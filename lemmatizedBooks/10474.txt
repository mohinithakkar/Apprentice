telephone for a surgeon part i _ william dawson _ chapter i a story and a visit at the beginning of the month of September 1916 there appear in the _ cornhill magazine _ a story entitle the lose naval papers i have tell this story at second hand for the incident have not occur within my personal experience one of the principal -- to whom i have allot the temporary name of richard cary -- be a intimate friend but i have never meet the scotland yard officer whom i call william dawson and be not at all anxious to make he official acquaintance to I he then seem a inhuman icy-blooded sleuth a being of great national importance but repulsive and dangerous as a associate yet by a turn of fortune 's wheel i come not only to know william dawson but to work with he and almost to like he he penetrative efficiency compel one 's admiration and he unconcealed vanity show that he do not stand wholly outside the human family yet i never feel safe with dawson in he presence and when i know that somewhere round the corner he be carry on he mysterious investigation i be perpetually apprehensive of he hand upon my shoulder and he bracelet upon my wrist i be unconscious of crime but the defense of the realm regulation -- which be to dawson a new fount of wisdom and power -- create so many fresh offence every week that it be difficult for the most timidly loyal of citizen to keep he innocency up to date i have doubtless trespass many time for i have dawson 's assurance that my present freedom be due solely to he reprehensible softness towards I whenever i have show independence of spirit -- of which god know i have little in these day -- dawson would pull out he terrible red volume of ever-expanding regulation and make note of my committed crime the act itself could be print on a sheet of notepaper but it have give birth to a whole library of regulation thus he bent I to he will as he have my poor friend richard cary the mill of scotland yard grind slowly yet they grind exceed small there be nothing showy about they they work by system not by inspiration though dawson be not specially intelligent -- in some respects almost stupid -- he be dreadfully terrifyingly efficient because he be part of the slowly grind scotland yard machine as this book properly begin with my publish story of the lose naval papers i will reprint it here exactly as it be write for the reader of the _ cornhill magazine _ in September 1916 \* \* \* \* \* i bait the trap this story -- which contain a moral for those fearful folk who exalt everything german -- be tell to I by richard cary the accomplished naval correspondent of a big paper in the north of england i have know he and he enthusiasm for the white ensign for twenty year he spring from a old naval stock the cary of north devon and have devote he life to the study of the sea service he have for so long be accustom to move freely among shipyard and navy man and be trust so completely that the veil of secrecy which drop in August 1914 between the fleet and the world scarcely exist for he everything which he desire to know for the better understanding of the real work of the navy come to he officially or unofficially when therefore he state that the naval note with which this story deal would have be of incalculable value to the enemy i accept he word without hesitation i have myself see some of they and they make I tremble -- for cary 's neck i press he to write this story himself but he refuse no say he i have tell you the yarn just as it happen write it yourself i be a dull dog quite efficient at handle hard fact and make scientific deduction from they but with no eye for the picturesque detail i give it to you he rise to go -- cary have be lunch with I -- but pause for a instant upon my front doorstep if you insist upon it add he smile i do not mind share in the plunder \* \* \* \* \* it be in the latter part of may 1916 cary be hard at work one morning in he room in the northern city where he have establish he headquarters he study table be litter with papers -- note diagram and newspaper cutting -- and he be laboriously reduce the apparent chaos into a orderly series of chapter upon the navy 's work which he propose to publish after the war be over it be not design to be a exciting book -- cary have no dramatic instinct -- but it would be full of fine sound stuff close accurate detail and clear analysis day by day for more than twenty month he have be collect detail of every phase of the navy 's operation here a little and there a little he have recently return from a confidential tour of the shipyard and naval basis and have exercise he trained eye upon checking and amplify what he have previously learn while he recollection of this tour be fresh he be actively write up he note and revise the rough early draft of he book more than once it have occur to he that he accumulation of note be dangerous explosive to store in a private house they be become so full and so accurate that the enemy would have pay any sum or have commit any crime to secure possession of they cary be not nervous or imaginative -- have i not say that he spring from a naval stock -- but even he now and then feel anxious he would i believe have sleep peacefully though know that a delicately prime bomb lay beneath he bed for personal risk trouble he little but the thought that hurt to he country might come from he well-meant labor sometimes rap against he nerve a few day before he patriotic conscience have be stab by no less a personage than admiral jellicoe who speak to a group of naval student which include cary have say : we have conceal nothing from you for we trust absolutely to you discretion remember what you have see but do not make any note yet here at this moment be cary disregard the order of a commander-in-chief whom he worship he try to square he conscience by reflect that no more than three people know of the existence of he note or of the book which he be write from they and that each one of those three be as trustworthy as himself so he go on collate compare write and the heap upon he table grow bigger under he hand the clock have just strike twelve upon that morning when a servant enter and say a gentleman to see you sir upon important business he name be mr dawson cary jump up and go to he dining-room where the visitor be wait the name have mean nothing to he but the instant he eye fall upon mr dawson he remember that he be the chief scotland yard officer who have come north to teach the local police how to keep track of the german agent who infested the shipbuilding centre cary have meet dawson more than once and have assist he with he intimate local knowledge he greet he visitor with smile courtesy but dawson do not smile he first word indeed come like shot from a automatic pistol mr cary say he i want to see you naval note cary be stagger for the three people whom i have mention do not include mr dawson certainly say he i will show they to you if you ask officially but how in the world do you hear anything about they i be afraid that a good many people know about they most undesirable people too if you will show they to I -- i be ask officially -- i will tell you what i know cary lead the way to he study dawson glance round the room at the papers heap upon the table at the tall window bare of curtain -- cary who love light and sunshine hate curtain -- and growl then he lock the door pull down the thick blue blind require by the east coast lighting order and switch on the electric light though it be high noon in may that be better say he you be a absolutely trustworthy man mr cary i know all about you but you be damned careless that bare window be overlook from half a dozen flat you might as well do you work in the street dawson pick up some of the papers and they purport be explain to he by cary i do not know anything of naval detail say he but i do not need any evidence of the value of the stuff here the enemy want it want it badly that be good enough for I but remonstrate cary no one know of these papers or of the use to which i be put they except my son in the navy my wife -lrb- who have not read a line of they -rrb- and my publisher in london hum comment dawson then how do you account for this he open he leather despatch-case and draw forth a parcel carefully wrap up in brown paper within the wrapping be a large white envelope of the linen weave paper use for register letter and generously seal to cary 's surprise for the envelope appear to be secure dawson cautiously open it so as not to break the seal which be adhering to the flap and draw out a second smaller envelope also seal this he open in the same delicate way and take out a third from the third he draw a fourth and so on until eleven empty envelope have be add to the litter pile upon cary 's table and the twelfth a small one remain in dawson 's hand do you ever see anything so childish observe he indicate the envelope a big registered sealed chinese puzzle like that be just cry out to be open we would have see the inside of that one even if it have be address to the lord mayor and not to -- well someone in whom we be deeply interested though he do not know it cary who have be fascinate by the succession of seal envelope stretch out he hand towards one of they do not touch snap out dawson you clumsy hand would break the seal and then there would be the devil to pay of course all these envelope be first open in my office it take a dozen year to train man to open sealed envelope so that neither flap nor seal be break and both can be again secure without show a sign of disturbance it be a trade secret dawson 's expert finger then open the twelfth envelope and he produce a letter now mr cary if we have not know you and also know that you be absolutely honest and loyal -- though dangerously simple-minded and careless in the matter of window -- this letter would have be very awkward indeed for you it run : ` hagan arrive 1030 pm Wednesday to get cary 's naval note meet he urgent ' have we not know you mr richard cary might have be ask to explain how hagan know all about he naval note and be so very confident of be able to get they cary smile i have often feel say he especially in war-time that it be most useful to be well know to the police you may ask I anything you like and i will do my best to answer i confess that i be aghast at the searchlight of inquiry which have suddenly be turn upon my humble labor my son at sea know nothing of the note except what i have tell he in my letter my wife have not read a line of they and my publisher be the last man to talk i seem to have suddenly drop into the middle of a detective story the poor man scratch he head and smile ruefully at the scotland yard officer mr cary say dawson those window of yours would account for anything you have be watch for a long time and i be perfectly sure that we friend hagan and he associate here know precisely in what drawer of that desk you keep you naval papers you flat be easy to enter -- i have a look round before come in to-day -- and on Wednesday night -lrb- that be to-morrow -rrb- there will be a scientific burglary here and you note will be steal oh no they will not cry cary i will take they down this afternoon to my office and lock they up in the big safe it will put I to a lot of bother for i shall also have to lock up there the chapter of my book you newspaper man ought all to be lock up yourselve you be a cursed nuisance to honest hard-worked scotland yard man like I but you mistake the object of my visit i want this flat to be enter to-morrow night and i want you naval papers to be steal for a moment the wild thought come to cary that this man dawson -- the choose of the yard -- be himself a german secret service agent and must have show in he eye some sign of the suspicion for dawson laugh loudly no mr cary i be not in the kaiser 's pay nor be you though the case against you might be paint pretty black this man hagan be on we string in london and we want he very badly indeed not to arrest -- at least not just yet -- but to keep run round show we he pal and all they little game he be a irish-american a very unbenevolent neutral to whom we want to give a nice easy happy time so that he can mix himself up thoroughly with the spy business and wrap a rope many time round he neck we will pull on to the end when we have finish with he but not a minute too soon he be too precious to be frighten do you ever come across such a ass -- dawson contemptuously indicate the pile of seal envelope he must have soak himself in american dime novel and cinema crime film he will be of more use to we than a dozen of we best officer i feel that i love hagan and will not have he disturb when he come here to-morrow night he shall be see but not hear he shall enter this room lift you note which shall be in they usual drawer and shall take they safely away after that i rather fancy that we shall enjoy ourselves and that the salt will stick very firmly upon hagan 's little tail cary do not at all like this plan it might offer amusement and instruction to the police but seem to involve himself in a excessive amount of responsibility will it not be far too risky to let he take my note even if you do shadow he closely afterwards he will get they copy and scatter amongst a score of agent one of whom may get the information through to germany you know you job of course but the risk seem too big for I after all they be my note and i would far sooner burn they now than that the german should see a line of they dawson laugh again you be a dear simple soul mr cary it do one good to meet you why on earth do you suppose i come here to-day if it be not to enlist you help hagan be go to take all the risk you and i be not look for any he be go to steal some naval note but they will not be those which lie on this table i myself will take charge of those and of the chapter of you most reprehensible book you shall prepare right now a beautiful new artistic set of note calculate to deceive they must be accurate where any error would be spotted but wickedly false wherever deception would be good for fritz 's health i want you to get down to a real plant this letter shall be seal up again in its twelve silly envelope and go by register post to hagan 's correspondent you shall have till to-morrow morning to invent all those thing which we want fritz to believe about the navy make we out to be as rotten as you plausibly can give he some heavy loss to gloat over and to tempt he out of harbor do not overdo it but mix up you fiction with enough fact to keep it sweet and make it sound convincing if you do you work well -- and the naval authority here seem to think a lot of you -- hagan will believe in you note and will try to get they to he german friend at any cost or risk which will be exactly what we want of he then when he have serve we purpose he will find that we -- have -- no -- more -- use -- for -- he dawson accompany this slow harmlessly sound sentence with a grim and nasty smile cary before whose eye flash for a moment the vision of a chill dawn cold gray wall and a silent firing party shudder it be a dirty task to lay so subtle a trap even for a dirty irish-american spy he honest english soul revolt at the call upon he brain and knowledge but common sense tell he that in this way dawson 's way he could do he country a very real service for a few minute he muse over the task set to he hand and then speak all right i think that i can put up exactly what you want the fake note shall be ready when you come to-morrow i will give the whole day to they in the morning the new set of naval papers be ready and they purport be explain in detail to dawson who chuckle joyously this be exactly what admiral -- want and it shall get through to germany by fritz 's own channel i have misjudge you mr cary i think you little better than a fool but that story here of a collision in a fog and the list of damage queen elizabeth in dock would have take in even I fritz will suck it down like cream i like that effort even better than you grave comment on damage turbine and worn-out gun tube you be a genius mr cary and i must take you to lunch with the admiral this very day you can explain the plant better than i can and he be die to hear all about it oh by the way he particularly want a description of the failure to complete the latest batch of big shell fuse and the shortage of lyddite you might get that do before the evening now for the burglary do nothing nothing at all outside you usual routine come home at you usual hour go to bed as usual and sleep soundly if you can should you hear any noise in the night put you head under the bedclothes say nothing to mr cary unless you be oblige and for god 's sake do not let any woman -- wife daughter or maid-servant -- disturb my pearl of a burglar while he be at work he must have a clear run with everything exactly as he expect to find it can i depend upon you i do not pretend to like the business say cary but you can depend upon I to the letter of my order good cry dawson that be all i want ii the trap close cary hear no noise though he lay awake for most of the night listen intently the flat seem to be more quiet even than usual there be little traffic in the street below and hardly a step break the long silence of the night early in the morning -- at six bst -- cary slip out of bed steal down to he study and pull open the deep drawer in which he have place the bundle of fake naval note they have go so the spy-burglar have come and carefully shepherd by dawson 's sleuth-hound have find the primrose path easy for he crime to cary the simple honest gentleman the whole plot seem to be utterly revolting -- justified of course by the country 's need in time of war but none the less revolting there be nothing of glamour in the secret service nothing of romance little even of excitement it be a cold-blooded exercise of wit against wit of spy against spy the amateur play a fish upon a line and give he a fair run for he life but the professional fisherman -- to whom a salmon be a people 's food -- net he coldly and expeditiously as he come in from the sea shortly after breakfast there come a call from dawson on the telephone all go well come to my office as soon as possible cary find dawson bubble with professional satisfaction it be beautiful cry he hagan be meet at the train take to a place we know of and shadow by we tight as wax we now know all he associate -- the swine have not even the excuse of be german he burgle you flat himself while one of he gang watch outside never mind where i be you would be surprise if i tell you but i see everything he have the fake papers be busy make copy and this afternoon be go down the river in a steamer to get a glimpse of the shipyard and dock and check you note as far as can be do will they stand all right quite all right say cary the obvious thing be give correctly good we will be in the steamer cary go that afternoon quite unchanged in appearance by dawson 's order if you try to disguise yourself declare that expert you will be spot at once leave the refinement to we dawson himself go as a elderly dug-out officer with the rank mark of a colonel and never speak a word to cary upon the whole trip down and up the teem river dawson 's man be scatter here and there -- one a passenger of inquire mind another a deckhand yet a third -- a pretty girl in khaki -- sell tea and cake in the vessel 's saloon hagan -- who cary hear afterwards wear the brass-bound cap and blue kit of a mate in the american merchant service -- be never out of sight for a instant of dawson or of one of he troupe he busy himself with a strong pair of marine glass and now and then ask innocent question of the ship 's deckhand he have evidently himself once serve as a sailor one deckhand a idle fellow to whom hagan be very civil tell he questioner quite a lot of interesting detail about the navy ship great and small which could be see upon the building slip all these detail tally strangely with those record in cary 's note the trip up and down the river be a great success for hagan and for dawson but for cary it be rather a bear he feel somehow out of the picture in the evening dawson call at cary 's office and break in upon he we have a splendid trip to-day say he it exceed my utmost hope hagan think no end of you note but he be not take any risk he leave in the morning for glasgow to do the clyde and to check some more of you stuff would you like to come cary remark that he be rather busy and that these river excursion though doubtless great fun for dawson be rather poor sport for himself dawson laugh joyously -- he be a cheerful soul when he have a spy upon he string come along say he see the thing through i should like you to be in at the death cary observe that he have no stomach for cold damp dawn and firing party i do not quite mean that reply dawson those close ceremony be still strictly private but you should see the chase through to a finish you be a newspaper man and should be eager for new experience i will come say cary rather reluctantly but i warn you that my sympathy be steadily go over to hagan the poor devil do not look to have a dog 's chance against you he have not say dawson with great satisfaction cary to whom the wonderful clyde be as familiar as the river near he own home find the second trip almost as wearisome as the first but not quite he be now able to recognize hagan who again appear as a brass-bounder and do not affect to conceal he deep interest in the naval panorama offer by the river nothing of real importance can of course be learn from a casual steamer trip but hagan seem to think otherwise for he be always either watch through he glass or ask apparently artless question of passenger or pass deckhand again a sailor seem disposed to be communicative he point out more than one monster in steel red raw with surface rust and give particulars of a complete power which would have surprise the admiralty superintendent they would not however have surprise mr cary in whose ingenious brain they have be conceive this second trip like the first be declare by dawson to have be a great success do you know I he ask i be a clean-shaven naval doctor about as unlike the army colonel of the first trip as a pigeon be unlike a gamecock hagan be off to london to-night by the north-western there be two copy of you note one be go by edinburgh and the east coast and another by the midland hagan have the original masterpiece i will look after he and leave the two other messenger to my man i have be on to the yard by ` phone and have arrange that all three shall have passport for holland the two copy shall reach the kaiser bless he but i really must have hagan 's set of note for my museum and what will become of hagan ask cary come and see say mr dawson dawson entertain cary at dinner in a private room at the station hotel wait upon by one of he own confidential man nobody ever see I he observe with much satisfaction though i be everywhere -lrb- i suspect that dawson be not without he little vanity -rrb- except in my office and with people whom i know well i be always some one else the first time i come to you house i wear a beard and the second time look like a gas inspector you see only the real dawson when one have get the passion for the chase in one 's blood one can not bide for long in a stuffy office as i have a jewel of a assistant i can always escape and follow up my own victim this man hagan be a black heartless devil do not waste you sympathy on he mr cary he take money from we quite lately to betray the silly ass of sinn feiner and now think we hoodwink be after more money from the kaiser he be of the type that would sell he own mother and buy a mistress with the money he be not worth you pity we use he and he like for just so long as they can be useful and then the jaw of the trap close by let he take those fake note we have do a fine stroke for the navy for the yard and for bill dawson we have get into close touch with four new german agent here and two more down south we sha not seize they yet just keep they hang on and use they that be the game i be never anxious about a agent when i know he and can keep he watch anxious bless you i love he like a cat love a mouse i have have some spy on my string ever since the war begin i would not have they touch or worry for the world they correspondence tell I everything and if a letter to holland which they have not write slip in sometimes it be useful very useful as useful almost as you fake note half a hour before the night train be due to leave for the south dawson very simply but effectively change in appearance -- for hagan know by sight the real dawson -- lead cary to the middle sleeping-coach on the train i have have hagan put in no 5 he say and you and i will take no 4 and 6 no 5 be a observation berth there be one fix up for we on this sleeping-coach come in here he pull cary into no 4 shut the door and point to a small wooden knob set a few inch below the luggage rack if one unscrew that knob one can see into the next berth no 5 no 6 be fit in the same way so that we can rake no 5 from both side but mind you on no account touch those knob until the train be move fast and until you have switch out the light if no 5 be dark when you open the peep-hole a ray of light from you side would give the show away and unless there be a good deal of vibration and rattle in the train you might be hear now cut away to no 6 fasten the door and go to bed i shall sit up and watch but there be nothing for you to do hagan appear in due course be show into no 5 berth and the train start cary ask himself whether he should go to bed as advise or sit up read he decide to obey dawson 's order but to take a look in upon hagan before settle down for the journey he switch off he light climb upon the bed and carefully unscrew the little knob which be like the one show to he by dawson a beam of light stab the darkness of he berth and put he eye with some difficulty to the hole -- one 's nose get so confoundedly in the way -- he see hagan comfortably arrange himself for the night the spy have no suspicion of he watcher on both side for after settle himself in bed he unwrap a flat parcel and take out a bundle of blue papers which cary at once recognize as the original of he steal note hagan go through they -- he have put he suit-case across he knee to form a desk -- and carefully make marginal jotting cary who have often try to write in train could not but admire the man 's laborious patience he paint he letter and figure over and over again in order to secure distinctness in spite of the swaying of the train and frequently stop to suck the point of he pencil i suppose think cary that dawson yonder be just gloat over he prey but for my part i feel a utterly contemptible beast never again will i set a trap for even the worst of my fellow-creature he put back the knob go to bed and pass half the night in extreme mental discomfort and the other half in snatch brief interval of sleep it be not a pleasant journey dawson do not come out of he berth at euston until after hagan have leave the station in a taxi-cab much to cary 's surprise and then be quite ready even anxious to remain for breakfast at the hotel he explain he strange conduct two of my man say he as he wallow in tea and fry sole -- one can not get dover sole in the weary north -- who travel in ordinary compartment be after hagan in two taxi so that if one be delay the other will keep touch hagan 's driver also have have a police warning so that we spy be in a barbed-wire net i shall hear before very long all about he cary and dawson spend the morning at the hotel with a telephone beside they every few minute the bell would ring and a whisper of hagan 's movement steal over the wire into the ear of the spider dawson he report progress to cary with ever-increasing satisfaction hagan have apply for and be grant a passport to holland and have book a passage in the boat which leave harwich to-night for the hook we will go with he the other two spy with the copy have not turn up yet but they be all right my man will see they safe across into dutch territory and make sure that no blundering custom officer interfere with they papers this time the way of transgressor shall be very soft as for hagan he be not go to arrive i do not quite understand why you carry on so long with he say cary who though tire could not but feel intense interest in the perfection of the police system and in the serene confidence of dawson the yard could it appear do unto the spy precisely what dawson choose to direct hagan be a american citizen explain dawson if he have be a british subject i would have take he at euston -- we have full evidence of the burglary and of the steal papers in he suit-case but as he be a damned unbenevolent neutral we must prove he intention to sell the papers to germany then we can deal with he by secret court-martial -lrb- 1 -rrb- the journey to holland will prove this intention hagan have be most useful to we in ireland and now in the north of england and in scotland but he be too enterprising and too daring to be leave any longer on the string i will draw the end together at the hook -lrb- footnote 1 : author 's note : this conversation be date may 1916 -rrb- i do not want to go to holland say cary to I when tell he story i be utterly sick and disgusted with the whole cold-blooded game of cat and mouse but the police need my evidence about the note and the burglary and do not intend to let I slip out of they clutch dawson be very civil and pleasant but i be in fact as tightly hold upon he string as be the wretched hagan so i go on to holland with that quick-change artist and watch he come on board the steamer at parkeston quay dress as a rather german-looking commercial traveller eager for war commission upon smuggle goods this sound absurd but he get-up seem somehow to suggest the idea then i go below dawson always keep away from I whenever hagan might have see we together the passage across to holland be free from incident there be no sign that we be at war and continental traffic be be carry serenely on within easy striking distance of the german submarine base at zeebrugge the steamer have draw in to the hook beside the train and hagan be approach the gangway suit-case in hand the man be on the edge of safety once upon dutch soil dawson could not have lay hand upon he he would have be a neutral citizen in a neutral country and no english warrant would run against he but between hagan and the gangway suddenly interpose the tall form of the ship 's captain instantly the man be ringed about by officer and before he could say a word or move a hand he be grip hard and lead across the deck to the steamer 's chart-house therein sit dawson the real undisguised dawson and beside he sit richard cary hagan 's face which two minute earlier have be glowing with triumph and with the anticipation of german gold beyond the dream of avarice go white as chalk he stagger and gasp as one stab to the heart and drop into a chair he suit-case fall from he relax finger to the floor give he a stiff brandy-and-soda direct dawson almost kindly and when the victim 's color have ebb back a little from he overcharged heart and he have drunk deep of the friendly cordial the detective put he out of pain the game of cat and mouse be over it be all up hagan say the detective gently face the music and make the best of it my poor friend this be mr richard cary and you have not for a moment be out of we sight since you leave london for the north four day ago when i have complete the writing of he story i show the m to richard cary who be please to express a general approval not at all bad copplestone say he not at all bad you have clothe my dry bone in real flesh and blood but you have miss what to I be the outstanding feature of the whole affair that which justify to my mind the whole rather grubby business let I give you two date on may 25 two copy of my fake note be shepherd through to holland and reach the german on may 31 be fight the battle of jutland can the brief space between these date have be merely a accident i can not believe it no i prefer to believe that in my humble way i induce the german fleet to issue forth and to risk a action which under more favourable condition for we would have result in they utter destruction i may be wrong but i be happy in retain my faith what become of hagan i ask for i wish to bring the narrative to a clean artistic finish i be not sure answer cary though i give evidence as order by the court-martial but i rather think that i have here hagan 's epitaph he take out he pocket-book and draw forth a slip of paper upon which be gummed a brief newspaper cut this he hand to I and i read as follow : the war office announce that a prisoner who be charge with espionage and recently try by court-martial at the westminster guildhall be find guilty and sentence to death the sentence be duly confirm and carry out yesterday morning \* \* \* \* \* two month pass summer what little there be of it have go and my spirit be oppress by the wet and fog and dirt of November in the north i desire neither to write nor to read my one overpower longing be to go to sleep until the war be over and then to awake in a new world in which a decent civilised life would once more be possible in this unhappy mood i be seat before my study fire when a servant bring I a card a gentleman say she wish to see you i say that you be engage but he insist he be a terrible man sir i look at the card annoy at be disturbed but at the sight of it my torpor fall from I for upon it be write the name of that detective officer whom in my story i have call william dawson and in the corner be the letter cid -lrb- criminal investigation department -rrb- i have become a criminal and be about to be investigate chapter ii at close quarter dawson enter and we stand eye one another like two strange dog neither speak for some seconds and then recollect that i be a host in the presence of a visitor i extend a hand offer a chair and snap open a cigarette case dawson seat himself and take a cigarette i breathe more freely he could not design my immediate arrest or he would not have accept of even so slight a hospitality we sit upon opposite side of the fire dawson say nothing but watch I in that unwink cat-like way of he which i find so exasperating many time during my association with dawson i have long to spring upon he and beat he head against the floor -- just to show that i be not a mouse if he silence be intend to make I uncomfortable i would give he evidence of my perfect composure how do you find I out i ask calmly he start of surprise gratify I and i see a puzzle look come into he eye find out what he mutter how do you find out that i write a story about you oh that he grin that be not difficult mr -- er -- copplestone i ask mr -- er -- richard cary for you real name and address and he have to give they to I i be consider whether i should prosecute both he and you no doubt you bully cary i say but you do not alarm I in the least i have take precaution and you would have find you way bar if you have try to touch either of we it be possible snapped dawson i should like to lock up all you write people -- you be a infernal nuisance -- but you seem to have a pull with the politician we be get on capitally : the first round be in my favor and i see another opportunity of show my easy unconcern of he power oh no mr -- er -- william dawson you would not lock we up even if all the authority in the state be vest in the soldier and the police for who would then write of you exploit and pour upon you head the bright light of fame the public know nothing of mr -- -lrb- i hold up he card -rrb- but quite a lot of people have hear of william dawson they have assent he with obvious satisfaction i send a copy of the story to my chief -- just to put myself straight with he i say that it be all quite unauthorised and that i would have stop it if i could oh no you would not do not talk humbug mr william dawson during the past two month you have prance along the street with you head in the cloud and in you own home mr dawson and the little dawson -- if there be any -- have worship you as a god there be nothing so flattering as the sight of oneself in solid black print upon nice white paper confess now be you not at this moment carry a copy of that story of mine in you breast pocket next you heart and do not you flourish it before you colleague and rival about six time a day alone among mortal man i have see a hardened detective blush throw away that cigarette say i and take a cigar i feel generous we relation be now establish upon a basis satisfactory to I i have no inkling of the purpose of this visit but he have lose the advantage of mysterious attack he have reveal human weakness and have cease for the moment to dominate I as a terrible engine of the law but i have hear too much of dawson from cary to be under any illusion he could be chaff even make ridiculous without much difficulty but no one however adroit could divert he by a inch from he professional purpose he could joke with a victim and drink he health and then walk he off arm in arm to the gallows now mr dawson say i perhaps you will tell I to what happy circumstance i owe the honor of this visit he have be chuckle over certain rich detail in the hagan chase -- with a eye no doubt to future enlarged edition -- but these word of mine pull he up short instantly he become grave draw some papers from he pocket and address himself to business i have come to you mr copplestone as i do to you friend mr cary for information and assistance and i have be advise by those who know you here to be perfectly frank you be not at present a object of suspicion to the local police who assure I that though you be know to have access to much secret information yet that you have never make any wrongful use of it you have moreover be of great assistance on many occasion both to the military and naval authority therefore though my instinct would be to lock you up most securely i be tell that i must not do it you be very frank say i but i bear no malice ask I what you please and i will do my best to answer fully i ought to warn you say he with obvious reluctance that anything which you say may at some future time be use in evidence against you i will take the risk mr dawson cry i laugh you have do you duty in warn I and you be so plainly hopeful that i shall incriminate myself that it would be cruel to disappoint you let we get on with the inquisition you be aware mr copplestone that a most important part of my work consist in stop the channel through which information of what be go on in we shipyard and munition shop may get through to the enemy we can not prevent he agent from get information -- that be always possible to those with unlimited command of money for there be always swine among workman and among higher folk than workman who can be buy you may take it as certain that little of importance be do or project in this country of which enemy agent do not know but they difficulty be to get it through to they paymaster within the limit of time during which the information be useful there be score of possible channel and it be up to we to watch they all you have already show some grasp of we method which in a sentence may be describe as unsleeping vigilance once we know the identity of a enemy agent he cease to be of any use to the enemy but become of the greatest value to we we motto be : ab hoste docerus he pronounce the infinitive verb as if it rhyme with glossary you be quite a scholar mr dawson remark i politely yes say he simply i have a good schooling i need not go into detail he go on of how we watch the correspondence of suspect person but you may be interested to learn that during the three week which i have pass in you city all you private letter have be through my hand the devil they have i cry angrily you exceed you power this be really intolerable oh you need not worry reply dawson serenely you letter be quite innocent i be gratify to learn that you two son in the service be happy and do well and that you contemplate the publication of another book it be impossible not to laugh at the man 's effrontery though i feel exasperated at he inquisitiveness after all there be thing in private letter which one do not wish a stranger and a police officer to read and how long be this outrage to continue i ask crossly that depend upon you as soon as i be satisfied that you be as trustworthy as the local police and other authority believe you to be you correspondence will pass untouched it be of no use for you to fume or try to kick up a fuss in london scotland yard would open the home secretary 's letter if it have any cause to feel doubtful of he you can not feel much suspicion of I or you would not tell I what you have be do you might have think of that at once say dawson derisively i shake myself and concede the round to dawson it have be plain to we for a long time that the food parcel despatch by relative and ` god-mother ' of british prisoner in germany be a possible source of danger and at last it have be decide to stop they and to keep the despatch of food in the hand of official organization since there be now some 30000 of military prisoner in addition to intern civilian at ruhleben the number and complexity of the parcel have make it most difficult for a thorough examination to be keep up we have do we utmost but have be conscious that there have exist in they a channel through which have pass communication from enemy agent to enemy employer i can see the possibility but a practical method of communication look difficult how be it do in the most absurdly simple way real ingenuity be always simple i will give you a example a english prisoner in germany have we will suppose parent in newcastle by whom food have be send out regularly he die in captivity and in due course he relative be notify through the international headquarters of the red cross in geneva he be cross off the newcastle list and he parent of course stop send parcel now suppose that some one in birmingham begin to send parcel address to this lately deceased prisoner he name unless birmingham be very vigilant will get upon the list there as that of a new live prisoner the parcel address to this name will go straight into the hand of the german secret service and a channel of communication will have be open up between some one in birmingham and the enemy in germany prisoner be frequently die new prisoner be frequently be take under a haphazard system of individual parcel despatch from all over the british isle it have be practically impossible to keep track of all the change for this and other good reason we have have to make a clean sweep and to take over the feeding of british prisoner by means of a regular organization which can ensure that nothing be send with the food which will be of any assistance to the enemy that be a good job do i observe have you evidence that what be possible have in fact be do we have say dawson not many case perhaps but sufficient to show the existence of a very real danger it be indeed one particular instance of direct communication which have bring I to you to-day order be give not long since that all new case that be all parcel address to prisoner whose name be new to local list should be open and carefully examine some six or seven week ago parcel begin to be send from this city address to a lieutenant in the northumberland fusilier there be nothing remarkable in that for though we be some distance here from northumberland young officer be gazette to regiment which need they irrespective of the part of the country to which the officer themselves belong in accordance with the new order all the parcel for this lieutenant -- which usually consist of bread chocolate and tin of sardine -- be examine the bread be cut up the chocolate break to piece and the tin open if the parcel contain nothing contraband fresh supplies of bread chocolate and sardine to take the place of those destroy in examination be put in and the parcel forward for the first two week nothing be find but in the third parcel bury in one of the loaf be discover a cut from a evening newspaper which at first sight seem quite innocent but a microscopic search reveal tiny needle prick in certain word and the word thus indicate read when take by themselves the sentence ` important naval news follow ' at this stage i be send for my first step be to inquire very closely into the antecedent of this lieutenant of northumberland fusilier i find that he friend live at morpeth that he have be take prisoner during the loo advance of September 1915 and that he have die about a year later of typhoid fever in a german camp he friend as soon as they have be inform of the death have stop send parcel of food out to he they be not tell the object of the inquiry it would have cause they needless pain it be bad enough that they only son have die far from home in a filthy german prison dawson 's rather metallic voice become almost sympathetic and i be please to observe that he harsh profession have not destroy in he all human feeling after this you may suppose that the parcel address to we poor friend the late lieutenant be very eagerly look for the alleged sender whose name and residence be write upon the label be find not to exist both name and address be false it be a hot scent and i be delighted after a week of wait to see another parcel come in this would in all probability contain the ` important naval news ' and i take its examination upon myself i reduce the bread and the chocolate to powder without find anything excuse I i cry intensely interested but how could one conceal a paper in bread or in chocolate without leave external trace there be no difficulty the loaf be of the kind which have soft end one cut a deep slit insert the paper close up the cut with a little fresh dough and rebake the loaf for a short time till all sign of the cut have disappear the chocolate be in egg not in bar the oval lump can be cut open scoop out a paper put in and the two half join up and the cut conceal by means of a strong mixture of chocolate paste and white of egg when thoroughly dry in a warm place chocolate thus treat will stand very close scrutiny i do not trouble to look for sign of disturbance in either loave or egg it be quicker and easier to break they up i then address my attention to the sardine tin which from the first have seem the most likely hiding-place a very moderately skilled mechanic can unsolder a tin empty out the fish and oil put in what he please in place weight judiciously and then refasten with fresh solder i open all the tin find that all except one have be undisturbed but that one be a blissful reward for all my trouble for in it be a tightly pack mass of glazier 's putty soft and heavy and at the bottom the carefully fold paper which i have now the honor of show to you dawson hand I a stiff piece of paper slimy to the touch and smell strongly of white lead upon it be two neatly make drawing and some line of word and figure it be just what i should have expect say i you recognize it of course say i we have here a deck plan show the disposition of gun and a section plan show arrangement of armor of one of the big new ship which have be complete for the grand fleet below we have the number and calibre of the gun the thickness and extent of the armor the length breadth and depth of the vessel she tonnage she horse power and she estimate speed everything be correct except the speed which i happen to know be considerably greater than the figure set down you have not by any chance see that paper before ask dawson with rather a forced air of indifference this no why i be curious that be all he look at I with a queer quizzical expression and then laugh softly you will understand my question directly but for the moment let we get on what sort of person should you say make those drawing and write that description i be no sherlock holme but any one who have have some acquaintance with engineer and they handiwork can recognize the professional touch these drawing be the work of a trained draughtsman and the writing be that of a draughtsman one can tell by the neatness and the technique of the shade right first time say dawson approvingly at present i have that draughtsman comfortably lock up we pick he out of the draw office at -- he name a famous yard in which have be build one of the ship of the class illustrate upon the paper in my hand poor devil i say what be the cause -- drink woman or the pressure of high price and a large family none of they he employer give he the best of character he get good pay be a man over military age and have so far as the police can learn no special embarrassment he own he house and have two or three hundred pound in the war loan then why in the name of wonder have the _ schweinehund _ sell he country he declare that he never receive a penny for supply the information upon that paper and we have no evidence of any outside payment to he he do not attempt to conceal he handwriting and when i make inquiry of he firm he own up at once that the paper be he work he say that for year past he have give particulars of ship under construction to the same party as on this occasion he admit that to do so be contrary to regulation especially in wartime but think that under the circumstance he be do no harm i be not exactly a credulous person and i have hear some tall story in my time but for once i be incline to believe that the man be speak the truth i believe that he receive no money and be act throughout in good faith i be more and more puzzle what in the world can the circumstance be which could induce a experienced middle-aged man employ in highly confidential work in a great shipyard not only to break faith and lose he job but to stick he neck into a rope and he foot on the drop of a gallows reveal the mystery you be sure that you have never see that paper before ask dawson again this time slowly and deliberately of course not i say how could i that be just what i have to find out say dawson he stop take out a knife prod he nearly smoked cigar puff once or twice hard to restore the draught and speak that be what interest I just now for you see this very indiscreet and reprehensible swinehound of a draughtsman who be at present in my lockup declare that he be without suspicion of serious wrong-doing because -- because -- the particulars of the new battleship upon that paper be supply to you chapter iii a inquisition perhaps i ought to have see it come but i do not for a moment as a washerwoman might say i be strike all of a heap then the delicious thought that i -- by nature a vagabond though by decree of the high god the father of a family and a justice of the peace -- have to face the charge of be a german spy shake my soul with ribald laughter i have be dull and torpid before the arrival of dawson he have awaken I into joyous life i arise fill and light a large calabash pipe and pass a box of cigar to the detective throw that stump away and take another say i i owe you more than a cigar or two he stare at I take what i offer and he face relax into a grin it be pleasant to see that you be a man of humor mr dawson i observe when we be again seat comfortably on opposite side of the fire in my day i have play many part but i can not somehow recall the incident of unsolder a sardine tin insert a paper pack in a mess of putty soldering it up and despatch the incriminate product within a parcel address to a late lieutenant of northumberland fusilier i be not deny the charge the whole affair be too delightful to be cut short let we spin it out delicately like child over plate of sweet pudding you be a queer customer mr copplestone i confess that the whole business puzzle I though you and you friend here seem to find it devilish amusing when i tell the chief constable the manager of the shipyard and the admiral superintendent of naval work that you be the guilty party they all roar for some reason the admiral and the shipyard manager keep wink at one another and gurgle till i think they would have choke what _ be _ the joke if you be good dawson i will tell you some day this be November and the _ rampagious _ -- the ship describe on you paper -- leave for portsmouth in August in July -- i break off hurriedly lest i should tell my visitor too much it have take we friend who put the paper in the sardine tin three month to find out detail of she i could have do better than that dawson that be just what the admiral say though he would not explain why the truth be dawson that the admiral and i both come from devon the land of pirate smuggler and buccaneer we be law breaker by instinct and family tradition when we get a officer of the law on toast we like to make the most of he it be a playful little way of ours which i be sure you will understand and pardon you know of course that i be justified in arrest you i have a warrant and handcuffs in my pocket admirable man i cry with enthusiasm you be dawson the perfect detective as a criminal i should be mightily afraid of you but as in my buttonhole i always wear the white flower which proclaim to the world my blameless life i be thoroughly enjoy this visit and we cosy chat beside the fire shall i telephone to my office and say that i shall be unavoidably detain from duty for a indefinite time ` detain ' would be the strict truth and the _ mot juste _ if you would kindly lock I up say for three year or the duration of the war i should be you debtor i have often think that a prison provide that one be allow unlimited paper and the use of a typewriter would be the most charming of holiday -- a perfect rest cure there be three book in my head which i should like to write arrest I dawson i implore you put on the handcuffs -- i have never be handcuff -- ring up a taxi and let we be off to jail you will i hope do I the honor of lunch with I first and meeting my wife she will be immensely gratify to be quit of I it can not often have happen in you lurid career dawson to be welcome with genuine enthusiasm why do that man say that he prepare the description of the ship for you that be what we be go to find out and i will help you all i can my reputation be like the bloom upon the peach -- touch it and it be go for ever there be a faint glimmer of the truth at the back of my mind which may become a clear light do he say that he have give it to I personally into my own hand no he say that he be approach by a man whom he have know off and on for year a man who be employ by you in connection with shipyard inquiry he be inform that this man be still employ by you for the same purpose now as in the past you case against I be thin out dawson at its best it be second-hand at its worst the mere conjecture of a rather careless draughtsman i have two thing to do : first to find out the real seducer who be probably also the despatcher of the parcel to the late lieutenant of northumberland fusilier and second to save if i can this poor fool of a shipyard draughtsman from punishment for he folly i do not doubt that he honestly think he be deal with I he will have to be punish the admiral will insist upon that we must make the punishment as light as we can you shall help I with all the discretionary authority with which you be equip i can see dawson from the tactful skill with which you have deal with I that discretion be among you most distinguished characteristic if you have be a stupid bull-headed policeman you would have be up against pretty serious trouble that be quite my own view reply dawson drily who be the man describe by we err draughtsman he will not say we have put on every allowable method of pressure and some that be not in ordinary time permit we have have over this spy hunt business to shed most of we tender english regard for suspect person and to adopt the french system of fishing inquiry in france the police try to make a man incriminate himself in england we try we hardest to prevent he that may be very right and just in peace time against ordinary law breaker but war be war and spy be too dangerous to be treat tenderly we have cross-examine the man and bully-ragged he but he will not give up the name of he accomplice it may be a relation one thing seem sure the man be or be a member of you staff engage in shipyard inquiry can you give I a list of the man who be or have be on this sort of work during the past few year i will get it for you but please use it carefully my present man be precious jewel the few leave to I by zealous military authority what i must look for be some one over military age who have leave I or be dismiss -- probably dismiss when a british subject of decent education and once respectable surroundings get into the hand of german agent you may be certain of one thing dawson that he have become a rotter through drink that be it cry dawson you have hit it crime and drink be twin brother as no one know better than the police look out for the name and address of a man dismiss for drunkenness and we shall have we bird the name i can no doubt give you but not the address give we any address where he live even if it be ten year ago and we will track he down in three day that be just routine police work i never presume to teach a expert he business -- and you dawson be a super-expert a director-general of those of common quality -- but would it not be well to warn all the post office so that when another parcel be bring in address to the lieutenant the bearer may be arrest dawson sniff police work common police work it be do at once for this city and fifty mile round no parcel be put in last week the warning have since be extend to the whole of the unite kingdom we may get we man this week or at least a messenger of he but no news have yet come to I i will lunch with you as you so kindly suggest and afterwards i want you to come with I to see the draughtsman in the lockup you may be able to shake he confounded obstinacy run the pathetic stunt say if he keep silent that you will be arrest you home break up you family drive into the workhouse and you yourself probably shoot pitch it strong and rich he be a bit of a softy from the look of he that tender-hearted lot be always the most obstinate when ask to give away they pal do you know dawson i say as he go upstairs with I to have a lick and a polish as he put it -- i be incline to agree with cary that you be rather a inhuman beast my wife with whom i could exchange no more than a dozen word and a wink or two grip the situation and play up to it in the fashion which compel the admiration and terror of mere man do they humbug we they husband as they do the rest of the world on we behalf she meet dawson as if he be a old family friend heap hospitality upon he and chaff he blandly as if to entertain a police officer with a warrant and handcuffs in he pocket be the best joke in the world my husband mr dawson need a holiday very badly but will not take one he think that the war can not be pursue successfully unless he look after it himself if you would carry he off and keep he quiet for a bit i should be deeply grateful she then fall into a discussion with dawson of the most conveniently situate prison mr copplestone dismiss dartmoor and portland as too bleakly situated but be please to approve of parkhurst in the isle of wight -- which i rather fancy be a house of detention for woman she insist that the climate of the island be suit to my health and wring a promise from dawson that i should if possible be intern there dawson 's manners and conversation surprise I he homespun origin be evident yet he have develop a easy social style which be neither familiar nor aggressive we be in he eye eccentric possibly what he would call among he friend a bit off and he bear himself towards we accordingly my small daughter jane to whom he have be present as a colonel of police -- little jane be deeply verse in military rank -- take to he at once and he manner towards she confirm my impression that some vestige of humanity may still be discover in he by the patient searcher she insist upon sit next to he and in hold he hand when it be not employ in convey food to he mouth she be startle at first by the discussion upon the prison most suitable for I but quickly become reconcile to the idea of a temporary separation colonel dawson she ask when daddy be in prison may i come and see he sometimes mother and I dawson grip he hair -- we be the maddest crew -- and reply of course you shall miss jane as often as you like thank you colonel dawson you be a nice man i love you now show I the handcuffs in you pocket for the second time that day poor dawson blush he must have regret many time that he have mention to I those unfortunate darby now amid much laughter he be compel to draw forth a pretty shine pair of steel wristlet and permit jane to put they on they be much too large for she she could slip they on and off without unlock but as toy they be a delight i should not mind be a prisoner she declare if dear colonel dawson take I up we be sit upon the fire-guard after luncheon dally over we coffee when jane demand to be show a real arrest show I how you take up a great big man like daddy then come a surprise which for a moment have so much in it of bitter realism that it drive the blood from my wife 's cheek i could not follow dawson 's movement he hand flicker like those of a conjurer there come a sharp click and the handcuffs be upon my wrist i stare at they speechless wonder how they get there and look up meet the coldly triumphant eye of the detective i realize then exactly how the professional manhunter glare at the prey into whom after many day he have set he claw my wife gasp and clutch at my elbow little jane scream and for a few seconds even i think that the game have be play and that serious business be about to begin dawson give we a few seconds of apprehension and then laugh grimly from he waistcoat pocket he draw a key and the fetter be remove almost as quickly as they have be clap on tit for tat say he you have have you fun with I fair play be a jewel little jane be the first to recover speech i know that dear colonel dawson be only play she cry he only do it to please I thank you colonel though you do frighten I just a weeny bit at first and pull he down towards she she kiss he heartily upon he prickly cheek it be a queer scene the door bell ring loudly and we be inform that a policeman stand without who be inquire for chief inspector dawson show he in here say i the constable enter and he manner of address my guest -- that of a raw second lieutenant towards a general of division -- shed a new light upon dawson 's pre-eminence in he service a telegram for you sir dawson seize it be about to tear it open remembered suddenly he hostess and bow towards she have i you permission madam he ask she smile and nod i turn away to conceal a laugh good cry dawson poring over the message i think mr copplestone that you have better telephone to you office and say that you be unavoidably detain what -- what be it cry my wife who have again become white with sudden fear something which will occupy the attention of you husband and myself to the exclusion of all other duty this telegram inform I that a parcel have be hand in at carlisle and the bearer arrest excellent i cry my time be at you disposal dawson we shall now get full light he sit down and scribble a reply wire direct the parcel and its bearer to be bring to he with all speed they should arrive in two or three hour say he and in the meantime we will tackle the draughtsman who make that plan of the battleship good-bye mr copplestone and thank you very much for you hospitality you husband go with I my wife shake hand with dawson and politely see he off the premise she have say little to I since about he visit but i do not think that she wish ever to meet with he again little jane who kiss he once more at parting be still attach to the memory of she colonel \* \* \* \* \* dawson lead I to the private office at the central police station which be he temporary headquarters and send for the dossier of the lock up draughtsman i have here full particulars of he say he and a verbatim note of my examination i examine the photograph attach which represent a bearded citizen of harmless aspect over he feature have spread a scared puzzle look with a suggestion in it of pathetic appeal he look like a human rabbit catch in a unexpected and uncomprehended trap it be a police photograph then i begin to read the dossier but get no farther than the first paragraph in it be set out the man 's name those of he wife and child he employment record of service and so on what arrest my research be the maiden name of the wife which in accordance with the northern custom have be enter as a part of she legal description the name awake in I a recollection of a painful incident within my experience i see before I the puff degraded face of one to whom i have give chance after chance of redeeming himself from thraldom to the whisky bottle one who have promise again and again to amend he way at last wearied i have cast he out he have be look after a important shipbuilding district have conspicuous ability and knowledge the support of a faithful wife but nothing avail to save he from himself give I five minute alone with you prisoner i say to dawson and i will give you the spy you seek i have ask for five minute but two be sufficient for my purpose the draughtsman have be obstinate with dawson seek loyally to shield he wretched brother-in-law but when he find that i have the miss thread in my hand he give in at once what relation be -- to you wife i ask he have rise at my entrance but the question go through he like a bullet he pale face flush he stagger pitifully and sit down bury he face in he hand you may tell the truth now i say gently we can easily find out what we must know but the information will come better from you he be my wife 's brother murmur the man you know that he be no longer in my service yes i know i might fairly have ask why he have use my name but refrain one can readily pardon the lapse of a honest man terrify at find himself in the coil of the police cling to the good name of he wife and she family clutch at any device to throw the sleuth-hound of the law off the real scent he have give he brother-in-law forbid information from a loyal desire to help he and with no knowledge of the base use to which it would be put when detect he have seek at any cost to shield he i will do my best to help you i say he head droop down till it rest upon he bent arm and he groan and pant under the torture of tear he be not the stuff of which criminal be make i find dawson 's chuckle joy rather repulsive i feel that be successful he might at least have have the decency to dissemble he satisfaction he might also have give I some credit for the rapid clearing up of the problem in detection but he take the whole thing to himself and gloat like a child over he own cleverness i neither obtain from he thanks for my assistance nor apology for he suspicion it be dawson dawson all the time yet i find he egotism and unrelieved vanity extraordinarily interesting as we sit together in he room wait for the carlisle train to come in he discourse freely to I of he triumph in detection he wide-spread system of spy upon spy he long delay sport with some and he ruthless rapid trapping of other man be never so interesting as when they talk shop and as a talker of shop dawson be sublime if say dawson as the time approach for the closing scene we much-wanted friend have himself hand in the parcel at carlisle -- he would be afraid to trust a accomplice -- we job will be do if not i will pull a drag net through this place which will bring he up within a day or two what a fool the man be to think that he could escape the eye of bill dawson a policeman enter lay a packet upon the table before we and announce that the prisoner have be place in cell no 2 dawson spring up we will have a look at he through the peephole and if it be we man -- one glance be enough before I i see he whom i have expect to see he and he cargo of whisky bottle have reach the last stage of they long journey at one end have be peace reasonable prosperity and a happy home at the other be perhaps a rope or a bullet dawson begin once more to descant upon he own astuteness but i be too sick at heart to listen i remember only the visit year before which that man 's wife have pay to I will you not open the parcel i interpose he fall upon it expose its contents of bread chocolate and sardine tin and call for a can opener he shake the tin one by one beside he ear and then select that which give out no flop of oil strip it open plunge he finger inside and pull forth a clammy mess of putty and sawdust in a moment he have come upon a paper which after read he hand to I it bear the word in english informant arrest : dare not send more what a fool cry dawson as if the evidence against he be not sufficient already he must give we this you will let that poor devil of a draughtsman down easily i murmured we want he as a witness reply dawson tit for tat if he help we we will help he and now we will cut along to the admiral he be eager for news we break in upon the admiral in he office near the shipyard and he greet I with cheerful badinage so you be in the hand of the police at last copplestone i always tell you what would be the end of you naval inquisitiveness dawson tell he story and the naval officer 's keen kindly face grow stern and hard german i can respect say he even those that pretend to be we friend but one of we own folk -- to sell we like this -- ugh take the vermin away dawson and stamp upon it we stand talk for a few moment and then dawson break in with a question i have never understand admiral why you be so very confident that mr copplestone here have no hand in this business the case against he look pretty ugly yet you laugh at it all the time why be you so sure the admiral survey dawson as if he be some strange creature from a unknown world mr copplestone be a friend of mine say he drily very likely snap the detective but be a man a white angel because he have the honor to be you friend a fair retort comment the admiral it happen that i have other and better reason for in July i myself show mr copplestone over the new battleship _ rampagious _ and after we inspection we both lunch with the builder and discuss she design and armament in every detail so as mr copplestone know all about she in July he be not likely to suborn a draughtsman in November see you should have tell I this before it be you duty my good dawson say the admiral gently you be a excellent officer of police but even you have a few thing yet to learn i have in my mind to give you a lesson especially as i owe you some punishment for you impertinence in open my friend copplestone 's private letter you have have the lesson profit by it dawson flush angrily punishment impertinence this to I yes return the admiral stiffly beastly impertinence chapter iv sabotage dawson show no malice towards the admiral or myself for we treatment of he i do not think that he feel any he be too fully occupy in collect the spoil of victory to trouble he head about what a scribbler or a salt horse might think of he he gather to himself every scrap of credit which the affair could be induce to yield and receive -- i admit quite deservedly -- the most handsome encomium from he superior in office during the two week he pass in my city after the capture -- week occupy in trace out the thread connect he wretch of a prisoner with the german agent upon what dawson call he little list -- he pay several visit both to my house and my office he happiness demand that he should read to I the many letter which pour in from high official of the cid from the chief commissioner and on one day -- a day of day in the chronicle of dawson -- from the home secretary himself to I it seem that all these astute potentate know they dawson very thoroughly and lubricate as it be with judicious flattery the machinery of he energy i could not but admire dawson 's truly royal faculty for absorb butter the stomach of most man really good at they business would have revolt at the diet which he superior shovel into dawson but he visibly expand and blossom yes scotland yard know its dawson and exactly how to stimulate the best that be in he he never bore I i enjoy he too thoroughly one day in my club i chance upon the admiral have you meet we friend dawson lately i ask meet he shout he with a roar of laughter meet he he be in my office every day -- he almost live with I goodness know when he do he work he have a pocket full of letter which he have read to I till i know they by heart if i do not know that he be a first-class man i should set he down as a colossal ass yet i rather wish that the admiralty would sometimes write to I as the severe but very human scotland yard do to dawson do he ever come to you in disguise i ask not that i know of i see vast number of people some of they may be dawson in he various incarnation but he have not give himself away then i explain to my naval friend my own experience he try i say to play the disguise game on I and clean bowl I the first time while he be laugh over my discomfiture i study he face more closely than a lover do that of he mistress i try to penetrate he method he never wear a wig or false hair he be too wise for that folly yet he seem able to change he hair from light to dark to make it lank or curly short or long he do it how i do not know he alter the shape of he nose he cheek and he chin i suppose that he pad they out with little rubber inset he alter he voice and he figure and even he height he can be stiff and upright like a drill soldier or loose-jointed and shamble like a tramp he be a finished artist and employ the very simplest mean he could i truly believe deceive he wife or he mother but he will never again deceive I i be not a specially observant man still one can make a shot at most thing when drive to it and i object to be the subject of dawson 's ribaldry if you will take my tip you will be able to spot he as readily as i do now good i should love to score off dawson he be a aggravating beast study he ear say i he can not alter they chief character the lobe of he ear be not loose like yours or mine or those of most man and woman he be attach to the back of he cheekbone my mother have lobe like those so have the real roger tichborne i notice dawson 's at once also at the top fold of he ear he have rather a pronounced blob of flesh this blob more prominent in some man than in other be i believe a survive relic of the sharp point which adorn the ear of we animal ancestor dawson 's ancestor must have be a wolf or a bloodhound whenever now i have a strange caller who be not far too tall or far too short to be dawson if a stranger stop I in the street to ask for a direction if a porter at a station dash up to help I with my bag i go for he ear if the lobe be attach to the cheekbone and there be a pronounced blob in the fold at the top i address the man instantly as dawson however impossibly unlike dawson he may be i have spot he twice now since he bowl I out and he be frightfully savage -- especially as i will not tell he how the trick be do he say that it be my duty to tell he and that he will compel I under some of he beloved defense of the realm regulation but the rack could not force I to give away my precious secret cherish it and use it you will not tell for you love to mystify the ruffian as much as i do i will watch for he ear when he next call which i expect will be to-morrow thank you very much i will not sneak remember that nothing else in the way of identification be of any use for i doubt if either of we have ever see the real undisguised dawson as he be know to god we know a man whom we think be the genuine article -- but be he cary 's description of he be most unlike the man whom we see here i expect that he have a different identity for every place which he visit if he tell I that at any moment he be wholly undisguised i should be quite sure that he be lie the man wallow in deception for the very sport of the thing but he can not change he ear study they and you will be safe we club be the only place in which we could be sure that dawson do not penetrate though i should not have be surprise to learn that one or two of the waitress be in he pay dawson be a ardent feminist he say that as secret agent woman beat man to a frazzle shortly before dawson leave for he headquarters on the north-east coast he drop in upon I he have finish he research and reveal the result to I with immense satisfaction i have fix up menteith he begin and know exactly how he come into communication with the german secret service the contemptuous emphasis which he lay on the word secret would have annoy the central office at potsdam i have give the detect british spy the name of menteith after that of the most famous traitor in scottish history if i call he say campbell or macdonald nothing could save I from the righteous vengeance of the outraged clan it be all very simple he go on like most thing in my business when one get to the bottom of they he be seduce by a man whom the local police have have on they string for a long time but who will now be put securely away menteith be a frequenter of a certain public house down the river where he pose as a authority on the navy and hint darkly at he store of hide information we german agent make friend with he give he small sum for drink and flatter he vanity it be strange how easily some man be deceive by flattery the agent get from menteith one or two bit of news by pretend a disbelief in he source of intelligence and then when the fool have commit himself threaten to denounce he to the police unless he take service with he altogether money of course pass but not very much the german who employ spy so extensively pay they extraordinarily little they treat they like scurvy dog for whom any old bone be good enough and i be not sure they be not right they go on the principle that the white trash who will sell they country need only to be pay with kick and copper menteith swear that he do not receive more than four pound for the plan and description of the _ rampagious _ fancy sell one 's country and risk one 's neck for four measly pound sterling if he have get four thousand i should have have some respect for he he home be in a wretched state and he wife -- a pretty woman though almost a skeleton and a very nicely mannered honest woman -- say that she husband unexpectedly give she four pound a month ago he have keep none of the blood money for drink curious be not it it show that the man have some good in he it show that he be ashamed to use the money upon himself we must do something for the poor wife dawson she will easily get work and she will be far better without she sot of a husband she do not cry when i tell she everything ' i ought to have leave he long ago ' she say ` but i try to save he thank god we have no child ' that seem to be she most insistent thought for she repeat it over and over again ` thank god that we have no child ' i hope that you be gentle with she dawson say i deeply move long ago the wife have come to I and plead for she husband she have shed no tear she have admit the justice the necessity of my sentence can you not give he another chance she have ask no i have answer sadly he have exhaust all the chance when she have rise to go and i have press she hand she have say still dry-eyed you be right sir it be no use no use at all thank god that we have no child i hope that you be gentle with she dawson i repeat he astonish I by the suddenness of he explosion damn roar he -- damn and blast do you think that i be a brute gentle it be as much as i could do not to kiss the woman as you little daughter kiss I and to promise that i would get she husband off somehow but i should not be a friend to she if i try to save that man so dawson have soft spot in he armor of callousness and little jane 's instinct be far surer than mine she have take to he at sight when i try to get from she why why he have so marked a attraction for she she reply baffle I more than the central fact i love colonel dawson he be a nice man he have a little girl like I she name be clara she birthday be next month i shall save up my pocket money and send clara a present i like colonel dawson better even than dear bailey i tear my hair for bailey be a wholly imaginary friend of little jane whom i invent one evening at she bedside and who have grow gradually into a personage of clearly define attribute -- like the putoi of anatole france dawson and bailey they be both nice man and little jane 's friend she be sure of they and i expect that she be right child always be right dawson after he outburst glower at I for a moment and then laugh i be a man say he though you may not think it and i have my weakness but i never give way to they when they interfere with business menteith be in my grip and he will not get out of it but he be a poor creature he hand over the description of the _ rampagious _ see it hide in the sardine tin and be order to take the food parcel to the post office the german agent who use he have no notion of risk he own skin then follow the discovery and the arrest of the draughtsman who have draw the plan those who have seduce menteith forbid he to come near they they slip away into hiding -- which profit they little since all of they be on we string -- after threaten menteith that he would be murder if he give himself up to the police as in he terror he seem to want to do when nothing happen for two week the vermin come out of they hole make up the last parcel and force menteith to go to carlisle in order to post it all through he have be the most abject of tool and receive nothing except the four pound and various small sum spend in drink you have the principal all right yes i have he tight the other associate with he i shall leave free they will be most useful in future they do not know that we know they when they do know they number will go up for they will be then of no further use to we it be a beautiful system mr copplestone and you have have the unusual privilege of see it at work what will you prisoner get by way of punishment i be not sure but i can guess pretty closely the principal will go out suddenly early some morning he be a jew of uncertain central european origin pole or czech a natural bear british subject a shine light of a local anti-german society a ` indispensable ' in he job and exempt from military service he will give no more trouble menteith will spend anything from seven to ten year in p learn to do without he daily whisky bottle and possibly come out a decent citizen the draughtsman i expect will be let off with eighteen month of the jug we be just but not harsh my bird do not interest I much once they have be catch it be the catch that i enjoy down in the south where i have a home of my own -- which i have not see during the past year except occasionally for a hour or two -- i use to grow big show chrysanthemum all through the process of root the cutting repot take the bud feed up the plant i never could endure any one to touch they but once the flower be fully develop my wife could cut they as much as she please and fill the house with they my job be do when i have get the flower perfect it be just the same with my business i cultivate the little dear i be after and hate any one to interfere with I i humor they and water they and feed they with opportunity till they be ripe and then i stick out my hand and grab they after that the law can do what it like with they they be not my concern any more by this time it have become apparent even to my slow intelligence why dawson tell I so much about himself and he method he have form the central figure in a real story in print and the glory of it possess he he have taste of the rich sweet wine of fame and he thirst for more of the same vintage he never in so many word ask I to write this book but he eagerness to play dr johnson to my boswell appear in all we relation he be communicative far beyond the limit of official discretion if i now disclose half or a quarter of what he tell I of the inner working of the secret service scotland yard which admire and love he would cast he out lock he up securely in gaol and prepare for I a safe harbourage in a contiguous cell so for both we sake i must be very very careful you have be most helpful to I he say handsomely at parting and if anything good turn up on the north-east coast i will let you know could you come if i send for you i would contrive to manage it say i dawson go away and the pressure of daily work and interest thrust he from my mind for a month i hear nothing of he or of cary and then one morning come a letter and a telegram the letter be from richard cary and read as follow : a queer thing have happen here a cruiser which have come in for repair be due to go out this morning she be ready for sea the night before the officer and crew have all come back from short leave and the work party have clear out then in the middle watch when the torpedo lieutenant be test the circuit it be discover that all the cable lead to the gun have be cut dawson have be call in and bid I say that if you can come down now be the chance of you life i will put you up the telegram be from dawson himself it run : they say i be beaten but i be not come and see the deuce say i sabotage i be off chapter v baffle when at last i arrive at cary 's flat it be very late and i be exceedingly tired and out of temper a squadron of zeppelin have be report from the sea the air-defence control at newcastle have send out the preliminary warning fmw and the speed of my train have be reduce to about fifteen mile a hour i have expect to get in to dinner but it be eleven o'clock before i reach my destination i have not even the satisfaction of see a raid for the zepp make cautious by recent heavy loss have turn back before cross the line of the coast cary and he wife fall upon my neck for we be old friend condole with I feed I and prescribe a tall glass of mulled port flavor with clove my stern view upon the need for prohibition in time of war become lamentably weaken by midnight i have recover my philosophic outlook upon life and cary begin to enlighten I upon the detail of the grave problem which have bring I eagerly curious to he city i expect that dawson will drop in some time to-night he say all hour be the same to he i tell he that you be on the way and he want to give you the latest news himself he be dead set upon you copplestone i can not imagine why be i then so very unattractive i inquire drily it seem to I that dawson be a man of sound judgment i confess that i do not understand why he lavish so much attention upon you you remark cary i observe be deficient in tact you might at least pretend to believe that my personal charm have win for I dawson 's affection as a matter of fact he care not a straw for my _ beau yeux _ he motive be crudely selfish he think that it be in my power to contribute to the greater glory of dawson and he cultivate I just as he would one of he show chrysanthemum he have do I the honor to appoint I he biographer extraordinary i be sure you be wrong cry cary he be most frightfully angry about that story of ours in _ cornhill _ he demand from I you name and address and swear that if i ever again disclose to you official secret he would proceed against I under the defense of the realm act he be a perfect terror i can assure you and yet he always carry that story about with he in he breast-pocket he have summon I here to see he at he work and you have be command to tell I everything which you know my dear cary do not be a ass you be too simple a soul for this rather grubby world in you eye every politician be a ardent disinterested patriot and every soldier or sailor a knightly hero of romance human being cary be make in streak like bacon we have we fat streak and we lean one we can be big and bold and also very small and mean you great man and you national hero can become very poor worm when so to speak they be off duty but i do not come here at great inconvenience to talk this sort of stuff at midnight go ahead give I the detail of this sabotage case which be baffling dawson and the naval authority let I hear about the cutting of those electric wire it be as i tell you in my note a queer business the _ antinous _ a fast light cruiser come in about a fortnight ago to have some defect make good in she high-speed geared-turbine there be not much wrong but she engineer commander recommend a renewal of some of the spur wheel the officer and crew go on short leave in rotation a care and maintenance party be put in charge and the builder place a work gang on board which be occupy in shift by night and by day in make good the defect when a ship be under repair in a river basin it be practically impossible to keep up the beautiful order and discipline of a ship at sea man of all kind be constantly come and go life on board be strip of the most ordinary comfort and convenience there be inevitably some fall off in strict supervision lack of space lack of facility for move about the ship lack of any regular routine you will understand just as the expansion in the new army and the new navy have make it possible for unknown enemy agent to take service in the army and the navy so the dilution of labor in the shipyard have make it possible for workman -- whose sympathy be with the enemy -- to get employment about the warship the danger be fully recognize and that be where dawson 's widespread system of counter-espionage come in there be not a trade union among all the eighteen or twenty engage in shipyard work -- riveter fitter plater joiner and all the rest of they -- in which he have not police officer enrol as skilled tradesman member of the union work as ordinary hand or as foreman sometimes even in office as shop steward represent the interest of the union and act as they spokesman in dispute with the employer dawson claim that there have never yet be a secret strike committee since the war begin upon which at least one of he own man be not serve he be a wonderful man i do not like he he be too unscrupulous and merciless for my simple taste but he value to the country be beyond payment but where in the world do he raise these man one can not turn a policeman into a skilled worker at a moment 's notice how be it do he begin at the other end all he skilled workman be the best he can pick out of they various trade they have serve they full time as apprentice and journeyman they be recommend to he by they employer after careful testing and sound most of they i believe come from the government dockyard and ordnance factory they be give a course of police training at scotland yard and then drop down wherever they may be want dawson and inspector like he have these man everywhere -- in shipyard in shell shop in gun factory in aeroplane shed everywhere they take a lead part in the council of the union wherever they go for they add to they skill as workman a pronounced even blatant parade of loyalty to the interest of trade union and a tasty flavor of socialist principle dawson be perfectly cynically outspoken to I over the business which i confess appal I in he female agent -- of which he have many -- he favor what he call a ` judicious frailty ' in he male agent he favor a subtle skill in the verbal technique of anarchism and this man dawson be by religion a peculiar baptist in private life a faithful husband and a loving father and in politics a strict liberal of the manchester school as a man he be good honest and rather narrow as a professional detective he be base and mean utterly without scruple and a jesuit of jesuit with he the end justify the means whatever the means may be and yet you admit that he value to the country be beyond payment dawson -- we remarkable dawson of the double life in the two compartment professional and private which never be allow to overlap -- dawson be a instrument of war we do not like use gas or liquid fire but we be compel to use they we do not like espionage but we must employ it as one who love this fair land of england beyond everything in the world and as one who would do anything risk anything and suffer anything to shield she from the filthy german i rejoice that she have in she service such supremely efficient guardian as this most wickedly unscrupulous dawson there be at any rate not a trace of we english muddle about he ours be a righteous cause cry poor cary desperately we be fight for right against wrong for defense against aggression for civilisation against utter barbarism we be by instinct clean fighter if in the stress of conflict we stoop to foul method can we ever wash away the filth of they from we soul we shall stand before the world nakedly confess as the nation of hypocrite we have always be declare to be cary i say you make I tired we can not be too thankful that we possess dawson to counterplot against the german and that personally we be in no way responsible for the morality of they method come off the roof and get back to this most interesting affair of the _ antinous _ i presume one of dawson 's man be work unknown to he fellow with the care and maintenance party and another equally unknown with the engineer who be busy upon the gear of the turbine many of the regular ship 's officer and man would also have be on board have we remarkable friend he agent among they too everything be possible with dawson i should not be surprise to hear that he have police officer in the fleet flagship you be almost right one of he man a temporary petty officer of rnvr be certainly on board and he tell I that down in the engine room be another -- a civilian fitter they be both first-class man the electric wire as you know be carry about the ship under the deck beam where they be accessible for examination and repair they be coil in cable from which wire be lead to the switch room and thence to all part of the ship there be thousand of wire and no one who do not know intimately they purpose and disposition could venture to tamper with they for great number be always in use if any one cut the lighting wire for instance the defect would be obvious at once so with the heating or telephone wire nothing be touch except the line to the gun of which there be eight disposed upon the deck from the gun connection run to the switch room the con tower the gunnery control platform aloft and to the gunnery officer 's bridge it be the main cable between the switch room and the con tower which be cut and it be one cable lay alongside a dozen other now who could know that this be the gun cable and the only one in which damage might escape detection while the ship be in harbor at sea there be constant gun drill during which the electrical control and the firing-tube be always test but in harbor the gun be lie idle most of the time it be evidently the intention of the enemy who cut these wire that the _ antinous _ should go to sea before the defect be discover and that she fire control should be out of action till the wiring system could be repair that very serious disaster be prevent by the preliminary testing during the night before sailing but the enemy have be successful in delay the departure of a invaluable light cruiser for two day in these day when the war of observation be more important even than the war of fight the service of light cruiser can not be dispense with for a hour without grave inconvenience and risk yet here be one delay for forty-eight hour after she ordinary repair have be complete the naval authority be in a frightful stew for what have happen to the _ antinous _ may happen to other cruiser even to battleship if there be sabotage among the workman in the shipyard it must be discover and stamp out without a moment 's delay this time it be the cutting of a wire cable at another time it may be some wilful injury far more serious a warship be a mass of delicate machinery to which a highly skilled enemy agent might do almost infinite damage dawson have be run off he foot during the past two day i do not know what he have discover but if he do not get to the bottom of the business in double-quick time we shall have the whole board of admiralty scotland yard and possibly the war cabinet down upon we think too of the disgrace to this shipbuilding city of which we be all so proud we shall know something soon i say for if i mistake not here come dawson the electric bell at the front door have buzz and cary slip from the room presently return with a man who to I at the first glance be a complete stranger i spring up move round to a position whence i could see clearly the visitor 's ear and gasp it be dawson beyond a doubt but it be not the dawson whom i have know in the north so what i have vaguely surmise be true -- cary 's dawson and copplestone 's dawson be utterly unlike dawson wink at I glance towards cary and shake he head from which i gather that he do not desire he appearance to be the subject of comment i therefore greet he without remark and as he sit down under the electric light examine he in detail this dawson be ten year older than the man whom i have know and fence with the hair of this one be lank and gray while that of mine be brown and curly the face of this one be white and thin while the face of mine be rather full and ruddy the tooth be different -- i find out afterwards that dawson who have few tooth of he own possess several artificial set of varied pattern -- the shape of the mouth be different the nose be different i could never have recognize the man before I have i not possess that clue to identity furnish by he unchanging ear so dawson say i slowly we meet again permit I to say that i congratulate you it be very well do he grin and glance at the unconscious cary you be learn bill dawson take a bit of know have you any news mr dawson ask cary eagerly not much the wire of the _ antinous _ have all be renew -- the admiralty will not allow cable to be patch except at sea -- but i have not find out who play hanky-panky with they it could not have be any one in the engine-room party as none of they go near the place where the wire be cut besides they be engineer not electrician and could have know nothing of the arrangement and disposition of the ship 's wire my man who work with they be positive that they be a sound good lot without a sea-lawyer or a pacifist among they a gang of plain honest tyke so we be throw back on the maintenance party include in which be all sort of rating some of they be skilled in the electrical fitting -- my own man with they be for one -- but we get the best account of all of they they be long service man cast for sea owe to various medical reason but perfectly efficient for harbor work among the officer of the ship be a rnr lieutenant with a german name i jump to he but the captain laugh the man 's father and grandfather be in the english merchant service and though he people originally come from saxony he be no more german than we be ourselves besides my experience be that a englishman with a inherit german name be the very last man to have any truck with the enemy he be too much ashamed of he forbear for one thing and for another he be too dead set on live down he beastly name so we will rule out the lieutenant rnr my own man who be a petty officer rnvr and have work on a lot of ship which have come in for repair say that the temper among the workman in the yard be good now it be ugly when dilution of labor first come in but the wages be so high that all that trouble have settle down i have have what you call sabotage in the shell and gun shop but never yet in the king 's ship we have have every possible cutter of the wire on the mat before the captain and I we have look into all they record have they home visit and they people question inquire of they habit -- mr copplestone here know what come of drink -- and find out how they spend they wages yet we have discover nothing it be the worst puzzle that i have strike when and how the gun cable be cut i can not tell you but whoever do it be much too clever to be about he must have be exactly inform of the lie and use of the cable have with he the proper tool and use they in some fraction of a minute when he be not under the eye of my own man whose business it be to watch everybody and suspect everybody i think that i have scheme out a pretty thorough system up to now it have work fine whenever we have have the slightest reason to suspect any man we have have he keep off the ship and watch we have run down a lot of footle spy too stupid to give we a minute 's anxiety but this man who cut the _ antinous _ 's wire be of a different calibre altogether he be be and when i catch he as i certainly shall i will take off my hat to he you say that the _ antinous _ be all right now i observe yes i see she tow out of the repair basin a hour ago and she must be away down the river by this time it be not of she that i be think but of the other ship which be constantly in and out for repair there be always a dozen here of various craft usually small stuff while the man who cut those wire be unknown i shall be in a perfect fever and so will the admiral-superintendent we 'll get the beauty sooner or later but if it be later there may be have mischief do if he can cut wire in one ship he may do much worse thing in some other the responsibility rest on I and it be rather crush dawson speak with less than he usual cheery confidence i fancy that the thinness and whiteness of he face be not wholly due to disguise he have not be to bed since he have be call up in the middle watch of the night before last and the man be wear out if you take my poor advice dawson i say you will cut off now and get some sleep even you brain can not work continuously without rest the country need you at you best and need you very badly indeed he dull weary eye light as if under the stimulus of champagne and he turn upon I a look which be almost affectionate i really begin to believe that dawson like I that he see in I a kindred spirit as patriotically unscrupulous as himself he jump up and grip my hand you be right i will put in a few hour ' sleep and then to work once more this time i be up against a man who be nearly as smart as i be myself and i can not afford to carry any handicap i lead he to the door and put he out and then turn to cary with a laugh and i too will follow dawson 's example it be past one and my head be buzz with queer idea perhaps after all the german have more imagination than we usually credit they with i wonder -- but i do not tell to cary what i wonder \* \* \* \* \* we be sit after breakfast in cary 's study enjoy the first sweet pipe of the day when the telephone bell ring cary take off the earpiece and i listen to a one-sided conversation somewhat as follow : -- what be that you mr dawson yes copplestone be here the _ antigone _ what about she she be a sister ship of the _ antinous _ and be in with damage to she forefoot which have be rip up when she run down that big german submarine north of the orkney -- yes i know she be due to go out some time to-day what do you say wire cut whose wire have be cut the _ antigone 's _ oh the devil yes we will both come down to you office this afternoon whenever you like cary hang up the receiver and glare at I it have happen again he groan the _ antigone _ this time she have be in dry dock for the past fortnight and be float out yesterday she full complement join she last night dawson say that he be call up at eight-o'clock by the news that she gun-wire have be cut exactly like those of the _ antinous _ and in the same incomprehensible way he seem curiously enough to be quite cheerful about it he have have a few hour sleep and besides he see that this second case so exactly like the first make the solution of he problem very much more easy i be glad that he be cheerful for i feel exuberantly happy myself i be keep awake half the night by a persistent notion which seem the more idiotic the more i think all round it but now -- now there may be something in it what be you idea tell I quick no thank you dr watson we amateur master of intuition do not work we thrilling effect in that way we keep we notion to ourselves until they turn out to be right and then we declare that we see through the problem from the first when we have be wrong we say nothing so you observe cary that whatever happen we reputation do not suffer chapter vi guesswork cary try to shake my resolution but i be obdurately silent while he canvass the whole position bring to bear he really profound knowledge of naval equipment and routine -- and incidentally help I greatly to realize the improbability of my own guesswork solution -- i be able to maintain a air of lofty superiority i must have aggravate he intensely unpardonably for i be he guest he ought to have kick I out yet he bear with I like the sweet-blooded kindly angel that he be and when at the end it appear that i be right after all cary be the first to pour congratulation and honest admiration upon I if he read this book he will know that i be repentant -- though i must confess that i should behave in just the same abominable way if the incident be to occur again there be no great value in repentance such as this we reach dawson 's office in the early afternoon and find he chief assistant there but no dawson the old man remark that officer a typical stolid faithful detective sergeant be out on the rampage he ought by rights to sit here direct the staff and leave the outside investigation to I he be a high-up man almost a deputy assistant commissioner and have no call to be always disguise himself and play he trick on everybody i suppose you know that white-haired old gent down here be not a bit like bill dawson who be not a day over forty i have give up wonder where the real dawson end and where the disguise begin the man i meet up north be not the least bit like the one down here a deal younger i expect say the chief assistant grin he shift about between thirty and sixty the old man be no end of a cure and try to take we in the same as he do you there be a inspector at the yard who be at school with he down hampshire way and ought to know what he be really like but even he have give dawson up he say that the old man do not know he own self in the looking-glass and as for mr dawson i expect she have to take any one who come along claim to be she husband for she can not possibly tell t ` other from which one might make a good story out of that i observe to cary i do not understand say he mr dawson tell I once that i know the real dawson but that few other people do if he tell you that calmly observe the assistant you may bet you last shirt he be humbug you he could not tell the truth not if he try ever so what be he at now i ask i do not know sir and if he tell I i should not believe he i do not take no account of a word that man say but he be the most successful detective we have get in the whole force he be sure to be head of the cid one day and then he will have to stay in he office and give we other a chance i do not believe he will i observe laugh there will be a sham dawson in the office and the genuine article will be out on the rampage he be a man who could not sit still not even if you tie he in he chair and seal the knot we spend a pleasant hour pull dawson to piece and leave to he not a rag of virtue except intense professional zeal we exchange experience of he those of the chief assistant be particularly rich and highly flavor it appear that dawson when off duty love to occupy the platform at meeting of he religious connection and to hold forth to the elect the privilege of sit under he have be enjoy more than once by the assistant who retail to we extract from dawson 's favorite sermon on truth he view upon truth be unbending as armor plate under no circumstance not to save oneself from imminent death not to shield a wife or a child from the penalty for a lapse from virtue not even to preserve one 's country from the attack of a enemy be it permissible to a peculiar baptist to diverge by the breadth of a hair from the straight path of truth hell yawn on either hand only along the knife edge of truth could salvation be reach he make I shiver say the chief assistant and he drive I to thinking of one or two little deception of my own when dawson preach he eye blaze he voice break and he will fall on he knee and pray for the soul of those who heed not he word you can not look at he then and not believe that he mean every word he say yet it be all humbug no it be not say i dawson in the pulpit or on the tub -- or whatever platform he use -- be absolutely genuine he be the finest example that i have ever meet of the dual personality he be in dead earnest when he preach on truth and he be in just as dead earnest when strip of every moral scruple he pursue a spy or a criminal in pursuit he be ruthless as a prussian but towards the capture victim he can be strangely tender i should not be surprise to learn that he hate capital punishment and be a strong advocate of gentle method in prison discipline the chief assistant stare open a drawer and pull forth a slim gray pamphlet it be mark for office use only and be entitle some note on prison reform by chief inspector william dawson i have begin to read the pamphlet when a step sound outside the assistant snatch it from my hand flash it back into its place and jump to attention as dawson enter he survey we with those search unwinking eye of he -- for we have the air of conspirator -- and say brusquely : clear out wilson you talk too much and do not admit any one except petty officer trehayne the _ antigone _ cry cary who think only of ship the _ antigone _ be she much damage no whoever try to cut she wire be disturbed or in too great a hurry to do he work well the main gun-cable be nipped but not cut through she will be delay till to-morrow not longer i be not worry about the _ antigone _ but about the new battleship _ malplaquet _ which be commission last month be nearly fill up with store and be expect to leave the river on Saturday we can not have she delay by any hanky trick not even if we have to put the whole detective force on board of she still i be not so anxious as i be this _ antigone _ business have clear thing up a lot and one can sift out the impossible from the possible to begin with the _ antinous _ be in for repair to she gear turbine and the _ antigone _ for damage to she forefoot engineer be on one job and plater and riveter on the other different trade so not a workman who be in the _ antinous _ be also in the _ antigone _ we can rule out all the workman we can also rule out my lieutenant rnr with the german name who have go to sea in the _ antinous _ the care and maintenance party in the _ antigone _ be not the same as the one in the _ antinous _ not a man the same you be sure of that cry i for it seem that my daring theory have go to wreck you be quite sure quite i have all the name and have examine all the man they be all off the ship by eleven o'clock last night i have not one of my own man among they but to make sure i send petty officer trehayne on board at eight o'clock to keep a sharp look-out and to see all the harbor party off the vessel he report a little after eleven that they be all go and the ship take over by she own crew the damage be discover at four bell in the morning watch six o'clock be interpret cary it look now as if there might be a traitor among she own crew which be she officer ' job not mine i wash my hand of the _ antigone _ but it be very much up to I to see that nothing hurtful happen to the _ malplaquet _ the admiral have order to support I with all the force under he command the general of the district have the same order but it be not force we want so much as brain -- dawson 's brain i have be beat twice but not the third time i have tell the yard that if the _ malplaquet _ be touch i shall resign and if they send any one to help I i shall resign between to-day Thursday and Saturday i be go to catch the wily josser who have a fancy for cut gun cable or dawson will say good-bye to the force that be a fair stake the man swell with determination and pride he have no thought of failure and draw inspiration and joy from the heaviness of the bet which he have make with fortune he take the bear gambler 's delight in a big risk then you think that the _ antinous _ and the _ antigone _ be both damage by the same man and that he may have design upon the _ malplaquet _ say i i do not propose to tell you what i think reply dawson stiffly still i persist pass over the snub you have a theory no thanks say dawson contemptuously i have no use for theory when they be wrong they mislead you and when they be right they be no help i believe in fact -- fact bring out by constant vigilance unsleeping watchfulness and universal suspicion those be the principle i work on the theory business make pretty story book but the force do not waste good time over they what be you go to do this be Thursday afternoon i be go to join the _ malplaquet _ presently and i be not go to sleep till she be safely down the river i be go to be my own watchman this time how in what capacity dawson give a shrug of impatience for he nerve be on edge for a moment he hesitate and then recollect the high post to which i have tacitly be appoint in he household he reply : i be go as one of the marine sentry it be no use dawson protest i emphatically you be a wonder at disguise and will look i do not doubt the very spit of a marine but you can not pass among the man for half a hour without discovery they be a class apart they talk they own language cherish they own secret tradition live in a world to which no stranger ever penetrate you could pass as a naval officer more easily than you could as a pongo it be sheer madness dawson he give a short laugh much you know about it i have serve in the red corps myself i be a recruit at deal pass two year at plymouth and serve afloat for three year i be then draft into the naval police afterwards i be recommend for detective work in the dockyard and at the end of my marine service join the yard my good man i be a sergeant before i leave the corps i give up dawson say i nothing about you will ever surprise I again not even if you claim to have be a cabinet minister a queer smile steal over he face no i have not be a minister but i have attend a meeting of the cabinet cary interpose at this point yours be a fine idea mr dawson as a marine sentry you can get yourself post by the major wherever you please and the guard will not talk even though they may wonder that any man should want to do twenty-four hour of duty per day the marine be the closest faith-fullest and best discipline force in the wide world bluejacket will gossip marine never you will be able to watch more closely than even trehayne who i suppose will also be on board yes he be come up soon for instruction it be he last chance as it be mine he see that he must be hold responsible for the wire cut in the _ antinous _ and to some slight extent also in the _ antigone _ and that if anything go wrong with the _ malplaquet _ he will be dismiss i shall be sorry to lose he for he be a exceptionally good man but we can not allow failure in petty officer detective any more than we can in chief inspector where do trehayne come from he name sound cornish i ask falmouth i believe he be quite young but he have have nearly three year in the _ vernon _ at portsmouth and in the torpedo factory at greenock a first-class engineer and electrician and a sound detective he have be with I for some twelve month you will see he if he call soon i have be think hard over the detail of dawson 's plan while the talk go on and then venture to offer some comment it be fortunate that you have grow a moustache since you be in the north you could not have be a marine as a clean-shaven man i often have to shave it say dawson but i always grow it again between while one can take it off quicker than one can put it on again false hair be the devil i have never use it yet and never will so whenever i have a spell of leisure i grow a moustache against emergency -- like this one my next comment be rather difficult to make for i do not wish either cary or dawson to divine its purpose if i may make a suggestion to a man of you experience it would be that none of you man here not even you chief assistant or trehayne should know that you be join the _ malplaquet _ as a marine two independent string be in this case better than a double-jointed string i never tell anything to any one least of all to pudden-headed wilson he be loyal but a stupid ass with a flap tongue trehayne be close as wax but on general principle i keep my movement strictly to myself he will be in the ship but he will not know that i be there too the commander must know and the major of marine for i shall want a uniform and the free run of the ship so as to be post where i like the marine sergeant of the guard may guess but as mr cary say they will not talk you two gentleman be safe add dawson pleasantly for i have get you tight in my hand and could lock either of you up in a minute if i choose a peculiar knock come upon the door a word pass between dawson and the police sentry outside and a young man in the uniform of a naval petty officer enter the room he be clean-shaven look about twenty-five year old be dark and slim of the latin type which be not uncommon in cornwall and impressed I at once with he air of intelligence and refinement he voice too be rather striking it be that of the wardroom rather than of the mess deck i like the look of petty officer trehayne dawson present he to we and then take he aside for instruction when he have finish both man rejoin we and the conversation become light and general trehayne though clearly suffer from nervous strain after he recent professional failure talk with the ease and detachment of a highly cultivate man it appear that he have be educate at blundell 's school have lose he parent at about sixteen have do a course in some electrical engineering shop at plymouth and when twenty year old have secure a good berth on the engineering staff of the _ vernon _ he could speak both french and german which he have learn partly at school and partly on the continent during leave dawson who be evidently very proud of he young pupil and assistant parade he accomplishment before we rather to trehayne 's embarrassment try he with french and german urge dawson he can chatter they as well as english but he be as close as wax in all three language some man can not keep they tongue still in one i turn to trehayne and speak in french : german i can not abide but french i love my vocabulary be extensive but my accent abominable -- incurably british you can hear it for yourself how it give I away it be not quite of pari reply trehayne mais vous parlez francais tres bien tres correctement beaucoup mieux que moi non non monsieur i protest and then revert to english now say dawson when trehayne have leave we i must get along see the commander of the _ malplaquet _ and draw a uniform and rifle out of the marine store it will be quite like old time you will not see I until Saturday when i shall be either a triumphant or a broken man what be the bet mr copplestone i could not understand the quizzical little smile that dawson give I nor the humorous twitch of he lip he have contemptuously disclaim all use of theory yet there be more move behind that big forehead of he than he choose to give away do he idea run on parallel line with mine do he even suspect that i have form any idea at all i could not inquire for i dislike be laugh at especially by this man dawson i have nothing to go upon at least so little that be palpable that anything which i might say would be dismiss as the merest guesswork for which as dawson proclaim he have no use yet yet -- my original guess stick firmly in my mind improbable though it might be and have just be nail down tightly -- i scorn to mystify the reader -- by a few simple sentence speak in french chapter vii the marine sentry we have a whole day to fill in before we could get any news of dawson 's vigil in the _ malplaquet _ and i have never know a day as drearily long cary and i be both restless as pea on a hot girdle and could not settle down to talk or to read or to write cary seek vainly to persuade I to read and pass judgment upon he navy book in spite of my interest in the subject my soul revolt at the forbid pile of manuscript i promise to read the proof and criticise they with severity but as for the m -- no thanks poor cary need all he sweet patience to put up with I by eleven o'clock we have become unendurable to one another and i gladly welcome he suggestion to adjourn to he club have lunch there and try to inveigle the commander of the _ malplaquet _ into we net i know he say cary he be a fine fellow and though he must be pretty busy he will be glad to lunch somewhere away from the ship if we have luck we will go back with he and look over the _ malplaquet _ ourselves if you can manage that cary you will have my blessing he do manage to work the luncheon part by telephone to the yard where the _ malplaquet _ be fitting out and we leave the rest to we personal charm cary be right the commander be a very fine fellow a english naval officer of the best type he confirm the view i have frequently hear express by other of he profession that no hatred exist between english and german sailor they leave that to middle-aged civilian who write for newspaper the german navy in he opinion be a jolly fine service worthy in high courage and skill to contest with we the supremacy of the sea he have be through the china trouble as a lieutenant in the _ monmouth _ -- afterwards sink by german shot off coronel -- know von spee von mueller and other officer of the pacific squadron and speak of they with enthusiasm they sink some of we ship and we wipe out theirs that be all in the way of business we love they in peace and we love they in war they be splendidly loyal to we out in china -- von spee actually transfer some of he ship to the command of we own senior officer so as to avoid any clash of control -- and when it come to fight they fight like gentleman i grant you that they submarine work against merchant ship have be pretty putrid but i do not believe that be the choice of they navy they get they order from rotten civilian like kaiser bill imagine if you can the bristle moustache of the supreme war lord could he have hear himself describe as a civilian we guest have command a destroyer in the jutland battle and assure we that the handling of the german battle squadron have be masterly they punish we heavily for just so long as they be superior in strength and then they slip away before jellicoe could get he blow in they keep fend we off with torpedo attack until the night come down and then clean vanish we get in some return smack after dark at straggler but it be very difficult to say how much damage we do not much i expect still it be a good battle as decisive in its way as trafalgar it prove that the whole german fleet could not fight out a action against we full force and have the smallest hope of success i be just pray for the chance of a whack at they in the _ malplaquet _ my destroyer be a bonny ship the best in the flotilla but the _ malplaquet _ be a real peach you should see she we mean to say cary this very afternoon you shall take we back with you the commander open he eye at this cool proposal but we prevail upon he to seek the permission of the admiral-superintendent who a good deal to my surprise prove to be quite pliable cary 's reputation for discretion must be very high in the little village where he live if it be able to guarantee so disreputable a scribbler as bennet copplestone the admiral fortunately have not read any of my work before they have be censor when print in _ cornhill _ they be comparatively harmless i must not describe the _ malplaquet _ she design be not new to I -- i have see more than one of she type -- but as she be now a unit in beatty 's fleet she existence be not admit to the world as we go up and down she many steep narrow ladder and peer into dark corner i look everywhere for a marine sentry whom i could identify by mark of ear as dawson i never see he but trehayne pass I twice and i find myself again admire he splendid young manhood he be not big be rather slim and wiry than strongly build but in sheer beauty of face and form he be almost perfectly fashion do you know that man i ask of we commander indicate trehayne no say he he be one of the shore party but i should like to have he with I he be one of the smartest look petty officer that i have ever see we be show everything that we desire to see except the transmission room and the upper conning tower -- the twin holy of holy in a commission ship -- and slip away escape the captain by a bare two minute which be lucky as he would probably have have we throw into the ditch the end of the day be as weariful as the beginning and we be all glad -- especially i expect mr cary -- to go early to bed that ill-used lady to whom we could disclose nothing of we anxiety must have find we wretched company we have finish breakfast the next morning -- the Saturday of dawson 's gamble -- and be sit on cary 's big fireguard talking of every subject except the one which have keep we awake at night when a servant enter and announce that a soldier be at the door with a message from mr dawson show he in almost shout cary and i jump to my foot stir for once into a visible display of eagerness a marine come in dress in the smart blue sea kit that i love upon he head the low flat cap of he corps he give we a full swinging salute and jump to attention with a click of he heel he look about thirty-five and wear a neatly trim dark moustache he hair also very dark be crop close to he head stand there with he hand upon the red seam of he trousers he chest well fill out and he face weather tan he look a proper figure of a sea-going soldier mr cary sir he say in a flat monotonous orderly 's voice major boyle 's compliment and could you and you friend come down to the police station to meet he and chief inspector dawson i have a taxi-cab at the door sir certainly cry cary in two minute we shall be ready oh no we sha not i remark calmly for i have move to a position of tactical advantage on the marine 's port beam we will have the story here if you do not mind dawson he stamp pettishly on the floor whip off he cap and spin it across the room confound you mr copplestone he growl how the -- how the -- do you do it he could not think of a expletive mild enough for mr cary 's ear there be something about I that i can not hide what be it if you do not tell i will get you on the regulation compelling all british subject to answer question address to they by a competent naval or military authority you do not happen to be either dawson say i unkindly and beside there be never yet a law make which could compel a man to speak or a woman to hold she tongue some day perhaps if you be good i will show you how the trick be do but not yet i want to have something to bargain with when you cast I into jail out with the story we be impatient if i mistake not you come to we dawson triumphant you have not the air of a broken man i have be successful he answer gravely but i be a long long way from feel triumphant no thank you mrs cary i have have my breakfast but if i might trouble you for a cup of coffee many thanks dawson sit down and cary move about inspect he from every angle no declare he at last i can not see the smallest resemblance not the smallest you be thin now you be distinctly plump you hair be nearly white you cheek have fall in as if you back tooth be miss you lower lip stick out dawson smile highly gratified i take in all my people at the office this morning he say they all think and think still that i be a messenger from the _ malplaquet _ which by the way be well down the river safe and sound just wait a minute he walk into a corner of the room move he hand quickly between he side pocket and he face and then return except for the dark hair and moustache and the brown skin he have become the dawson of the Thursday afternoon it be as simple for I to change say the artist with a nasty look in my direction as it seem to be for mr copplestone here to spot I it will take a day or two to get the dye out of my hair and the tan off my skin i be go to have a sharp touch of influenza which be a useful disease when one want to lie in since Sunday i have only be twice to bed we fill he up with coffee and flattery -- as one fill a motor car with petrol and oil -- but ask he no question until we be safely in cary 's study and mr cary have go about she household duty you good lady remark dawson to cary be as little curious as any woman i have meet and we will leave she at that if you do not mind the best thing about we woman be that they do not care tuppence about naval and military detail if they do and once start prying with that keen scent and indomitable persistence of theirs we might as well chuck up even my own bright team of charmer never know and never ask the meaning of the information that they ferret out for I they curiosity be all personal -- about man and woman never about thing woman -- i cut dawson short he tend to become tedious quite so i observe politely and to revert to one big female creature let we hear something of the _ malplaquet _ you at any rate be curious enough for a dozen it would serve you right to keep you hop a bit longer but i have a kindly eye for human weakness though you might not think it i join the ship on Thursday afternoon slip in as one of a detachment of fifty rmlus who have be wire for from chatham they be a emergency lot we have not enough in the ship for the double sentry go that i want all my plan be make with the commander and major boyle and they both do exactly what i tell they it be not often that a private of marine have the order about of two officer but dawson be dawson no common man they do as i tell they and be glad to do it i have extra light bulb put on all over the lower deck and every dark corner light up -- except one just one and this one be where the four gun-cable run out of the switch-room and lay alongside one another before they branch off to the fore and after turret and to the port and starboard side battery that be the most likely spot which any one want to cut the gun-wire would mark down and i mean to watch it pretty closely myself we have double sentry at the magazine the _ malplaquet _ be a oil-fired ship so we have not any bother coal bunker to attract fancy bomb i be pretty sure that after the _ antinous _ and the _ antigone _ we have mostly wire-cutting to fear when a man have do one job successfully and repeat it almost successfully he be pretty certain to have a third shot besides if one be out to delay a ship cut wire be as good a way as any i have a idea that my man be not a bomber i think that you scorn theory i put in dryly when they be wrong they mislead you and when they be right they be no help dawson frowned shut up copplestone snap cary we be in no danger from the lighting heating and telephone wire for any defect would have be visible at once it be the gun and gunnery control cable that be the weak spot so i have lto 's post in the spot top the con tower the transmission room the four turret and at the side battery every few minute they put through test which would have show up at once any wire that have be tamper with after the shore party have clear out about nine o'clock on the Thursday no officer or man be allow to leave the ship without a special permit from the commander this be all dead against the sanitary regulation of the harbor but i have the admiral 's authority to break any rule i please by the way you two ought never to have be allow on board yesterday afternoon -- i see you though you do not see I it be contrary to my order i speak to the admiral pretty sharp last night ` who be responsible for the ship ' say i ` you or I ' ` you ' say he ' i leave it at that ' say i one moment dawson i put in if the shore party have all go how be it that i see petty officer trehayne in the ship he have order to stay and keep watch -- though he do not know i be on board myself two pair of police eye be better than one pair and fifty time better than all the navy eye in the ship of all the simple-minded unsuspicious beggar in the world give I a pack of naval rating i would not have one of they for sentry -- that be why the fifty emergency marine be send for dawson 's limitless pride in he old service and deep contempt for the mere sailor have come back in full flood with the uniform of he corps i start my own sentry duty in the dark corner i tell you of as soon as i have see to the arrangement all over the _ malplaquet _ and i be there with very few break of not more than five minute each for a bite of food for twenty-six hour two marine sentry take my place whenever i be away i have my rifle and bayonet and stand back in a corner of a bulkhead where i could not be see the hour be awful long i stand without hardly move all the pin and needle out of redditch seem to dance up and down I but i stick it out -- and i have my reward i have my reward i do my duty but it be a sick and sorry man that i be this day there be nothing else to be do i say what you feel now be a nervous reaction that be about it i watch and watch never feel a bit like sleep though my eye burn something cruel and my foot -- they be lump of prickly wood not foot dull lump with every now and then a stab as if a tin tack have be drive into they beyond I in the open alley-way the light be strong and i could see man pass frequently but no one come into my corner till the end and no one see I i hear six bell go in the first watch -lrb- ` eleven pm ' whisper cary -rrb- on Friday evening though there be a good bit of noise of get ready to go out in the early morning and i be begin to think that all my trouble might go for naught when a man in a navy cap and overalls stop just opposite my dark hole between two bulkhead he face be turn from I as he look carefully up and down the light way he stand there quite still for some seconds and then step backwards towards I i could see he plain against the light beyond he listen for another minute or so and satisfy that no one be near spin on he heel whip a tool from he dungaree overalls and reach up to the wire which run under the deck beam overhead in spite of my ache joint and sore foot i be out in a flash and have my bayonet up against he chest he do not move till my point be through he clothes and into he flesh i just shove till he give ground and so step by step i push he with the point of my bayonet till he be under the light he arm have come down he drop the big shears with insulate handle which he have draw from he pocket but he do not speak a word to I and i do not speak to he i just hold he there under the light and we look at one another without a word speak there be no sign of surprise or fear in he face just a queer little smile suddenly he move make a snatch at the front of he overalls and put something into he mouth i guess what it be but do not try to stop he it be the best thing that he could do dawson stop and pull savagely at he cigar he jab the end with he knife though the cigar be draw perfectly well and give forth a deep growl which might have be a curse or a sob have you ever watch a electric bulb fade away when the current be fail he ask the film pale down from glowing white to dull red which get fainter and fainter little by little till nothing but the memory of it linger on you retina he eye go out exactly like that bulb they fade and fade out of he face which still keep up that queer twisted smile i have see they ever since wherever i turn i shall be glad of that bout of influenza and shall begin it with a stiff dose of veronal when the light have nearly go out of he eye and he be rock on he foot i speak for the first time i speak loud too ` good-bye ' i call out ` i be dawson ' he hear I for he eye answer with a last flash then they fade right out and he fall flat on the steel deck he have die on he foot he will keep he upright to the end that be a man he live a man 's life do what he think he duty and he die a man 's death i blow my whistle twice up clatter a sergeant with the marine guard and stop where that figure on the deck bar they way ` get a stretcher ' i say ` and send for the doctor but it will not be any use the man 's dead ' the sergeant ask sharply for my report and send off a couple of man for a stretcher ` excuse I sergeant ' i say in my best detective officer voice ' i will report direct to you major and the commander i be chief inspector dawson ' he show no surprise nor doubt of my word -- if you want to understand discipline gentleman get the marine to teach you -- he ask no question with one word he call the guard to attention and himself salute I -- I a private i hand he my rifle -- there be a inch of blood at the point of the bayonet -- and hobble off to the nearest ladder my word i could scarcely walk and as for climb a ship 's ladder -- i could never have do if some one have not give I a boost behind and some one else a hand at the top the commander and the major of marine be both in the wardroom i walk in salute they as a self-respecting private should do and tell they the whole story it be petty officer trehayne say i calmly -- and wait for a sensation of course reply dawson greatly to my annoyance he might have show some astonishment at my wonderful intuition but he do not not a scrap even cary be at first disappointing though he warm up later and do I full justice trehayne a spy cry cary he look a smart good man i be not say that he be not snap dawson whose nerve be very badly on edge he be obey the order of he superior as we all have to do he give he life and it be for he country 's service nobody can do more than that do not you go for to slander trehayne i watch he die -- on he foot cary turn to I what make you think it be trehayne he ask this be better i look at dawson who be brooding in he chair with he thought far away he be still see those eye fading out under the glare of the electric between the steel deck of the _ malplaquet _ it be a sheer guess at first say i preserve a decent show of modesty when i hear how the enemy plot and dawson counter-plotted with all those skilled workman in he detective service it occur to I that a enemy with imagination might counter-counterplot by get man inside dawson 's defence i could not see how one would work it but if german agent say could manage to become trust servant of dawson himself they would have the time of they life so far i be guess at a possibility however improbable it might seem then when dawson tell we that he have send trehayne into the _ antigone _ and that he be the one factor common to both vessel -- the workman and the maintenance part be all different -- i begin to feel that my wild theory might have something in it i do not say anything to you cary or to dawson -- he despise theory afterwards trehayne come in and i speak to he and he to I in french he do not utter a dozen word altogether but i be absolutely certain that he french have not be learn at a english public school and during short trip on the continent i know too much of english school french and of one 's opportunity to learn upon continental trip it take I three year of hard work to recover from the sort of french which i learn at school and i be not well yet the french speak by trehayne be the french of the nursery it be almost if not quite he mother tongue just as he english be trehayne 's french accent do not fit into trehayne 's history as retail to we by dawson from that moment i plumped for trehayne as the cutter of gun wire dawson have be listen though he show no interest in my speech when i have quite finish and be bask in the respectful admiration emanate from dear old cary he upset over I a bucket of very cold water very pretty say he but answer one question why do i send trehayne to the _ antigone _ why how can i tell you say it be to make sure that the shore party be all off the ship i say what do it matter what i say what i do matter a heap but what i say -- pouf i send trehayne to the _ antigone _ to test he i send he expect that he would try to cut she wire and he do then when i be sure though i have no evidence for a law court i send he to the _ malplaquet _ and i set my trap there for he to walk into how do i guess i do not guess i watch the more valuable a man be to I the more i watch he for he might be even more valuable to somebody else trehayne be a excellent man but he have not be with I a month before i be watch he as closely as any cat i have not be a marine and serve ashore and afloat without know a bear gentleman when i see one and know too the naval stamp trehayne be too much of a gentleman to have become a workman in the _ vernon _ and at greenock without some very good reason he say that he be a orphan -- yes he say he parent leave he penniless and he have to earn he live the best way he could -- yes quite good reason but they do not convince I i be certain sure that somewhere some time trehayne have be a naval officer i have see too many during my service to make any mistake about that so when i stand there wait in that damned cold corner behind that bulkhead it be for trehayne that i be wait i mean to take he or to kill he when he kill himself i be glad as i watch he eye fade out it be as if my own son be die on he foot in front of I but it be better so than to die in front of a firing party for i -- i love he and i wish he ` good-bye ' dawson pitch he cigar into the fire get up and walk away to the far side of the room i have never till that moment completely reverence the penetrative infallible judgment of little jane dawson come back after a few minute pick up another cigar from cary 's box and sit down you see i have a letter from he i find it in he quarter where i go straight from the _ malplaquet _ may we read it i ask gently i be greatly take with trehayne myself he be a clean beautiful boy he be a enemy officer on secret service there be no dishonor in that if he be alive i could shake he hand as the officer of the firing party shake the hand of lody before he give the last order dawson take a paper from he pocket and hand it to I read it out say he i can not chapter viii trehayne 's letter i take the letter from dawson and glance through it the first sheet and the last have be write very recently -- just before the boy have leave he quarter for the last time to go on board the _ malplaquet _ the remainder have be set down at various time and the whole have be connect up put together and page after the completion of the last sheet trehayne write a pretty hand firm and clear the writing of a artist who be also a trained engineer there be no trace in the script of nervousness or of hesitation he have carry out he order he see clearly that the path which he have tread be lead he to the end of he journey but he make no complaint he be a latin and to the last possess that loftiness of spirit wed to

accompany -- to see the dockyard the engine shop the training school and the barracks they know that he be a austrian naval officer and they take he to they heart as a brother of the common universal brotherhood of the sea i think that you navy hold those of a foreign naval service as more nearly of kin to themselves than civilian of they own blood the bond of a common profession be more close

we judgment have he a english public school boy play the game accord to the immemorial english rule i go on -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* it be extraordinarily easy for I to obtain employment in the heart of you naval mystery few question be ask you admit I as one of yourselve i take the broad open path of full acceptance of you condition i first obtain employment in a marine engineering shop at

and store they in my mind for the benefit of my own service at home it be at portsmouth that there come to I the great temptation of my life for i fall in love not as you colder people do but as a latin of the warm south she be a english girl of good if undistinguished family though in my hour of duty i belong to that you call the ` work class ' i be well off and live in private the life of my own class i have double the pay of my rank a allowance from my father and my wages which be not small there be many english family in portsmouth and southsea who be graciously pleased to recognize that john trehayne trade unionist and weekly wage-earning workman be a gentleman by birth and breeding in any foreign port i should have be under police supervision as a person eminently to be suspect in portsmouth i be accept without question for what i give myself out to be -- a gentleman who wish to learn he business from the bottom upward i will say nothing of the lady of my heart except that i love she passionately and should have marry she -- aye and become a englishman in fact casting off my own country -- if war have not blow my ignoble plan to shatter there be nothing ignoble in my love for she be a queen among woman but in myself for permit the hot blood of youth to blind my eye to the duty claim of I by my country when war become imminent i be not recall as i have hope to be since i wish to fight afloat as become my rank and family i be order to take such step as most effectively aid I to observe the english plan and preparation and to report when possible to vienna in other word i be order to act in you midst as a special intelligence officer -- what you would call a spy it be a honorable and dangerous service which i have no choice but to accept my dream of love have go to wreck i could have deceive the woman whom i loved for she would have trust I and believe any story of I that i have choose to tell but could i a officer a gentleman by birth and i hope by practice a secret enemy of england and a spy upon she in the hour of she sorest trial could i remain the lover of a english girl without tell she fully and frankly exactly what i be could i have commit this frightful treason to love and remain other than a object of scorn and loathing to honest man i could not in soul and heart she be mine i be she man and she be my woman with she there be no reserve in love she be mine yet i flee from she with never a word even of good-bye i make my plan obtain certificate of my proficiency in the _ vernon _ kiss my dear love quietly almost coldly without a trace of the passion that i feel and flee it be the one thing leave I to do my friend that be two year ago she know not whether i be alive or be dead i know not whether she be alive or be dead yet during every hour of the long day and during every hour of the still longer night she have be with I i have do my duty but i do not think that i wish to live very much longer if death come to I quickly -- and to those in my present trade it come quickly -- will you my friend of you bountiful kindness write to -lrb- here follow a name and address -rrb- and repeat exactly what i now say do not tell what i be or how i die but just write he love you to the last there be a portrait in a locket round my neck and a ring on my finger send she those my good friend and she will know that you word be true \* \* \* \* \* i flee as far from portsmouth where my dear love dwelt as i could go i flee to greenock that dreadful sodden corner of earth where the rain never cease to fall and the sun never shine at greenock one measure the rainfall not by inch but by yard sometimes not often a pale orb struggle through the cloud and glimmer faintly upon the grimy town -- some poor relation of the sun maybe but not the godlike creature himself for six month in this cold desolate spot among a people strangely unlike the english of devon though they be of kindred race i labor for six month in the torpedo factory i live meanly in one room for my austrian pay and allowance have stop when war cut the channel of communication i could have i choose have draw money from german agency in london but i scorn to hold truck with they they be traitor to the england which trust and protect they and of which they be citizen i live upon my wages and preserved jealously all that i have save during my year of comparative affluence at portsmouth it be duty which make I a spy not gold one day i be call into the office of the superintendent and it be hint to I diplomatically not unskilfully that i be desire to take service with the english secret police i feigned reluctance make difficulty profess diffidence until pressure be put upon I and i be force to accept a position which i could never by any scheming have achieve those whom the god seek to destroy they first drive mad -- you be a very trustful unsuspicious folk all except you to whom i write but even you do not i be sure suspect I at the beginning i be send to scotland yard in london to be train in my new duty you see I there and claim I for you staff and i come to this center of shipbuilding and work here with you i be clothe in the uniform of the royal naval volunteer reserve there be two matter closely affect my personal honor which will seem of small moment to you -- you who display always a sublime patriotic scorn of every moral scruple but to I they be great i be of the old chivalry of italy and i have be teach at school in england always to play the game though i wear the uniform of the rnvr it be as a disguise and cloak of my police office i be never attest i have never never never swear allegiance to england i have always keep troth with my own country i have never break troth with england have the english naval oath be proffer to I i should have refuse it at any hazard to my personal safety my honor be unstained you have pay I for my work i have take you pay but i have not spend it upon myself every penny of it for the last twelve month will be find at my quarter i have live upon what i save at portsmouth -- live sometimes very scantily my fund be run low what i shall do when they be exhaust i can not tell perhaps who know they will last my time as for the rest that packet of treasury note which have be my police pay unexpended will you take it my friend and pay it to the fund for assist the english sailor intern in holland i should feel happier if they would accept it for i have as you will presently learn take some of they name in vain i have not break any oath and i have not use you pay my honor be unstained \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- again i pause and glance at dawson he have not even wince -- at least not visibly -- when trehayne have hold he free from every moral scruple he must i think have read the letter many time before he have hand it to I cary look troubled and uneasy to he a spy have be just a spy -- he have never envisage in he simple honest mind such a super-spy as trehayne i go on -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* now nothing be hide from I i have within my hand all the secret of england 's navy my one difficulty -- and it be not so great a one as you may think -- be communication with my country never for one moment do it fail year before it have be think out and prepared i vary my method at portsmouth during the early week of the war i have employ one mean at greenock another here yet another the basis of all be the same it be much more difficult for I to receive order from my official superior in austrium but even those come through once or twice never during the whole of the past year have i fail to send every detail of the warship building and complete here of the ship damage and repair of the movement of the fleet in so far as i could learn they my country and she ally have see the english at work here as clearly as if this river have be within they own border john trehayne have be they eye -- a unsleeping ever-watching eye shall i tell you how i get my information through it be very simple and be do under you own keen nose one of the rnvr who go with you mr churchill to antwerp and be intern in holland be a friend of mine at greenock well know to I i write to he constantly though he never receive and be never mean to receive my letter they be all address to the care of a house in haarlem where live one of we austrian agent who be place under my order all letter address by I to my friend be receive by he and forward post haste to vienna do you grasp the simplicity and subtlety of the device my friend be on the list of those intern in holland no one here know where he lodge the address use by I be as probable as any other what more natural and commendable than that i should write to cheer he up a bit in exile and that i should send he book and illustrate magazine if it have be notice by the postal authority in holland that my friend do not live at the address which i use it would have be suppose that i have make a mistake and no suspicion would have be attract to I but how do my letter book and magazine contain information the most secret and urgent pass through the censorship unchecked that again be simple my letter be those which a friend in freedom in england would write to he friend who be a captive in holland they be personal sympathetic no more the book and magazine be just those which such a man as my friend would desire to have to lighten the burden of idleness between the line of my letter and on the white margin of the book and papers i write the vital information which my country desire to have and i desire to give the ink which i use for this purpose leave no trace and could not be make visible by any one who have not its complementary secret it be the special ink of the austrian secret service you do not know it you censor do not know it you chemist might experiment for month and year and not discover it i use it always and you never read what i write now you will understand why i wish the small stock of money my police pay which i could not myself have use without dishonor to go to the intern sailor in holland i feel that i owe to my friend some little reparation for the crooked use to which i have put he name there be little more to tell three week ago i receive by post from london a copy of _ punch _ it have be despatch to I unordered from the office of the paper in a office wrapper you know that english papers may not now be send abroad to neutral country except direct from the publishing office of the newspaper themselves it be a precaution of the censorship childish and laughable for what be easier than to imitate official wrapper i guess at once when i see this unordered copy of _ punch _ that the wrapper be a fake one and that it have come to I bear order from my superior i apply my chemical test to the margin of the page and upon the advertisement of a brand of whisky appear the order which i have expect i read what be write and i have not suffer greater pain -- no not upon that day when i flee from portsmouth without a word of good-bye to the woman who possess my heart for i learn then that my country the proud clean-fighting austrium have give up its soul into the keep of the filthy prussian assassin i be direct to damage or delay every warship upon which i work to employ any means to blow up unsuspecting english seaman -- not in the hot blood of battle but secretly as a assassin a step in rank be promise for every battleship destroy have these foul order admit of no loophole through which my honor might with difficulty wriggle i should have take the only course possible to I i should have instantly resign my commission in the austrian navy and take my own life but it happen that i have a alternative i be order to damage or delay warship i would not treacherously slay the english sailor among whom i work but i would if i could delay the ship my experience teach I that the simplest and most effective way be to cut the electric wire and i decide to do it whenever opportunity offer i could not do this for long i be certain to be discover you be not a man who fail before a definite problem in detection but before i be discover i could do something to carry out my order i cut the gun-wire of the _ antinous _ it be easy i be the last to leave of the shore party then you send I on board the _ antigone _ she be closely watch the task be very difficult and dangerous i be within the fraction of a second of discovery but i take one chop of my big shears the job be ill do but i could do no better you warn I fairly that if injury come to the _ malplaquet _ while under my charge that i should be dismiss she be my last chance as she be you own but what to I be risk i have lose my love and my country have dishonour herself in my eye i be nameless loveless countryless all have go and life might go too \* \* \* \* \* i be complete this letter before go on board the _ malplaquet _ and place it where you will readily find it i know you my friend more intimately than you know yourself i be certain that even now you be in the ship that you be prepare snare into which i shall in all probability fall you snare be well set if i fail it will be through you if i be catch it will be through you but be sure of this -- if we meet in the _ malplaquet _ the fowler and the bird it will be for the last time you may catch I but you will not take I for a long time past i have provide against just such a outcome as this upon my uniform tunic upon my overalls i have fix button hollow out each of which contain enough of cyanide of potassium to kill three man if i be court-martialle and shoot there would be no disgrace to I a officer on secret service but a whisper of it might steal to portsmouth and give deep pain to one there no one will learn of the petty officer of rnvr who die far away in the north the locket with the portrait be round my neck the ring be upon my finger both be ready wait for you who will do what i ask and will keep my secret from she i have the honor to be sir you obedient servant john trehayne \* \* \* \* \* i fold up the papers and return they to dawson who carefully place they in he pocket in the shadow the spirit of trehayne still seem to be wait i think for a few minute and then rise to my foot he be a officer on secret service say i slowly a enemy but a gallant and generous enemy in love and in war he play the game requiescat in pace aman say cary dawson rise and grip we hand i have the locket and the ring and i will write as he wish it be the least that i can do they bury trehayne with naval honor as a enemy officer who have die among we england do not war with the dead though he have fall by he own hand the roman church do not withhold from a err son the beautiful consolation of she ritual cary and i openly attend the funeral dawson be officially in bed suffering from he much-desired attack of influenza but in the firing party of red marine whose volley ring through the wintry air over the body of trehayne i espied one whom i be glad to see present part ii _ madame gilbert _ chapter ix the woman and the man if one believe dawson 's own account of he exploit -- i can conceive no greater exercise in folly -- one would conclude that he never fail that he always hold the string by which he puppet be constrain to dance and that he could pluck they from they game and shut they within he black box whenever he grow wearied of they fruitless sport he trumpet he success but he never speak of he failure -- he bury they so deeply that he forget they himself he veil he plan movement and personal appearance in a fog of mystery none not even he closest associate know what he would be at until a job be completely finish and finish successfully thus when he succeed he own small world be deeply impressed -- even nauseated -- by the compelling spectacle of a dawson triumphant when he fail very few know or hear of the failure he love the jealousy of he equal and inferior even more than the admiration of he superior thoroughly to enjoy life he must be surround by both in the amplest measure what i now have to tell be the story of a failure -- a failure due to he refusal ever to allow he right hand to know what he left hand seek to do he never tell I himself one word concern this story i obtain the detail partly from captain rust partly from dawson 's deputy but chiefly from the lady who fill the star role dawson himself foolishly introduce I to she nearly two year later he do not anticipate that we should become friendly confidential that we should discuss he and he little way over cup of tea make the sweeter by the clandestine nature of we frequent meeting he have not allow for the fascination of the lady -- fascination so alluring that even i a middle-aged father of a family and justice of the peace be instantly reduce by they to the softest moral pulp and he have not allow for the puckish glee with which i welcome the tale roll it round in my wicked fancy and bent its ramification into a orderly narrative \* \* \* \* \* i very vividly remember my first meeting with the lady she come one day a fortnight after i have return from cary 's flat to my neglect duty herald by a short note from dawson i shall be greatly oblige if you will give madame gilbert all assistance in you power she be one of my team that be all but my curiosity be pique i have hear much of dawson 's team of feminine assistant -- rudely call by rival he harem -- and i be eager to meet one of they i order madame gilbert to be admit to my presence she come i see she conquer when i assert that in two minute she have pluck I from my chair of dignity fling I upon the turkey carpet and jump upon I with she daintily shod foot i do not exaggerate she be not very young -- i put she at two or three year over thirty she be or give herself out to be a widow she be a female detective i be a modest gentleman of rigid english respectability not without some matrimonial experience in the way of woman there be nothing in the purpose of she visit to have cause she to come upon I as a venus fully armed and to have force I to a abject surrender from the feather of she black picture hat to the tip of she black velvety shoe she be french-clad the french of pari and wear she clothes like a frenchwoman she be dress -- _ bien habillee bien gantee bien coiffee _ she hair be red copper she skin -- the glad neck of she dress show a lot of it -- have the color and bloom the cream and rose of devon she eye be very large and of a deep violet all these charm of dress and face and color i could have gallantly withstand but the voice of she settle my business at once its rich full tone its soft appealing inflection the pretty foreign accent with which she then choose to speak english -- i can hear they now i have always be sensitive to beautiful voice and madame gilbert 's voice be beyond comparison the most beautiful voice in the wide world madame gilbert make one or two small request to which i give a immediate assent and then she ask I to do something within my power but much against my uncontrolled will madame say i shamelessly as you be strong be merciful let I off as lightly as you can she laugh and eye I with interest my defeat have be with she of course a certainty but perhaps it take place more rapidly than she have expect i have not ask for much say she it be not what you have ask that i fear but what you may ask before i get you out of my room say i she laugh again and let I down very gently i do not tell she more than three secret which i be pledge never to reveal that be all say madame gilbert thank heaven say i on the follow afternoon about four o'clock madame gilbert call again upon I when she card be bring in i tremble and for a moment have in mind to deny myself to she but i thrust away the cowardly thought be brave say i to myself advance boldly attack the terrible delightful siren say no to she once and you will be save she enter and though my knee shudder as i rise to greet she my mien be bold and warlike she warmly squeeze my hand and i return the attention with _ empressement _ for a few minute we exchange polite compliment and then she spring upon I in she tender confident tone a request so preposterous that my rapidly flit courage be stimulate to return be brave i murmured to myself attack boldly say no and you will be save for ever i deeply regret madame say i coldly that it be not possible for I to accede to you wish it be do and i breathe more freely though the sweat break out on my forehead she eye open upon I with the pained surprised look of a deeply disappointed child oh mr copplestone she moan and i think that you be my friend i clutch tightly at the arm of my faithful chair and hold to my program of heroic boldness you should not have ask I such a question you really should not -- you know you should not she eyelid flicker and the violet pool which they uncover glitter with a moisture which be not of tear and she laugh laugh and continue to laugh with the deepest enjoyment i want to see how much you would stand say she at last from that moment she spell over I be break and we become friend i admire she as much as ever but she be no longer the all-devouring siren i could say no to she as easily as to the most dowdy and unbeautiful of female axe-grinder will you permit I to offer you a cup of tea so as to wash from you mouth the unpleasant taste of my brutal refusal i will say madame gilbert graciously we issue from my office and betook ourselves to a pleasant shop where we could drink tea and nibble cake and talk without be overhear madame gilbert i observe have a healthy appetite we talk of ourselves and exchange delicious confidence you have ask I many question i say may i ask one of you what be you you be not english and you be not i think french shall i also learn a lesson from you in unkindness and say ` no ' she inquire but it would be cruel for you have really be quite nice to I i will reveal the secret of my birth she put up one hand and begin to tick off the country which have be privileged to play a part in she origin and education my father be a swede -- one my mother be a irishwoman -- two i be bear at cork in ireland but remember nothing about it for my father die when i be three year old and my irish mother remove instantly to paris -- three by the way i have observe that the irish and the scotch always run away from they own country at the first possible opportunity why be this it be much pleasanter i remark sententiously to sentimentalise over the fringe of the unite kingdom from a safe distance than to live in they oh let I see i have get as far as pari when i be old enough i go to a convent school there i speak french rather better than i do the irish-english which my mother teach I you speak english most charmingly there be about it now a delicate suggestion no more of ireland when you first come to I you accent be distinctly foreign french or italian i be afraid that you be a wicked woman a deceiver and that the fascinating accent be put on for my subdue it be a very pretty accent i have find it most effective say she brazenly when i be eighteen i be marry -- to a italian -lrb- guilbertus -rrb- -- four i should have become a catholic my husband 's faith but for my mother 's protestant-irish prejudice she be of the irish church my husband of the roman so i compromise i join the church of england the high branch you religion be almost as complicate as you nationality yes be not it say she she hand be still uplift she have pause at the fourth finger we live in italy and in france two year ago my husband die and shortly after the war begin my mother die i have a little money i be know to the embassy in pari as one who could pass indifferently as english or french or italian i want to strike a blow for all my country and i be recommend to mr dawson for -- she look round carefully bent she head close to mine and whisper -- the secret service so i come for the first time that i remember to england -- five but what be you i ask with knit brow i be not a international lawyer mr dawson say -- i find that she have a childlike confidence in the redoubtable dawson -- that by birth i be a british subject my swedish father do not count as i never adopt sweden when i come of age my domicile before marriage be france but by marriage i become a italian it be no matter i be of the entente and i do my bit it be not a bad bit sometimes that be the first of many agreeable tea-drinking which madame gilbert and i take together madame gilbert believe herself to be as she put it a woman of surprising virtue and i be by no means sure that she be not right for the do of she bit have lead she into situation from which nothing but the coolest of heart and the quickest of wit could have bring she out untarnished she have play she part gallantly serenely in the service of the alliance i should be a poor creature if i judge she by british provincial standard among other story she tell I the tale which i will repeat to the reader here and there be gap which i have seek diligently to fill up until the whole have be make complete madame gilbert tell to I the most intimate detail without a blush and if in my tell i startle the blood to the cheek of the very oldest of reader the fault will rest with I \* \* \* \* \* i have a notion madame gilbert which i should like you to follow up say dawson he be at that time -lrb- the spring of 1915 -rrb- in he office in london -- he have not yet be despatch on he spacious pilgrimage to the northern shipyard -- and madame gilbert sit opposite to he in a attitude deliberately provocative she sit back in a comfortable chair face the light she leg be cross and she display a great deal more of beautifully round calf and perfectly fitting silk stocking than be usual even in the best society although she do not look at dawson she be fully conscious of the frown glare which he throw at the audacious leg please give I you attention -- if you can i have be out at the front lately at general headquarters to advise upon the means of stop the flow of information from we line to the enemy all the obvious channel have be stop -- the telephone hide in french cellar the signal give by the hand of clock the german spy dress in uniform strip from we dead and so on lot of they all obvious and simple one can deal with that sort of thing by a careful system of unremitting watchfulness we must have catch up with most of the arrangement make by the german before the war but they still get much more information than be good for they to have and for we to lose i be convince -- and ghq agree -- that there be many officer especially in the french and belgian army who be plant there year before the war for the precise purpose to which they be now put even in we own army which be expand so rapidly the same thing be possible even probable a infantry officer spy can do little -- he know nothing of the staff plan and can not get into communication with the enemy at all readily without arouse suspicion i go into the whole thing at the front and i put my finger as i always do upon the danger spot -- the fly corps those who fly constantly over we own and the enemy 's line have complete information as to distribution and movement and if they choose can drop dummy bomb contain news for the enemy to pick up a french belgian or english aeroplane ` observer ' in the enemy 's secret service could convey information to he at pleasure and without the possibility of detection i do not suspect we own fly corps except on the general principle of suspect everybody and everything but i do that of the french and the belgian france and belgium be salt through and through by the german in anticipation of war there in the fly corps we have a very grave danger which -- but i see that you be not attend madame he break off angrily she eye withdraw from the offend leg for a instant and flash at dawson with a penetrative power which even he feel shall i repeat what you have say word for word ask madame gilbert coldly i be not now deal with fact but with conjecture go on dawson after beg she pardon i have nothing to go upon but the german have far more of imagination and ingenuity than we always credit to they they must see that with the great advance in the fly corps of the ally army and the opportunity which fly man have for collect and convey information one fly spy would be worth a hundred spy on foot for they to perceive be to act i therefore conclude positively that they have agent in the fly squadron of france and belgium and possibly even in we own so i tell the c in c and he agree with I he be good enough to say that he would never have think of this have i not suggest it to he soldier be not detective madame and very few detective be william dawson if the war office know its business every assistant provost-marshal would be not a soldier but a man from the yard and i should be the pm in chief on the headquarters staff i should wear a general 's uniform and hat you would look sweet say madame politely dawson the ex-private of red marine swell out he chest and feel himself to be a major-general at the least they will do they best to follow up my idea at the front and i shall start a campaign here for i become more and more convinced that the head center of the german secret service be here in london paris even before the war be too watchful and now be as hot as hell london reek with spy and though we lock up the worst of they when war break out lot still remain if you only know how many we lay by the heel and keep shut up without any trial or nonsense of that sort you would be surprise it be only since the defense of the realm act be pass that england have become a free country we keep a drag-net go continually we have hundred of agent in all suspect quarter but this wilderness of brick and mortar be too big even for we once a enemy agent have get himself into a english or ally uniform he be horribly difficult to run down that be where you and those like you come in be you sure my dear madame that you can pass without detection as a frenchwoman or a french-belgian madame gilbert put up she left hand and begin to tick off she qualification my father be a swede my mother be irish i be educate in france from the age of three to eighteen i marry a italian brussels i know almost as well as dear pari i can be parisienne or bruxelloise -- whichever you wish mr dawson good say dawson what i want of you be this whenever here in london you see a french or belgian officer wear the badge of the fly corps mark he down make he acquaintance somehow you will know how entertain he fascinate he let he entertain you fool he as you would fool I if i let you worm out he secret if he have any if you get upon a promising track go strong let the man make love to you -- he will whoever he be if you give he half a chance -- intoxicate he with those confound eye of yours if you can find only one who be in the enemy 's service you will be fully repay for all you trouble it be a largish contract murmur madame thoughtfully there be not so very many fly officer say dawson and they be all young you will work through they pretty quickly most of they will be the genuine article upon whom you need not waste much time but the other those whom i suspect you must grab hold of and never let go whatever happen i hope say madame primly that you do not expect I to do anything -- improper dawson stare at she in wonder she big eye shine with the lovely innocence of childhood meet he without a flicker bless my immortal soul he mutter she be get at I again then aloud and gravely -- my assistant be always expect to conduct themselves with the strictest propriety madame laugh softly i have know many man in my time mr dawson but i have never enjoy any man so much as i do you i appear to have rather a roam commission madame gilbert go on after a thoughtful pause can you not give I any guidance not at present i be test a idea that be all you must be guide by you own wit and judgment in which i have the utmost confidence do not waste you time or fascination on the wrong people find out if among the french or belgian fly officer who from time to time visit london there be any whose connection and movement will repay close watch here and at the front sift they out when you get upon a track which seem promising follow it up and do not be -- what shall i say -- do not be too squeamish money be no object behind we be the whole british treasury and you can have whatever you want will you take on the contract madame i will do my best she reply soberly and i will not be -- too squeamish i can look after myself my friend in another room of the great building upon the thame embankment sit deputy chief inspector henrus froissart a french detective officer who have be lend to the english service opposite he be sit a young handsome man in the uniform of a captain in the british army froissart be frown and speak in savage disrespect of dawson he immediate chief this english dawson with whom it be my misfortune to work be of all man the most impossible he be clever as the devil but secretive -- my faith he tell I nothing he live in disguise of body and mind there be twenty man in he face he figure and he dress he come to I as a police officer a doctor a soldier a priest even as a old hag who clean the stair he deceive I continually and laugh laugh he be a reproach and a insult i have it in my mind to score off he what do you say mon amus froissart speak in french and the english officer reply in the same language with pleasure in the way of business i have be place at you order not at old man dawson 's go ahead what be the game froissart nod approval i think that you can pass as a french officer or a french-speaking belgian be it not so you should be able to certify that better than i can myself reply the officer modestly as a boy i be bring up at dinard in normandy i serve two year in the french army as a volunteer a gunner then i go to st cyr but england the home of my father claim I and i be give a commission in the artillery that be two year ago i volunteer for the fly corps serve in it at the outbreak of war but be invalide after that confound accident which spoil my nerve i fall two hundred foot into the sea and pass thirty hour in the bitter water before a destroyer pick I up thirty hour my friend my nerve go and i be besides cripple by rheumatism of the heart then i be for a few week liaison officer on the yser at the point where the english and belgian line meet the wet the cold be too great for I and again i be invalide i be a temporary captain without a job until you meet I and ask for I to be attach to you for secret service yes m froissart i can pass as a french or a belgian officer it need but the uniform good cry froissart you be english of the english and french of the french you have serve under the tricolor and under the union jack you be a embodiment of l'entente cordiale you almost reconcile I to that detestable dawson but not quite he be of the provincial english what you call a nonconformist -- bah he be clever but bourgeois he grate upon I for i he subordinate in this service be _ aristocrat _ a count of _ l'ancien regime catholique presque royaliste _ he blood be that of muddy peasant yet he be my chief peste i spit upon the sacred name of dawson you do not seem to be a very loyal subordinate observe the officer smile I not loyal cry froissart astonished i surely be of all man most loyal to l'entente have i not prove my loyalty i have leave my beautiful france and come here to this foggy london to aid this flat-footed _ homme de bout _ dawson in he research yet he tell I nothing he disguise himself before I and laugh laugh when i fail to recognize he filthy obscene countenance but i be loyal of a true loyalty unapproachable i believe you though you have a queer way of show it what be now the game that you want to play off on the old man as a proof of you unapproachable loyalty he be clever my faith clever as the devil he discern the german plan before they be make he have they agent within a wire net which close whenever he wish he have sweep london clean of the foul brood which fester here before the war i have great limitless confidence in this dawson whom i detest but to whom i be of all he assistant the most loyal he now suspect that contain within the fly corps of we the belgian and the english be observer in the pay of germany it be a idea most splendid for if it be true what greater opportunity could be give to any spy to fly over we line to learn of everything and then to convey the news to the enemy by way of the air if he have tell I of this most perspicuous of theory i would have aid he with all the wealth of my genius but no he tell to I nothing he come and go he spin he web like a great fat female spider but he tell I nothing it be my belief that he despise I because i be french _ aristocrat _ and _ catholique _ but i will show he i will as you call it score most bitterly off he i will do in my way successfully what he vainly seek to do in he way _ conspuez _ dawson this be quite like the old time of the dreyfus case say the englishman dreyfus but i will speak not of that it be bury we french be one people now one and indivisible though of traitor the villain dreyfus be of the most horrible let we speak of _ cet homme tre sale _ dawson i do not know he plan they will be shrewd but without imagination without flair he will watch with he eye of a cat the french and belgian fly officer who come to london but he will not discover they secret for he do not understand this cold english dawson that secret which endanger the neck be tell only to woman yet i have hear that he have a team of woman -- he harem as it be call i have never see one of they bah englishwoman of the large foot and the so protrude tooth who would tell of he precious secret to they oh come m froissart we have as many pretty woman in london as you have in pari it be possible my friend all thing the most improbable be possible but they conceal themselves most assiduously i have not see they these so pretty englishwomen well well you be a bit out of date as regard we woman but i do not want to argue what be the game froissart lean forward and speak solemnly forcibly if the man dawson be right and there be german spy in the french and belgian fly service they will come to london to get they order and they will get they from woman depend upon it my friend from woman who be of french education who appear to be french yet who be the deadly the most dangerous enemy of france let dawson watch the man themselves but watch you such woman as i indicate -- woman who appear to be french and yet be not french i will speak to the chief not to dawson but to the great chief of we all you shall be dress in the tenue of a french fly officer you shall avoid french or belgian officer who might ask question the most embarrassing you shall make the acquaintance of woman who appear to be french yet who be not french grip on to these my friend entertain they make yourself of the most fascinating and agreeable give to they attention and love of the warmest and when after two or three glass of champagne you repose at ease with you arm about they waist get you at they secret you be young handsome and you eye be bold i give you a pleasant task -- the deception of deceive woman in my younger day what joy would i not have take in it captain rust become very gloomy during this speech for though french in education he be by instinct a englishman i do not like the business at all it sound mean and grubby ugh not quite what one would ask of a gentleman froissart be genuinely surprised what do you say not for a gentleman be i not a gentleman i who speak a froissart a count of _ l'ancien regime _ a royalist almost i offer you a task which combine business and pleasure in the most delicious of proportion and you call my offer mean and grubby _ meprisable et crotte _ i do not ask you to consort with those of the _ demi-monde _ the woman who be of most danger to we country be not _ courtisane _ they be of the _ monde _ fashionable they meet officer in society they humor and flatter they they display a melting softness of sympathy and interest i do not ask you my friend to endanger you english virtue the tone of wonder contempt with which he end bring a smile to rust 's lip i be not so very virtuous monsieur but i be english and i try vainly perhaps to be a gentleman it seem to I a dirty business to make up to woman in order to wheedle out they secret we have to do worse than that in defense of we country we have to plot and counterplot to lie and deceive but we do these thing and you must do they too if you would be of the secret service content yourself think always that it be for _ la belle france _ or for _ le bel angleterre _ for _ la grande alliance _ you have qualification unusual you be young handsome and french in manner and speech you be a soldier it be for I to command and for you to obey besides think you if success come to we picture to yourself the desolation of dawson desolating dawson be more you fun than mine i have no grudge to work off on the old man since you command i will obey i will do my best but to be quite frank i do not like the job but you will do it i think that you english slow to move do best those thing which you like least you despise the secret service what you call dirty spy yet you do it to admiration -- with a courage and _ sing froid _ most wonderful you hate to begin a war and yet when you fight you be of all people the most unwilling to stop when we french and the russian yonder have sup of this war to the dregs you english will just have begin to find you appetite stop you will cry make peace be content why we have just get we second wind it will be the same with you my friend you begin reluctantly but when the chase become hot you will be on fire with zest you will not trouble then that _ vous vous faite crotte _ i will do my best i can not say more than that chapter x a progressive friendship neither madame gilbert nor captain rust be very communicative concern they adventure until they begin to speak of that day when first they meet one another in the courtyard of the savoy hotel they both then become voluble i rather gather -- though i do not cross-examine they at all closely -- that they have be a good deal bore they instruction be so very vague and the best method of carry they out so far from clear to they ingenious mind that they wander aimlessly about the resort most affect by officer on leave spend much money make a good many pleasant acquaintance but progress not at all in they research madame do not meet with any french or belgian fly officer who seem likely to be german agent and captain rust fail to discover a siren who appear to be french and yet be not french and who arouse any plausible suspicion that she dwell in the central web of german intrigue madame begin to think that for once the impeccable dawson have despatch she upon a wild goose chase and rust become convinced that froissart 's vivid longing to score off the detest dawson have mislead he in the selection of the means to bring about this much-desired consummation they tell I little of these wanderings but when i ask for detail of they first meeting the one with the other and they subsequent rather startling proceedings they break into eager speech it be not until my keen and curious eye begin to penetrate the delicate mystery surround they surprising week-end visit to brighton that rust again become tongue-tied he reprehensibly slur over the most entertaining detail madame gilbert on the other hand reveal everything with that plain-spoken frankness which in any other woman would appear to be brazen madame be thirty-two captain rust no more than twenty-six he be a modest young man in spite of he french training she i be afraid be a hussy but i would not have she other than she be madame gilbert be take tea alone in the courtyard of the savoy she occupy one place at a table lay for four it be a fine afternoon in late spring motor and taxi run in and out unceasingly the open-air restaurant begin to fill up but none venture to approach any one of three empty place at madame 's table she be as usual perfectly dress -- though she assure I that she clothes cost next to nothing it be the wear of they my friend not the cost which count i fancy that she unshakable temper and she gay humor like she beauty be really base as she say upon she complete freedom from ailment she love life and this perhaps be why life love she madame gilbert though to the unobservant eye intent upon she tea and cake see every one who come and go many officer be in the restaurant but one only attract she special notice he be a young handsome man in the field-service kit of the french army and upon he sleeve and cap be the wing of the fly corps this young man be look for a table but could not find one that be empty she wait until he pause not far from she and then sweep she eye slowly over the crowded table bring they to rest upon he face he be quite a attractive-looking young man there be a appeal in he dark eye as they meet hers he be implore she of she gracious kindness to permit he to occupy one of she superfluous seat and she telegraph to he a encouraging reply the french officer approach salute and bow : be it permit madame to inconvenience you he ask humbly the table be very full or i would not venture to intrude he speak in careful accurate english and with a accent markedly french please favor I by sit down at once reply madame i feel myself to be very selfish with my four place and one small person she speak in careful accurate english and with a accent markedly french ah he exclaim seat himself opposite to she and break into french madame be of my country be it not so but certainly say madame in the same language which be to she a second mother-tongue i be of pari if you have not be french i should not have dare to hint to you that a place at this table might be take for a few minute they talk together in the ceremonious style for which the french language be the perfect medium and then drop into more easy friendly speech madame when she like the look of a man become intimate at the shortest notice and rust like every man bear of woman succumb helplessly instantly to the wiles of madame though she have finish tea she urge rust not to be hurry there be plenty of time and one do not often have the happiness to meet a french officer in this dreary london she envelop he in she mesh of kindliness and he respond by think to himself that she be the loveliest most friendly creature whom he have ever meet madame know a great deal more of military detail than most male civilian but when she talk to captain rust at the savoy she ignorance of the fly corps be absolute she ask question quite intelligent question and he bubble over with eagerness to answer they poor rust i can picture the humbling scene he make a ass of himself of course but not a greater ass than i always make of myself -- and i be not far from double he age -- whenever madame get to work upon I within ten minute she have wheedle out of he a account of he accident i be out on patrol duty he explain spot for submarine between the strait and zeebrugge when the weather be fine we can see deep down into the water a hundred foot or so and quite easily make out a submerge u boat i be test a new plane fit with a 90 hp raf engine -- he pause and quickly glance at she for he realize he blunder the instant the slip have be make madame be all eager attention -- what do she know of the marque of aeroplane engine -- it be a day of rotten luck for I i spot nothing and late in the afternoon my engine begin to overheat and miss fire i do my utmost to struggle towards do -- dunkirk but the beastly thing give out altogether and down i drop into the sea i have a ordinary land plane without float and be oblige to cut myself clear and keep up as best i could with my air belt it be a weary time wait to be pick up all that night and all the next day the cold of the water strike right through I and i be senseless like a dead man when at last thirty hour afterwards one of we destroyer find I float there pick I up and carry I into dover i be in hospital for six week cripple with rheumatic fever and my heart go wrong it be much better now and i hope soon to get back to fly again i be still on sick leave poor heart sigh madame and smile to herself he look at I she explain long afterwards as if there be still life in he poor strained heart it be a real kindness to give it some gentle exercise and when you be well you will again fly for france she inquire ah yes i yearn for the day when the obdurate doctor will permit I to fly again -- for france and you madame who be so kind to a poor cripple soldier be it permit to ask -- i be alas a widow she pause and though demurely look at she empty tea cup see he eye light up -lrb- the silly boy be pleased that i be a widow she explain as if that matter -rrb- my poor husband fall for france -- at le grand couronne that be eight month ago and i be still inconsolable i love to meet the brother officer of my dear lose husband he be kill by a shell close beside he general and i do not even know where he be bury she delicately wipe she eye and rust murmured broken word of the deepest sympathy yet he be not sorry to hear that he new friend be a widow it must have be a most pathetic scene madame recover from she sudden rush of grief -- bring on by thought of that unknown grave upon le grand couronne -- and begin to pull on she glove and you my friend she ask gently no one live who will grieve for I he reply sadly you be young my friend and you heart will -- recover itself i be old make old by illness and sorrow she be a picture of glowing health may i ask the name by which i may remember you he be clean bowl for he foolishly have not prepare a plausible name i be call stammer he captain rouille it be the best that he could do on the instant -- the translation of he uncommon english name into french a strange name she murmur though the sound of it be beautiful rouille it signify for the moment the decay of hope a mould of rust obscure ambition but in a little while the steel of you courage will shine bright once more i be madame gilbert my husband be of the territorial army -- a captain also she have think to have make he a colonel on general castelnau 's staff but refrain from so risky a flight of imagination a obscure captain of territorial might well be call guilbert and pass unidentified as they press hand at parting rust hesitate may one hope madame to meet you again you kindness have be great and i feel that i have make a new friend and i also sigh madame i often come here to drink the english tea it be a please custom of london to-morrow he inquire anxiously it be possible reply madame very graciously \* \* \* \* \* well say i when madame have tell I of this meeting i hope that you have the grace to feel ashamed of yourself to deceive a invalided fly officer with you tale of the captain of territorial blow up by a shell beside he general upon le grand couronne it be abominable it be the unknown grave which fetch he say madame cheerfully worse and worse why could you not have tell he the truth because my stupid friend the captain rouille interested I and i be on duty what be a captain in the french fly corps do with a aeroplane drive by a 90 hp royal aircraft factory engine -lrb- raf -rrb- why should he speak of ` we ' destroyer refer to those of the british when he ought to have say the ` english ' destroyer as a french officer would have do why again should he hesitate over he name and then give so impossible a one as rouille no i have discern plainly that m le capitaine rouille whatever he might be be not the man he pretend that he be he speak french perfectly but he be not in the french fly service he be english i recollected my instruction from the great dawson -- to stick to any one who excite my suspicion to let he make love to I if need be and to discover he secret i be my friend a martyr to duty besides le capitaine rouille be a handsome young man very attractive i be not grieve at the thought that he might pursue I with he attention why i ask in turn of rust do you begin by tell lie to the charming madame gilbert i be in french uniform say he and i have to play my part and a nice mess you make of it say i rudely i be afraid that i do that slip about the raf engine be unpardonable but then how be i to know that the dear woman know as much about aeroplane as i do myself she be like desdemona at the foot of othello and of course i lose my head you be as crazy about she as i be with less excuse besides i be on duty before madame have speak to I for five minute i be certain that she be not french she speak perfectly but there be a little accent a delightful accent that tell I she be irish that soupcon of a brogue which give so delicate a spice to she english appear also in she french my mother be a irish woman though i have never live in ireland you know that all the irish especially those of america or of france be watch most carefully by the police many of they hate the english and spy upon we when therefore i perceive that madame though she appear to be french be by birth irish i recollected my instruction from froissart it be my duty to stick to she to study she if necessary to make love to she it do not seem wholly disagreeable to I he add dryly to make love to madame gilbert i forgive you say i though from what i learn you somewhat exceed you instruction \* \* \* \* \* if i be not a most serious writer this veracious history of madame gilbert and captain rust would tend to degenerate into comedy possibly to reach the depths of farce but to one of my grave bent of mind waste deception waste energy and above all waste national money excite rather to tear than to laughter what a spectacle be this which i place before the reader here be two trust member of the english secret service pit against one another those treasure of intelligence wit and sensibility which they be employ -- and pay -- to exercise in the defense of they country it may be concede that one of they be more or less honest rust i be convince have persuade himself -- he have no marked ability or attraction of any kind that i can discern -- that he duty impel he to watch madame with exceed closeness of attention that he strong inclination march with he duty may be allow he as a privilege the plea of duty be not i believe merely a excuse but what can one say in defense of madame one who have store within she little copper-covered head enough brain to furnish a brigade say of the woman 's emergency corps she have perceive that rust be a english officer masquerade as a frenchman yet she could not have think that he be a german spy why do she not ask he point blank what he be do in that galley she have never supply I with a credible explanation she plead with obvious insincerity the instruction of dawson which in the most reprehensible way grant to she the vaguest of rove commission she parade she duty before I in the most tattered of rag upon the follow afternoon when madame gilbert drive up to the savoy in a taxi-cab at half-past four a young man in the uniform of a french officer open the door and hand she out it be of course captain rust who have wait palpitating upon the curb for some three-quarter of a hour he lead she to a small table which he have reserve for another charming duet of tea cake and conversation at this second meeting madame bent herself to the deft cross-examination of rust have the captain rouille join st cyr as a cadet officer or have he serve in the rank of the french army he have serve in the rank and break into detail of he training and garrison service which convince she that he really have serve she become thoughtful rust eager to show off he accomplishment explain that he have be recommend for a commission and have join st cyr more detail follow all of a verisimilitude wholly convincing madame who know france and the french army up and down become more thoughtful and more puzzle it be plain that rust have really serve in the rank of the army and have be at st cyr yet he be a englishman and a officer of the english fly corps she ask further question innocent flattering question seek to discover what have happen to he after he course at st cyr he do he best but he be of inconsiderable agility of mind and deficient in imagination he have be he say with maunoury 's sixth army which emerge from paris in red taxi have fall upon the expose right wing of von kluck he description be accurate enough but the lavish detail of former narrative be lack he have be _ officier de liaison _ on the aisne again the little intimate touch be lack he have join the fly corps but omit to explain how he have learn to fly it have be at farnborough but he could hardly admit this and be unhappily quite ignorant of the french fly grounds madame 's quick mind begin to see daylight how come it my friend that you be fly upon the coast when you suffer that accident so terrible and paralyse that poor brave heart of yours madame ask the question in the most natural sympathetic way it be a facer for rust who regret that he have be so communicative at that first meeting i be lend to the naval wing he explain and avoid to particularise by this time madame have sort out he service she be quite sure that he have not be with maunoury or upon the aisne but that in some manner as yet not clear he have leave st cyr to pass into the english army when in he turn rust seek diffidently to penetrate the mystery surround madame gilbert she overflow with untruthful particulars she resemble she master dawson in this -- it be unwise to believe one word which she wish you to believe of she early life in paris she speak with emotion she be the beloved only child of a french doctor -- ah the most learn and pious of man he die early smitten by disease contract during he gratuitous practice amongst the friendless poor a most noble parent she mother too a saint and angel have go aloft shortly after see she daughter madame happily marry to a maker of calorifere -lrb- anthracite stove -rrb- i be unworthy of those so noble parent wail madame in broken tone it be not until they be about to separate that madame gilbert herself throw he a bone of truth design to test he appetite for curiosity i must fly exclaimed she i be a woman _ tre occupee _ i work oh so very hard for my belle france and to avenge the death of my glorious husband the blown-up stove maker do not seem to rust to be a figure of glory yet he force himself again to express the deepest sympathy yes go on madame i would avenge he i work -- she glance round cautiously and then whisper -- i work for the _ gouvernement anglai _ i be a _ agent de police _ be you not rather rash i ask of madame gilbert to give yourself away so completely he might not have be so thorough a ass as you think my friend say madame calmly i have take tea with he twice and have satisfy myself that he be not what you call very bright a dear fellow handsome a gentleman of the english pattern but not bright if i have not help he to get a move on i might have lunch with he have tea dine with he attend theater traverse in motor you pleasant countryside flirt until i have become a very old woman and there would have be nothing to show for all my exertion i remember the instruction of mr dawson i recall to myself my duty i be compel to discover who and what be this capitaine rouille and i could only succeed by force he to reveal himself -- to give himself away when i say that i be a agent of the english police he do not believe I but he be curious -- he watch I i give he much to watch and to imagine that he have discover then one begin to get forward \* \* \* \* \* i be ignorant of the diplomatic pourparler which lead up to the week-end trip to brighton that remarkable trip which end _ l'affaire _ rust it must have be plan by madame it bear the unmistakable imprint of she impish wit it be too a bold development of she design for the effective speeding up of rust he would have dally all through the summer look feebly for a opportunity to ravish a despatch-case which always accompany madame and which have become the inseparable and ostentatious gooseberry at they meeting madame declare that it be stuff with papers the most secret the english government would be desolate if they pass for one moment out of my hand this despatch-case play part quite human it be perpetually provocative of rust 's curiosity and a reminder that the agreeable pastime of make love to madame be not a end in itself but a mean whereby he might discharge he official duty it be moreover a visible sign that madame be a woman _ tre occupee _ and a self-styled _ agent de police _ it rest always silent at she side as a protector of innocence rust become uneasy when that case be mention but madame bubbles over at the thought of she _ petite chere portefeuille cette idee de genie _ she brag of she genius of she notion _ si lumineuse _ of she _ guet-apen si adorable _ while madame must have plan the brighton trip she contrived that the suggestion should come timidly deprecatingly from rust she would have scorn so crude a advance one too fall so far short of she high standard of womanly virtue as a direct hint that she be willing to pass three day in a seaside hotel with a young man _ mai non ce serait une betise incroyable _ i can imagine she hint increase in strength as she beat against the obtuse heaviness of rust 's intellect but i can not imagine how any one least of all the brilliant froissart should have conceive that lumpish soldier to be capable of the finesse needful for the secret service he have since be return empty and i do not wonder at it madame must have lament the stuffiness of london during the bright day of early June and paint in she enthusiastic french fashion a picture of southern england and the glittering channel _ ma foi mon ami _ what would i not give for one hour of peace and rest away from this swarm hive of man and woman it be as yet too cold to swim in that sea which wash the shore of my beautiful france -- and bear the so gallant english soldier to she help -- but i would love to sit upon the sand and gaze gaze across the water towards my poor bleeding land but alas i be a woman _ tre occupee _ after a great deal of this sort of thing rust be spur up to suggest that he also be weary and that nothing could be more delightful than to sit beside madame upon those sand and to bewail with she the woe of they common country the idiot do not reflect that a woman of madame 's taste in dress do not usually mess up she pari frock with nasty sea sand madame sigh it be a charming picture but alas quite impossible rust still further spur by madame -- le capitaine rouille be not very bright -- at last break into a proposal deliver with many hesitation and many apology why should not they travel to brighton on the Friday evening and draw solace for they weary soul from a Saturday Sunday and possibly Monday at brighton madame become a frozen statue of offended womanhood what _ mon dieu _ have she do that he should conceive she to be a light woman she the never-to-be-comforted widow of the incomparably gallant hero of anthracite stove and le grand couronne she have be too unsuspicious too trustful they pleasant acquaintance must end upon the instant the too-gross insult which he have put upon she could never be pardon rust be bear away and overwhelm in the flow of she sad reproach abjectly he grovel : he regard the ineffable madame guilbert as a light woman perish the thought he to whom she have be a angel of kindness and discretion he cast a slur upon the shine brightness of she reputation rust have never in he life be so eloquent madame listen with satisfaction she might in time after long year forgive he but not yet the insult however unintended be too fresh and she heart be desolate she scorch and scarify rust during two whole day for they meeting continue unbroken and

grandly le capitaine guilbert have leave he honor and i will guard it with my life alas what be my life when my heart be bury in that lonely grave upon le grand couronne in which i pray rest he much-blown-up body i myself will devise the means by which i can grant you a mark of my condescending forgiveness and preserve _ san reproche _ the honor of a guilbert i confess that i have draw upon my imagination for most of this touching scene but know madame as i do i be sure that i have give the hang of it chapter xi at brighton madame gilbert and captain rust travel to brighton on the Friday evening in the pullman train they occupy different carriage they hotel one of those face the sea which wash the far-off shore of they beloved bleeding france have be select by madame -- i desire a hotel my friend not a _ caravanserai _ madame arrive ten minute before rust and have disappear within she own _ appartement _ when he cab drive up to the door rust then book he room one upon the

french ah monsieur le capitaine say she beam caress upon he with what joy do i perceive the _ tenue de campagne _ of my own army i will gladly grant to you one of the room of the very best and at the price of the lowest the patron he also be french and would be furious if i do not give the most cordial welcome to a _ officier francai _ rust thank the lady of the bureau and heartily approve madame 's choice of a hotel one moment if you please say i to madame who supply I with these detail i perceive that both the room yours and rust 's be upon the second floor be it in this way you shameless woman that you preserve from reproach the honor of the late imaginary stove man madame sigh and turn upon I the look which in my mind i have label innocence unjustly traduce one of these day with german thoroughness i shall prepare a number and annotated catalogue of madame gilbert 's look and tone though it can not teach she sex anything which the youngest member do not already know it will be full of valuable instruction and warning for the innocent male be i responsible wail madame for the allotment of room by _ hotelier _ most certainly i say severely i do not know you method it be not give to man to penetrate the unfathomable duplicity of woman but i be convince that have you wish it you would have be place _ a premier _ and rust consign to the uttermost cock-loft in the roof madame and rust dine that first evening at separate table but discover in one another old friend when they accidentally meet afterwards in the lounge what happiness can it indeed be le capitaine rouille the friend closer than a brother of my poor slay husband madame guilbert can it be you whom i meet thus unexpectedly you whom i have not see since that dreadful never-to-be-forgotten day upon which i break to you the news the terrible news -- rust 's voice fail even madame who think little of he ability admit that he perform on this occasion to admiration the rencontre be a most affect one conduct in voluble french in the full blaze of publicity in a crowded hotel lounge the english audience be impressed and honestly sympathetic we insular reserve have be melt in the fire of war it be a french lady poor thing who have lose she husband they whisper the one to another and that handsome fellow in ordinary evening-dress be she man 's brother officer who be with he at the last and who bring the sad news to she how sweet she look and how tenderly sympathetic he be the eye of the man have already be draw to madame 's royal beauty and those of the woman to she dress a masterpiece of paquin now that she have meet rust the man be sorrowful regret a vanish opportunity of make she acquaintance and the woman be relieved she be too formidable a rival to be at large alone and unattended but now she would be monopolise naturally and properly by she good-looking compatriot so when madame and rust slip away to a corner of the lounge kindly eye follow they and the voice of the censorious have no excuse to be raise you be a wonder madame whisper rust and you my friend do not so badly reply madame in frank approval they separate early that evening for madame who know not what it be to feel really tired shammed fatigue as a reason for retire betime to she come marie a little dark french _ femme de chambre _ of the second floor implore to be allow to assist at the night toilet of a desolate widow of france while marie brush out the long rich copper hair the two chatter unceasingly of france and the army of steel-hearted poilus which hold the frontier of civilisation away yonder in picardy artoi champagne and the vosge marie herself have a man out there of whose welfare she have hear nothing since the war begin she have receive no letter and the french publish no casualty list _ mon cher petit homme est mort madame c'est certain mais j' espere toujors _ there be many many frenchwoman to whom the death of they loved one be certain though they hope always i feel rather a pig talk fib to the poor girl confess madame madame gilbert have make she plan with thoughtful care and propose to carry they out with hardihood she have determine to work so adroitly on the Saturday upon the curiosity and poor strained heart of rust that he would be speed up to run big risk he do not know that however judiciously frail she conduct might be she be a very dragon of virtue in defense of she honor i give my heart say she to I quite seriously to the signor guilbertus one far far different from _ le marus imaginaire _ of le grand couronne until if ever i give my heart again no man shall possess I i play i kiss i philander -- as you call it -- but what be these trifle _ des bagatelles rien de tout _ he do not realize she serene indifference to the small change of love and she respect for its true gold but i do not think that rust when madame consent to be he companion at brighton seriously misjudge she motive he do not know of course or in the last degree suspect that she design he capture as a professional victim again and again she have tell he that she be a agent of the english police and again and again as she intend he have disbelieve she she be so incomparably he intellectual superior that she could make he believe or disbelieve precisely as she choose she make he think that she have come to brighton for companionship and as a proof of she kindly forgiveness of a grave indiscretion he believe for never be rust even rust so idiotic as to suppose that she have succumb before he charm and have come to throw herself into he arm but for the machination of madame the visit would i be sure have pass without incident rust would not have lose he turnip of a head he would out of loyalty to he order from froissart have try to grab the despatch-case and ravish its secret but he would not have do what he do at the risk of compromise the bloom of she so precious reputation if she have not deliberately work he up to do it therefore while i acquit rust of evil intention my reproof my grave reproof -- at which she laugh and snap she finger -- be reserve for that unscrupulous madame at breakfast madame gilbert and captain rust find that a private table a table of the best in a bay window face the sea have be reserve for they by order of the patron the news of they pitiful rencontre in the lounge have speed to he ear he have weep copiously before he sympathetic staff and declare that the bereaved widow and the so gallant captain should lack for nothing in he hotel if it be not that i fear to offend they delicacy i would refrain from present to they _ l'addition _ make i pray you _ mademoiselle du bureau _ they charge of the lowest he be a most noble patron the path of the wicked be thus make smooth by the english guest by the entire staff it be consider inevitable indeed highly become that madame and rust should devote themselves wholly to one another have they embrace in public and weep many time a day upon one another 's neck the staff -- half of which be french -- would have deem the exhibition most seemly and fitting and the english though embarrassed would not have be censorious by so much have war bring to we a understanding of the simple honest heart of we closest ally in cease to be insular we be cease to worship we wooden conventional god madame who as i have before remark say the most frightful thing in she soft musical voice regard one the while with frank steady eye comment thus upon the attitude of _ le patron _ and he assistant towards they they wrap we about so thoroughly in they tender sympathy that nothing which we have choose to do in mutual consolation could have shock they i do not propose to weary the reader by detail at length the progress of madame 's Saturday campaign she method of offence will by now have become clear to the suffocating gas of she smile and the liquid fire of she eye she have add the devastating tank -- she despatch-case she work its mystery unceasingly when it be not under she own hand it repose -- during meal time for example -- in the steel safe of _ le patron _ all except one paper of the most thrilling importance which never leave she person this small unobtrusive paper upon which accord to madame the destiny of nation depend be hide always -- happy paper -- in the bosom of she corset do she not inquire rust greatly daring find it rather hard and scratchy to he its resting-place seem too delicate a spot to be use as a general store madame frown at the allusion to so intimate a topic and rust terrify implore she pardon which be graciously vouchsafe you should not _ mon amus _ speak to I as if i be that which you once think I -- a light woman she reduce he nearly to tear and then in kindly consolation permit he to hold she hand both as a pretended french officer and as a english agent of the secret service rust be the most derisory of fraud during the day the pair of plotter be inseparable and madame play continually with unfailing deftness upon the two string of rust 's poor heart and of he intense curiosity which she clearly perceive though she do not know it to be professional when the heart swell with stimulate emotion and rust begin to show inconvenient fondness madame would frown reproof and lead the despatch-box into action very often she would carry she hand to that pleasant spot where nestle the paper of so great international importance and she would speak of it and of the terrible responsibility which rest upon she as a secret _ agent de police _ when i carry a document such as this she would say one _ pour faire les boches se crever _ it never leave my bosom all the day and rest under my pillow by night under my pillow _ mon amus _ she dwell upon that pillow and raise in the mind of rust a charming vision of a white lace-edged surface upon which be spread out a lovely disorder of red copper hair she so work upon he that he emotion and he duty become inextricably mixed somehow he must secure that paper and solve the baffling problem of the wonderful widow who appear to be french and yet be not french he brain by itself could not have conceive of a means but madame assist to stimulate its imagination as she have do the beating of he heart it be wrong of you _ mon ami _ she say in gentle reproof to select a room upon the same floor as mine it be a proceeding bold and not a little indelicate which might have compromise my precious reputation have i not be secure in the honor of my poor lose captain guilbert rust protest that he have leave the choice of room entirely to the lady of the bureau but madame 's smile show that she be wholly sceptical i speak frankly to you say she so that there may be no longer in you mind any thought that i be a woman of light conduct i have come here drive by you sad pleading to give you of my companionship and my heart would be desolate if i think that you still misjudge I the beautiful voice shake and i do not doubt that the violet eye glisten with pumped-up tear be raise to rust 's face i she friend know that she can feel deeply and i can distinguish that which she simulate from that which move she but the poor creature rust be in she hand the most helpless and delude of victim so the day pass they lunch together and dine together in the interval they walk upon the sunny front for the weather be perfect and the sun shone as it only shine at brighton madame i be quite sure do not sit upon the sand it appear also that they visit a succession of picture house madame declare that she be fascinate by this form of entertainment the variety and rapid movement delight she -- as i admit they do my dull self -- and she deeply enjoy the blatant crudity of cinematic drama it be so entirely unlike life that it transport one to another world say she here in this strange visionary world of the picture one live in a maelstrom of emotion boy and girl meet embrace and marry all within the space of a few minute upon the screen and of a hour or two of dramatic action child be conceive and bear by some lightning process which it would be a happiness for the human kind to learn hero die while strong man bare they head in grief and ten minute later the corpse be caper joyously in a new piece by attend three or four house in one afternoon one sup upon emotion and feed without restraint upon rich satisfying laughter yes _ mon ami _ i love the cinema rust do not i think greatly interest himself in the picture but be happy in the darkness -- hold my hand she laugh as i break into growl be it not _ mon cher _ she go on that the cinema will always be most popular -- however dull may be the picture -- so long as boy and girl man and woman who love desire to fondle one another 's hand in the dark you and rust do not love one another i grunt no we be not the real thing but we make ourselves into quite a plausible imitation madame pursue she program with indefatigable ardor and patience she impress again and again upon rust 's imagination a picture of herself sleep unprotected in a room not far distant from he own while beneath she pillow repose a paper precious and mysterious beyond word to describe she even hint that a dread of fire from which she always suffer when sleep at hotel forbid the lock of she door i be not afraid to die say she for what have i to bind I to life now that i can never visit the spot where repose the shatter fragment of my beloved capitaine guilbert but to be burn helpless while rescue be cut off from I by a lock door i shrink from so terrible a fate subtlety she have discover be throw away upon the obtuseness of rust she be compel to be brutally plain and so she drive into he thick head the tempting fact that nothing interpose during the hour of darkness between he eager hand and the paper which she have teach he to covet if she awake and mistake he motive -- if she think that he have venture into she room with design upon she honor -- rust feel sure that she kind heart would forgive he by breakfast-time though she would certainly dismiss he from she bedside with the most haughty of reproach if he could not find some other way before they separate for the night he have almost decide to essay the venture she sleep very soundly say madame she have not awaken in she _ appartement _ in pari upon one night when a bomb from a prussian aeroplane have explode within two hundred yard of she house another way be still possible and rust while he be dress for dinner determine to try it it be a way too which thrill he with pleasurable anticipation at dinner madame decline champagne which she say be a poor feeble drink let they for once share a bottle of sparkling burgundy a royal wine the wine of courage the patron bring they the bottle himself and lament that they would not indulge themselves in a second madame have no desire that rust should under its influence become too enterprising the evening be warm and afterwards they move into the pleasant garden behind the hotel and sit together in a quiet corner other guest be in the garden but it have become tacitly agree among they that madame and rust -- the dear french thing -- should be permit to console one another in seclusion no one could perceive that the black-sleeved arm of rust have find a happy resting-place around madame 's black-covered waist or that she glowing head be not far from he shoulder she pari evening frock be cut low though never by the fraction of a inch would madame permit she _ couturier _ to exceed the limit of perfect taste look down over she shoulder rust could see protrude from the white lace below she bodice the corner of a paper she talk little it seem to give she pleasure to lean against he shoulder and dreamily half asleep to rest there reposefully like a tired child but _ mon ami _ say madame to I in relate these tender detail with the greatest satisfaction i be very wide awake indeed rust eye that corner of paper and wait without speak until he companion should become almost unconscious of he movement then gently he move he right arm from she waist and place it over she shoulder she move slightly but it be only to nestle more closely against he he dangling finger move little by little towards the opening of she corsage they descend and with he thumb and forefinger he grip the paper madame do not move she body nor to rust do she seem to suspect he intention but she right arm lift slowly up she gently grasp he hand in hers press it kindly for a moment and then still hold it remove he arm from she shoulder to she waist you coat sleeve scratch my shoulder she murmur rust who have instantly release the paper when madame take he hand never again get a opportunity of touch it for she keep she arm press over he during the whole time that they sit together i give he the chance explain madame to I and it work beautifully but once be enough from that moment i become really suspicious of rust before i have only be puzzle what he be i could not guess but i be dead set on find out before the night be over till then i have allow only little freedom but when i rise to go into the hotel and he bent over I i let he kiss I on my lip it be a severe disappointment that kiss add madame contemplatively spare I the loathsome detail say i crossly when at last madame gilbert go to she room she be smile gaily and show no sign of fatigue at the tiresome exercise of the day though it be approach midnight the faithful marie be wait to assist she toilet ah madame sigh marie in she frank parisienne fashion le capitaine be so beautiful and devoted he regard you as one who would devour i marvel that you have the heart to separate from he marie say madame laugh you be a naughty girl a corrupter of my youthful moral i be afraid that _ le bon capitaine _ must go hungry for -- and then she prance off upon that wearisome old story about the blown-up territorial bear of _ le grand couronne _ fidelity to the scatter corpse of a husband -- _ un marus assommant mon dieu pas un amant joyeux _ -- seem to marie the most waste of emotion she in common with all the other frenchman and woman in the hotel be a ardent partisan of captain rouille if my bell ring in the night come quickly marie say madame as she dismiss the girl i shall need you _ a la grande vitesse _ madame slip the seductive paper and something else under she pillow see that the electric and the light switch be close to she hand upon the bedside table and snuggle down contentedly the trap be set and bait she murmur i hope that the bird will not keep I wait a hour pass slowly rust have tell I little of he feeling but admit that he be in the devil of a funk he have determine to make a daring shot at the paper and the solution of madame 's identity but he shiver at the prospect of she wrath should she awake and catch he in the act she would have think the worst of I and like you copplestone i cherish she beautiful friendship as the most precious of privilege on my honor i be only after the paper madame find the wait time very tedious but i be sure that she pulse do not quicken by a beat she have a wonderful nerve at one o'clock when the hotel be very quiet and the boot-cleaner have make he round of collection madame hear the handle of she door move and the door itself push slowly open through she partly close eye she see the momentary flash of a electric torch with which rust take he bearing and then she feel rather than saw or hear a figure draw gently towards she bed she right hand be under the pillow grasp that something not the paper which she have lay there in readiness rust approach bent over she and he finger feel for the pillow they touch she hair and she know that the moment for action have come out stretch she arm hold the pistol well clear of he body for she be loath to hurt he and a sharp report within a couple of foot of he side frighten rust more thoroughly than have the hottest of crump in flander he spring away and dart for the door but in a instant the light go up and a loud commanding voice -- utterly unlike madame 's soft musical social tone -- call to he to halt halt cry madame in english right about turn ` shun the familiar word of command bring he round in prompt obedience and there before he he see madame gilbert sit up in she bed point a most business-like automatic pistol straight for he heart she hand hold it true without a quiver and along the sight glitter a eye remorseless as blue steel this be a woman wholly different from that kindly yield creature whom he have embrace and kiss a couple of hour earlier you will please stand quite still say madame speak the slightly tinged irish-english of she birth for if i shoot le capitaine rouille will be no more see upon my dressing-table behind you be a small vase support a rose i will cut off its stem she quickly move the pistol and fire you may turn round he obey and see that the vase be unbroken but that the rose cut

and streaming down the front of she dainty nightdress appear in action even more lovely than in repose the first to arrive be marie then follow another _ femme de chambre _ then come the night porter then the boot-collector last with eye open wide at the surprising spectacle of a beautiful young woman receive she lover at the point of a pistol appear _ monsieur le patron _ himself they cluster in a group by the door i think say madame serenely that we have enough marie the house be full shut the door and lock it the order be obey now go on the commanding voice from the bed use french for the effective shut out of the english boot-cleaner and night porter if you man will turn you back and marie will hand I my dressing-gown i will prepare myself for the examination of monsieur le capitaine

she have suggest -- bring the silk dressing-gown and robed madame who skip out of bed for the purpose then the fair _ juge d'instruction _ wrap to the neck in blue silk and look prettier than ever prop herself upon the pillow and open the court captain rouille order she in french please tell these other why you come to my bedroom i regret to record that marie and the other girl look towards one another and snigger the patron lift up he hand in amazement _ mon dieu _ what a question the two english servant do not understand french rust say nothing madame who have observe the excusable misunderstanding of she french audience condescend to explain i be sure she say that captain rouille will not suggest that he visit be design to attack my honor _ quelle dame extraordinaire _ moan the patron _ c'est incroyable la sangfroid de celle-la _ of course not cry rust speaking for the first time never would i have dare to think of such a thing madame gilbert be a lady of the highest virtue it be not to compromise she that i enter she room the man groan the patron be no less extraordinary than the woman why in god 's name this pistol this scene so public they be lover beyond doubt yet they spring upon my hotel this scene of the most scandalous it be not the way of france i do not understand such going on madame draw a paper from she bed and hold it up be it for this that you come yes say rust for that and that only _ un billet doux _ say the patron playing without design the part of a bewildered chorus why should not madame have give it to he if she wish to write that which she be too modest to say why do you want it what more natural cry the patron than that the brave captain should be eager to read the sweet confession of you love madame miss not a word which dribble from the lip of the poor puzzle patron who contribute the comic sauce which titillate she humorous palate the patron to she be a sheer joy why do you want it repeat madame sternly because say rust you say that it contain the most important of secret what have you to do with secret which concern the fate of nation at war nation war mutter the patron what word be these to find upon the lip of lover by now they should have they not both be quite mad have forget war in they mutual embrace rust be silent consider what he should say he have not the wit to invent a plausible story and to such man there be only one safe rule -- when in doubt tell the truth he tell the truth i want that paper because i be a member of the secret service of germany snap madame flash violet lightning from she eye sensation the two french woman break into scream of rage dreadful to hear the patron raise he clenched hand and roar like a furious beast rust a brave man shrink for a long startled moment he flesh

_ menteur espion _ foul seducer of a desolate _ veuve de france _ die traitor madame raise you pistol shoot -- shoot instantly for the honor of france the man a fat comfortable bourgeois be transfigure with frightful murderous rage he have become a figure almost heroic but madame do not shoot in ten seconds she swift brain have recall the whole series of incident during she commerce with rust she penetrate to the heart of the mystery and immediately become convinced that he speak the truth no say she _ monsieur le patron _ and you _ me demoiselle _ cease you cry you do the brave capitaine rouille a very grave injustice for which you must pray he forgiveness _ sur le champ _ he be a soldier of france and of we noble ally the english he be a officer of the english secret service the mistake be mine for which _ mon capitaine _ i implore you pardon she lay back in she bed and the laughter pour out of she in one unbroken flood she laugh until she become weak as a baby for the idiotic comedy which they two have play -- at the expense of the british treasury -- be beyond any other means of expression rust who begin to grasp something of the truth also break into a laugh and the amusement of the principal bring instant conviction to the audience the repentance of those who have thirst for rust 's blood a moment since be very pleasant to witness the woman beg permission to kiss he brave hand which have slay the foul boche and the patron cast he burly person upon rust 's pyjama-clad bosom and salute he on both cheek he have a stiff hard beard and now cry the patron this scene so deplorable and scandalous be happily end we beautiful madame and the brave captain they mistake and misunderstanding remove be again lover of the fondest let we go my friend and leave they to forgive one another as they will desire to do in decent privacy _ allon allon vite _ he drive away the boot-collector and the night porter who have not understand one word of the quick french which have be speak they explain the scene satisfactorily to themselves by the one word french the woman would also have go if madame who be still laugh have not hastily recall marie marie she whisper splutter with cheerful impropriety lead that captain away and lock he into he room or my reputation be go for ever take rouille away and then leave I for i want to laugh and then to sleep but rust blush deeply at the preposterous closing of the scene have sneak quietly out of the room \* \* \* \* \* they meet at breakfast without embarrassment at least madame be perfectly tranquil i can not answer so surely for rust in the eye of the little world of the hotel nothing have be change they retain they assume character as a widow and soldier of france who consort with the freedom of old friend so say madame when all have be explain you be put on by we dear fiery froissart and i by the dear secretive dawson we blunder up against one another and the rest follow naturally you be such a one as i look for and i be of the kind picture by the imaginative froissart it have all be most amusing especially when one reflect that the english government have pay for all we delightful lunch tea dinner and motor run i doubt though whether we can with easy conscience send in the bill for this week-end no we will divide the cost between ourselves for i be sure that you will refuse to be my guest all i ask be that you do not cut we holiday the shorter on account of what have pass not by a hour reply madame heartily i like you captain rust we will enjoy ourselves to-day as colleague _ en vacance _ and to-morrow we will report at headquarters we will leave dawson and froissart to sort out the responsibility for the whole comedy it have be a most please experience never shall i forget that scene of last night and the bewilderment of the poor patron he comment be a delight and the conclusion be so purely french in its artless conception that i feel for you innocent blush the patron be the limit mutter rust flushing deeply he be and yet no one could convince he that the reconciliation so desire by he be not the most natural and decorous for we i be still sore with excessive laughter again and again in the night i wake up and simply bellow the Sunday be again a very fine day and rust speak of it still with enthusiasm madame reveal herself to he no longer as the seductive siren but as a true-hearted colleague and helper he see she not only as a beautiful and most compelling fascinator before whom he have grovel but as a big-brained and big-souled friend she be the only woman whom i have ever meet with whom i would go tiger-shooting say rust to I i will accept that one sentence as he consider verdict no greater tribute could be pay by a man to a woman at first he do not fully grasp that the madame of that Sunday the real madame be wholly different from the one he have know before as they sit together upon the cliff towards rottingdean he slip he arm about she waist gently but very decidedly she remove it no _ mon amus _ say she all that have pass with the necessity for its exercise i do not play with my friend thank you reply he -- it be the brightest speech which madame have record of he there be hope that rust will with year and experience develop in intelligence when madame return to london on the Monday she seek a audience of chief inspector dawson and tell the whole story he be not pleased but handsomely concede that she have carry out she duty with skill and enterprise the farce be not you fault say he it be entirely due to that french ass froissart who have no right to play game of he own without consult I i will make a protest to the chief do not do that urge madame froissart be rather a dear and you know that the fault be partly yours for not take he into you confidence i have determine to cultivate froissart and shall endeavor to persuade he that you feminine assistant be not all of microscopic intelligence and of repulsive appearance you will succeed say dawson handsomely froissart to whom rust report glean some consolation from the failure of he agent this wonder of a woman of whom i must instantly make the honorable acquaintance have save the detest dawson from the deep of humiliation but we have score off he most surely he have show himself to be a blundering conceit english pig and i will protest to the chief that never again must he keep I in ignorance of he project i shall laugh at he all we people here will laugh i shall be revenge _ conspuez _ dawson do not be too hard on dawson urge rust madame gilbert think a lot of he and would be pained if he suffer discredit through any fault of hers fault shout the gallant froissart _ la belle madame _ be _ san faute _ peerless a prodigy of skill and discretion she be superb if she implore I to spare the man dawson then i will consent though my heart be rent in fragment as for you _ mon ami _ i fear that in she hand you be not a figure of admiration she twist you about she pretty finger like a skein of wool i do not think that you be what you call cut out for the secret service that be quite my own opinion assent he gloomily part iii _ to see be to believe _ chapter xii dawson prescribe the mind of dawson have the queerest limitation he be entirely free from any sense of proportion if i write of those incident which he press upon I this book would be intolerably dull he see no interest in any episode which be not dawson dawson all the time the emotion which be arouse in the heart of cary and myself by trehayne 's letter cause dawson no small anxiety he fear lest in render this episode i should turn the limelight upon trehayne and leave the private of marine in the shadow which be precisely what i have do from he sick bed he send I a letter explain that he own honorable weakness of sympathy with a enemy spy be physical not moral -- reprehensible fail induce by lack of sleep he labor to convince I that the spirit of dawson in the full flush of health be of a frightfulness wholly prussian in its logical completeness but i smile go my own way and dawson when he come to read this book can swear as loudly as he please if i have depend only upon dawson i should never have secure the detail of the story which i be about to write it be froissart who first put I upon the track of it during one of those visit which i pay to he when i be investigate _ l'affaire _ rust froissart in imaginative insight be as much superior to dawson as the average frenchman be to the average englishman but in execution he admit sorrowfully that he can not hold a candle to he brutal secretive english chief i have genius exclaim froissart of which the sacred dog dawson have not a particle i know not whence come he idea the most penetrative it can not be from _ son esprit _ of which he have none he brain repose without doubt in he stomach yet _ ma fous _ that man whom i detest and to whom i be a colleague most loyal be of a practical ingenuity most wonderful do you ever learn how he hide the great cruiser _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ from the watch eye of the boche and win here in england a glorious victory for the english navy eight thousand mile away i be with he and at the end fall upon he bosom in generous admiration i kiss he on both cheek and what be my reward it be to receive a short-arm blow upon the diaphragm that man of mud take my wind as he call it and i be lay gasp upon the floor it be in this fashion that he repulse I -- I a count of _ l'ancien regime _ i could have he blood i soothed froissart and extract enough from he in rapid french spasm -- he idiomatic staccato french be often beyond my understanding -- to give I a general idea of what dawson have do thereafter i pursued my inquiry pump dawson himself -- who for some reason do not greatly value the affair -- tackle other who know more than they be always willing to tell even to I they friend yet in many way of which it be well not to be particular i arrive at the full story which i now tell to my mind it show dawson at he best and dawson 's best be very good indeed \* \* \* \* \* it be early

between whom and he chief be a very close friendship i suppose i must toddle round and see what the little man want this time last month he have secret wireless installation on the brain dawson find the first lord stride up and down he big room all round the wall be set great map bristle with pin to which be attach number label each pin represent a ship and each ship be obedient to a order flash from the big aerial overhead here be the holy of holy the nerve ganglion of the english navy and here stride up and down the man who could jab the nerve-centre with he finger whenever he please he often pleased then he would gloat over the pin as they skip about the map chief inspector dawson be announce and stand to attention ha cry the first lord so you be dawson the master of spy we need you dawson the country need you i need you you have a great chance this day to show you quality dawson those of whom i approve i advance they become great man be i to approve of you dawson observe that he could not well say until he learn what be want of he ha cry the first lord again you be a man of few word i like those with I who do not talk when there be talk to be do -- well i can do a little in that line myself among my instrument i demand silence dawson say nothing the first lord strike a bell a servant in blue uniform appear will you please tell he lordship that chief inspector dawson be here and that i await he presence the man retire and presently return he lordship be in he room make out the order for the fleet he bid I say that he be quite at you service the first lord flush and glance hurriedly at dawson who stand at attention stolid silent immovable it would seem that he read nothing in the message the mountain be old and stiff in he joint remark the first lord playfully when he settle into he chair it would take a bomb to lift he out we be young and active we must consider the infirmity of age mahomet will go to the mountain and you will please to follow mahomet swing he long coat-tail stride out of the room and down a passage whence they emerge into another room also set about with pin-studded map ha say the first lord as you would not come to we we have unbent we dignity and come to you this be chief inspector dawson so i suppose growl the grizzled old man who sit at a big desk upon which be pile many flimsy it be the great lord jacquetot who for all he french name be english of the english will you explain to mr dawson what we want of he or shall i inquire the first lord lord jacquetot rise from he chair show nothing of the infirmity of age he approach dawson look over he keenly and say you do not look like a civilian policeman where have you serve dawson explain that he have in former day be a red marine i think as much say jacquetot there be no mistake the back and shoulder of they once a pongo always a pongo he hold out he hand which dawson shake diffidently a ex-private of marine do not often shake the hand of a first sea lord lord jacquetot walk over to one of the map and beckon to dawson to follow the first lord hover in the background ready to put in a word at the first opportunity there have be a serious naval disaster in the south sea say jacquetot and we must clean up the mess pretty damn quick the news come yesterday order be wire at once that two battle-cruiser the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ should be send at full speed from scotland to devonport to dock coal and complete with store to keep they outside the enemy 's observation and to avoid any risk of mine or submarine in the irish channel they have be send far out round the west coast of ireland here they be we get message from they every hour he indicate two pin just then a messenger enter and hand to the first sea lord a wireless flimsy jacquetot read it slip a scale along the map take out the two pin and shift they further south they be go well say he do twenty-five knot they should be off plymouth sound by to-morrow evening it be a long way put in dawson deeply interested fifteen hundred mile there or thereabout the coast light be all out so that they will steer a bit wide they should do it in sixty hour i give the order within thirty minute of get the news of the disaster remark the first lord smack he lip jacquetot make no reply though he eye harden and he mouth draw into a stiff line it be he province to give order to the fleet those battle-cruiser go on lord jacquetot address dawson will go into dock at devonport as soon as they arrive they will be there forty-eight hour at least they must be clean ship before they go through the hot tropical water if they speed be to be keep up they have gun power but power without speed be useless for the work which they have to do after leave england it will be a month before the squadron of which they be to form the chief part will be concentrate in the south sea for two day at devonport and for four week while at sea there must be the completest secrecy if we plan be to succeed without absolute secrecy we shall fail the board of admiralty be responsible for the sea but not for the land we can make certain that no news of the despatch of these two cruiser get out at sea can you mr chief inspector dawson undertake that no news get out on land -- that no whisper of they sailing reach the enemy by means of he spy on land it be a large order say dawson thoughtfully it be a very large order assert lord jacquetot frowning but large or small the thing must be do break in the first lord if this news get out and we fail to come up with the german squadron down south the effect upon the public will be horrible the english people may even lose they perfect they sublime faith in I they may lose they faith in the navy mutter jacquetot it be the same thing say the first lord can you let I know more detail my lord ask dawson what be the program i do not see at present how the arrival docking and sailing of the battle-cruiser can possibly be keep secret but there may be a way if one could only think of it if the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ arrive accord to program say jacquetot they will not come up the sound till after dark then in the small hour they will slip into dock and no one but the regular dockyard hand will know that they be there we will haul they out also in the middle of the night and they will be clear away by daybreak forty-eight hour after arrival coal and other store be on the spot in plenty and the shell and cordite for the twelve-inch gun can soon be get down from the plymouth magazine the secrecy of the operation seem to I to turn on whether we can trust the dockyard hand dawson shake he head i would not plump on that my lord there have be enemy agent work in every dockyard in the kingdom for year past and we have not spot all of they still we have we own man work alongside of they -- scotland yard man engage from among the shipbuilding trade union -- accounting for every one so that no man can be away from he post without we know and shadow he it be not easy to get any information out of the country nowadays the secret wireless story be all humbug wireless give itself away at once if one want to get news to the enemy one have to carry it oneself or hire some one else to carry it most of that which go we allow to go for we own purpose i be pretty sure that no dockyard hand could get anything away to holland without we knowledge so that it do not matter whether they be trustworthy or not so long as we be not fool enough to trust they you may not know it but i have my own yard man among you messenger here in this building and among you clerk too what cry the first lord you do not even trust the admiralty least of all say dawson grimly if i be head of the german secret service i would have my own man as you private secretary the first lord sit down gasp jacquetot nod kindly to dawson and laugh in he grim old way you be the man we want say he i be not think much of the dockyard hand go on dawson i can look after they they be all provide for the danger be in the gossip of a seaport town i have live in portsmouth for year and plymouth be just like it you may take my word for it that the arrival of the _ terrific _ and _ intrepid _ in dock at devonport will be know all over the three town half a hour after they get there they mission will be discuss in every bar and it will not be difficult to make a pretty useful guess here be a disaster in the south sea -- which will be publish all over the country by to-morrow morning -- and here be two of we fastest battle-cruiser summon in hot haste from scotland to be clean and load for a long voyage any child let alone a longshoreman could put the two thing together ` so the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ be off to the south sea to biff old fritz in the eye ' that be what they will say in the three town where there must be hundred of man -- british subject too the swine and many of they natural bear -- who would take risk to shove the news through to holland if they could get enough dirty money for it we worst spy be not german you bet they be irish and scotch and welsh and english that be where we difficulty come in i be not afraid of the dockyard but the gossip of the three town give I the creep then what can we possibly do wail the first lord who see he prospect of a brilliant coup wilt away like a fair mirage the secret will get out we plan will fail and my administration my beautiful administration will have to stand the racket how shall i defend myself in the house that will not matter much to the country put in jacquetot bluntly what matter be that we should do everything possible to keep the secret in spite of all the inherent difficulty sit down mr dawson and do some hard thinking i prefer to stand my lord when i want to think i do a bit of sentry-go so do i exclaim the first lord all my most famous speech be compose while i walk up and down my dressing-room before my -- he break off hastily but as neither jacquetot nor dawson be listen he might have complete the sentence without reveal the secret of he looking-glass may i speak my mind my lord ask dawson it be what you be here for reply jacquetot i always work on certain general principle they apply here people will talk that be certain if one do not want they to talk about something really important one put up something else conspicuous harmless and exciting to occupy they mind in you politics -- turn to the first lord with a air of simplicity -- when you have make a thorough mess of govern england and do not want to be find out you set the people fight about home rule for ireland i do not mean you sir but politician generally quite so say the first lord blinking well see here we do not want any talk about the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ so before they arrive we must give the people of the three town a real titbit of excitement battle-cruiser come to dock in devonport quite often when they be damage two battle-cruiser which have be mine or submarine one tow the other would be a pretty picture in the sound it would set all the folk talk for day and no one would think that two damaged cruiser have anything to do with the south sea everybody would say ` what cruel luck if the _ terrific _ and _ intrepid _ have not get blow up they would be just right and handy to send down south as it be -- ' and then the german agent would somehow get the news to holland -- we would help they all we could in a quiet way -- that the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ two fast battle-cruiser have be nearly lose and be be patch up at devonport the german hear the glorious news would hug themselves and say that now be the time for the high sea fleet to come out and smash jellicoe the last thing in they mind would be any concentration in the south against they own pacific squadron that be how i apply my general principle to this case meanwhile of course the _ terrific _ and _ intrepid _ well and sound would be race away down to the south sea and no one in the three town -- except the dockyard hand whom we would look after -- and no one at all in germany would have a glimmer of the real truth while dawson be think aloud in this rather halt stumbling way the first lord and he chief naval colleague be look hard at one another the politician with he quick house-of-common wit jump to the idea before he slower thinking expert colleague could sort out the two battle-cruiser who be to be mine or submarine from the two which be to speed away south to avenge the recent disaster if the two battle-cruiser be mine or submarine -- which god forbid say jacquetot how can they sail for the south need they be the same ship inquire dawson whose eye have begin to flash with excitement need they be the same do not you see interpose the first lord the idea be quite good i be just about to suggest something of the kind myself when mr dawson anticipate I that be where the mind with a wide universal training have a great advantage over the narrow intensive intelligence of the professional expert even in war what i propose what mr dawson here propose with my full concurrence be that two severely damage battle-cruiser known temporarily as the _ terrific _ and _ intrepid _ should be bring into the sound in broad day and display before the eye of the curious in the three town the real ship will slip in be dock and coal and slip out again the two other upon whom public attention have be concentrate shall be put aground somewhere in the sound to be salve with great and leisurely ostentation we will keep they well away from the hoe and allow no one whatever to approach they we will unofficially allow the news of they sorry state to get out of country and into the dutch papers meanwhile as mr dawson say the real _ terrific _ and _ intrepid _ will be speed towards the south and the saving for the nation 's service of my invaluable public reputation for accurate judgment and quick decision mr dawson 's suggestion -- i should perhaps rather say my own suggestion -- shall be lay before the board at once though the stiff mind of lord jacquetot be not very quick to take in a new idea no man alive be better equip for practically work out a naval scheme while the first lord be assume that sorely damage battle-cruiser or vessel which could be pass off in place of they need but he summons to spring from the deep jacquetot have press a bell and order a messenger to request the immediate presence of the fourth sea lord within whose province be the whole art and mystery of ship construction upon the appearance of this officer the plan be go over anew and he be ask whence and within what time he could produce two presentable dummy to do duty in the sound for the entertainment of the population of plymouth devonport and stonehouse there be say he two if not three at portsmouth construct out of old cargo tramp hull for the mystification of the enemy they have already do duty as newly complete battleship but with a little alteration to the canvas of they funnel the lath and plaster of they turret and con tower and the wood of they gun they might be make into perfect likeness -- at a distance -- of the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ the ship ' carpenter he explain could make the change while the dummy be come round to plymouth seat at the desk of lord jacquetot he write the necessary order in code he chief sign they and they be put at once on the wire for portsmouth the sea-cock say the fourth lord would be open twenty mile from land so that the _ intrepid _ might come in sadly down by the bow and the _ terrific _ with a list of twenty degree pluckily tow she sorely cripple sister with a chart of plymouth sound before they the two officer settle the precise spot sufficiently remote yet well within sight of the hoe at which the two unhappy battle-cruiser should come to rest upon the mud it will be a most pathetic spectacle say the fourth lord laughing and i will bet a month 's pay and allowance that at the distance not a man in the three town will have the smallest suspicion that the genuine copper-bottomed _ terrific _ and _ intrepid _ be not ditch before he bloom eye he rise from the table upon which the chart have be lay walk over to dawson and shake he warmly by the hand you will not get any credit for the idea he whisper one never do but it be a damned good notion what be you go to do now i be go to plymouth this afternoon to make sure that the german truth get over the water to holland and that the english truth stay safely behind if you will all do you part i will do mine chapter xiii the see and the unseen every man to he trade say dawson i do not go into the difficulty of we job to those high folk at the admiralty but they be not at all small you have a head on you froissart though it have the misfortune to be french set it go on double shift the two man be sit in a specially reserve first-class compartment in the paddington-plymouth express as companion they be hopelessly uncongenial yet as colleague form a strong combination in which the quality of the one serve to neutralise the defect of the other dawson in spite of he love for the defense of the realm regulation be still sometimes unconsciously hamper by a ingrained respect for the ordinary law and the rights of civilian froissart like all french detective officer hold the law in contempt and be by nature and training utterly lawless the more reputable a suspect the more remorseless be he pursuit they be professionally a terrible pair who could have be pass through a hair sieve without leave behind a grain of moral scruple froissart when he would be at the trouble understand and speak english quite well though with I he use nothing but the raciest of boulevard french my friend say he you promise to those minister of marine be rash for unless there be the most perfect execution of you scheme and the most sleepless watching of those whom you call dockyard hand -- _ ceux qui travaillent dan les chantiers ne c'est pas _ -- the sailing of these _ grand croiseur _ will be tell to germany there be too many who will know we be upon _ une folle enterprise _ -- a chase of the wild goose you do not know my system if you think that remark dawson frowning and if i do not of whom be the fault inquire froissart blandly for my faith you never tell what you would be do a secret say dawson sententiously be a secret when know to one only if two know of it there be grave danger if three one might as well shout it from the housetops therefore i keep my own counsel that be just what i say cry froissart triumphantly if the secret of these _ grand croiseur _ be know to one hundred two hundred _ le bon dieu _ know how many hundred of dockyard hand one might as well print it in these dull english _ journaux _ you attempt the impossible _ mon amus _ they be englishman proclaimed dawson who feel compel to uphold the character of he countryman in the presence of a foreigner they be patriot not a man of they would sell he country i would not bank on they patriotism my friend when there be much boche gold to be win and much beer to be drunk and who say that i do bank upon it cry dawson testily forget he noble word of two minute earlier i would not trust one of they out of my sight i have two dozen of my own man work alongside of those dockyard hand watch they by night and day we know if a man drink two glass of beer when he use to drink one and take home to he wife eighteenpence above he ordinary wage do you take I for a fool you 'll be a bigger fool than i take you for if you do not play straight this time with I and tell I you plan in detail i have to work with you and i can not give service blindfold you be not a bad fellow froissart say dawson thoughtfully -- the name in he mouth become froy-zart -- and i will tell you here and now more of my mind than i have yet show even to the great chief of we all it will take all you brain -- for you have some brain -- and all of mine to keep the secret of those battle-cruiser \* \* \* \* \* in the morning the newspaper publish the meager detail of the disaster in the south sea and the three town be shake to they foundation for when naval ship go down they take with they crew of whom half have they home in devon the disaster mean that eight hundred family in the west mourn a son or a father ever since the day of the great queen -- whose name in the west be not victorium but elizabeth -- devon have pay in the life of its best man the price of admiralty the three town mourn with a grief make more bitter by the realisation that the disaster be one which never should have happen bad slow english ship have be send against good fast german ship and have be sink with all hand without hurt to the enemy the three town know the speed and power of every fight ship afloat british or foreign as you or i before the war know the public form of every lead golfer or cricketer in every bar where sailorman meet one another and meet too the brother and father of sailorman the lord of the admiralty be weigh and condemn it be a thing most serious when in the cradle of the navy portsmouth and the three town faith in the wisdom of whitehall become shake one may muzzle the press but no muzzle yet devise can close the mouth of sailorman and they friend in dockyard town in the afternoon of the same day while the news of the disaster be still fresh there come a whisper which gain in loudness and in precision of detail as it pass from mouth to ear and from ear to mouth that the worst have not yet be tell there have be not one but two disaster two battle-cruiser it be declare have be sink in the channel by german mine or submarine what be they name inquire the white-faced woman the name be not yet know but they would soon come a little later the severity of the rumor become soften the battle-cruiser have not it appear be sink but severely damage they be at that moment on they way to the sound cripple sorely yet afloat man groan two battle-cruiser blow up in the channel what in god 's name be two battle-cruiser do in the mine-strewn channel when they proper place be in one of the safe eyrie overlook the north sea a plausible explanation be offer the two battle-cruiser have be come to plymouth to take in store that they might speed away south to avenge those other two cruiser sink by the german as have be tell in the morning 's papers if this be indeed true the news be of the worst england 's prestige afloat be go she could not spare two other whole battle-cruiser to proceed upon a mission of vengeance to the south sea while the german ' battle squadron in the north sea port be still undefeated meanwhile the german far away to the south could do what they please they could sink and burn we merchant steamer at will the command of the pacific have pass from england to germany and the white ensign hang draggled and shame for all the world to sneer at the three town almost forget they personal grief for drowned friend in they horror at the disgrace which have come to they own sacred service it be still light though late in the afternoon when the anxious watcher upon the hoe make out beyond drake 's island two big ship come in round the western end of the breakwater though deep in the water they tower above they escort of destroyer and fast patrol boat the leading ship be list badly she tripod mast with its spot top hung far over to port and she be tow stern first a sister ship whose bow be almost hide under water the three town which can recognize the outline of warship afar off rapidly pronounce judgment that be the _ intrepid _ they declare and the one she be tow be a battle-cruiser of the same class -- the _ terrific _ or _ tremendous _ they be both badly hole gawd a ` mighty cry a grizzled longshoreman who might have sail with drake or hawkin -- as no doubt he forbear have do -- look to the list of un and thicky with she bow down under be tow by the stern to keep she from swamp entire if it wor not for they bulk ` ead un would not never have make the sound it be plain to those who have glass turn on the damage ship that they be draw far too much water to be bring into the hamoaze and over the sill of the dry dock at devonport so that no one feel surprise when the battle-cruiser be see to pull out of the deep fairway and make towards the shore the purpose be plain to read they be to be put aground under mount edgcumbe patch up and pump dry and then would go into dock for repair it be a job of week and during all that time the fleet would be short of two battle-cruiser which might have sweep the south sea clear of the german ensign it be cruel luck and the three town have enough to talk of to keep they occupy for many day presently more news come authentic news and pass rapidly from mouth to mouth the vessel be the _ intrepid _ the flagship of admiral stocky and she sister the _ terrific _ a pair of fast dreadnought cruiser they have as be surmise be speed down from scotland to dock at plymouth on they way to clean up the mess make in the far south they have come safely through the irish sea and round the land 's end but when near they journey 's end off fowey they have run into a patch of mine lay by german submarine the _ terrific _ have have she bow plate rip into sliver of ragged steel and the three fore compartment flood the _ intrepid _ have pick up the wire of a twin mine get catch badly on the port side but have luckily escape to starboard she have take she cripple sister in tow and bring she in safely both ship could easily be repair but it would take time the voyage to the south sea be off nothing could have be more convincing than the story which quickly get about the ship have be see and recognize by the three town -- there be no concealment and no mystery for once the silent navy appear to be talkative the heart of german agent in the town swell with pride and joy here be convincing proof of the kindly hand of the prussian gott if the great news could be carry through to the kaiser and von tirpitz there would be much ringing of church bell in the fatherland but these english since the war begin have become very watchful very suspicious the problem be : how to get the glad news through \* \* \* \* \* it be two o'clock in the morning and very dark the big dry dock at devonport be desert except for a few pick hand not more than two score at the outside tell off on night shift for special duty against all workman who have not be warn for this duty the big gate would be close for two whole day there be important job await completion but they must wait one hundred and twenty man work in three eight-hour shift per day -- forty at a time -- could do all that be need to the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ and not one man be include who have not serve at devonport for at least ten year dawson have be very firm and the commander-in-chief have back he with full authority do not make any mistake say dawson among even one hundred and twenty though pick in this way there will be some few who would sell we if they could one would have to go back more than ten year to weed out all those whom the german have corrupt but out of this lot there should not be more than two or three swine and i can look after they he do not say that he have already be in touch with the scotland yard officer at devonport and have arrange that a dozen out of he precious twenty-four counter-spy should be put among the choose hundred and twenty dawson never do allow he left hand to know the wiles of he right under the thick cover of the autumn night two massive silent form which have creep with all light out into the sound after they long fast voyage from the northern mist be warped into dock the support shore be fit and the water around they run out long before the flagship _ intrepid _ stand clear and dry on the dock floor dawson in he uniform of a private of marine -- a marine can go anywhere and do anything he would say -- have slip on board and show the commander credentials from the board of admiralty which make that hardened officer open he eye my word exclaim he you must be some marine come along quick to the admiral so dawson go not a little nervous -- the moment he foot tread the deck of a king 's ship all he assurance drop off he old sense of discipline flow back over he and a admiral become a very mighty potentate indeed ashore dawson could face up to the lord jacquetot himself on board ship a two-ring lieutenant be to he a god he follow the commander and be usher into the admiral 's presence what cry stocky stern in manner always but very kindly at heart towards those whom he find to be true man a private of marine with plenary power from the first lord take the papers off he and chuck the damned comedian into the ditch we have no time here for the first lord 's humor the commander draw near and whisper what authority endorse by jacquetot there be something queer about this look here my fine fellow who the devil be you be you a marine or a too clever german spy or what make haste there be still enough water leave over the side to pitch you into without break you dirty neck dawson know he man he have serve in the same ship with stocky when that officer have be a lieutenant he have wait upon he in the wardroom he have feel the rasp of he tongue in old day he approach and without say a word hand the letter give he by the first lord and jacquetot add he official card the admiral read the papers slowly and come at last to the card then he frown brow soften and he smile it be the old smile of lieutenant stocky why it be dawson who be my servant in the old _ olympus _ now chief inspector of scotland yard that explain all but why the hell man do you dress up as a marine once a marine always a marine reply dawson who feel happier now that the admiral have recognize he i can not keep out of the uniform sir besides it be very useful when i want to be about the dock my order say the admiral be to dock clean coal and be off i be expect more detailed instruction but they have not yet come these letter say that you will explain the program here and that you have be charge with full responsibility for keep we movement secret i be to give you all possible assistance all right go ahead what do you want of we dawson rapidly tell how the two dummy battle-cruiser have come stumble into the sound in the afternoon and how the three town believe that the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ be at that moment lie on the shoal out of service for week to come no one must guess he conclude that the real _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ be here safe in dock that they will go out two day hence in the middle of the night and dash away south to wipe fritz 's flag off the sea we have pick the dockyard hand with the greatest care and have they under watch like mouse with cat all about they if a single one of you officer or man go out of the dock gate the game will be up and i will not answer for the consequence everything rest with you sir will you give order that no one no one not even you yourself shall leave either of the battle-cruiser while they be in dock -- no one not for a minute the admiral laugh and the officer in he room respectfully join in so we have be mine and be aground somewhere yonder on the mud surround by sorrowing patrol and the three town be drop salt tear into they beer it be a fine game dawson i do not believe much in lord jacquetot 's dummy but they have come in darned useful this time be you go to keep plymouth and devonport in the dump for long until you have do you work sir say dawson so until then the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ will lie cripple in the sound for all the world to see and for fritz to believe if this very bright scheme be yours dawson we will all drink you health down south as soon as we work have be do for the credit will be yours rather than ours i will help you all i can it be my duty and my very keen desire a man who can make so brilliant a plan for confound the enemy 's spy be worth a statue of gold he be even worth the sacrifice of two day 's leave while one 's ship be in dock what do you say gentleman i never think say the flag captain that i would willingly spend two day shut up in a smelly dock but you may count I in sir i will not head a mutiny when all leave be refuse you shall have you way dawson all leave stop in both ship not a man be to go ashore on any pretence no matter what the excuse the mother of the lower deck may all die -- they always do when a ship be in port -- but not a man shall leave to bury they give the order in the _ intrepid _ and ask the captain of the _ terrific _ to be so good as to come aboard \* \* \* \* \* so far good exclaimed dawson when he get back to he hotel and find froissart sit up for he the ship be in and no one be to be allow ashore i shall be in a fever till both of they be away again we be on very thin ice froissart it be lucky that the dockyard be on the hamoaze out of sight even of most of devonport and far away from plymouth and stonehouse i have see all the foreman of the dockyard myself tell they the whole trick which we be play on the hun and put they on they mettle to tackle they man they will pitch it fine and strong on the honor and patriotism of complete silence but not neglect to throw in a hint of the defense of the realm act and penal servitude never threaten a englishman froissart but always let he know that behind you fine honorable sentiment there be something devilish nasty preach as loud as you can about the beauty of virtue but do not forget to chuck in a description of the fiery hell which await wrongdoer i do not depend much either on the sentiment or the hint of punishment i have get every man of that hundred and twenty on my string and if one of they ask leave within the next day or two to go and bury he mother on the east coast he shall go -- but i shall go with he and he shall have a jolly little funeral of he own every letter which they write will be read every telegram copy for I every message by ` phone take down they be on my string froissart -- every man you do everything mr dawson grumble froissart where do i come in you have help I a lot already reply dawson handsomely you be a foreigner make I talk very simple and plain and think out my plan so that i can explain they to you one see the weak point of a scheme when one have to make it clear to a foreigner you do not always twig my meaning froissart and sometimes you remark be a bit foolish but you mean well and for a frenchman be quite intelligent i will say that for you froissart -- quite intelligent _ sacre nom d'un chien _ -- begin froissart hotly but dawson pay no heed he just go on talk and froissart realize that dawson could not understand he french and that he himself could not give word to he feeling in english relapse into wrathful silence much as i respect and admire dawson i should not care to be he subordinate we must keep the cinema show go nice and lively for the three town go on dawson a big salvage steamer be come down to-morrow to give a air of verisimilitude to the proceedings patrol boat will buzz about the sound and the potentate naval and civil will gather from all part the unfortunate wreck out at picklecombe point will be guard so that no shore boat can get within half a mile they will not bear a very close inspection i hope that none of the gun will break loose and float about the harbor that would be what you might call a bloom contretemps i shall be pretty busy all the next two day myself though i be a strict teetotaller i shall get into shore rig and spend my day in the public bar i must know what the three town be talk about and whether any suspicion of the truth get wind i do not think that it can at least for some time the stage management have be too good later on there may be some wonderment because none of the man from the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ be allow ashore a lot of wife and family must be around here especially as the _ intrepid _ be a plymouth ship of course it must be give out that they be all need to help with the salvage operation and no leave be allow you froissart might spend you time read copy of all telegram send out from the town if any german agent want to get news of the damage to the battle-cruiser over to holland he will probably travel up to the east coast and send a wire on ahead that be what i hope for you shall then follow he up and make smooth the path of crime half we trouble will be lose unless we can help the spoof news over to the kaiser bless he the job at first will be pretty dull for you froissart and not over lively for I i hate pub yet for two day i must loaf about they pretend to drink you can read the telegram but you can not understand english well enough to pick up the gossip of the bar i must do that myself you have stop all leave on the battle-cruiser -- the real one i mean -- but what about the dockyard man inquire froissart be they to be allow to go to they home when they come off they shift i have think of that and weigh both side it will be safer to let they go home as usual if we lock they all up in the dockyard till the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ be both safe away there would be no end of curiosity and gossip what so very special people would ask could be go on in the yard that no one be allow out for two day i do not want wife and family and neighbor to come smell round those dockyard gate they might see the spot top of the cruiser inside of course there be a regular forest of mast and gantry show and a couple of spot top more or less might not be notice but my general idea be to concentrate attention on those dear old dummy down at picklecombe point they be the center of interest the eye of the picture -- the cynosure as a scholar would say i be not a bad scholar myself i pass the seventh standard and go to school all the time i be in the red marine i be a sergeant which take a bit of do but see here froissart exclaimed dawson look at he watch it be five o'clock and we must get quick to bed so as to be bright and lively in the morning dawson carry out he program though a strict teetotaller he pass hour at public house especially in the evening listen to the talk of the port it be all about the disaster in the south sea the heavy casualty suffer by the three town and the rotten ill-luck of the avenge battle-cruiser run upon the german mine not a whisper could dawson hear of suspicion that the ship beach under mount edgcumbe be other than the genuine article the salvage steamer with she big arc light glowing through the darkness have be the last artistic touch which bring complete conviction gold-laced officer include the commander-in-chief himself have be come and go all day the acting of the navy have be perfect dawson bless the four bone of old jacquetot who when he tackle a job do it very thoroughly indeed i should not be surprised thought he if the mountain as that young jackanapes call he come trot down here himself just to make the show complete and sure enough he do accompany by the fourth sea lord who have work out all the convincing detail dawson be order to meet they in the admiral 's quarter of the _ intrepid _ he go look a very different person from the private of marine of some thirty hour earlier and have the honor of be invite to luncheon that lunch be the one scene in the comedy upon which he dwell in tell the story to I lord jacquetot he say clinked glass with I and wish I the best of luck and success it be as much as he could do he say to keep the first lord from come down and monkey the whole affair luckily there be a debate in parliament that he want to figure in and so could not get away lord jacquetot say that the first lord have grab the whole scheme as he very own and forget that i have any part in it i do not mind the secret service never get any credit for anything if it do it would not be secret very long no credit i remark and not much cash i expect little enough sir reply dawson i suppose we do the job for the love of it there be no sport like it we real work never get into the papers or the story-book never i ask slily what about that story of mine in the _ cornhill magazine _ which you still carry about next you heart dawson change the subject he never will appreciate chaff at midnight of the day of the luncheon party the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ clean and fully load clear out of dock and slip off into the darkness attend by they destroyer escort whose duty it be to see they safe round ushant eight hour later dawson come down to breakfast and find that froissart satisfy with he _ petit dejeuner _ of coffee and roll have already go out dawson feel satisfied with himself and be confident now that he work in the three town have be well and truly do the rest could be leave to the navy and to he secret service agent he sit down to a hearty meal but be not destine to finish it first come a messenger from the officer in charge of the dockyard who hand over a sealed note and take a receipt for it dawson break the seal dear mr dawson he read you will be interested to learn that one of the hand engage upon the work we know of have ask for three day ' leave -- that he may bury he mother in essex she die he say at burnham i await you view before grant the leave ask for the man have be in we service for sixteen year and bear the best of character now what do i know of burnham mutter dawson the name seem familiar he ring the bell ask for a atla and study carefully the coast of essex burnham stand upon the river crouch which dawson have hear of as a famous resort for motor-boat he eye gleam and he throw up he head which have be bent over the map the man shall have he leave murmur he but i do not think it will be he mother who be bury just at that moment in come froissart look as dawson at once remark merry and bright it be no wonder say he for see this telegram of which i have just have a copy it be spot at once at the bureau and the man who despatch it have be shadow by a police officer the telegram read come to-day by south western meet I this evening at usual place it be address to burnham-on-crouch in essex dawson pick up the note which he have receive and pass it to froissart who read it slowly the same place cry he yes say dawson slowly the same place and a famous resort for motor-boat we have not finish yet my friend with the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ chapter xiv a coffin and a owl dawson lay the letter and the telegram upon he breakfast-table and bent he head over they in a few minute he have weigh they up sort out they relative significance and speak we have here froissart two distinct people i be almost sure of that my man of the dockyard who want leave to bury he mother in essex have not yet receive permission from he chief he would not therefore be telegraph about he train he do not know yet whether he will be permit to go at all you man be quite confident that he movement be in no way restricted as i read between the line i judge that my man who know the actual truth about the docking and sailing of the battle-cruiser want to reach the east coast whence he have means of transmit the priceless news to germany you man be of one of the town he have see the dummy cruiser ashore in the sound he believe they to be genuine and he also want to transmit the news to he paymaster in germany he will be a ordinary german agent the identity of place whither both wish to go be partly a coincidence and partly explain by its excellence as a jumping-off place for fast motor-boat which during these long autumn night could race over to and get back again between sunset and dawn we have coast watcher always about for the very purpose of stop such line of communication you shall accompany you own man and make sure that he be allow to get through if he do not himself cross arrest he as soon as he boat have go if he do go watch for he return and arrest he and he boat and all on board the moment that they return in any event the boat and its crew must be seize upon return to essex be you quite clear about what you have to do quite say froissart the spy and they boat must be catch red-handed but not till after the false news of the mining of the battle-cruiser have be carry to holland but how shall we make certain that the sleepless english navy will not butt in and catch the boat at sea before it get across to holland the narrow sea swarm with fast patrol i will provide for that i will write at once for you a letter to the inspector of police at burnham and enclose copy of my credentials from the admiralty i will also wire to lord jacquetot in private code you will find on arrival that the responsible naval authority of the district will be entirely at you service that motor-boat with the news of the great spoof shall be shepherd across most craftily but when it come to return will find that the way of transgressor be very hard get ready and be off froissart we depend upon you skill and discretion get a good view of you man -- the police will point he out -- before he board the train and then do not let he out of you sight take two plain-clothes officer with you run no unnecessary risk of be spot you be rather easily recognisable with those shine black eye and black beard but no one here have see you officially and you should pass unsuspected as a scotland yard man can i trust you _ mais certainement _ say froissart crossly this be simple police work which i have do a thousand time i could do it on my head you train leave at 108 the south western station i will give you the letter at once and then you can start within a quarter of a hour dawson -- he breakfast forget -- have give froissart he letter send a long telegram by special messenger to the commander-in-chief for despatch in code to jacquetot not even to dawson would the admiralty entrust its private cypher then as soon as froissart have disappear he call up the chief of the dockyard on the telephone and arrange to come at once to he office i have give the easy job to froissart he explain to I long afterwards it be as he call it simple police work he have without arouse suspicion to make smooth the path for he spy just as you and i open the door to the hook for the late-lamented hagan and escort he across in the mail-boat we have help false news over to the german score of time it be grand sport my job be something much more tricky i have to get plain proof that my man be a spy in the dockyard to keep he play on my line to the very last minute but to make dead certain of stop he at the fifty-fifth second of the eleventh hour why do you not cut out you difficulty by just stop he from go to essex at a word from you he chief would have refuse leave dawson smile at I in a fashion which i find intensely aggravate he have no tact when he feel superior he let one see it plainly the fat would have be in the fire then exclaim he suppose he lay low for a day or two take french leave and go i should have be off he track shadow be all very well but it do not always succeed in a crowded district like the three town if he have get away without I beside he the man might have reach essex and do there what he please besides he might have have accomplice unknown to I no it be the only possible course to give he leave and follow he up close then whatever he do would be under my own eye dawson gulp down a cup of coffee sadly regard he rapidly congeal bacon and skip off to the dockyard who be this man of yours whose mother have die at so very inconvenient a moment for we what the deuce be he do with a mother in essex at all he ought to be a devon man he be not anyway i have be make close inquiry though he have be with we for sixteen year he do come originally from somewhere in the east the man be one of the best i have -- never drink keep good time and work hard he make big wages and carry they virtuously home to he wife he have money in the savings bank and hold consol poor chap on which he must have waste the good toil of year i can not imagine any one less likely to take german gold than this man maynard sure you have not a bee in you bonnet dawson to a police officer every one be a probable criminal but some of we now and then be passably honest i will bet my commission that maynard be honest dawson sniff the honest man with the excellent character and the virtuous wife be always the most dangerous because least likely to arouse suspicion how do you know that maynard have not a second establishment hide away somewhere in the three town the upper and middle class have no monopoly in illicit love affair they work class betters do a bit that way too all right have it you own way we will assume for the sake of security that maynard be a spy that he have no dead mother whom he want leave to bury and that he have sell he country for the sake of some bit of fluff in plymouth the point be : what be i to do shall i grant leave yes say dawson and do it handsomely give he four day and run the sympathetic stunt offer he a service pass by the great western say how grieve you be and all the rest of the tosh have he up now and put I somewhere close so that i can take a good look at the swine when he come in and when he go out the chief of the dockyard shrug he shoulder place dawson in a adjoining room and summon maynard from the yard the man who be dress in the awful dead black of he class when a funeral be in prospect come up and dawson get a full sight of he maynard be about thirty-five well set up -- for he have serve in the territorial -- and look what he be a first-rate workman of the best type even dawson who trust no one be slightly shake i have never see a man who look less like a spy mutter he but then those always make the most dangerous of spy why have he a mother in essex and why have she die just now real mother do not do these thing they have more sense maynard receive he third-class pass respectfully thank he officer for he kindly express sympathy -- which in he case be quite genuine -- and disappear dawson jump into the room again to take a word of farewell i should know he anywhere he cry i be go by the same train in the same carriage good-bye maynard reach the great western station in good time and find a carriage which be not overcrowded he be carry a small handbag at the last moment before the train start a prosperous-looking passenger with commercial gentleman write all over he step into the same compartment and seat himself in a vacant seat opposite the bereaved workman it be dawson in one of he favorite role there be nothing less like a detective he would say than a middle-aged commercial traveller they be such genial unsuspicious open-handed folk this come of wander about the country at other people 's expense the 1015 fast express from the three town to paddington be a excellent one and the journey be not more tedious than five hour spend in a train be bind to be all through the journey dawson from behind he stock of papers and magazine study maynard and become not perhaps shake in he conviction but certainly puzzle he look he explain to I like a sick and sorrowful man one who have really lose a beloved mother far away would look just like that but so might one who have be unfaithful to a trust wife and be now risk he neck to pour gold into the greedy lap of a frowsy mistress one must never judge by appearance a man may look as sick over back the wrong horse as at lose a only son in the trench human means of expression be limit it take time to learn that you be not such a beast as you pretend i observe dawson grin at paddington maynard take the tube to liverpool street and do not observe that he fellow passenger of the brown tweed suit and the fat self-satisfied rather oily face follow by the same route dawson who be famished rejoice to see maynard make for the refreshment-room he could not lunch on the train since the workman upon whom he attend have economically feed himself upon sandwich put up in a nosebag no breakfast no lunch groan dawson what a day he do he best during five minute in the refreshment-room at liverpool street to fill up the howling void in he person and then watch maynard enter a train for burnham-on-crouch in two minute he have open up communication with a station inspector of police make himself known and secure the service of a constable to travel in maynard 's carriage he do not wish to be see again himself just at present he yearn too for a first-class compartment and a ample tea-basket dawson 's brain be a martyr to duty but he stomach continually rise in rebellion it be a fast train which would not stop until the essex coast be reach so that dawson do not doubt that he quarry would be upon the platform when he himself get out so he be and so too be a girl in deep mourning who have come to meet he dawson be stagger a girl also in funeral black upset the picture which he have paint to himself the man and girl talk together for a few minute and then walk slowly arm in arm out of the station towards the village dawson pick up he police assistant and follow he give no explanation of the reason for he shadow of the man maynard for he be just begin to feel uneasy slowly the party of four thread through the pretty little place bright under the pleasant autumn twilight maynard and the girl be in front dawson and he policeman follow some fifty yard behind in a side street at the door of a small cottage -- one of a humble row -- the pair of mourner stop open the iron gate and enter dawson wait watch he could see through the window into a little parlor where some half a dozen people all in deep black be gather presently as if they have wait only for the arrival of maynard -- which indeed be the fact -- the heavy step of man clump down wooden stair resound from the open door and there emerge into the street a coffin bear upon the shoulder of six bearer the moment that the coffin appear dawson realize he blunder maynard have really lose he mother and like a dutiful son have come all the way from the three town to bury she off fly dawson 's hat and he nudge the policeman hard in the rib take off you helmet you chump he growl savagely do not you see that it be a funeral the man rather daze -- he have be pluck away from liverpool street at a moment 's notice and send upon what he think be police service -- do what he be tell the group of mourner form behind the coffin which be carry to the cemetery not far off still follow with they head bow dawson and the bewildered policeman attend the funeral hear the beautiful service read and the last office complete then they turn away and make for the railway station why sir ask the policeman look sideways rather fearfully at he superior officer 's stern face -- why sir do we come to this place why have not you see snapped dawson to attend a funeral of course \* \* \* \* \* i have never meet that policeman to have converse with he and to have seek to chop a way through the tangled recess of he mind would have gratify I hugely for if police constable think at all in what a bewildered whirl of confused speculation must he poor brain have be occupy during the return journey to london dawson toss he into a compartment of the first train which come along one of extreme slowness and then dismiss he into cold space without a scrap of remorse the humble creature discharge he station duty with the precision of daily habit have swing into the overpowering orbit of chief inspector dawson be catch up dump without instruction upon a unknown journey in attendance upon a unknown workman then when the train have stop he have be spew out upon a strange country platform lead through strange mean street and force with head bare to the autumn chill of evening to attend the obsequy of a total stranger at the end without a word of explanation still less of apology he have be return as a empty reject package to the platform at liverpool street yes i should dearly love to have meet and cross-question that policeman and have listen to the bizarre solution which he have to offer to it all but most probably in he stolid faithful way he never give the subject any thought at all to be toss about at the whim of superior be a experience which he would take as composedly as he would those exiguous weekly wages which be the derisory compensation dawson go to the small hotel which he have pick out with froissart as a convenient rendezvous there he sit for hour do nothing for he be far too wise a man to push he head into another man 's business even though that one be a subordinate and a foreigner he have fail once he could not afford by deputy to fail a second time besides he know nothing of the movement of froissart and he quarry they have not appear within the visible horizon of burnham-on-crouch though they have have ample time in which to arrive i be afraid that he temper get the better of he and as the night draw on unsolaced by a word from froissart and unrelieved by any literature more engrossing than old railway time-table and hotel advertisement he consign to the bottomless pit the chief of the devonport dockyard the disgustingly virtuous and unenterprising maynard and even the harmless soul of he lately bury mother dawson in a royal rage be no pleasant spectacle it have go half-past eleven before froissart come a boisterous triumphant froissart bragging of he skill and he success in the manner of a bear gascon it be tremendous _ mon amus _ roar froissart unchecked by dawson 's scowl i have do the bloom trick : the boat have go to holland and the filthy spy be in the strong lock-up my vigilance my astuteness my resource unfathomable my flair my soul of a artist my patience inexhaustible my address so firm and yet so delicate my mastery of the mind of those other less gifted my -- oh stow it roar dawson unfailing insight _ mon esprit francais _ my genius for the service of police my unshakable courage and elan have have they just and inevitable reward the boat with the message so false have go to holland for the german kaiser to gloat over and the filthy spy be in the safe lock-up i take he with my own hand -- i le comte de froissart i bemired my hand by contact with he foul carcase the boat it fly down the river _ ma foi _ like a flash of the lightning go they say thirty knot _ presque cinquante kilometre par heure _ the glorious _ marine anglaise _ will see that it reach les pay ba and then when it be of return you sailor so splendid with sang-froid so perfect will gobble it up just gobble it up as i will gobble up this cold beef upon you table _ peste _ i be of a hunger excruciating i have not eat for five six ten hour froissart sit down at dawson 's table where still lay the cold remains of he supper -- he have have the decency to reflect that he colleague froissart might be hungry upon arrival -- and fall to eat copiously and loudly the french be least admirable when they be see devour food froissart eat while dawson writhe though he colleague 's success would plant laurel upon he own brow -- little would he ever say at the yard of that journey to burnham and the preposterous funeral -- he be jealous bitterly jealous i be by special appointment the boswell of dawson yet i do not spare the feeling of my subject rather do i go over they with a rake -- for the ultimate good of dawson 's variegated soul he be bitterly jealous but from natural curiosity yearn to know the detail of those feat of which froissart prate so triumphantly and all the while unconscious heedless of he wrathful exasperated chieftain froissart devour food in immense quantity it be a disgusting exhibition satisfy at last froissart break away from the table light a cigarette and sit himself down beside dawson before the fire it be well past midnight but to these man regular habit be unknown and the hour of work and of sleep always indeterminate now exclaim froissart i will tell to you my friend dawson the true _ histoire _ of my exploit so tremendous and unapproachable i reach the station at plymouth at ten hour my spy be upon the platform i know he for those who have keep he under watch have inform I of he i have with I two police officer _ en bourgeois _ what you call plain clothes and i distribute they with the acumen of a strategist it be _ un train a couloir _ the spy dispose himself in a compartment i place one of my officer in the same compartment with he the other in the compartment _ contiguee _ towards the engine myself in that _ a derriere _ he be thus the meat in we sandwich if he pass into the corridor and walk this way or that he be see by I or by my man in advance all he movement while within he own compartment be supervise every moment so we travel he do himself well that spy so atrocious he partake of he _ dejeuner _ in the _ buffet du train _ and we all three take we _ dejeuner _ there also that be the last meal of which i eat before this my supper here the journey be without incident but when he arrive at waterloo the trouble begin he be not take risk that spy he know not that he be under watch but he take not risk he begin to perform a voyage design to throw any man except one of the vigilance and resource of froissart completely off he track i be not learn in you metropolitain before this day but now i know you tube as if a map of they be print in color upon my hand at waterloo that spy so astute burrow into the earth and enter a train of the railway call bakerloo in which he journey to golder 's green then he cross a _ quaus _ and return to the town call camden again he descend pass through tunnel and emerge upon another _ quaus _ proceed to highgate all the while we three follow not close but so that he never escape from under we eye at highgate he turn about and return to tottenham court road thence he depart by another line to the bank and rise in and _ ascenseur _ emerge upon the pavement of you city he look this way and that not perceive we who watch walk warily to the lord maire 's station of the mansion house board the district railway and do not alight till wimbledon it be easy to follow but my friend the billet the ticket be _ une grande difficulte _ i solve the problem of ticket by my genius so _ superbe _ we at first try to take they but _ apre _ we abandon the project so hopeless and travel _ san payer _ when ask at the barrier or in the lift we offer penny and the man who collect take they joyfully ask not whence we come it be _ une procedee tre simple _ it be possible that these wayward uncounted penny drop into they own pocket they rejoice always to receive they from wimbledon we return to earl 's court and then descend by a electric staircase which move of itself again find ourselves in the tube i love that _ escalier electrique _ one day i will return and ascend and descend upon it for hour from earl 's court we go to piccadilly circus there we make another change for oxford circus there we again get out and at last after penetrate the bowels of you london travel to liverpool street by this time it have become dark and the spy 's passion for underground travel have spend itself he cross the street descend to the grand station of the eastern railway and take a ticket for burnham-on-crouch exhaust but ever vigilant froissart and he faithful man take also ticket for burnham-on-crouch i will not weary you more with we wanderings but after many hour at ten o'clock we at last arrive at this place the spy be meet upon the _ quaus _ by another villain with whom he hold converse and the pair of they ignorant that the vengeance of froissart overshadow they march heedlessly openly to the river side and enter a large house of which the garden run down to the water i leave there my two faithful but weary one on watch and hasten to the _ salle de police _ there a inspector and a young _ officier anglai _ -- a sub-lieutenant of the royal naval volunteer reserve -- be await my arrival with impatience to they i tell my story with the brevity that i now recount it to you they be intrigue greatly and the _ sous _ - lieutenant strike I violently upon the back and say _ ma fous _ that i be a ` downy old bird ' it be a compliment _ tre ` bizarre mai tre aimable _ i be it appear a old bird of the downiest plumage i have note the name of the house and the inspector seize a directory ` we have suspect that house for some time ' say he there be a big boat-house at the bottom of the garden contain a large sea-going motor-boat the proprietor call himself english but do not look like one he be doubtless a snake one whom they call _ naturalise _ a viper whom we english have warm in we bosom ' so speak the inspector the sub-lieutenant whistle he say only ` send for little tommy it be a job for he ' a call be send forth and there come into the room a scrap of a infant habit in short pantaloons and a green shirt the child carry a long pole and stand stiffly at attention ' _ ma foi _ do i see before I a boy scout ' i ask ` you do ' reply the sub-lieutenant ` this be little tommy the patrol leader of the owl ' ' _ mon dieu _ ' i cry ` a owl _ un hibou _ be he then stupid as a owl ' i could see that the tommy so small frowned savagely but the sub-lieutenant laugh ` you will see presently if he be stupid i have forty mile of coast to watch and i do it all with boy scout like this one ' ' _ nom d'un chien _ ' i cry ` you english be a great people ' ` we be ' agree the sub-lieutenant ` devilish great ' tommy grin then the officer so youthful -- he age could not have exceed nineteen year -- give order to the little tommy he be to go to the house to enter the garden to squeeze he tiny person into the boat-house and watch when the spy and he associate go towards the boat tommy be to warn we with a hoot -- like a owl -- and we be to take charge at least so i understand the order give in a strange sea language tommy salute and vanish if he have ten year i should be astonished but he be a man every inch of he wait till i have finish we follow quickly behind tommy but see he not and join my man who still watch the house the sub-lieutenant and i move warily climb over the wall of the garden and creep along the grass soft like moss to we foot till we could see the boat-house stand out against the dull shine of the river there be no sign of the presence of _ le petit hibou _ suddenly the door of the house which give upon the garden open and four man walk down to the boat-house and enter stealthily my heart turn to water -- what a calamity if they should find and slay the pretty little owl the minute pass perhaps five perhaps ten and then quite close we hear the soft low hoot of a owl the sub-lieutenant hoot a reply and from among some bush there come out that serene intrepid infant with the pole he join we and whisper eagerly to the officer i could not hear what he say afterwards the sub-lieutenant tell I that the man have enter three have get into the boat one remain on land it be a forty-foot boat report tommy -- who seem of wisdom and knowledge encyclopaedic -- it have a big cabin forrard the engine be a wotherspoon ten cylinder set v-fashion the power a hundred horse so tommy have observe and report and so i repeat to you as we watch we see the boat push out into the river turn towards the sea the engine so powerful buzz like a million bee a wave curl up in front and it speed away for holland like the shot of a arrow the night be fine the sea calm it would complete the voyage in safety but upon return what a surprise have be prepare for that motor-boat and its detestable owner what a surprise _ ma foi _ i yearn to hear of the denouement ` we will nab the fourth man who have stay behind ' whisper the officer and we creep towards the boat-house we be ten yard away when he issue forth and turn to lock the door then we spring upon he he be very quick -- like the big snake that he be he hear we spin round and strike two blow of he fist the sub-lieutenant get one upon he beautiful nose i get the other here under the jaw we be shoot sprawl upon the grass one to each side and the villain spring between we start to flee i be strike down but not stunned i be alert undefeated eager to resume the battle i rise to my knee i see the villain flee up the grass ah he would escape but i have not reckon upon the patrol leader the little owl the _ hibou _ of a boy scout so deft and courageous the spy flee but into he path spring the tiny figure of the owl he pole in rest like a lance they meet the man and the little owl and the shock of that tourney arouse the echo of the night the man hit in the belly by the point of the pole collapse upon the grass and the owl drive backwards by the weight of the man roll over and over like _ un herisson _ he be no longer a owl he be a round hedgehog i be consume with admiration for the gallant owl i get to my foot i jump across the lawn and fall with both knee hard upon the carcase so foul of the spy whom i have pursue all day he lay groan from the grievous pain in he belly and i put upon he the handcuffs before that he could recover the little tommy the hedgehog pick himself up stagger to the body of he enemy and there lean upon the admirable pole which he have not release in he somersault give forth a hoot of victory it be the day of tommy but for that morsel of a wise owl the spy would have escape i embrace tommy who wriggle with discomfort the sub-lieutenant shake he hand which he appreciate the more ` good work ' say the officer ` thank you sir ' say tommy that be all no emotion no compliment no embrace ` good work ' ` thank you sir ' _ ma foi _ what a people be the english we lock up the spy the sub-lieutenant tell I that wireless order have go out to the patrol spread far over the sea the boat of which we have the name and description would arrive at holland but upon its return on the morrow it would be seize and escort to harwich if by mischance it elude the patrol it would be capture when it arrive in the river crouch all be provide for the false news have go to holland and froissart have do good work i ask for no reward i will be like the english -- cold implacable when the officer say at parting to I ` good work m froissart we be much oblige to you ' i reply calmly ` thank you sir ' i have you will observe modelled myself upon the little owl and you mr dawson conclude froissart wipe he face for the effort of talk so much english have bring out the sweat upon he have you also succeed yes say dawson curtly i have also do my work but it be not exciting my man be no spy and the real news about the _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ will not get through to germany save roar froissart spring to he foot we be colleague most perfect we have do work of the most good _ embracon nous mon amus _ then occur that deplorable incident which have already be related froissart in he enthusiasm embrace the unresponsive dawson and be lay out by a short-arm jab upon the diaphragm it be really too bad of dawson but then as i have say he temper be atrocious \* \* \* \* \* the two battle-cruiser remain upon the shoal of picklecombe point all through November and well into the follow month the great salvage steamer with the arc light go away but other remain work seem to proceed though it be unaccountably slow in produce a result the three town lose interest in the derelict until one evening there fall upon they a blow which set they gasp for coherent speech the newsboy be cry in the street a special edition very special set in dirty type in a odd column head with the mysterious word stop press appear a announcement by the admiralty that far away in the south sea the battle-cruiser _ intrepid _ and _ terrific _ under the command of vice-admiral stocky have meet and sink the lately victorious german squadron it be glorious news but the three town think little at the moment of the glory they urgently hunger for a explanation of the inscrutable means by which two battle-cruiser mine and cast upon the shoal below mount edgecumbe under they very eye could race hot foot to the south sea and there lay out a german squadron as soon as the winter dawn break a immense crowd surge upon the hoe gaze into blank space the two battle-cruiser which for a month have lie helpless before they be go go too be the salvage steamer and the patrol boat the water which have be so active and crowded be void then the three town understand they grasp man woman and child the great spoof of which they have be the interested victim and they approve laughter rise to heaven for in all that appertain to the royal navy every one bear within the circuit of the three town be very wise indeed part iv _ the captain of marine _ chapter xv dawson reappear i have see nothing of dawson during my intimate association with madame gilbert he have write to I copiously -- for a very busy man he be a curiously voluminous letter-writer he always employ the back of official form and write in pencil he handwriting large and round be that of a man who have receive a good and careful board school education but be quite free from personal characteristic dawson 's letter in no respect resemble the man they be very long very dull and very crudely phrase he have evidently try to put they into what he conceive to be a literary shape and the effect be deplorable one may read such letter the work of unskilled writer in the newspaper which devote space to correspondence the writer like dawson can probably talk vividly and forcibly use strong nervous vernacular english but the moment they take the pen all thought and individual character become swamp in a flood of turgid commonplace jargon i be disappoint with dawson 's letter and i be sure that he will be even more disappointed when he find none of they make immortal in this book he purpose in send they to I will have be ruthlessly defeat a week after madame have vanish down my lift for the last time dawson -- in the make-up with which i be most familiar -- call upon I at my office he also come to say good-bye for a turn of the official wheel have come and he be order south to resume he duty at the yard he be he tell I take a last tour of inspection to make certain that the secret service net which he have design and lay would be deftly work by the hand of he subordinate i shall not be sorry say he to get back to my desert family and to be once more the plain man dawson whom god make you have so many different incarnation i observe that i wonder the original have not escape you memory he smile if i have forget say he my wife would soon remind I she always insist that she marry a certain man dawson and decline to recognize any other so if i come south to visit you i shall see the original you will thanks say i i will come at the earliest opportunity i do not say that if you call at the yard you will see quite the same person whom you will meet at acacia villa primrose road tooting that would be too much to expect but under any guise dawson i be always sure of know you yes confound you i would give six month ' pay to know how you do it you shall know some day and without any bribery now that you be here talk talk talk i want to get the taste of those rotten letter of yours out of my mouth he look surprised and hurt he look exactly as a famous sculptor look who when a beautiful work of he hand be unveil wish I to publish a descriptive sonnet from he pen i bluntly refuse he be a admirable sculptor but a dreadful sonneteer yet in he secret heart he value the sonnet far above the statue in this strange way we be make i do not conceal from dawson my interest in madame gilbert and he rather rudely express strong disapproval he suggest that for a married man i be much too free in my way that woman be full of brain say he but she be the artfullest hussy ever make she will turn any man around she pretty finger if he give way to she she have make a nice fool of you and of that ass froissart she even try she little game with I -- with I indeed but i be too strong for she i regard dawson with some interest and more pity the poor fellow do not realize that madame have for year mould he to she hand like potter 's clay she have master he by ingenuously pretend that he stand upon a serene pinnacle far remove from she influence he have preen he feather and do she bidding we be not all strong -- like you dawson say i mildly i switch dawson off the subject of madame gilbert and direct he mind towards the contemplation of he own exploit when handle judiciously he will talk freely and frankly give away official secret with both hand but he confidence always relate to the past to incident complete when he have a delicate job on hand he can be as close as the english admiralty even to I he have no sense of proportion again and again he have recount the interminable detail of case in which i take not the smallest interest and have ignore all my effort to dam the unprofitable flood of narrative and to divert the current into more fruitful channel he look at everything from the dawson standpoint and care for nothing which do not add to the glory of dawson unless he fill the stage a incident have for he no value or concern happily for I the most startling of he exploit that of bend a timid war committee of the cabinet to he will in the winter of 1915-1916 and of bluff into utter submission nearly a hundred thousand rampant munition worker who be eager to down tool fulfil all the dawson condition of importance he and he alone fill a star part to he and to he alone belong the success of a incredibly bold maneuver i have draw dawson as i see he in he weakness and in he strength i have reveal he vanity and the carefully hide tenderness of he heart in my whimsical way i have perhaps treat he as essentially a figure of fun but though i may smile at he even rudely laugh at he he be a great public servant who once at least -- though few at the time know -- save he country from a most grievous peril in the early week of 1916 when work for the navy and work in the gun and ammunition shop which be rapidly be organise all over the country be within a very little of be suspend by a general strike of workman terrify for they threaten trade-union privilege the strength and resource of dawson put forth boldly in the north dam the peril at its source in spite of the penalty lay down in munition act in spite of the power vest in military authority by the defense of the realm regulation there would have be a great strike and both the navy and the new army would have be hang up gasp for the ship the gun and the supplies upon which they have base all they plan for attack and defense the danger arise over that still insistent problem -- the dilution of labor the new army have withdraw so many skilled and unskilled workman from the workshop and the demand for munitions of all kind be so overwhelming that wholly new and strange method of recruit labor be urgent woman must be employ in large number in million machinery must be put to its full use without regard for the restriction of union if the country be to be save many of the younger and more open-minded of the trade-union official have enlist many of those older one who remain could not bend they stiff mind to the necessity for new condition they be not consciously unpatriotic -- they son be fight and die they be not consciously seditious though secret enemy agent move amongst they and talk treason with they in the jargon of they trade they simply could not understand that the hardly win privilege of peace must yield to the greater urgency of war civilian come north to examine the position on behalf of the ministry of munitions they come wring they hand and report in terror that if dilution be press a hundred thousand man would be out yet the risk have to be take for dilution must be press dawson be hard at work sweeping into he widespread net all those whom he know to be enemy agent and all those whom he suspect it be not a occasion for squeamishness with the consent of he official superior he pick up with those prehensile finger of he many of the most troublesome of the union agitator and deport they to safe spot far distant where they be constrain to cease from trouble still the danger increase and he see that a few day only could intervene between industrial peace and war already the manufacture of heavy howitzer for the spring offensive have be stop -- by a cunning embargo upon small essential part -- and the moment have arrive for a trial of strength between authority and rebellion he make up he mind plainly tell he chief what he plan be obtain they whole-hearted concurrence and go south by the night train by telegram he have send a ultimatum which strike awe into the official mind unless he wire in code the cabinet want a revolution it have better meet at once and call I in unless it do this at once i shall not go back here i shall resign and leave the government in the soup where it deserve to be such a message from a man who in official eye be no more than a chief inspector of police be in itself a portent it reveal how completely war have upset all official standard and convention to the chief he commissioner he open he mind freely i be about feed up with politician and lawyer say he there be big trouble come and not a man of they all have the pluck to get he blow in first i have always find that man will respect a order -- they like to be govern -- but they despise slop what the devil 's the use of minister go north and tell the man how well they have do and how patriotic they be when the man themselves all know that they have do damn badly and mean to do worse i could settle the whole business in twenty-four hour they be frightened man dawson say the chief that be the matter with the government they have be bring up to slobber over the public and try to cheat it out of vote they can not tell the truth when hard deadly reality break through they web of make-believe they cower together in corner and howl i doubt if you will get a free hand dawson what do you want -- martial law yes that or something like it if i have the threat of it at my back so that it rest with I and I alone to put it into force i shall not need to use it but i must go north with the proclamation in my pocket or i shall not go north at all here be my resignation dawson toss a letter upon the table and laugh the chief pick it up and read the curt line in which dawson deliver he last word good man comment he that be the way to talk they can not understand how any man can have the grit to resign a fat job before he be kick out they never do they compromise you may put starch into they soft backbone but personally i doubt the possibility but at least you will get you chance there be to be a meeting of the war committee the first thing to-morrow morning and you be to be summon i tell the home secretary that i should resign myself if they do not give you a full opportunity to state you case i will support you as long as i be in this chair dawson hold out he hand thank you he say simply the two man clasped hand and look into one another 's eye it be a good country dawson say the chief -- a jolly good country and worth big risk to oneself it will be save by plain honest man if it be to be save at all we worst enemy be not the german but we flabby-fibred political class at home the people be just cry out to be tell what to do and to be make to do it yet nobody tell they do not let the cabinet browbeat you and smother you with plausible sophistry just talk plain english to they dawson i will for once in they sheltered life they shall hear the truth for what follow dawson be my principal but not my sole authority i have test what he tell I in every way that i could and the test have hold somehow -- i be prepare to believe in the manner tell by he -- he force the cabinet to give he the authority for which he ask and he use it in the manner which i shall tell of he hold what be always a first-rate advantage : he know exactly what he want no more or less and be prepare to get it or retire from official life those who give to he authority give it reluctantly -- give it because they be between the devil and the deep sea they would gladly have throw over dawson but they could not throw over the civil and military power who support he in he demand and have they throw he over they would have be leave to deal by they incompetent unaided self with a strike in the midst of war which might have spread like a prairie fire over the whole country but though they bent before dawson i be very sure that they do not love he and that he will never be the chief commissioner of metropolitan police against he name in the official book stand a mark of the most deadly blackness strength and success be never pardon by weakness and failure when at last dawson be summon to the sit of the war committee he find himself in the presence of some half a dozen elderly and embarrassed-looking gentleman arrange round a big table they have be discuss he and try to devise some decent civil means to get rid of he he and he story of the come strike in the north be a distressful inconvenience a intolerable intrusion upon a quiet life when he enter he be without a friend in the room except the war minister who love a man who know he own mind and be prepare to accept big responsibility but even he doubt whether it be possible to achieve the result aim at with the means require by dawson we friend suffer from no illusion i know what i be up against he say to I long afterwards i know that they be all longing to be quit of I and to go to sleep again but i have make up my mind that they should get some very plain speaking i would compel they to understand that what i offer be a forlorn chance of avert a civil war and that if they refuse my offer they would be leave to themselves -- not to stamp out a spark of revolution but to subdue a roar furnace they could take they choice in the certain knowledge that if they choose wrongly the north would be in flame within forty-eight hour it be a great experience mr copplestone i have never enjoy anything half so much dawson be offer a chair set some six foot distant from the sacred table but he prefer to stand he early training hold and he be not comfortable in the presence of he superior in rank or station except when stand firmly at attention the prime minister fumble with some papers look over they for a few embarrassed minute and then speak great pressure have be place upon we mr dawson to see you and to hear you report great pressure -- to my mind improper pressure i have here letter from magistrate lord lieutenant competent military authority naval officer superintend shipyard official of the munitions department they all declare that the industrial outlook in the north be most perilous and that at any moment a situation may arise which will be fraught with the gravest peril to the country we have reply that the law provide adequate remedy but to that the retort be make that the man who be at the root of the grave trouble pend snap they finger at the law we be press to take counsel with you though why the high officer who communicate with I should as it be shift they responsibility upon the shoulder of a chief inspector of scotland yard i be at a loss to comprehend what i would ask of my colleague be this : who be in fact responsible for the maintenance of a due observance of law in the northern district from which you have come and where you appear to discharge unofficial and wholly irregular function who be responsible perhaps my learn friend the home secretary can enlighten we the prime minister pause and smile happily to himself he have at least make thing nasty for a intrusive colleague but the home secretary suave alert be not to be catch he at any rate be not prepare to admit responsibility it be possible sir he say that in some vague undefined constitutional way i be responsible for the police service of the unite kingdom but happily my direct charge do not in practice extend beyond england the center of disturbance appear to be on the northern side of the border within the jurisdiction of the secretary for scotland it be possible that my right honorable friend who hold that office and whom i be pleased to see here with we will answer the prime minister 's question he be responsible for he obstreperous countryman the home secretary pause and also smile happily to himself he have evade a trap and have involve a unloved colleague in its mesh what more could be require of a highly place minister god forbid cry the scottish secretary hastily these aggressive and troublesome workman be no countryman of mine it be true he add pensively that when i be in the north i claim that a somewhat shadowy scottish ancestry make of I a scot to the finger tip but no sooner do i cross the border upon my return to london than i revert violently to my english self a kindly providence have ordain that the central scottish office should be in london and my urgent duty compel I to reside there permanently which be indeed fortunate it be true that technically my responsibility cover everything or nearly everything which occur in the unruly north but i do not interfere with the discretion of those on the spot who know the local condition and can deal adequately with they i be content to rest my action upon the advice of those responsible authority whose consider opinion have be quote by the prime minister the prime minister smile no more the wheel which he have jog so agreeably have come full round and in colloquial speech have biff he in the eye he fumble the papers once more and frown it seem to I plaintively put in the first lord of the admiralty -lrb- a political chief very different from the one whom dawson encounter in chapter xii -rrb- though i be a child in these high matter that no one be ever responsible for the exercise of those duty with which he be nominally charge for consider my own case though i be the first lord and attend daily at the admiralty i be convince that the active and accomplished young gentleman whom i have the misfortune to succeed regard himself as still responsible to the people of this country for the disposition and control of the fleet at least that be the not unnatural impression which i derive from he frequent speech and newspaper article there be a general laugh in which all join except the war minister and dawson they be not politician if there be a big strike growl the war minister the spring offensive will be off it be threaten now very seriously i be month behind with my howitzer he colleague look reproachfully at the famous warrior and shift uneasily in they chair he have a uncomfortable habit of blurt forth the most unpleasant truth yes put in the minister for munitions we be behind with the howitzer and with ammunition of all kind but what can one do with these savage brute in the north i go there myself and speak plainly to they by god 's grace i be still alive though at one moment i have give up myself for lose at one work where i make a speech the audience be arm with what i believe be call monkey wrench and show a almost uncontrollable passion for launch they at my head i be hustle and wellnigh personally assault like my patriotic friend the scottish secretary i be very happy indeed when i get south of the border the central office of the munitions department be happily in london and my urgent duty compel I to reside there permanently i have no leisure for rove expedition this be very interesting break in the first lord who lay back in he chair with shut eye there appear to be no eagerness on the part of any one of we to stick he hand into the northern hornet ' nest or to admit any responsibility for it all of we that be except we courageous and silent friend mr dawson he open he eye and smile most winningly towards dawson would it not be well if we give he a opportunity of tell we what he view be i have be wait for he to begin growl the war minister we be at you service mr dawson say the prime minister graciously dawson standing stiffly at attention have closely follow the conversation and as it proceed he heart sink he despair of discover courage and quick decision in the group of minister before he yet when call upon he make a last effort if the country be to be save it must be save by its people not by its politician and he be a man of the people resolute endure long suffer gentleman say he we be threaten with a strike in the northern shop and shipyard which will cripple the country it will begin within forty-eight hour i can stop it if i go north to-night with the full power of the government in my pocket and with the means for which i ask all the authority in the north civil military and naval have approve of my plan i ask only leave to carry they out you plan be snap the war minister to get my blow in first say dawson simply the first lord again look at dawson and a glint of fight light flash in he tired eye thrice arm be he who have he quarrel just and four time he who get he blow in first how would you do it mr dawson yes how eagerly inquire the war minister i have serve say dawson in most part of the world when in west africa one be attack by a snake one do not wait until it bite one cut off its head you have serve ask the war minister in what service the red marine proudly answer dawson ah the war minister be plainly interested and dawson have during the rest of the interview no eye for any one except for he and for the first lord he recognize these two as brother fight man the other he wave aside as civilian truck ah the red marine long service man the best we have so you would cut off the snake 's head before it can bite to-morrow afternoon explain dawson i must attend a meeting of shop steward over two hundred of they they contain the head of the snake give I power a proclamation of martial law which i may show they and i will cut off the snake 's head you soldier be always prate about martial law grumble the prime minister we have give to you the amplest power under the defense of the realm act and the munitions act to punish striker those be sufficient i have no patience with plan for enforce a military despotism excuse I sir say dawson patiently as to a child but if a hundred thousand man go out on strike you act of parliament will be waste paper you can not lock up or fine a hundred thousand man and if you could you would still be unable to make they work no means have ever be devise to make unwilling man work except the lash and that be useless with skilled labor no one in the north care a rap for act of parliament but there be a mystery about martial law which carry terror into the hardest heart and the most stupid brain i want a sign proclamation of martial law but i undertake not to issue it unless all other form of pressure fail i must have it all in cold print to show to the shop steward when i strike my blow without that proclamation i be helpless and you will be helpless too by Friday next this be Wednesday unless i cut off the snake 's head to-morrow it will bite you here even in you sheltered london the prime minister fumble once more with the papers before he but they give he no comfort all advise the one measure of give full authority to dawson and of trust to he energy and skill dawson be a man of the people and know he own class he can deal with the man we can not so the urgent appeal run and if you do not succeed if you proclaim martial law and we have to enforce it where shall we be then no worse off than you will be anyhow by Friday say dawson curtly so you say but suppose that we think you needlessly fearful suppose that we prefer to wait until Friday and see what then you will see what have not be see in we country for over a hundred year retort dawson you will see artillery firing shot gun in the street the prime minister shrug he shoulder but the war secretary turn to he pile of map and pick up one on which be mark all the depot and training camp in the northern district how many man do you want he ask no khaki thank you reply dawson it be not train and the workman be use to it to they khaki means they son and brother and friend dress up i want my own soldier of the _ sea regiment _ in service blue i want eighty man from my old division at chatham eighty cry the war minister -- eighty man you be go to stop a revolution with eighty red marine i could perhaps do with fewer explain dawson modestly but i want to make sure work give I eighty marine none of less than five year ' service a couple of sergeant and a lieutenant -- a regular pukka lieutenant give they to I and make I temporarily a captain in command and i will engage to cut off the snake 's head you can have my own head if i fail the great war minister rise walk over to dawson and shake he embarrassed hand it be a pleasure to meet you mr dawson say he the first lord now fully awake sit up and stare earnestly at the detective those two the chief of the navy and the army have grasp the startling fact that for once they be in the presence of a man the other see only a rather ill-dressed intrusive vulgar police officer i have rarely meet a man with so economical a mind go on the war minister who resume he seat if you have ask I for eight thousand i should not have be surprise he turn to the prime minister if we resolute friend here can stop a revolution with eighty red marine let he have they in god 's name oh he can have the marine growl the prime minister -- if the first lord agree they be in he department and if it please he to dress up as a temporary captain that be nothing to I but i draw a firm line at any proclamation of martial law well ask the war minister of dawson what say you i must have the proclamation my lord reply dawson not to put up in the street but to show to the shop steward they will not believe that the cabinet have any spunk until they see the proclamation sign by you they know that what you say you do -lrb- great heaven i say to dawson when he recount to I the detail of he surprising interview with the war committee tact be hardly you strong suit you could not have ask more plainly to be kick out the flabbier a cabinet be the more convinced be its member of adamantine resolution if i have to go down and out reply dawson i have determine to go fight i be there to speak my mind not to flatter anybody -rrb- the silence which follow this awful speech could be feel the prime minister gasp flush to the eye and half rise to dismiss dawson from the room he himself think for a moment that all be lose when through the tense atmosphere run a ripple of gay laughter it be the first lord who with instant decision have take the only mean to save he new friend dawson he have a delightfully infectious silvery laugh and the effect be electrical the war minister open he great mouth and bellow ha ha ha the minister of munitions put he head down on the table and shriek even the home secretary a severe humourless legal gentleman cackle the prime minister whose perception be of the quickest saw that anger would be ridiculous in the midst of laughter he admit the first lord 's victory and force a smile you be not a diplomatist mr dawson say he reprovingly like marcus antonius whisper the first lord as he wipe he eye delicately he be a plain blunt man the war minister pull a sheet of paper towards ' he and begin to write he scribble for a few minute make a few correction and then read out slowly the word which he have set down all present saw that the moment of acute crisis have arrive that be all that i want say dawson if you will sign that paper my lord i need not trouble you gentleman any longer i be one of he majesty 's principal secretary of state observe the war minister shall i sign sir i believe remark the home secretary primly that if one have regard for strict historical accuracy there be but one secretary of state and that i be that one i will not trouble you say the war minister i be technically responsible for the country over which i be suppose to rule put in the scottish secretary plaintively i speak of course under correction but north of the border my signature might -- you be not a secretary of state growl the war minister and you seat be not safe no one shall sign except myself for i have no need to seek after working-class vote dawson and i will face this music and if i decline to permit you to sign ask the prime minister blandly this be not a cabinet meeting and we have no power to commit the government to so grave a step you will require to fill up the vacant position of secretary for war come the answer and also the humble post of first lord of the admiralty murmur that high officer of state we be up against reality and cabinet etiquette can go hang for I the war minister again read aloud what he have write sign it carefully and deliberately and rise up hand it to dawson get it print at once and go ahead mr dawson captain dawson rmlus correct the first lord who also rise and warmly shake hand with the new captain you shall be gazette at once i will see the adjutant-general myself and give order to chatham you have both make up you mind inquire the prime minister quite say the war secretary the first lord nod very good reply the prime minister i consent we must above all thing preserve the unity of the cabinet in these circumstance of grave national crisis clear out dawson whisper the first lord dawson clear out chapter xvi dawson strike it be a little past noon and dawson have much work to do before he could be free to speed north by the midnight train first he skip across to the yard and into the private room of he firm friend the chief to he he show the potent proclamation and recount the method of its extraction i think that i be in a company of jackal say he at the end but i be wrong -- two of they be lion we should be in a bad way if there be no lion comment the chief those two and another who be dead save south africa there be one or two more but not many what shall you do with this we will set it up on we own private press and run off a couple of hundred placard the secret must not leak out i be play for surprise the chief strike a bell the order be give and dawson 's priceless proclamation vanish into the lower region now inquire the chief chatham explain dawson to pick up my man -- and to get my uniform when tell the story dawson again and again describe to I he uniform with which i happen by family association to be intimately acquaint he do not spare I a badge or a button i be convince that no girl wear she first ball-dress with half the palpitating pride with which dawson survey himself in he captain 's kit when i chaff he gently and hint that the star of a captain be cheaply come by in these day he have one retort always ready not in the red marine he do not value he office of chief detective inspector a rap beside that temporary rank of captain of red marine he have you see be a private in that proud exclusive corps and its glory for he outshine all human glory he fly away to

take two sergeant only but in chatham there be four who have serve with he in the rank and he could not withstand they pleading when all be settle dawson go to the commandant 's quarter to be introduce to he second-in-command and surprise there that officer endeavor to squeeze he rather middle-aged figure within the button limit of a subaltern 's tunic since the senior officer of marine

a couple of stage villain with soft hat pull down over they eye -- the field-marshal and the first lord you have some friend sir i be only a ranker say dawson humbly with very temporary star not a pukka officer and gentleman like you i hope that you do not mind share ' a sleeper with I i should be proud to share with you the measliest dug-out in a flander graveyard reply the colonel emphatically the two officer so anomalously associate enter they berth the best of friend and talk together far into the night and as they talk the colonel now a lieutenant make the same discovery which have startle dawson 's two powerful supporter of the morning in the police officer rough half-educated vain tender of heart he also have discover a man but for I and my red marine say dawson as they turn in for some broken sleep those poor fool up yonder would get themselves shoot in the street but i shall save they and in save they i shall save the country \* \* \* \* \* it be the afternoon of the follow day just twenty-four hour after dawson have commandeer the resource of chatham and the scene be a public hall in a big industrial city in the body of the room sit two hundred and thirty-four man -- shop steward and district trade union official -- and they face be gloomy and anxious they have come for a last meeting with the officer of the munitions dept and to declare that the man whom they represent be resolve not to permit of any further dilution of labor the great majority of they be not unpatriotic they son and brother and friend have join the force and have already fight and die gallantly but they be intensely suspicious to they the employer the capitalist be a greater because more enduring and insidious enemy than the german dilution of labor have become in they eye a device for destroy all they hardly win privilege and restriction and for deliver they bind and helpless to they capitalist oppresser to this sorry pass have the perpetual dispute of peace bring the workman under stress of war rate of pay do not enter into the dispute -- never in they life have they earn such wages -- its origin lead in a queer pervert sense of loyalty to the trade union and to those member who have go forth to fight what will we folk say ask the man of one another when they come home from the war if we have give away in they absence all that they fight for during long year when it be attempt to make clear that the life of they own son in the trench be be make more hazardous by they obstinacy they shake they head and simply do not believe we can make all the gun and the shell that be want without give up we rule we value we son ' life as much as you do we love we country as much as you do the capitalist be use a plea of patriotism to get the better of we it be a pitiful deadlock -- honest for the most part yet it be a deadlock which as dawson say bring very near the day when english artillery would be firing shotted gun in english street at a small table on a low platform at one end of the room sit three civilian and a few foot away sit a little back be a officer whose uniform and badge attract the eye of the curious none of the workman know this brown-skinned man with the small dark moustache who look so very professional a soldier yet dawson know they every man of they and have move among they in they work many time ten of those present be actually he own agent work among they fellow unionist and agitate with they -- hidden source of information and of influence at need -- and yet not one of those ten know that the marine captain upon the platform be he own official chief the chairman rise to speak to the man for the last time and dawson sit listen and study a small slip of paper in he hand the chairman say nothing that the man have not be tell many time during the past few day but there be in he speech a note of solemn appeal and warning which be new the hearer shuffle they foot uneasily for most of they feel uneasy they be as i have say most of they honest man but when the chairman have sit down and the man begin one after another to reply it appear at once that there be present a element not honest even seditious dawson smile to himself and study he slip of paper for the snake whose head he have come to cut off be begin to rear itself before he hint begin to appear that there be a strong minority at least which be unwilling both to fight and to work for a country which be none of theirs -- what have this country do for we that we should bleed and sweat for it it have starve we and sweat we to make profit out of we and now in its extremity slobber we with fair word at last one man rise a thin-faced wild-eyed man who under happier condition might have be a preacher or a writer and deliver a speech which be rankly seditious the worker he declare be be shackle gag and rob we enemy be not the german kaiser we enemy consist of that small cunning treacherous well-organised and highly respectable section of the community who by means of the money power compel the worker to sweat in order that they belly may be full and they fine lady gown in gorgeous raiment they pass a munitions act to chain the worker to he master they ` dilute ' labor to call into be a invisible army which can be mobilise at short notice to defeat the struggle of striking artisan the attack of the master must be resist the worker must fight there be a fascinating attraction in the idea of meeting force with force violence with violence it be undeniable that many of the more thoughtful among the toiler would consider that they life have not be spend in vain if they organise they comrade to drill and arm rebellion the speaker pause he be encourage by a few cheer but the mass of he hearer be silent he glance at dawson whose face be set in a expressionless mask cheer come again and he go on but with less assurance the worker 's labor power be he only wealth it be also he highest weapon but the worker need not think of use this weapon so long as they be split and divide into sect and group and craft to be effective they must organise as worker a organization that would include all the worker skilled and unskilled throughout the entire country would prove irresistible but as matter stand at present i do not advocate armed rebellion i advocate and herewith proclaim a general strike he sit down and there be a long silence the die have be cast if the meeting break up without the emphatic assertion of the government 's authority then a general strike upon the morrow be as certain as that the sun would rise it be for this moment this intensely critical moment that dawson have work and fight in london and for which he be now ready the chairman sigh and wipe he face which have become clammy he look at dawson who nod slightly and then rise i call say he solemnly upon captain dawson he be now in supreme authority dawson spring to he foot alert decide and pick up a large roll of papers which have rest behind he upon he chair he place the roll upon the table and face the audience who know at once with the rapid instinct of a crowd that the unexpected be about to happen dawson pull down he tunic settle himself comfortably into he sam browne belt and rest he left hand upon the hilt of he sword -- it be a pretty artistic touch the wear of that sword and exactly characteristic of dawson 's method i laugh when he tell I of it -- there be two door to the room -- one upon dawson 's left hand the other at the far end behind the workman he raise he right hand and the chairman who be watch he press a electric bell then event begin to happen the door fly open and through each of they file a line of smart man in blue equip with rifle and side arm twenty man and a sergeant pass through each door which be then close the rank of each detachment be dress as if on parade and when all be ready dawson give a sharp order instantly forty-two rifle-butt clash as one upon the floor and the marine stand at ease at this moment the door at the far end might have be see to open and a officer to slip in who though white of hair have not apparently reach a higher rank than that of lieutenant it be all very fine dawson he explain afterwards you plan of leave I outside with the rest of the marine but it be not good enough i do not come north to be bury in the reserve you should have obey order reply dawson severely i should cheerfully assent the colonel-commandant of chatham but somehow i do not while dawson 's body-guard of marine be get into position before the door the workman surprise and trap be on they foot chatter and gesticulate the unfamiliar appearance of the blue-uniformed man not one of whom be less than five foot nine inch in height they well-set-up figure and stolid professional face give a business-like even ominous flavor to the proceedings which chill the strike leader to the bone they would have cheer a irruption of kilted recruit in khaki tunic as the come of old friend and would have feel no more than local patriotic hostility towards a detachment of english or irish soldier but these blue man of the sea regiment a integral part of the great mysterious silent navy have no part or lot with british workman rightly struggle to be free they represent some outside authority some potent overpower authority as no khaki-clad soldier could have represent it the surprise be complete the moral effect be staggering and dawson who have count upon both when he bring he marine north smile contentedly to himself he step forward with that little slip of paper in he hand and begin to read from it one by one he read out twenty-three name the very first be that of the man who have make the speech which i have report as name after name drop from dawson 's lip the wonder and terror grow who be this strange officer who could thus surely divide the goat from the sheep who be pick out one after another the self-seeker and fomenter of sedition who while he omit none who be really dangerous yet include none who be honest though mistaken as the list draw towards its end quite half the listener be smile broadly they could not have draw up a more perfect one themselves and they do not love most of those whose name be find upon it now say dawson when he have finish i must ask all those gentleman to step forward not a man move let I warn you that every man whose name i have read out be personally know to I if i have to come and fetch you i shall not come alone there be still some hesitation and then those upon the proscribed list begin to move forward they would willingly have hide themselves have that be possible but to be know and to be drag out by those hard-faced marine would have add humiliation to terror they come forth until all the twenty-three be range up before dawson then the man whose name be first upon the list rasp out what be you authority for this outrage upon a peaceful meeting i demand you authority you shall have it serenely reply dawson and go up to the pile of papers which he have lay upon the table he draw one forth and hold it up so that all might see it be a large placard boldly print a proclamation in cold terse language of martial law sign by the secretary for war himself martial law this be sheer militarism cry the first of those arrest for you and for these other twenty-two upon my list it be martial law reply dawson but for the rest it will be as they choose themselves sergeant remove the prisoner a sergeant step out the line of marine before the door divide and the prisoner be lead away dawson put the proclamation back upon the table square he shoulder and turn towards he audience now silent subdue and purge he plan be work very well i be no speaker he begin i be a man of the people one of yourselve i have make my own way and though i wear the uniform and star of a captain of marine i be really a officer of police chief detective inspector dawson of scotland yard he pause to allow time for this astonishing fact to sink in so that be why he have know the name and face of all the ring-leader of sedition and if he know so much what more might he not know even the most innocent among he audience begin to feel loose about the neck i know you all he go on there be not a man among you whom i do not know you -- or you -- or you he address those near to he by name we sympathise with you and have reason with you but you prove obdurate the king 's government must be carry on the war must be carry on if we country be to be save and those who have give power to I -- the power which you have see set out upon these papers the power of martial law -- will exercise they unflinchingly if there appear to be no other way but there be another and a better way you must obey the law which parliament have pass for the defense of the country and for the provision of munitions you rights be protect under they after the war be over you privilege will be restore for the present they must be abandon willingly or unwillingly they must be abandon i say just now that it be for you to choose whether martial law shall take effect or not the moment those placard be post in the street the military authority become supreme but they will not be post if you have the sense to see when you be beat what i have to ask to require of you be that to-morrow at the mass meeting of the man which be to be hold you will advise they to surrender unconditionally to work hard themselves and to allow all other to work hard there must be no more hold up of essential part of gun no more write and talk sedition we country need the whole-hearted service of we all if you here and now give I you promise that you will use every effort -- no perfunctory but real effort -- to stop at once all these threat of a strike i will let you go now and wish you god-speed if you fail then martial law will be proclaimed forthwith make this very clear to the man tell they that you have see the proclamation sign by the field-marshal himself and that i captain and chief inspector dawson will post the placard in the street with my own hand if you will not give I you promise -- i do not ask for any hostage or security just you promise as loyal honorable man -- i shall arrest you all here and now and deport you all just as those twenty-three have be arrest and will be deport you will not see those man for a long time you know in you heart that you be well quit of they if i arrest you all i shall not stop my arrest at that point there be many other -- many who be not workman from whom have come money for you strike fund and to offer bail when arrest have be make i shall pick they all up nothing that you can now do will affect the fate of those who have be take from this room whatever loyalty you may owe to they have be discharge and i will give you a quittance they chapter have be close what you have to consider now be the fate of yourselve and of many beside yourselve of all those who look to you for advice and guidance take time talk among yourselve consult one another i be not here to hurry you unduly but before you be allow to leave this room there must be a complete and final settlement he sit down the man split into group and the buzz of talk run through the room there be no anger or excitement but much bewilderment they have come to the meeting as master strong in number to dictate term yet now the table have be turn dramatically upon they no longer master they be in the presence of a force which at a word from dawson could hale they forth as prisoner to be deal with under the mysterious shuddering power of martial law they think of those twenty-three a few minute since so potent for mischief now bind and helpless in the hand of the blue man from the sea at last a elderly grey-locked man step forward and dawson rise to meet he we admit sir say he that you have we at a disadvantage we do not expect this proclamation nor those marine of yours we do not believe that the government mean business we think that we should have more talk talk and we be all sick of talk we be true patriot here -- you have take away all those who care nothing for they country -- and we feel that if you be prepare to use martial law and the force of the crown against we that you must be very much in earnest we feel that you would not do these terrible thing unless the need be very urgent we do not agree that the need be urgent but if you represent the government say that it be we have no course open to we but to submit if we now surrender unconditionally and promise heartily to use every effort to bring the mass of the man to we view will you in you turn give we you personal assurance that all we legitimate grievance will be fully consider and that every effort will be make to meet they you may crush we sir but you will not get good work from man whose spirit have be break i can not make condition reply dawson gently but ask yourselve why i bring my marine all the way from chatham to deal with this meeting be it not that i would not put upon you the pain and humiliation of arrest at the hand of you own son and brother though i stand here with gold star on my shoulder i be one of you my father work all he life in the dockyard at portsmouth and i myself as a boy have be a holder-on in a black squad of riveter i can make no condition but if you will leave yourself entirely in my hand and in those of my superior you may be assure that there will be no attempt make to crush you to break you spirit as he say these word a inspiration come to he and by sure instinct he act upon it jump down from the platform he approach the old sad-faced spokesman and shake he hard by the hand then he move along among the other workman address they by name chat to they of they work and private interest and show so complete and human a regard for they that they hostility melt away before he this man who have conquer they be one of themselves a tradesman like they one of the black squad of portsmouth a fellow-worker he be no tool of the hate capitalist if he say that they must all go back to work unconditionally well they must go but he be they friend and would see justice do they presently dawson be hand out cigarette -- of which he have bring a large supply in he pocket woodbine -- and the meeting of which so much be fear have apparently turn into a happy conversazione for half a hour dawson pursue he campaign of personal conciliation and then go back to he place upon the platform go in peace he cry come again to-morrow afternoon and tell I about the mass meeting there will be more cigarette await you and even possibly a bottle or two of whisky the man laugh and one wag call out three cheer for holder-on dawson the cheer be give heartily the marine stand aside from the door and the room rapidly empty the official of the munitions department and the colonel who be dawson 's insubordinate subaltern crowd round he spout congratulation he soak in they flattery as be he habit and then deliver a lesson upon the management of man which should be print in letter of gold man be just grown-up child say he and should be treat as child be always just praise they when they be good and smack they when they be naughty but if when they be naughty you spare the rod and try to slobber they with fine word they will despise you utterly and become upon the instant naughtier than ever what about that mass meeting to-morrow ask the colonel i shall not be there but ten of my man will be have no fear of the mass meet the snake 's head be off -- by to-morrow it will be two hundred mile away -- and though the body may wriggle it will be quite harmless after two or three hour of talk and vain threat the meeting will collapse and we shall get unconditional surrender and so it happen the talk go on for four solid hour -- vain vapouring talk during which steam be blow off at the end the surrender as dawson predict be unconditional that evening of the morrow a telegram speed away over the long wire to the south address to the secretary of the admiralty please tell first lord that the snake be dead i be return the marine carriage-paid and undamaged my commission as a captain be no longer require dawson back flash a reply from the minister himself : to captain dawson rmlus adjutant-general insist that you retain rank and pay until the end of the war so do i you have do a wonderful piece of work for which you will be adequately punish in official quarter but you will suffer in good company though dawson thus become entitle to call himself captain for the duration of the war he never use the rank or the uniform again once more to my knowledge he serve in he well-beloved corps but it be then not as captain but as private during he long watch in the _ malplaquet _ of which i have tell the story earlier in this book chapter xvii dawson telephone for a surgeon i have never be able to plan this book upon any system which would hold together for half a dozen consecutive chapter i be the victim of my character who come and go and pull I with they tie to they chariot wheel when i write the first story of the lose naval papers -- which by the way be not lose at all -- i have not make the personal acquaintance of william dawson when i write of my own encounter with dawson and of my share a humble share in he research my dear madame gilbert have not meet I and subdue I into a drivelling worship of she shine personality while i be amusing myself try to convey to the reader the frolicsome atmosphere which madame carry about with she and in which she hide the workings of she big heart and brain i be ignorant of the adventure of the two battle-cruiser and of dawson 's encounter with the war committee and of he triumph over the revolting workman of the north i have therefore write as it be from hand to mouth more as one who keep a vagabond diary than as one who consciously plan a work of art it be as a diary of personal experience that this book should be regard it have no merit of constructive skill for i have never know what the future would yield to I of material when dawson part with I to return south to the yard and to he desert family in acacia villa primrose road tooting i do not expect to see he again for month possibly year but a turn come to the wheel of my destiny as it have do to he i also be pluck from my northern place of exile and transport joyfully to the south country whither i have always flee whenever for a few day or week i could loosen the bond which tie I to the north now that those bond have fall entirely from I and i be back in my southern home -- whether for good or for evil rest upon the lap of the high god -- i have be able unexpectedly to resume contact with dawson and to bring this discursive book to some kind of a conclusion it can not really end so long as dawson and froissart and madame gilbert live and remain in friendly association with I they have become part of my life and if i have not outraged they feeling beyond forgiveness by what i have write of they i have hope that i shall meet all of they often in the future and that they will tell I many more story of they exploit \* \* \* \* \* as soon as i have settle myself in london i take the earliest opportunity of call upon dawson at the yard he be absent but he deputy who know my name receive I kindly he explain that it would not be easy to find dawson we never know where he be or what he be do i suppose that the chief know certainly no one else how can one be deputy to a man who never tell one what he be do or where he may be find i agree that the post seem difficult to fill adequately i wish i could chuck it as froissart do when he go back to pari have you ever see madame gilbert he inquire eagerly i observe that madame do I the honor to be my friend so you know she do you she be a clinker of a woman hot stuff but a real genuine clinker she could do what she please with old man dawson make he fetch and carry like a poodle she be the only woman bear who ever turn dawson round she finger i observe rather stiffly that madame gilbert be a lady for whom i have a very high regard and that the expression hot stuff be hardly respectful hum say the deputy eye I with interest so she have make a fool of you like she have of the rest of we even the chief get down on he rheumaticky old knee and kiss the carpet of he room after she have trodden on it the deputy tend to become garrulous and i cut he short with a inquiry for dawson 's exact address he live in acacia villa but i be without the precise number the deputy tell I and promise to inform dawson of my visit at the earliest moment it may be to-day or next week or next month it may not be till the war be over -- a expression which have come into colloquial use as a synonym for the greek kalends i thank the officer and withdraw somewhat annoyed it appear that dawson be not far away for a letter from he reach I two day later at my club it be a invitation to visit he home and to dine with he on the follow Sunday at one o'clock enclose be a plan design to assist I in penetrate the maze of toot that Sunday be a beautiful day in may and i wander down with plenty of time to spare to provide against the danger of be bush but with the aid of dawson 's thoughtful plan i find primrose road without difficulty the hour be then 1215 and the house desert dawson and he family be at chapel i have forget what i have hear month before of dawson 's fervor as a preacher upon truth until remind of it by a constable whose beat pass the house if you be look for chief detective inspector dawson say he i can show you where to find he in chapel he will be hold forth just now the opportunity of see dawson as he really be -- known certainly only to he wife and to god -- and of see he as a preacher spur I into active interest my relief be come now say the constable as soon as i have hand over i will show you the way as we walk together the policeman reveal to I the admiration inspire by dawson in he humble subordinate there be nothing that man can not do say he he be a skilled mechanic a soldier -- some say he have a general 's uniform hide away in he house -- a electrical engineer and a telegraph operator he have be all over the world in the royal navy and could if he like be command a ship now he be the friend of minister and secretary of state he be the best detective that the yard ever know and he preach to folk here like -- like the archangel gabriel come to trot 'em off to hell i be a wesleyan myself but i often go to hear the chief inspector he make one come out in a cold sweat and give a man a fine appetite for dinner he shake you up so that you feel empty he explain i observe that if dawson be so great a stimulus upon appetite he would not be popular with the food controller the policeman though he have hear of the food controller be unconscious of he many activity which show how little the world know of its greatest man it also suggest that police constable do not read newspaper the chapel be a building illustrative of the straight line and plane it be fairly large and so full that the crowd of worshipper bulge out of the door though we could not force we way inside we could hear the booming of a voice which be scarcely recognisable as that of dawson wave of emotion run so strongly through the congregation that we could feel they beat against the fringe by the door the chief inspector be on he game to-day whisper the constable he be hit they fine from which i judge that the constable have in he youth come from the north where golf be cheap it be a disappointment that i could not get in but perhaps well for the reader the temptation to record a genuine sermon by dawson might have prove too much for I presently the voice cease to boom the congregation squeeze out hot and oily like grease from a full barrel and i wait for dawson to appear do not speak to he now direct my guide let he get up to he house he can not talk for half a hour after hold forth there be not a word bad or good left in he carcase after all the worshipper have go there issue forth a party of three : a man a woman and a little girl there he be say the constable nudging I who ask i the chief inspector there he be with mr dawson and they little girl i stare and stare but fail to recognize my friend of the north i be too far away to see he ear and he face be quite strange to I i hope i whisper primly to the constable that mr dawson be sure he be she husband she ought to be be not you sure not yet i be not near enough to see properly that dawson be not a bit like those other whom i know that dawson those other be there more than one chief inspector dawson ask the man wonder i should say about a hundred reply i and leave he gasp i fear that he now think that either i be quite mad or that mr dawson be a pluralist in husband i give the dawson family sufficient time to reach they home and to recover the power of speech and then walk gravely to the door as if i have just arrive one become contagiously deceptive in the vicinity of dawson the stranger who be the real undisguised dawson welcome I to he home the house be a small one and the family keep no servant i do not know what income the chief inspector draw from the yard but be sure that it be absurdly inadequate to he service the higher one rise the less work one do and the more pay one get -- provide that one begin more than half-way up the ladder for those like dawson who begin quite at the bottom the rule seem to be invert : the more work one do the less pay one get i should judge my own ill-gotten income at twice or three time that of dawson -- which even that cautious judge euclid would declare to be absurd he lead I to the parlor which be well and tastefully furnish -- dawson have see good house -- and we wait there while mr dawson dish up the dinner please sit there dawson face the light say i let I have a good look at you he comply smile and i examine he feature with grave attention dawson the real dawson as i now see he for the first time be a very fair man he pale sandy hair can readily be bleached white or dye a dark color he use quick dye which can be remove with appropriate chemical he hair and moustache he tell I grow very quickly he complexion like he hair be almost white and he skin curiously opaque he blood be red and healthy but it do not show through he skin and hair be like the canvas of a painter always ready to receive pigment and ready also to give they up when treat with skill i begin to understand how dawson can make to himself a face and appearance of almost any habit or age he can be fair or dark dark or fair old or young young or old at will he carry the employment of rubber and wax inset very far indeed he nose he cheek he mouth he chin may be force by internal packing to take to themselves any shape i make a hasty calculation that he can change he appearance in seven hundred and twenty different way so many as that say dawson surprise when i tell he i do not think that i have go beyond sixty i assure he that on strict mathematical principle i have arrive at the limit number and it give he pleasure to feel that so many untried permutation of countenance remain to he in actual everyday practice there be rarely more than six dawson in be at the same time he find that number sufficient for all useful purpose a greater number he say would excessively strain he memory he have you see always to remember which dawson he be at any moment when he be pull my leg or that of he brave enemy froissart the number multiply greatly but as a work business rule he be modestly content with six i suppose i ask that here in acacia villa you be always the genuine article always he declare with emphasis once he go on i try to play a game on emma i come home as one of the other force my way into the house and be clout over the head and chuck into the street when i get back to the yard to alter myself -- for i have leave my tool there -- emma have be telephone to I to get the wicked stranger arrest for house-breaking i never try any more game woman have no sense of humor he shudder dawson be afraid of he wife and i picture to myself a great haughty woman with the figure and arm of a juno but when clara -- who ask kindly after my little jane -- have summon we to the dining-room i be present to a small quiet mouse of a woman whose head reach no higher than dawson 's heart this be the redoubtable emma do she really clout you over the head and chuck you into the street i whisper she do sir he reply smile she throw I yard over my own doorstep between dawson and he little wife there be a very tender affection in she eye he be not a police officer but a inspired preacher she know nothing of he professional triumph and would not care to know she i be very sure will never trouble to read this book to she he be the lover of she youth the most tender of husband and a boanerge who spend he sabbath drag fellow-creature from the pit the god of dawson and of he emma be a pitiless giant with a pitchfork busily thrust he creature towards eternal torment dawson in emma 's eye be a intrepid salvor with a boat-hook who once a week arduously pull they out dawson married emma when he be a sergeant of marine and i think that he have show to she he uniform with the three captain 's star to I she always speak of he as the captain though i could not be quite sure whether she mean a captain of marine or a captain in the army of salvation dawson he emma and clara be very happy very unite and i be glad that i see they in they own home i be help to understand how tender be the heart which beat under dawson 's assume cloak of professional ruthlessness at first i wholly misjudge he but i will not now alter what i then write my reader will learn to know they dawson as i learn myself whenever in the future i wish to hear from dawson of he exploit i shall not seek he at he own house he be a artist who be highly sensitive to atmosphere in acacia villa the police officer fade to shadowy insignificance even in he own mind then he be a husband a father and a mighty preacher he will talk of he disguise and in general term of he work but there be no fiery enthusiasm for manhunt when dawson get home to tooting i shall seek he at the yard or upon the hot trail then and then only shall i get from he the full flavor of he genius for detection dawson away from home be so vain as to be unconscious of he vanity dawson at home be quite extraordinarily modest he defer always to the opinion of emma and she gently kindly but with a air of infinite superiority keep he wander step firmly in the path of truth he be i be tell a most kindling preacher but it be emma who inspire he sermon once only during my visit do i see a flash of the old dawson the dawson of the _ malplaquet _ and of the war committee and that be just before i leave we be in the parlor smoking and i be get rather bore conjugal virtue domestic content and happiness be beautiful to look upon for a while but i confess that in a remorseless continuous film -lrb- feature dawson and emma -rrb- i find they boresome there be little humor about dawson and none at all about he dear emma i would gladly exchange fifty virtuous emma for one naughty madame gilbert we have be talk idly of we sport together and of he different incarnation suddenly he spring from he chair and he pale face light up now that i have you here mr copplestone i shall not let you go until you tell I by what trick you can always see through my disguise would you know I now as dawson of course say i there be no difficulty if you paint you face black and you hair vermilion i should still know you at once you have promise to tell I the secret tell I now i consider whether i should tell it be amusing to have some hold over he but be it quite fair to dawson to keep he in ignorance of those mark of ear by which i could always be certain of he identity he have be useful to I and i have make free with he personality yes i would tell he and in a few sentence i tell he grip he ear with both hand he feel those lobe so firmly secure to he cheekbone and those blob of flesh which remain to he of he wolfish ancestor he finger they carefully while he think at last he make up he mind it be the sabbath say he but when i be on duty i work ever upon the sabbath day it be now my duty to -- he reach for the telephone book take off the receiver and call for a number what be you do i ask though i ought to have know i be make a appointment with a surgeon say dawson the end end of project gutenberg 's the lose naval papers by bennet
