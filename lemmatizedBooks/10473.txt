provide with many opportunity for study the gentleman at arm 's - length racey naturally assume that the deal be a shady one personally he believe lanpher capable of anything which of course be unjust to the manager he courage be not quite sufficient to hold he abreast of the master in wickedness but he be mean and cruel in a slimy way and if leave alone be prone to make life miserable for someone invariably the someone be incapable of proper defense from farewell to marysville throughout the length and breadth of the great lazy river country lanpher be know unfavourably and dislike accordingly to he companion 's sneering remark lanpher make no intelligible reply he merely grunt as he reach for the gate to pull it shut he companion half turn -lrb- he back have from the first be toward racey dawson -rrb- and racey perceive the cold and roman profile of a long-jawed head then the man turn full in he direction and behold the hard feature vanish and the man display a good-looking countenance of singular charm the chin be a think too wide and heavy a trait it share in common with the mouth but otherwise the stranger 's full face would have find favor in the eye of almost any woman however critical racey dawson at first mind to reveal he presence in the corral thought better of it almost immediately while not by habit a eavesdropper he feel no shame in fortuitously overhear anything lanpher or the stranger might be move to say lanpher merit no consideration under any circumstance and the stranger in appearance a similar breed of dog as far as moral go certainly deserve no better treatment so racey remain quietly where he be and be glad that besides the pony to whom he be minister there be several other between he and the man at the gate why do not you wanna appear in this business persist the stranger pivot on one heel in order to keep face to face with lanpher i gotta live here be the lanpher reply well be not i gotta live here too and i do not see anything round here

then that be all right you can keep the man from throw in with the other side anyway can not you i can do that much which be quite a lot for a ranch manager to be able to do be the stranger 's blandly sarcastic observation c'mon we have gas so much i be dry as a covered bridge i -- what do thompson want now ` lo punch ` lo jack howdy lanpher racey could not see the newcomer but he recognize the voice it be that of punch-the-breeze thompson a gentleman well know to make he living by the ingenious capitalization of a utter lack of moral virtue say jack continue thompson nebraska have be plug plug great amazement on the part of the stranger plug who do it feller by the name of dawson racey dawson nip in lanpher yeah he lanpher chuckle slightly why the laugh ask jack harpe i would always think nebraska could shoot nebraska be suppose to be some swift admit the stranger how would it happen punch thompson tell he and on the whole give a truthful account what kind of feller be this dawson the stranger inquire after a moment 's silence follow the close of the story a skipjack of a no-account cow-wrastler promptly reply lanpher he think he be hell on the wabash allasame he must be old pie to put the kybosh on nebraska thataway luck sneer lanpher just luck be he square probe the stranger square as a billiard-ball say lanpher why jack he be so crooked he can not lay in bed straight at which racey dawson be move to rise and declare himself then the humor of it strike he he grin and hunker down he ear on the stretch well say the stranger refrain from comment on lanpher 's estimate of the dawson quality we 'll have to get somebody in nebraska 's place i be as good as nebraska punch-the-breeze thompson state modestly no the stranger say decidedly yo be all right punch but even if we can get old chin whisker drunk the hand have gotta be quicker than the eye y ' understand thompson it appear do understand he grunt sulkily we 'll have to give peach austin a show resume the stranger nemmine give I a argument punch i say i would use austin c'mon le 's go get a drink the three man move away racey dawson cautiously ease he long body up from behind the pony with slightly narrow eye he stare at the gate behind which jack harpe and he two friend have be stand now i wonder mused racey dawson i shore be wonderin ' what kind of skulduggery li'l mr lanpher of the 88 be a-trying to crawl out of and what mr stranger be a-trying to drag he into nebraska too huh i be wonder what that feller 's name be he kneel down again and swiftly complete the bandaging of the cut on the pony 's near fore as he ride round the corner of the hotel to reach main street he see luke tweezy single-footing into town from the south the powdery dust of the trail fill in and overlay the line and crease of luke tweezy 's foxy-nosed and leathery visage layer of dust almost completely conceal the original color of the cake and mat hide of luke tweezy 's well-conditioned horse it be evident that luke tweezy have come from afar in common with most range rider racey dawson possess a automatic eye to detail quite without conscious effort he brain register and file away in the card-index of he subconscious mind the picture present by the passing of luke tweezy the impression make thereby and the inference draw therefrom the inference be almost trivial -- merely that luke tweezy have come from marysville the town where he live and have he be but triviality be frequently paradoxical and always relative if dundee have not raise a arm to urge he trooper on at killiekrankie the world would know a different england a single thread it be that solve for theseus the mystery of the cretan labyrinth racey dawson do not like luke tweezy from the sparse and sandy strand of the tweezy hair to the long and varied line of the tweezy business there be nothing about mr tweezy that he do like for luke tweezy 's business be ready money and its possibility he drive hard bargain with he neighbor and harder one with stranger he buy county scrip at a liberal discount and lend he profit to the needy at the highest rate allow by law luke tweezy 's knowledge of what be allow by territorial law be not limit to money-lending he have be admit to the bar and no case be too small too large or too filthy for he to handle in he dislike of luke tweezy racey dawson be not solitary luke tweezy be as generally unpopular as lanpher of the 88 but there be a difference where lanpher 's list of acquaintance nod and otherwise be necessarily confine to the lazy river country luke tweezy know almost every man woman and child in the territory it be he business to know everybody and luke tweezy be always attend to he business he have nod and speak to racey dawson as they two pass and racey have return the greet gravely slimy ol' he-buzzard racey dawson observe to himself and reach for he tobacco but there be no tobacco the sack that he know he have put in he vest pocket after breakfast have vanish lack of tobacco be a serious matter racey wheel he mount and spur to the blue pigeon store five minute later smoke a grateful cigarette he again start to ride out of town as he curve he horse round a freight wagon in front of the blue pigeon he see three man issue from the doorway of the happy heart saloon two of the man be lanpher and the stranger the third be luke tweezy the latter stop at the saloon hitching-rail to untie he horse see yuh later luke the stranger fling over he shoulder to luke tweezy as he pass on he and lanpher head diagonally across the street toward the hotel it seem odd to racey dawson that luke tweezy by no word or sign make acknowledgment of the stranger 's remark racey tickled he mount with the rowel of one spur and stir he into a trot have to be move along if he want to get there some time that day he wish he do not have to go alone so he do the old lady would surely lay he out and he wish for company to share he misery why could not swing tunstall have stay reasonably in farewell instead of traipse off over the range like a tomfool might not be back for a week swing might not idiotic caper -lrb- with other adjective -rrb- of swing 's anyway why have not he use he head oh racey dawson be a exceedingly irritable young man as he ride out of farewell the ache and pain be still throbbingly alive in he own particular head the immediate future be not alluring it be a hard world when he and he mount be breast the first slight rise of the northern slope of indian ridge -- which ridge mark with its long broad-backed bulk the southern boundary of the flat south of farewell and force the marysville trail to travel five mile to go two -- a rider emerge from a small boulder-strewn draw wherein tamarack grow thinly racey stare -- and forget he irritation and he headache the draw be not more than a quarter-mile distant and he perceive without difficulty that the rider be a woman she quirt she mount into a gallop

be racey look at he from beneath level brow the lid of the stranger 's right eye drop ever so little it be the merest of wink yet it be unmistakable it recall they morning 's meeting more it be the tolerant wink of a superior to a inferior a wink that merit a kick quite so the keen black eye veer from racey to the girl the man remove he hat and bow with it must be say not a little grace miss dale nod coldly the stranger smile it be marvellous how the magic of that smile augment the attractive good look of the stranger 's full face it be equally singular how that self-same smile render

be make in company with lanpher the cause of say visit have be the rustling and butchering of a 88 cow which lanpher have ill-advisedly essay to fasten upon mr dale but due to the interference of chuck morgan a bar s rider who later marry jane dale lanpher 's attempt have be unavail it may be say in pass that lanpher have suffer both physically and mentally because of that visit of course he

and he outfit luke tweezy sit up very suddenly swing clap a hand over racey 's mouth and shove he backward shut up command swing he dunno what he be talkin ' about the poor drunk thus do swing tunstall come up to the scratch right nobly racey could have hug he instead he bite he this in order that swing should pull he hand away in a natural manner have achieve he purpose racey smile sottishly at luke tweezy but what be jack harpe do luke tweezy inquire swiftly it be not what he be do racey reply it be what he be gug-gonna do he be out to cuc-colddeck the bub-bar s a ' they nun-know it whereupon swing begin to shake he severely stop yore ravin he command and contrived to bang racey 's head against the wall with a bump that go a long way toward cure the pain of racey 's bite racey with real tear in he eye look up at swing and guggle i be sho shleepy then he lay he head upon he arm and sleep luke tweezy do not attempt to awaken he swing tunstall advise against it luke tweezy and he have a parting drink together then the money-lender take what be leave of the second bottle of whiskey -- the first be but a memory -- to the bar and endeavor to chivvy a rebate out of the bartender but such a procedure be decidedly not the happy heart 's method of do business luke tweezy much to he disgust for he never drink except in the way of trade be force to carry he bottle with he when he go swing sapient young person walk casually to the window and watch luke tweezy cross the street to calloway 's store then he return to racey 's table racey turn he tousled head sidewise and whisper from a corner of he mouth help I out to tom kane 's stable he be out o ' town and there will not anybody bother we c'mon racey come alive urge swing tunstall make a great business of shake awake he drunken friend you do not wanna stay here no longer i know a fine place where you can sleep it off ten minute later racey and swing be sit comfortably on a pile of hay in tom kane 's new stable racey pull off he boot flop down on the hay and clasp he hand behind he head he wiggle he toe luxuriously and laugh gawd say he think o ' that old skinflint buy nearly two bottle of whiskey bet that 'll lay heavy on he mind for as much as a month what you lookin ' at I like that for yeah i would ask if i be you i shore would what be yore bright idea of tellin ' luke tweezy we be gonna ride for jack harpe so be to watch he so he would know it so he would know it so he would know it the man sit there and say ' _ so he would know it _ ' and you call I a thickskull which yore head have get mine snow under thataway can not you see you droolin ' fool that now they 'll know as much as we do no oh no racey deny with a superior smile not never a-tall i be not say they might not know as much as you do by yoreself but not while you get the benefit of my brain they will not know as much as we do ` tai not possibil and what do you bite I for pursued swing disregard the slur hell 's bell if you would bit luke i would not have a word to say but why pick on I well you bump my head so hard i see spark so we be even say stop squallin ' about yore hand i do not bite you half as hard as i might have not half you can still use the hand all right can not you yeah well then you be not get anything to cry about not a thing talk sense will you you get we into a fine mess you have a fi-ine mess guess i fool he all right racey say with irritating complacency what be you try to do anyway swing snarled glaring at he friend what be the notion of tearin ' off all they confidence about bein ' bust and yore dear friend at the bar s and how you and I be gonna play detective and to think providence let a what-you-may-call-it like you go on live it be not reasonable that business of tell luke we be bust grin racey and ask he for a loan be just so i could work up roundabout and natural like to how the bar s bunch be my personal friend and how we be gonna ride for jack harpe and watch he on they account i want he to know those thing and i could not slam out and tell he dry so could i it would not sound natural it would make he think the wrong way you bet luke tweezy be not a plumb fool for all he make the mistake of deny he know jack harpe that be a bad one yeah but -- lookit swing we know that when lanpher speak of a front yard there in the hotel corral he mean the bar s range aw right while we be shore jack harpe want to hire we to do he dirty work -- which mean be rub out by we own friend likely -- would he let we ride for he if he think the bar s be pay we to watch he not if he know what he be do admit swing that be why i get so greasy and confidential with mister luke tweezy so jack harpe will know and luke will tell he will luke tell he luke will run to he a-pantin ' i 'll gamble jack harpe know the awful worst already so we 'll be safe enough to go to jack to-morrow morning bright and early and tell he we have decide to give he the benefit of we service but i think we figure not to ride for he say the now thoroughly bewildered swing of course we be not in word of one syllable swing i want to find out if it be the bar s jack harpe 's go against well then we know what we know and jack harpe know what we know he know if he turn we down to-morrow after offer we the job yesterday it 'll not only give we the absolute proof we want but it 'll make he turn he wolf loose p d q and that last will be good medicine because if i be any judge he be not ready to start anything yet awhile and i notice when a gent be not ready and have to jump anyhow he be a heap likely to fall down and smear himself all over the landscape the man 's right say swing but it be the oddest number alla same i ever do see all kind of clue to a crime and no crime yet it 'll come say racey dawson grimly jack harpe be one bad actor what you get against he -- i mean anything particular besides yore natural dislike swing tunstall at time be bless with flash of penetrate shrewdness i be not get any use for he thassall much emphasis on the part of racey dawson swing nod see he at moccasin spring be he drawled question i do not say so stiffly you do not have to and you do not -- not now i see it all and you yawpin ' out real loud how interested you be in see how the bar s get a square deal and let out only a small peep about old dale and think yo be foolin ' swing to a

yet why be she so infernally polite to luke tweezy she do not have to smile at he when he speak to she it be not necessary racey 's spirit groan within he finally the spectacle of the chatter group on the back porch of the blue pigeon prove more than racey could stand he retreat into a dark corner of the barn and lay down on the hay but he do not go to sleep far from it later he remove he boot stuff they full of hay and hunker down behind a dismount wagon-seat over which a wagon-cover have be fling with a short length of rope and several handful of hay he prop the boot in such a position that they stick out beyond the wagon-box ten or twelve inch and give every evidence of human occupation boost up with a bushel basket the stiff canvas at the end opposite the boot he make the wagon-cover stretch long enough and high enough to conceal the important fact that there be no leg or body attach to the boot which be do racey take up a strategic position behind a upended crate near the doorway he proceed to wait he wait quite a while the afternoon drain away the sun set in the dusk of the evening racey hear footstep swing tunstall he would know he step anywhere the individual

have racey be so inclined the man be strong and the knife be long -- and presumably sharp racey pinion he opponent 's knife arm with one hand and he tooth flash out he gun and smartly clip the man over the head with the barrel instantly so far as a active participation in the affair of the moment the man cease to function he lay limp as a sodden moccasin and breathe stertorously racey knelt at

however it prove a poor fit he have take tweezy 's hat by mistake he drop it on the floor and turn to pick up he own where it lay behind the wagon-seat but as we wheel a flicker of white show inside

out of the window good dog he continue presumably address a canine friend without leave swing 's nice new boot alone will you do not go gnawin ' at it thataway it be not a bone swing pull on he pants leave the room hop physically and mentally racey rest both elbow on the sill and wait happily for he comrade to appear beneath he shuck he say in a tone of great surprise when swing shot round the corner of the hotel i shore think there be a dog there a-teasin ' that boot i could have take my bible oath there be a great big black curly-haired feller with lot of tooth down there i see he swing shore think i do must ` a ' be mistaken and you go and believe I and get splinter in yore foot because you be in such a hurry never mind swing here be the other one he jerk the boot in question at he friend 's head and sit down on he cot to complete he own dress come then the sound of a prodigious yawn from the room next door occupy by jack harpe a cot creak a boot be scrape along the floor shore must be a sound sleeper say racey dawson to himself if he really do just wake up he buckle on he gunbelt set he hat a-tilt on one ear and go down to wash he face and hand in the common basin on the wash-bench outside the kitchen door but swing tunstall be before he and be dispose to make a issue of the drop boot only by he superior agility be racey enable to dodge all save a few drop of a full bucket of water djever get leave djever get leave singsonged racey from the corner of the building and set the thumb of one hand to he nose and twiddle opprobrious finger at he comrade you wanna be a li'l bit quicker when you go to souse I swing yo be too slow a lot too slow yep now i would not go for to fling that pail at I swing you might bust it and yore carelessness with crockery thataway have already cost you ten dollar and six bit this be too much for the ruffle swing wave the pail he pursue he tormentor round the hotel and into the front doorway racey flee up the stair at the stair foot swing give over the chase and return to the washbench to resume he face-washing racey go on into they room there be in it several article belong to swing that he intend to throw out of the window at once but when he have enter the room and the door be close behind he he do not touch any of swing 's belongings instead he remain standing in the middle of the room look thoughtfully at the floor what have give he pause be the fact that he have find the door ajar and he know with absolute certainty that he have close the door tightly before he go downstairs it be the vagrant straw that show the wind 's direction and since the attempt to bushwhack he racey be not overlook any straw the door have be ajar why there be no closet and from where he stand he could see under both cot no one lay conceal in the room the bedclothes on swing 's cot have not be touch at least they be in precisely the position in which they have be land when throw back by swing 's careless hand racey do not believe that he own have be touch either but the saddlebag and _ cantena _ lie on the floor at the head of he cot have certainly be move he recall distinctly have the previous evening pile the _ cantena _ on top of the saddlebag and now the saddlebag be on top of the _ cantenas _ he glance at swing 's warbag they have not be move he wonder if jack harpe and the starlight 's owner be still in they room he listen intently hear no sound he go out into the hall and knock gently on jack harpe 's door and call he softly by name get no reply he lift the latch and walk in there be jack harpe 's saddlebag _ cantena _ and rifle in a corner a coat lay on the tumbled blanket of the cot otherwise the room be empty racey go out be careful to close the door tightly and go to the room of the starlight 's owner this room too be empty racey return to he own room toss he _ cantena _ and saddlebag on the cot and begin feverishly to paw through they contents nothing have be subtract from or add to the heterogeneous collection of article in the _ cantena _ the contents of the off-side saddlebag be in they familiar disorder there be nothing in or about the off-side saddlebag to arouse suspicion not a thing he unbuckle the flap of the near-side saddlebag and flip it back somebody have be at this saddlebag he be sure of it he extra shirt instead of be wad into the fore-end of the saddlebag on top of a pair of sock have be stuff into the hinder end on top of a pair of underdrawer which underdrawer should by rights have be at the bottom of the leather hold-all but there be something else at the bottom of the saddlebag it be something long and hard and wrap in the buttonless undershirt despise and reject by swing racey unrolled the undershirt he eye stare in genuine horror at what the unrolling reveal it be the commonest of butcher knife that someone 's busy hand have wrap in the undershirt but what be not nearly so common be that the broad thin blade be stain with blood from point to haft the steel be as red as if it have be dip in a pail of paint indeed be dry it look not unlike paint but racey know that it be not paint it be dry before it be wrap in that undershirt he say to himself test the blood on the blade with a speculative fingernail there be not a mark on the undershirt gawd here it be again -- the earmark of a crime and no crime -- yet this be get monotonous he lay down the knife settle he hat and methodically search swing tunstall 's warbag it turn out a needless precaution he have feel that it would be but he could not afford to take any risk have find nothing in swing 's warbag save he friend 's personal belongings racey slide the knife up he sleeve and go downstairs to breakfast on the way he stop a moment at a fortuitous knothole in the board wall when he pass on he way the knife be no longer with he jack harpe be still eat when racey ease himself into the chair at swing 's right hand jack harpe nod to racey and go serenely on with he meal racey seize knife and fork square he elbow and begin to saw at he steak and as he chew and swallow and slosh the coffee round in he cup in order to get the full benefit of the sugar he wonder whether it be jack harpe or bull to whom he be indebted for the butcher knife it be one of the two he think who else could it be he believe it would be wise to spend most of he spare time in he room at least until he know the inwardness of the butcher-knife incident it be possible that the man who have secrete the knife would return racey might well be in line for other even more delicate attention before go up to he room racey go to the corral he have leave he saddle-blanket out all night he mention to swing in the hearing of jack harpe he be go five minute when he return strangely enough minus the saddle-blanket he be in time to see piney jackson dart round the corner of the blacksmith shop cup he hand at he mouth and raise a stentorian bellow for jake rule piney do not wait to see whether the sheriff reply to he call instead he beckon violently to the handful of man group on the sidewalk in front of the hotel c'mon over he bawl look what i find here this morning jack harpe and the owner of the starlight be among those present and respond to the invitation racey dawson take a chance and go with the rest look at that say piney jackson indicate a humped-up individual sit behind the woodpile racey and the other spectator go round the woodpile and view the humped-up individual the latter be bull the starlight bartender and he be dead very dead he throat have be cut from ear to ear he be a ghastly object who do it inquire one of the fool that infest every group of man he do not leave any card the blacksmith reply with sarcasm the fool ask no more question come then jake rule and kansas casey jake a rather heavy well-meaning officer old at the business begin to sniff about for clue kansa casey lay the body down on its back and thoroughly search the pocket of the clothing one thing say kansas casey look up from what he have find -- a handful of silver dollar a pocket knife and a silver watch robbery be not the motive racey look sidewise from under he eyebrow at jack harpe the latter be stare down unmoved at the dead body somebody must ` a ' have a grudge against bull offer the fool you think so say piney yo be a real bright feller the fool subside a second time lookit here jake piney continue to the sheriff 's address you do not have to kick my wood all over the county do you i be lookin ' for the knife explain the sheriff cease not to stub he toe against the solid chunk feller after do a thing like this get flustrated sometimes and drop the knife and find the knife might be a help in locate the feller all of which seem sufficiently logical to the bystander racey decide he have see enough besides he want to camp closer to he warbag he should have be in he room before this and he would have be have he care to make himself conspicuous by not go along with the crowd to see what piney jackson have find decline swing 's earnest invitation to drink he return to the hotel swing go grouchily to the happy heart wonder what be the matter with he friend it be not like the racey he know to play the hermit once in he room racey again explore he own and swing 's saddlebag and _ cantena _ look under the cot and through the bedclothes but he find nothing that do not belong to either himself or swing they do not make a second trip he say to himself i be bet it be jack harpe shore it be the polecat then in order to have a water-tight reason for remain in the room he pull off he boot and trousers fish a housewife from a _ cantena _ and set about repair a rip in he trousers it be a perfectly good rip he have have it a long time what more natural that on this particular day he should wish to sew it up it be a hour later that he hear the tramp of several pair of boot on the stair he could hear the wheeze labor breathing of bill lainey the hotel proprietor climb the stair always bother bill the latter and he follower come along the hall and stop in front of racey 's door this be he room pant bill lainey unceremoniously the latch be lift a man enter the man be jake rule the sheriff of fort creek county he be follow by kansas casey he deputy jake look serious but kansa be smile as he close the door behind he then he open it quickly and thrust he head into the hall no need of you bill he say aw right say bill aggrievedly and forthwith shuffle away kansas withdraw he head and nod to jake rule he be go he say racey dawson sit crossleg on he cot and ply he needle in most workmanlike fashion grin comfortably at the two officer lord how glad he be he have find that knife if he have not -- sidown gent invite racey there be two chair or you can have swing 's cot if you like jake rule shake he head we do not wanna sit down racey he say we get a li'l business with you maybe maybe then you be not shore about it not unless yo be willing you see dolan 's drunk to-day and of course we can not get a warrant till he be sober a warrant for I not yet say jake rule only a search warrant -- first but of course if you be not willing we can not even touch anything still racey put in kansas casey smoothly if you could see yore way to let we go through yore warbag yore and swing 's it would be a great help and we would remember it -- after yeah we shore would declare the sheriff you save we trouble now racey and i 'll guarantee to make you almighty comfortable in the calaboose you will not have nothing to complain of not a thing racey laugh cheerily get I in jail already have you he chuckle you 'll have I hung next oh they be quite some formality to go through before _ that _ happen declare the sheriff seriously i be glad drawl racey i think maybe you be fix to take I right out and string I up before dinner want to search we stuff huh hop to it swing be not here but i 'll give you permission for he he will not mind jake and kansa go at the warbag like terrier digging out a badger racey lean on he elbow and watch they what luck that the door have be ajar and that he have notice it if it have not be a life-and-death matter he would have laugh aloud at the end of twenty minute the officer stand up they have go through everything in the room include the cot kansas casey wear a pleased smile jake rule look disappointed do not look so glum jake urge racey be it a fair question to ask what yo be hunting for the knife he say shortly the knife that cut bull 's throat the knife huh remark racey as if to himself so yo be suspectin ' I of wipe out bull be you i never do say kansa promptly i know you you be not that kind jake look reproachfully at he deputy you never can tall racey he say turn to the puncher i have get so myself i do not trust nobody no more be this here yore own idea pursue racey or do somebody sic you onto I jake make no immediate answer it be obvious that he be of two mind whether to speak or not why not tell he suggest kansa what be the odds at this jake take a piece of paper from he vest pocket and hand it to racey i find this lie on the floor of my office when i come back after attend to bull be he explanation there be word print on the slip of paper they read : look in racey dawson 's room for what kill bull the communication be unsigned racey handed it back to jake rule get any idea who put it in yore office he ask jake shake he head i dunno he say the window be open anybody passing could ` a ' throw it in you satisfied now jake or -- racey do not complete the sentence oh i be satisfied you do not do it reply the sheriff if that be what you mean but -- the man who write this here _ joke _ as he speak he tear the note in two drop the piece on the floor and stamp out of the room kansa casey look over he shoulder as he follow in the wake of he superior he see racey dawson pick up the two piece of the note racey 's mouth be a grim uncompromising line if racey ever find out who write that think kansa to himself pull the door shut hell will shore pop and i hope it do for he like racey dawson do kansas casey the deputy sheriff chapter xv fire fire why do not you tell I at breakfast demand swing tunstall and give it away to jack harpe say scornful racey shore that would ` a ' be a bright thing to do now would not it what didja do with the knife drop it through a knothole in the wall the only way they 'll ever get hold of it be by tear the build down jack harpe if he _ be _ the feller will know you find it and try again shore we can not help that one thing we 'll know before the day be over whether it be jack harpe or not how remember I this morning tell you how i would leave my saddle-blanket out all night and then go out in the corral for the same i say it so jack could hear I he do hear I and he watch I go he see I go out round the corral and he see I come back without the saddle-blanket now anybody would know i would not leave my saddle-blanket out behind the corral would i not likely but a feller who have just find a knife with blood on it in he warbag might go out back of the corral to lose the knife might not he he might well that be what i do naturally have already lose the knife down through the knothole i could not lose she again but i do the best i could i dig in the ground with a sharp stick and i make a li'l hole like and i fill she in again and tramp she all down flat and sort of half smooth down the roughed-up ground like i be try to hide my track and what i would be do then i come away now i be bet that if jack harpe be the lad tuck away that knife in my warbag he 'll go skirmish out behind the corral to see what i be really do maybe doubtfully there be not any maybe if he be the man turn the trick and from where we be a-lay under this wagon we can see the back of the corral plain as -- there he come now the post of the corral be less than a hundred yard from where racey and swing lay

toward he friend racey dawson ride away westward munch pie and it be a very good pie and would have bring credit to any cook he regretfully eat the last crumb and roll a cigarette he feel fairly full and at utter peace with the world why not be not it a good old world and a mighty friendly world despite the harpe and tweezy and jonese that infested it i should say so racey dawson inhale luxuriously push back he wide hat and let the breeze ruffle he brown hair he rub the back of one hand across he straight eyebrow and stare across the range toward the distant hill that mark he goal which goal be the old c y ranch-house at moccasin spring on soogan creek where live the dale and they daughter molly and as he look at the hill and bethought he of what lay beyond it he draw a winchester from the scabbard under he left leg and make sure that he have not forget to load it for racey labor under no delusion as to the danger that menace not only he own existence but that of he friend swing he know that they life hang by a thread and a thin thread at that they be but two against many and they position have not be aid by the string of uneventful day succeed they advent at the bar s for they enemy be take they time in the launching of they enterprise and racey have not expect this it throw he off he balance somewhat certainly it worry he it be not humanly possible that jack harpe could be aware that old man saltoun do not believe what racey have tell he but he be act as if he know perhaps he be wait till nebraska jone should be entirely well of he wound that be possible but not probable jack harpe have not impressed racey as a man who would allow he plan to be indefinitely hold up for such a cause there be no tell when nebraska would be up and about he recovery thanks to past dissipation have be exceedingly slow again perhaps the delay might be merely a detail of the plan fat jakey pooley mention in he letter to luke tweezy or it might be due to the more-than-watchful care the dale and morgan be take of old mr dale wherever the old gentleman go some one of he relation go with he certainly no ill-wisher have be able to approach mr dale -lrb- since he spree at mcfluke 's -rrb- at any time mr dale to all intent and purpose be impossible to isolate at any rate whatever the reason the fact remain that harpe have not move and show no sign of move mr saltoun every time he meet racey take special pain to ask he puncher how much twice six time two hundred be then mr saltoun without wait for a answer would walk off slapping he leg and cackle with laughter even tom london be begin to take the view that perhaps he father-in-law be in the right after all you be here near two month now racey he have say that very morning and they be not anything happen yet i have get four month to go racey have reply with a placidity he do not feel now as he ride he eye closely scan the various place in the landscape provide good cover for possible bushwhacker he recall what loudon have say i 'll show he all the happenstance he want to see before i be through he say aloud something 's gonna happen something 's get to happen jack harpe will not let this slide not by a jugful the word be confident enough but they be word that he have be in the habit of repeat to himself nearly every day for some time perhaps they have lose some of they force perhaps -- twelve hundred dollar muse racey and the same for swing six month ' work for -- hell it can not turn out different i know it can not we 'll show 'em all yet will not we cuter old settler cuter old settler waggle he ear he be a companionable horse never kick human being and buck but seldom yep continue racey sit back against the cantle she be a long creek that do not bend some'er or other and then the creek that be he flow of think shot round a bend into the broad and sparkling reach of a much pleasanter subject than the one that have to do with harpe and tweezy and jonese after a time he come to where the pleasanter subject on she knee be weed among the flower that grow tidily round moccasin spring baby-blue-eye low and lovely cuddle down between tall columbine and orange wall-flower side by side with the pink geranium of old-fashioned garden the wild geranium nod its lavender bloom in perfect harmony the subject black-haired molly dale rest the point of she hand-fork between two row of ragged sailor and johnny-jump-up and lift a pair of the clearest softest blue eye in the world in greet to racey dawson this be a fine time for you to be traipse in she tell he with a smile that reveal a deep dimple in each cheek i think you promise to help I weed my garden to-day i do he return humbly dismount and slide the rein over cuter 's neck and head but you know how it be Sunday mornin 's molly there be a lot to do round the ranch sometimes now this mornin ' -- i 'll bet she interrupt smooth out the smile and frowning as severely as she be able i would just tell a man that i would i would indeed i be sure it must have take you at least half-an-hour to shine those boot half-an-hour more likely a hour why i can see my face in they and a very pretty face too say racey rise to the occasion if i own that face i would never stop look at it myself i mean -- he flounder aghast at he own temerity but the lady smile that 'll do she caution he do not try to flirt with I i will not have it i be not -- he begin and stop molly dale continue to look at he inquiringly but as he give no evidence of complete the sentence she lower she gaze and resume she weeding racey thought to have glimpse a disappointed look in she eye as she drop she chin but he could not be certain probably he have be mistaken why should she be disappoint why indeed start in on that bed racey she direct nod she head toward the columbine and wall-flower there be some of that miserable pusley inch in on the baby-blue-eye and they be such tiny thing it do not take much to kill they and lord know i have a hard enough job persuade 'em to grow in the first place wild thing never cotton to live inside a fence he tell she they be like injun thataway -- put 'em in a house and they do not do so well shuck look at the rainbow half-breed there be the difference and besides the rainbow be not live in a house since she leave the convent she live in a tepee same as she uncle and auntie i do not care defend molly straighten on she knee to survey she garden every single plant in my garden except the pink geranium be wild look at those thimble-berry bush round the spring and the blue camass along the brook and the squaw bush round the house and the squaw grass and pussy paw back of the clothes-line some i transplant the rest i grow from seed and where will you find a better-looking garden racey sag back on he heel and stare critically about he yeah he drawl nod a slow head they do look pretty good get to give you lot of credit but those squaw bush now -- he break off grin oh of course you provoke thing cry she irately might know you would pick on those squaw bush it be a mite too shady for 'em where they be but still they be do pretty well consider i be satisfied -- what be that that be a horseman appear suddenly among the cottonwood that belt with a scattering grove the garden and the spring the horseman be lanpher manager of the 88 ranch he be follow by another rider a lean swarthy individual with a smooth-shaven saturnine face racey know the latter by sight and reputation the man be one skeel and rejoice in the nick-name of alicran the furtive scorpion whose sting be death be not indigenous to the territory but mr skeel have gain the appellation in new mexico a region where the tail-bearing insect may be find and when the man leave the border for the border 's good the name leave with he oh lookout the bush the bush do not trample my thimble-berry but lanpher heed not at all molly 's cry of warn spur he sweating horse through the thimble-berry growth break down three shrub and splash cat-a-corneredly across the spring the brook and several row of flower the garden look as if a miniature cyclone have pass that way midway across the garden lanpher 's horse halted -- halted because a fly figure in chap have appear from nowhere and seize it by the rein but the horse do more than halt in obedience to a powerful jerk administer by the man in chap the horse pivot on its foreleg and slide its rider out of the saddle and deposit he a-sprawl and face downward among the flower lanpher arise snarl to face a level sixshooter it do not signify that racey have not draw the weapon he be perfectly capable of shoot through the bottom of he holster and lanpher know it and racey know that he know it get out of this garden order racey take yore friend with you he add toss the horse 's bridle to lanpher and if i be you i would walk a heap careful between the row i just would not go a-busting any more of these posy lanpher go he go carefully he be follow quite as carefully by racey dawson when lanpher be free of the neat row he look up venomously into the face of alicran skeel who have meticulously ridden round the garden i be wonder where you be lanpher remark with deep meaning i be not root up nobody 's gyarden alicran return cheerfully and do not wonder too hard might strain yore intellect or something i 'll always be where i aim to be -- always you do scratch yore face lanpher lanpher turn from alicran skeel and spat upon the ground alicran say racey hold he alert attitude the first false move you make lanpher get it i be not makin ' a move say alicran thumb hook in the armhole of he vest i get plenty to do mind my own business huh thus the sceptical racey who do not trust mr skeel as far as he could throw a horse by the tail shuck say alicran out of deference to the lady you do not believe I shore i do assert racey shore you bet you i -- _ careful lanpher _ i can talk to somebody else and watch you at the same time if alicran be worth a -- begin lanpher furiously and stop you be gonna say -- what query alicran softly nothing say lanpher sulkily put yore gun away he continue to racey i be not gonna hurt you now that be what i call downright generous of you lanpher racey declare warmly i would shore hate to be hurt i shore would but if it be alla same to you i 'll keep my gun right where she be -- if it be alla same to you that 'll do racey stop this rowing i will not have it it be molly dale push past racey and standing with arm akimbo directly in front of he gun-muzzle racey let he gun and holster fall up-and-down but he do not remove he hand from the gunbutt who do you want here molly inquire of lanpher lanpher 's rat-like feature crack into a ugly smile be yore paw home he ask father 's go to marysville when 'll he be back day after to-morrow i guess yeah i kind of guess he would want to spend the night so 's he could do business in the morning huh the lanpher smile grow even uglier he have some business to attend to in the morning yes i kind of thought he would yeah you do not happen to know the nature of he business do you he business be none of yours and i 'll thank you to pick up you foot and clear out the pair of you not so fast lanpher spread deprecatory hand and he smile become suddenly crooked i just come down to do yore paw a favor a favor you blank unbelief be patent in molly 's tone and expression a favor I you see yore paw 's get a mortgage come due on the tenth and the reason yore paw go to marysville be so he could be there bright and early to-morrow morning at the bank to renew the mortgage be not i right you might be molly 's face be now a mask of indifference but there be no indifference in she heart there be cold fear racey 's expression be likewise indifferent but there be no fear in he heart there be anger cold anger for he have sense what be come he know that the previous winter have be a hard one on the dale fortune they have lose most of they little bunch of cattle in a blizzard and the roof of they stable have collapse kill two team horse and a ride pony racey have conjecture that mr dale would have be force to borrow on mortgage to make a fresh start in the spring and at that time in the territory the legal rate be 12 per cent stiff to be sure but the security in those day be never gilt-edged -- cattle be prone to die at inconvenient moment and land be not worth what it be east of the mississippus we 'll take it i be right pursued lanpher lap he tongue round the word as though they possess taste and that taste pleasant and be that i be right i 'll say yore paw could ` a ' save himself the ride to marysville by stayin ' to home oh lanpher be the sort of man who as a boy be accustom to thoroughly enjoy the pastime of pull wing from live fly and drown a helpless kitten by inch now he nod he head and grin anew and put up a satisfied hand and rub he stubbly chin racey yearn to kick he it be shameful that molly should be compel to bandy word with this reptile racey step forward determinedly and slide past molly promptly she catch he by the sleeve do not mix in racey she command with set face it be all right it be all right i tell you ` course it be all right lanpher hasten to say more than a hint of worriment in he little black eye one could never be sure of these bar s boy they be uncertain proposition every measly one of they shore it be all right go on the 88 manager i be not mean no harm yo be take a lot for grant racey a whole lot for grant nemmine what i be take for grant flung back racey i get along with take only what be mine anyway which be equivalent to say that lanpher be a thief but lanpher overlook the poorly veil insult and switch he gaze to molly dale i just rid over to say he tell she that if yore paw be still set on renew the mortgage when he come back from marysville he 'll have to see I and luke tweezy at the 88 we do buy that mortgage from the bank molly dale say nothing racey feel that if he hold he tongue another second he would incontinently burst he sidestep past the girl you have say yore li'l piece he tell lanpher and for a feller who be bellyach so loud about keep out of this deal it strike I yo be a-getting in good and deep -- buy up mortgage and all dunno what i mean huh yep you do shore you do think back think way back and it 'll come to you jack harpe you know he bossy-looking jigger seem like have he be a-bear down on you lately lanpher must not let he run you thataway bad business might be expensive you can not tell you be careful lanpher you go slow -- a mite slow yep well do not lemme keep you this way out he flick a thumb westward and stare at lanpher with bright eye lanpher 's eye drop lift then veer toward alicran skeel that appreciative observer who continue to sit he horse as good as gold and silent as a clam lanpher turn to he horse without another word slide the rein over the animal 's neck and cross they slackly he stick toe in stirrup and swing up he look down at molly where she stand dumbly she troubled eye gaze at nothing and the finger of one hand slowly plait and unplait a corner of she apron lanpher open he mouth as if to speak but no word issue for racey have cough a peremptory cough lanpher turn he horse 's head toward the creek lookit here alicran the peevish lanpher burst forth when he and he henchman have ford the creek and be ride westward whatsa matter with you anyway with I alicran tilted a question bead i dunno i do not feel a mite sick what do you think i hire you for heatedly gawd he know business of roll a cigarette yo be suppose to be a two-legged man with a gun yeah indifferently yeah but i get my doubt -- now hell 's bell be not you off to one side there when racey pull be not you be not you listenin ' to what racey say at the time be not you after i mean after he gun be back hug he leg after the girl slide in between what more of a chance didja want so that be it huh that be -- it between the two word be a perceptible pause i be not shootin ' nobody in the back i never have yet and i be not beginnin ' now not for you or any other damn man say -- begin lanpher threateningly alicran skeel turn a grim face on he employer so suddenly and sharply that lanpher almost dodge lookit here lanpher say he quietly do not you try to start nothin ' that i 'll have to finish i know you from way back you lizard and outside of my regular work i be not take no order from you do not gimme any more of yore lip aw i do not mean nothing alicran you be not get any call to get het i need you in the business shore you do alicran declare contemptuously you need I to do anything you be not get the nerve to do i get my duty to my company lanpher bluff lamely duty bedam you be not get the gut for a tough job that be whatsa matter this be rub it in lanpher pluck at the loose string of he courage and manage to draw out a faintly responsive twang i 'll show you whether i get gut -- he begin oh look say alicran see that wild currant bush to lanpher it seem that the sixshooter be barely out of the holster before it be back again but there be a swirl of smoke adrift in the windless air and the topmost branch of a wild currant bush thirty foot distant have be that instant cut in two what be that you be gonna say alicran prompt softly i forget evade lanpher but they be one thing you wanna remember alicran it do not pay to be squeamish it come high in the end usually you 'll find if you keep on be mushy thisaway that you 'll have more 'n you can swing at the finish be that so you leave I do thing my own way you hear lemme tell you if i would ` a ' know all what you be up to by come to dale 's this mornin ' i would never have allow it allow it yes allow it i say want I to spell it for you you thumb-handed idjit if you have any more sense you would be a damfool do not you know that in anything you do no matter what they be no profit in unnecessary trimming most always it be the extra frill on a feller 's work that push the bridge over and land he underneath with everything on top of he and the job to do again if he be lucky enough to be livin ' at the finish and yore swashing through that girl 's gyarden be a heap unnecessary it be a close squeak you be not drill by racey dawson i would not have blame he if he have let a little light in on yore darkened soul do it myself in he place and yore rubbing in that mortgage deal be another unnecessary piece o ' damfoolishness it only make racey have it in for you more 'n ever and after act like more kind of a fool thataway in less time than anybody i ever see before you sit up on yore hunkers and tell _ I _ i 'll have more 'n i can swing at the finish say you make I laugh listen lanpher for a feller that be come out second best with the bar s outfit as many time as you have it look to I like you be crowdin ' providence a heap close that be all right sulk lanpher then add with a sudden flare of spite : when i hire you as foreman i shore never expect to draw a skypilot full o ' sermon into the bargain no drawled alicran look hard at lanpher i often wonder just what you do hire I for on which lanpher make no comment yeah resume alicran the fish have fail to bite i often wonder about that be it a foreman you want or a -- gunman and what do racey mean about jack harpe a-bearing down on you so hard huh nothing nothing nothing a-tall lanpher reply irritably if racey do not mean nothing by it what do yore eye flip for and why didja shuffle yore foot whatell business be it of yore burst out the goad manager none alicran reply calmly i be just wonder i get a curiosity to know why thassall then hogtie yore curiosity -- or you 'll be gettin ' yore time i be free to admit i need you like i say before but i can do without you if i gotta that be just where yo be dead wrong alicran promptly contradict you can not do without I lanpher i like the job of bein ' yore foreman i like it so well that if you be to fire I i dunno what i would not do you know lanpher a man be a whole lot bigger target than the branch of a wild currant bush frankly speculative the eye of alicran travel up and down the spare frame of the 88 manager which give lanpher furiously to think as it be why say he force a smile i guess we understand each other alicran shore we do say alicran cheerfully and do not you forget it chapter xvii sign paper when the two 88 man have depart molly dale continue to stand where she be for a space and stare dumbly at nothing racey realize well enough that she world have crash to piece about she wish that she would burst into tear a sob woman be easily comfort it be simply necessary to pet she and keep on pet she till she grief be assuage but this hard stillness of molly dale 's give racey no opening he could but gaze at she uncomfortably and shift he weight from one foot to the other that be a dirty trick of the marysville bank thus tentatively it be doubtful whether molly hear he poor father she say in a low tone lookit here molly say racey strike by a bright idea i have get a li'l money i be save i -- i want you should take it molly continue to stare into the distance i have get some money -- he begin again think that molly have not hear but she turn she face toward he at that and he see that she eye be shine with unshed tear racey she say with a slight catch in she voice and lay she hand lightly on he arm racey you be a dear good boy we -- we 'll manage somehow i mum-must tell mother abruptly she swing away and leave he he watch she cross the garden and enter the kitchen of the ranch-house then slowly thoughtfully he set to work repair as best he could the ravages leave in the garden by the hoof of lanpher 's horse come then swing tunstall on a paint pony and be move to mirth at sight of racey dawson engage in earthy labor see the pret-ty flower mouth swing tunstall after the fashion of a child wrestling with the first

shoulder toward the house then he get to he foot and stride across the garden to where swing tunstall sit he horse swing say he quietly be you busy just now swing suspect a catch somewhere stare in swift suspicion why -- uh -- no be he cautious reply then go off some'er and die without wait for swing 's possible comment racey turn he back on he friend and walk unhurriedly to he horse cuter swing slouch sidewise in the saddle and watch he go he roll a cigarette light it and inhale luxuriously and all without remove he gaze from racey 's back he watch while racey fling the rein crosswise over cuter 's neck mount and ride down into the creek when he see that racey after allow cuter to drink nearly all he want ride on across the creek and up the farther bank swing 's brow become corrugated

but he know too that he could not do it unless lanpher make the first break otherwise it would be murder and racey be no murderer he 'll back down if he can the snake racey say aloud and he 'll be shore to slick and slime round till all be blue damn he ride over those flower of hers racey do not hurry he have no desire to come up with lanpher on the open range it would be better to meet the man at he own ranch-house -- where there be apt to be plenty of witness racey realize perfectly that he might need a witness several witness before the sunset he hope that all the boy of the 88 outfit would be at the ranch he hope that luke tweezy would be there too lanpher and tweezy together the pup fat jakey pooley 's li'l playmate he mutter and swear again -- heartily he understand now the true reason for jack harpe 's lack of activity this purchasing by lanpher and tweezy of the dale mortgage be the eminently safe and lawful plan of jakey pooley in he letter fat jakey have write that it would take longer and be not it take longer it be racey thought he see the plan in its entirety and be in a boil accordingly he would have be in considerably more of a boil have he be bless with the ability to read the future when he ride in among the building of the 88 ranch he eye be gratify by the sight of freckle-faced bill allen straddle a cracker-box in front of the bunkhouse and have he

the office he understand well enough that rod and the other two puncher would not interfere in any way with he and whatever act he might be call upon to perform during he conversation with lanpher loyal to the last cartridge and after whenever it be ranch business none of the 88 puncher ever feel it incumbent upon he to go out of he way so far as lanpher personally be concern the manager be not the man either to engender or to foster personal loyalty at the open doorway of the office racey dismount he drop the rein over he horse 's head and walk to the doorway there he stop and look in he see lanpher sit behind he big homemade desk lanpher be watch he at one side of the desk on a chair tilted back against the wall sit luke tweezy luke be chew a straw he eye be half closed but racey detect they glitter luke tweezy be not overlook any bet at that moment racey step across the doorsill and halt just within the room the thumb of he left hand be hook in he belt he right hand hang at

lanpher want to make a complaint you hear lanpher ask racey still more nervously you wanna make a complaint huh lanpher have not fail to note the nervousness of racey 's tone now he lick he lip again he feel quite cheerful of a sudden it give he a warm and pleasant feeling to think that racey dawson be to a certain degree in he power have lick he lip several time he rub he chin judicially and cough likewise judicially well i dunno as i wanna make a complaint exactly he say slowly but you wanna walk a chalkline round here racey you get too much to say for a fact what do you think luke query racey have i get too much to say you hear what lanpher say reply the cautious luke yep i hear all right i just want to get yore opinion because i be not through yet -- through talk i mean what i be go

be a gun in that open drawer not six inch from you hand go after it you hound-dog lanpher be not inordinately brave he would go out of he way to avoid a appeal to lethal weapon but racey 's word be more than he could stand he hand jerk sidewise and down toward the sixshooter in the open drawer bang shooting from the hip racey drive a accurate bullet through the manager 's right forearm lanpher grunt and gurgle with pain but he make no attempt to seize he weapon with he left hand luke tweezy pick himself up from the floor where he have throw himself a split second before the shot luke tweezy

's hand he 'll pay off the mortgage himself do you think you can get a easy rate from old salt ask dale the light of a new hope dawn in he fade old eye it be a awful tax on a feller pay the full legal rate we 'll have to take what we can get but i 'll do my best to tone it down sometimes a man will take less if he have another object in view besides the interest and you bet old salt will have a plenty big object in view in keep out lanpher and tweezy money be not tight now anyway i 'll do the best i can for you do not you fret you go on in now and square up with the woman and i 'll slide out

yoreself i hear you so do tom loudon and swing too jack harpe yeah he be the tune you be play alla time and up to now i can not see that jack harpe have make a move not a move but -- lanpher and

have to pay we ' they be yore very word racey i get 'em write down all so careful i know 'em by heart i 'll bet you do racey tell he heartily i 'll gamble you be study those word in all yore spare time it pay to be careful smile mr saltoun always bear that in mind i be not want to rub anything in racey but if you would be a mite more careful just a mite more careful you would not be out so much at the finish drink be on you cowboy and when you stop to think that i would ` a ' make the bet just the same if you would want lanpher and tweezy in on it only you do not guess i must ` a ' overlook 'em huh grin racey feller can not think of everything can he i be glad to see yo be take it thisaway approve mr saltoun work for six month for nothing do not seem to bother you a-tall i be not work six month for nothing -- yet point out racey the six month be not up -- yet you wanna remember salt that a race be not over till the horse cross the line you gotta prove jack harpe 's connection begin mr saltoun racey top he mount but as the horse start he hold he up lessee who be come he suggest jerk he thumb over he shoulder he and mr saltoun both turn they head someone be ride toward they along the trail from the direction of the lazy river ford -- racey have catch the clatter of the horse 's hoof on the rock of a wash wherein the trail lay conceal siftin ' right along say mr saltoun racey nodded horse and rider slide into sight above the side of the wash and trot toward they look like punch-the-breeze thompson say mr saltoun it be thompson confirm racey do not it strike you he sort of hesitate a li'l bit when he first see we -- like a man would whose breakfast do not rest easy on he stomach as you might say mr saltoun nod he do sway back on they line at the top and he be not boil along quite as fast now as he be in the wash elaborate racey i notice that too admit mr saltoun they wait bar the trail punch-the-breeze thompson do not attempt to ride around they he pull up and nod easily to the two man they be be a frayca down at mcfluke 's thompson say frayca racey cock a eyebrow yeah -- old dale and a stranger racey nod he know with a great certainty what be come next anybody hurt he ask old dale bad kill racey nod again even break we do not think so thompson state frankly who be we query racey oh austin honey hoke doc coffin mcfluke jack harpe lanpher and luke tweezy we all just do not like the way the stranger go at it so i be go to farewell after the sheriff yo be holdin ' the stranger then i take it put in mr saltoun well no not exactly reply thompson he get away that stranger do and do not none of you make any try at stop he a-tall demand racey plenty thompson reply with a stony face i take a shot at he myself just as he be hop through the window i miss yet they say yo be a good snap shot thompson throw in racey i be -- most usual admit thompson but this time my hand must ` a ' shake or something yep concur racey i shore guess it must ` a ' shake or -- something thompson face racey ` or something ' he repeat hardily mean what i say reply racey calmly i never mean more 'n i say -- ever thompson continue to regard racey fixedly mr saltoun be glad that he himself be two yard to the right and he would not have object to double the distance racey 's hand be fold on the horn of he saddle thompson 's right hand hang at he side racey have tell the truth when he speak of thompson as a good snap shot he be all of that and he be fairly quick on the draw as well it would seem that take into consideration the position of thompson 's right hand that thompson have a shade the better of it racey think so but he hope nevertheless by shoot through the bottom of he holster to plant at least one bullet in thompson before the latter kill he the decision lay with thompson would he elect to fight racey could almost see the thought at conflict behind thompson 's frontal bone mr saltoun hope against hope sit tensely silent racey 's eye hold thompson 's steadily slowly inch by inch thompson 's right hand move upward -- and away from the gun butt he gather he rein in he left hand and with he hitherto menacing right he tilted he hat forward and begin to scratch the back of he head if you do not mean more 'n you say offer thompson you do not mean much which be all the way you look at it say racey and a damn good way too nip in mr saltoun hurriedly inwardly cursing racey for not let well enough alone what be the fight about thompson card say thompson laconically switch he eye briefly to mr saltoun 's face and the stranger cold-deck he inquire racey something like that but i can not say for shore i be not play with he doc coffin be and so be honey hoke and peach austin peach say he kind of have a idea the stranger deal himself a card from the bottom just before old dale start to crawl he hump but peach be not shore about it seemin ` ly old dale be the only one be shore and he be dead and yo be go for the coroner huh ask racey i say so but you do not say if anybody be chase the stranger now be they shore be the prompt reply they all take out after he -- all except mcfluke that be racey nod i expect mcfluke would want to stay with dale he say gently just as you would want to go to farewell after the coroner yo be shore it be the coroner thompson say how many time do you want I to tell you demand the badger thompson of course it be the coroner in a case like this the coroner 's gotta be notify i expect assented racey i expect but if yo be really goin ' for the coroner thompson what make you tell we when you first meet we you be go for the sheriff why say thompson without a quiver i be a-goin ' for he too i must ` a ' forget to say so at first yeah i guess you do thus racey annoy that thompson have contrived to crawl through the fence he have hope that thompson might be tempt to a demonstration for which potentiality he racey have prepare by remove he right hand from the saddle horn it do not always pay to forget thompson suggest mr saltoun coldly it do not thompson assent readily and i do not -- most always do not stay here any longer on we account thompson say racey you have tell we about enough try and remember it thompson bid he and lift he rein we will and on the other hand do not you forget yore sheriff and yore coroner i will not grin thompson and ride past and away he be not goin ' for the sheriff and the coroner any more 'n i be declare mr saltoun disgustedly turn in the saddle to gaze after the vanish horseman of course he be not almost bark racey in this country feller like thompson do not ride hellbent just to tell the sheriff and the coroner a feller have be kill murder be not any such e-vent as all that unless he add thoughtfully thompson be the stranger you mean thompson might ` a ' kill he i do not think it would spoil he appetite any you remember how fast he be pelt along down in the wash and how he slow up after see we a murderer would act just thataway mr saltoun nod a gent can not do anything on guesswork he say bromidically fact be what count you 'll find before we get to the bottom of this business observe racey sagely that guesswork be gonna lead we to a whole heap of fact i hope so mr saltoun say uncomfortably conscious that the death of dale might seriously complicate the lifting of the mortgage racey be no less uncomfortable and for the same reason he feel sure that the killing of dale have be inspire in order to settle once for all the future of the dale ranch no wonder luke tweezy have be so positive in he assertion that old man saltoun would not lend any money to dale the latter have be mark for death at the time despite the fact that tweezy and harpe be at last be see together in public thus indicate that the deal to quote pooley 's letter to tweezy have be spring racey doubt that the murder form part of jacob pooley 's absolutely safe plan for force out dale while in some way the murder might be consider sufficiently safe the method of it and the act itself do not smack of pooley 's handiwork it be much more probable that the killing be the climax of luke tweezy 's original plan adhere to by the attorney and he friend against the advice and wish of jacob pooley guess we would better go on to mcfluke 's be racey 's suggestion they go look like they get back mighty soon from chase the stranger say racey when they come in sight of the place eye the number of horse tie to the hitching-rail maybe they get he quick mr saltoun offer sardonically they ride on and add they horse to the tail-switching string in front of the saloon racey do not fail to note that none of the other horse give any evidence of have be ridden either hard or lately which in the face of thompson 's assertion that the man he leave behind have ride in pursuit of the murderer seem rather odd or perhaps it be not so odd look upon it from another angle the saloon when they have ride up have be quiet as the well-known grave it remain equally silent when they enter mcfluke behind the bar wear a black eye and a puffed nose nod to they civilly in chair range round the wall sit a assortment of man -- peach austin luke tweezy jack harpe doc coffin honey hoke and lanpher the latter be nurse a slung right arm they be all there the man mention by name by thompson as have be in the place when dale be kill what be this a graveyard meetin ' ask racey of mcfluke glancing from the assemble multitude to mcfluke and smile slightly it be no part of wisdom think racey to let these man know of he encounter with thompson he have thompson 's story he be anxious to hear theirs ' a graveyard meeting ' repeat the saloon-keeper well and that be what it be in a manner of speak racey stare i bite what be the answer the saloon-keeper clear he throat old dale 's be kill have huh who kill he racey allow he eye casually to skim the expressionless face of the man back against the wall a stranger kill he reply mcfluke heavily racey remove he eye from the slack-chinned countenance of the saloon-keeper to thin-faced foxy-nosed luke tweezy luke 's little eye meet he you see this stranger luke he ask luke tweezy nod we all see he he be play draw with honey hoke and peach austin and I doc coffin offer oilily and the stranger amend racey and the stranger doc coffin accept the amendment what be the trouble pursue racey well we kind of thought -- doc coffin 's eye slide round to cross a instant the shifty gaze of peach austin -- we think maybe this stranger deal a card from the bottom we be not none shore dale say he do anyhow say peach austin he say so twice put in lanpher racey turn deliberately you here say he softly i do not see you at first i must be get nearsighted you see the whole thing do you lanpher yeah reply lanpher who pull first the stranger the answer come patly from at least five different man racey look grimly upon those present most everybody seem shore the stranger 's to blame he observe besides say the stranger be deal from the bottom do dale use any other fight word he call he a -- tinhorn burst simultaneously from the lip of mcfluke and peach austin only two this time say racey shooting a swift glance at jack harpe and overjoy to find the latter divide a glare of disgust between mcfluke and austin but you 'll have to do better than that mr saltoun shiver inwardly he be a man of courage but not of foolhardy courage the species of courage that dare death unnecessarily he be get on in year and hope when it come he time to die to pass out peacefully in he nightshirt and here be that fool of a racey practically tell harpe and the other rascal that he be on to they game no wonder mr saltoun shiver he expect matter to come to push of pike in a split second so be what he be a fairly brave man in a tight corner he put on a hard confident expression and hook he thumb in he belt racey dawson spread he leg wide and laugh a reckless laugh he feel reckless he likewise feel for these man range before he the most venomous hate of which he be capable these man have kill the father of molly dale it do not matter whether any one or all of they have or have not commit the actual murder they be wholly responsible for it they have bring it about he know it he know it just as sure as he be a foot high and as he look upon they sit there in flinty silence he purpose to make they pay and pay to the uttermost that the old man have be a gambler and a drunkard and the world be undoubtedly a better world for he leave it be fact of no moment in racey 's mind he racey be not one to condone either murder or injustice and this murder and the injustice of it would cruelly hurt three woman he laugh again without mirth he blue eye glitter through the slit of the drawn-down eyelid be pin-point of wrath he hard-bitten stare challenge he enemy damn they let they shoot if they want to he be ready he racey dawson would show they a fight that would stack up as well as any of which a hard-fighting territory could boast so feel as he do racey stare upon he enemy with a frosty slit-eyed stare and mentally dare they to come to the scratch but in moment like these there be always one to say let 's go or give its equivalent a sign and that one be invariably the leader of one side or the other racey dawson see luke tweezy turn a slow head and look toward jack harpe he see doc coffin honey and austin one after the other do the same but jack harpe sit immobile he neither speak nor give a sign perhaps he do not consider the present a sufficiently propitious moment no one know what he think have he know what the future hold in store he might have go after he gun tense nerve wire-drawn racey and mr saltoun await the decision it come and like many decision its form be totally unexpected jack harpe look at racey and say smilelessly : wanna view the remains chapter xx draw the cover you do not understand it do you peach racey inquire genially of peach austin when he find himself neighbor with that slippery gentleman at the inquest peach shy away from racey on general principle he fear a catch there be so many thing about racey that he do not understand whatcha talk about peach grunt surlily you -- I -- chuck -- everybody more or less you do not do you do not what a trifle more surlily you do not see how and why chuck morgan be so all-fired friendly with I and how i be a-ride for a good outfit like the bar s when the last you see of I chuck be a-hazing I up the trail with my hand over my head you do not understand it none i can see it in you light green eye peach peach modestly veil he pale green eye beneath drop lid and turn he head away he would have give a great deal to go elsewhere but to do that would be to make himself conspicuous and there be many reason all more or less cogent why he do not wish to make himself conspicuous peach sit still on he chair and break into a gentle perspiration racey perceive the other 's discomfort and ache to increase it do you stay here three-four day like i tell you to that time a few week ago and be jack harpe most gawd-awful hot under the collar when you do see he final and if so what happen racey gape at peach like a expectant terrier watch a rat-hole it may be that peach feel like a hole rat in a hole too small for comfort he turn on racey with a flash of defiance there be a feller once say peach who bite off more 'n he could chew i have hear of he racey admit gravely he be first cousin to the other feller that grab the bear by the tail i dunno whose first cousin he be frowned peach all i know be he do not show good sense now that say racey be where you and i do not think alike i may be wrong in what i think i may have make a mistake but i gotta be show why and wherefore anybody be welcome to show I peach just anybody racey accompany he remark with a chilling look the perspiration of peach turn clammy meaning peach query mean why mean that you can show I if you like peach this be too much for peach he be out of he depth and unable to swim he sink with a gurgle of i dunno what yo be drivin ' at racey shake a sorrowful head i be shore sorry to hear it i be guessin ' you do i have hope of you peach you have do gimme a disappointment yep she be a cruel world when all ' say and do this be too much for peach he resolve to shift he seat whether it make he conspicuous or not the gambler remove to a vacant windowsill upon which he sit and look anywhere but at racey dawson that young man lean back in he chair and survey the multitude besides the citizen find in the saloon on he and mr saltoun 's arrival there be now present dolan who combine with he office of justice of the peace that of coroner and twelve good man and true the coroner 's jury and most intimate friend ready

farewell punch-the-breeze thompson have return with the sheriff which circumstance either disposed of the theory that thompson be the murderer or else thompson have more nerve than he be suppose to have racey begin to nurse a distinct grievance against thompson the main room of the saloon into which the body have be bring from the back room be a fog of smoke and a blabber of voice mcfluke have not be idle at the bar and the coroner 's jury be three part drunk the member have not yet agree on a verdict but the delay be a mere matter of form they always like to stretch the time and give the territory a good run for she money racey dawson conscious that both jack harpe and luke tweezy be watch he covertly roll a meticulous cigarette he scratch a match on the chair seat hold it to the end of the cigarette and stare across the pulsing flame straight into the eye of the marysville lawyer tweezy 's gaze waver and fall away racey inhale strongly then get to he foot and laze across to the bar where jake rule with kansas casey at he elbow be perfunctorily question mcfluke the latter 's hard close-coupled blue eye narrow at racey 's approach racey as he drape himself against the bar be careful to nudge casey 's foot with a surreptitious toe jake say racey would i be interruptin ' the proceedings too much if i make a motion for we to drink all round not a-tall declare the sheriff heartily racey turn to mcfluke when they hand have encircle the glass for the third time racey instead of drinking suddenly look across the bar at mcfluke who be industriously swab the bar top mac he say easily when that stranger run out the door how many gent fire at he punch thompson reply mcfluke the sushing cloth stop abruptly you hear he tell the coroner how he fire and miss do not you oh i

he the sheriff regard racey with he keen gray gaze then he face about and single out thompson from a conversational group across the room punch he call and then put racey 's question in he own word what be he doin ' say thompson heedless of mcfluke 's agonize expression which he be hoppin ' through that window there -- here he indicate the middle one of three in the side of the room -- when i drawed and miss i only have time for the one shot at this there be a sudden scrabble behind the bar it be mcfluke try to retreat through the doorway into the back room and be prevent from accomplish he purpose by racey dawson who at the innkeeper 's first panic-stricken movement have vault the bar and grab he by the neck none of that now caution racey dawson he right hand flash down and up as mcfluke finding that escape be out of the question make a desperate snatch at the knife-handle protruding from he bootleg the saloon-keeper react immediately to the cold menace of the gun-muzzle press

left-handed and send a bullet smack through the scornful face of racey dawson but it be precisely as racey say he do not have the nerve with half-a-dozen drink under he belt he undoubtedly would have make a attempt to clear he honor but he be not carry the requisite amount of liquor lanpher snarl another string of oath if i do not have my right arm in a sling -- he begin i guess interrupt the sheriff this will be about all lanpher yore hoss be outside git on and git out chapter xxii a check lookit here judge say racey earnestly do you mean to say yo be gonna let the sheriff serve they eviction papers judge dolan elevate he foot upon he desk and tilted back he chair before reply racey he say teeter gently i gotta do what the law say in this thing then yo be gonna sic the sheriff on huh i be not doin ' no sicin ' not I luke tweezy 's the boy you mean but the law make you back up luke in this case it do then it be a helluva law that let a feller take away the home of two woman they 's lot of time observe dolan judicially when i think she be a helluva law too but what you gonna do under the law one man 's word be as good as another 's till he be prove a liar and two man 's word be better than one and so on and so far nobody be not prove doc coffin and honey hoke and luke tweezy be liar of course we know they be protest racey not legally you gotta remember that know a man be a liar be one thing and be able to prove it be another breed of cat then they be not nothing to be do short of rub out lanpher and tweezy and what good would wipe out either or both of they do beyond lanpher and tweezy be they heir and assign whoever they may be you can not go down the line and abolish 'em all i s ` pose not grumble racey of course not it be not reasonable you do not wanna bull along regardless like a bufflehead in this racey you wanna use yore brain a few they 'll always go farther than main strength you get brain and you can bet you 'll need every single one of 'em if you wanna get to the bottom of this business under the circumstance then what be yore advice judge i be not get no particular advice to give reply dolan promptly i be a judge not a lawyer but i be free to say even if i be a lawyer i dunno exactly what i would do or where i would begin racey nod he do not see exactly where to begin either lookit judge he say at last can not you sort of delay the proceedin 's for a while i 'll do what i can assent dolan but i can not keep it up forever i be swear to obey the law and see that it be obey and if luke tweezy 's paper can not be prove a forgery certain and soon they 's only one thing for I to do and one thing for the dale to do i be sorry but that be the way it stand under the law it be then that the door-latch click and one enter without knock it be luke tweezy beyond the merest flicker of a glance he do not acknowledge the presence of racey dawson he nod perfunctorily to dolan mornin ' judge say he be the papers ready for the sheriff yet not yet luke not yet dolan assure he blandly i be not have time to get at 'em when you gonna get at 'em soon as i get time but lookit here judge we be bein ' delay we wanna get the dale off they ranch soon as we can off _ they _ ranch be shore the truth strike in racey you do tell it sometimes do not you luke but luke tweezy be not to be draw that morning he focus he eye and attention steadily on judge dolan we wanna take possession soon as we can persist luke tweezy shore you do say the judge heartily no reason why you should not wanna as i know of if you can not see yore way to get at this business within a reasonable time i 'll have to sue out a mandatory injunction against you judge and -- dolan smile wintrily what judge be you figure on to grant this injunction luke tweezy be silent you do not expect I to grant a mandatory injunction against myself do you pursue dolan i can go to judge allison at marysville or to piegan city and i guess -- i guess not interrupt the judge judge allison as you know be a federal judge and these here eviction proceedin 's be territorial business and furthermore lemme point out that the piegan city court be not get any jurisdiction in this case why not because the case be not come to a hearing yet that be why you oughta know that luke yo be a lawyer alla same -- begin luke alla same nothing declare judge dolan _ after _ eviction proceedin 's have be start and if you do not have any luck in get they woman off the place then you can apply to this court for redress i 'll set a date for a hearing _ after _ the hearing if you get a notion in yore numskull that i be not do you right you can apply to the piegan city court for all the -- mandatory injunction you feel like and be -- to you be they any further business you get with I luke or any more point of law you wanna be instruct on 'cause if they be not here 's you there be the door and right yonder be outside luke tweezy depart abruptly dolan laugh harshly as the door slam he can not bluff I the chucklehead he know he could not sue out a mandatory injunction yet know it damn well but he do not think i know it damn he ornery soul oh he be slick luke tweezy be say racey dawson but like most slick gent he think everybody else be a fool he make a mistake once in a while grunt dolan at which racey look up sharply a mistake he repeat there be a idea i wonder if he have make any mistake who be not nod dolan luke 's make plenty i 'll bet i dunno about plenty doubt racey one would be enough dolan rasp a hand across he stubbly chin one would be enough he admit if you could find the one it would not have to be a mistake have to do with this particular case either would it not necessarily of course it would be better to trip he up on this case but if you can get hold of something else luke have do that can be prove anyways shady it would be four ace and the joker luke would have to pull in he horn about this mortgage and if i know luke he would do it he be get nerve but it be not cold enough nor witless enough to go up against the shore thing if only mcfluke would talk he know the in and out of this business dolan nod shore as yo be a foot high dale give he that black eye and shore as _ yo be _ a foot high he down dale i guess likely but circumstantial evidence be amazing queer you can not ever tell how the jury 's gonna take it but anyway we get mcfluke and he 'll do to start in on enter then kansas casey with a serious face mcfluke have slope say he without preliminary what cry judge dolan but it be characteristic of racey dawson that he do not say what he ask how because the jail be burn down say kansa you know we have to put he in yore warehouse judge as the next strongest place and they dig he out ` dig he out ' thus judge dolan that be what they do ` they ' ` they ' who be ` they ' again judge dolan if i knowed who they be kansas reply i would dump 'em just too quick way i know it be a ` they ' be because the job of diggin ' be bigger than a one-man job we 'll go look into this dolan exclaimed wrathfully and reach for he hat he have never ` a ' be pull out of the calaboose so easy say kansa as he lead dolan and racey up the street to the rear of the dolan warehouse but yore foundation log be not sink more 'n six inch and diggin ' under and in be a cinch but why do not you handcuff this sport to a roof stanchion inside demand the judge we do man we do we get a log chain and the biggest pair of handcuffs in we stock and we iron mcfluke by the ankle to a stanchion in the middle of the warehouse besides that he hand be handcuff and no matter how he stretch he could not reach nothing we see to that but my gawd hownell do they have time to file through that log chain or they cuff a log chain be not make of wire a ' they cuff be all special steel they do not file neither the chain nor the cuff explain kansa wearily they unlock the cuff unlock 'em huh where would they get the key lose one of yore do yuh ours be all safe they must ` a ' have a key anyway there be the handcuffs wide open when i find mcfluke go this mornin ' dolan pull out he watch nine o'clock say he when do you first find mac be go kansa when i take he breakfast in less 'n five minute ago howcome you go to the warehouse so late well say kansa somewhat shamefacedly we do not lock he up in the warehouse till one o'clock this morning and i figure a li'l extra sleep would not do he any harm or a li'l extra sleep would not do yoreself any harm neither huh maybe i do sleep later than usual admit kansas i guess you do say dolan i guess you do and jake too tell anybody else about this only jake they have leave the street while they talk and walk down the long side wall of the warehouse now they turn the corner and see heap against a foundation log a pile of freshly dig dirt beyond the dirt pile gape the mouth of a hole lead beneath the log the hole be quite large enough for a over-size man to crawl through without difficulty judge dolan get down on he hand and knee and peer into the hole then he ease down into it headfirst and paw he way through that be what you get for not walk in by the front door in the first place kansa grin racey root hog or die feller root hog or die swearing under he breath kansa go to grind like a badger he broad shoulder do not scrape the side of the hall observe which racey know that it must have be a easy matter for mcfluke to crawl through for the saloon-keeper 's shoulder wide as they be be not as broad as those of kansas casey by a good inch and a half that hole be four or five inch wider than necessary ruminate racey prepare to follow the deputy i wonder why yep i shore wonder why here they be in a harri of a hurry and they take time to make a hole big enough for two man almost maybe they rob the warehouse too he suggest as much to dolan when he join the latter within no say dolan sweeping with a glance the stack of case and crate that half fill the single floor of the warehouse no i do not think they 's anything miss who would steal truck like this here anyway it be not valuable enough where 's jake kansas i leave he here when i go after you reply the deputy guess this be he he add as the front door open it be the sheriff he shut the door behind he and advance toward the little group gather about the stanchion this be a great note jake say dolan eye the sheriff severely can not you make out to hang onto yore prisoner no more hang onto hell snap back the sheriff short of sleep in here with he i do all that could be expect i put shorty rumbold on as guard and shorty -- where 's shorty go to the starlight for a drink he 'll be along in a minute maybe he go to sleep suggest dolan not shorty deny the sheriff with a decisive shake of he head i have use shorty before he do not go to sleep on duty shorty do not here he be now enter then shorty rumbold a tall lean-bodied man with a twinkling eye and a square chin shorty say dolan jake say he put you on guard here last night not here say shorty always painfully meticulous as to fact outside where outside just outside i sit on the doorstep all night and do not you go round to the back once even i do not think they be any use they be no door in the back and the log be forty inch through some of 'em i never think of 'em gopherin ' under this away i guess the sheriff do not either say dolan with a glance of strong disapproval at the sheriff you do not hear anything huh yo be shore of that shore i be if i would hear anything i would ` a ' scout round to see what make the noise maybe you go to sleep not I the twinkle in shorty 's eye be replace by a frosty stare i do not sleep on duty judge that be what the sheriff say shorty but hownell they could dig that tunnel and not make _ some _ noise i do not see i do not either shorty rumbold admit frankly but i do not hear a single suspicious sound either inside or outside the jail the whole night do you hear any noise a-tall ask racey dawson only when some drunk gent have a argument out in front of the dance hall you could not help hearin ' 'em they make noise enough to hear 'em a mile how long do the argument last oh maybe a hour -- a long time for a plain argument without any shooting do they call each other any fight name press on racey plenty and no shooting nary a shot do not that hit you as kind of odd it do at the time sort of recognize any of the voice shorty rumbold shake he head they be all too hoarse a ' loud that be the how of it judge say racey to dolan that be why shorty do not hear any sound of diggin ' the drunk gent a rowing together for a long time like that without any shooting prove they be do it on purpose to keep shorty from hear anything else the sheriff swear i hear they feller too he say they wake I up with they bellerin ' and i have a job gettin ' to sleep again i guess racey 's right i guess he be assent the judge now we know how they manage that part of it where do they get the key to open the cuff kansa say you be not lose any key jake we get 'em all every one i do not believe they use a key they handcuff lock be pick pick pick after kansa go for you i find these here on the floor here he produce from a pocket a bent and twisted piece of baling-wire and a steel half-moon horse-collar needle that be a number six needle observe the sheriff who invariably scented clue in the most unpromising object and the point 's break off number six be a common size say racey most store carry 'em and if the point do not get break off wigglin ' round inside the lock it would be a wonder still it would take a mighty good man to open they lock with only bale-wire and a harness-needle say the sheriff hurriedly a expert you bet it do not matter whether he be a expert or not say dolan he open they and the prisoner have skedaddle that be the main thing jake how about trailin ' he how they 's track a few of 'em leadin ' from the pile of dirt straight to the hard ground in front of the stage corral beyond there they be not any track trail 'em how you gonna trail 'em i dunno reply dolan promptly pass the buck yo be the sheriff she be yore job you gotta do _ something _ c'mon out the five man dolan and the sheriff argue steadily go out into the street racey walk thoughtfully in the rear he be revolve in he mind what the sheriff have say about a expert of course it have be a expert and expert in lock-picking in the cattle country be few and far between racey decide that it would be a good idea for he to have a little talk on lock-picking with peach austin not that he suspect the excellent peach of have pick those lock but peach know who have oh most certainly peach know who have chapter xxiii take fence ` lo peach peach austin standing at the starlight bar be raise a glass to he lip but at the greet he set down the liquor untasted turn he head and look into the face of racey dawson whatsa matter peach inquire racey you do not look glad to see I i be not peach say frankly i do not give a damn about seein ' you i be sorry grieve racey edge closer to the gambler peach yo be break my heart with they cruel word at this the bartender remove hastily to the other end of the bar he sense he know not what and he feel instead of curiosity a lively fear racey dawson be the most unexpected sport peach look nervously at racey a desperate resolve begin to formulate itself in the brain of peach austin he right arm tense slowly he hand slide toward the edge of the bar why no say racey who have never be more wide-awake than at that moment i would not do anything we have all be sorry for peach that be all of we but you yoreself you might not be sorry -- or anythin ' else this be threatening language plain and simple but it be no bluff peach know that racey mean every word he say peach ' right hand move no farther peach say racey le 's go where we can have a li'l private talk all right peach acquiesce shortly and leave the saloon with racey on the sidewalk they be join by swing tunstall the latter fall into step on the other side of peach austin be he come too query the gambler with a marked absence of cordiality in expression and tone he be answer racey i think this talk be gonna be private it be -- only the three of we we would not think of let anybody else horn in you can rest easy peach we 'll take care of you the gambler do not doubt it he wicked heart sink accordingly he know that he have be a bad bad boy and he conceive the notion that nemesis be roll up she sleeve all to he ultimate prejudice he perceive in front of the dance hall doc coffin and honey hoke and pluck up heart at once but racey see the pair at the same time and say twitch peach by the sleeve we 'll turn off here i guess peach turn perforce and accompany racey and swing into the narrow space between the express office and a log house when they come out into the open racey oblique to the left and pilot he companion to a large log that lay among empty tin can almost directly in the rear of and about fifty yard away from dolan 's warehouse here be a good place say racey indicate the log good seat plenty of fresh air and nobody round to bother we sidown peach peach sit as request the two friend seat themselves one on he either hand racey laugh gently doc coffin and honey look kind of surprised to see you with we he remark with enjoyment do not they peach i do not notice lie peach it do not matter nod racey see that pile of dirt over against the back wall of dolan 's warehouse peach i be not blind no then maybe you have hear how and why it come to be dig and all i be not deaf neither racey smile he approval i always say you have all yore sens except the common variety peach hop ahead with yore private talk grunt the badger gambler gimme time gimme time it do not cost anything whadda you think of that hole peach good big hole reply peach conservatively too big -- that be too big for just mcfluke or for any other feller the size of mcfluke what of it do not be in a hurry peach and you 'll last longer do you know mac 's handcuffs be pick open how -- pick open whoever open 'em do not use a key racey explain they be pick open with a piece of bale-wire and a collar-needle i hear that i think maybe so but do you ever think that a feller have get to have a good and clever pair of hand to pick a lock with only a collar-needle and bale-wire all that stand to reason admit peach there can not be a great many feller like that no not many -- not around here anyway you 'll find such sport in the big city mainly yeah chip in swing tunstall stare hard at peach i 'll bet you a hundred even they be not more than one or two such expert in the whole territory whadda you think peach inquire racey swing may be right say peach preserve a wooden countenance i dunno shore about that sharply shore i be shore why not you look sort of funny when you say it well then peach we 'll go back to we hole yonder it be reasonable to suppose that feller hustlin ' to dig it and without any too much time would not make it any bigger than they have to how about it huh guess so maybe aw right i tell you a while ago the hole be too big for mcfluke why be

intend that be he ride to the vicinity of marysville for arrive at a hill five mile outside of town in the broad of a afternoon he stop in a hollow under the cedar and wait for night daylight be decidedly not appropriate for the act he contemplate i wonder he mutter as he lay with he back brace against a tree and stare at the bulge in he slicker i wonder if i ought to use all they stick at once i never hear that miner man say how much of a argument a safe need i s ` pose i better use 'em all luke tweezy be a bachelor he office be in he four-room house and he do not employ a housekeeper further than this racey dawson know nothing of the lawyer 's establishment but he believe that he knowledge be sufficient to serve he purpose about midnight racey dawson remove himself he horse and he dynamite from the hollow on the hill to where a lone pine grow almost directly in the rear of and two hundred yard from the residence of luke tweezy he have select the tall and lonely pine as the best place to leave he horse because should he be force to run for it he would have against the star a plain landmark to run for he thoroughly expect to be force to run six stick of dynamite let go together would arouse a cemetery and marysville be a lively village racey take no chance on the lainey horse stampede at the explosion rope-tie the animal to the trunk of the pine after which he remove he spur carefully unwrapped the dynamite and stick three stick in each hip-pocket the cap in they little box he put in the breast-pocket of he shirt with the coil of fuse in one hand and the bran sack give he by lainey in the other he walk toward the house of tweezy the house be of course dark nor be there any light in the irregular line of house stretch up and down this side of the street the neighbor have apparently all go to bed through a opening between two house racey see a brightly light window in a house a eighth of a mile away that would be judge allison 's house the judge then be awake two hundred and twenty yard be not a long distance even for a portly man like judge allison to cover at speed and racey have know judge allison to move briskly on occasion racey move steadily ahead slide past someone 's barn and open up a view of the dance hall it have previously be conceal from he sight by the high post and rail of three corral the dance hall be go full blast at least all the window be bright with light he be too far away to hear the fiddle the dance hall he might have know it would still be operate at midnight but it be almost twice as far from the tweezy house to the dance hall as it be from the judge 's house to tweezy 's that be something indeed it be a great deal but he would have to work fast all the neighbor would come bounce out at the crash of the explosion racey pause to flatten a ear at the kitchen door he hear nothing and tiptoe along the wall to the window of the room next the kitchen the ground plan of the house be almost a exact square there be a room in each angle the office which racey know contain the safe be diagonally across from the kitchen racey halt at the window of the room next the kitchen be somewhat surprised to find it open he stick in he head and see a faint glow beyond the half-closed door of the office the glow seem to be brighter near the floor racey listen intently he hear a faint grumble and now and then a squeak he crouch beneath the window and remove he boot then he crawl over the sill and hunker down on the uncarpeted floor the floor board do not creak still crouch he arm extend in front of he he make he way silently across the room skirt safely in the process two chair and a table and stand upright behind the crack of the door look through the crack he perceive that the glow he have see from the window emanate from a tin can pierce with several hole the dim uncertain light reveal the figure of a tall and hatless man kneel beside the safe the man 's back be toward the light tin can one of the tall man 's hand be slowly turn the knob of the combination the side of the man 's head be press against the front of the safe near the combination racey could not see the man 's face across the window of the room two blanket have be hang the door into the other front room be open then suddenly the doorway be no longer a black void a man stand there -- a fat man with a stomach that hang out over the waistband of he trousers there be something very familiar about the figure of that fat man the fat man lean against the doorjamb and push back he wide black hat the light in the tin can illumine he countenance dimly but racey 's eye be become accustomed to the half darkness he be able to recognize jacob pooley -- fat jakey pooley the register of the district whose home be in piegan city you be not as fast as you use to be observe fat jakey in a soft whisper shut up hiss the kneel man and turn he face for a instant toward fat jakey so that the light shone upon he feature it be jack harpe what be bite you ear fat jakey ask good-naturedly i have tell you more 'n once to let what be past alone grumble jack harpe hell there be nobody around nemmine whether they be or not you get out of the habit rat sneer fat jakey what be that jack harpe 's figure tauten in a flash rat repeat fat jakey i think i hear something persist jack harpe you hear rat chuckle fat jakey you be nervous that be what be the matter or else you be not able to open the safe i can open the safe all right growled jack harpe bend again to he work i wonder what he do hear racey say to himself i think i hear something too whatever it be he do not hear it again there she be say jack harpe suddenly and throw open the safe door it be at this precise juncture that a voice from the darkness behind fat jakey say hand up oh it be then that event begin to move with celerity fat jakey pooley duck and leap jack harpe kick the tin can the candle fall out and roll gutter in a quarter circle only to be extinguish by one of fat jakey 's fly foot there be a slither sound as the blanket across the window be rip down follow by a scrape and a heaving and a grunt as two large people endeavor to make they egress through the same window at the same time so that window be open alla time think racey as he prudently wait for the owner of the voice in the other room to discover himself but this the voice 's owner do not immediately do racey could not understand why he do not shoot while the two man be struggle through the window lord know he have plenty of time and opportunity even after jack harpe and fat jakey have reach the outer air and presumably go elsewhere swiftly there be no sound from the other room racey he gun ready wait at first he impulse have be incontinently to flee the premise as jack and jake have do but a saving second thought hold he where he be it be more than possible that the mysterious fourth man have design on the contents of the safe in which event -- racey stand pat he hear no sound for at least a minute after jack and jake have leave then he hear a soft swish and a few star which have be visible through the upper half of the window be blot out the blanket be be readjust a match be strike and a figure stoop for the candle that have be dash out by the foot of fat jakey pooley a table shield the figure from racey then the figure straighten and set the flare match to the candle end and the face that bent above the light be the face of one he know molly he whisper and slip from he ambush at which molly drop candle and match and squeak in affright but she scare do not prevent she from draw a sixshooter he hear the click of the hammer and whisper desperately molly molly it be I racey he strike a match and retrieve the candle and light it quickly by its light he see she stare at he uncertainly she eye be bright with conflict emotion she sixshooter still point in he general direction put yore gun away he advise she we have get no time to lose hold the candle for I put it in the can first automatically she obey the several command he kneel before the open safe and begin at the top shelf he stuff into he bran sack every piece of paper the safe contain besides papers there be two sixshooter and a bowie these he do not take when the safe be clean of papers racey tie the mouth of the bran sack take molly by the hand and blow out the candle c'mon he say shortly we 'll be leavin ' here now tow she behind he he lead she to the window of the rear room hold he hat by the brim he shove it out through the window no blow or shot follow the action he clap the hat on he head and look out cautiously he satisfy himself that the coast be clear and fling a leg over the sill when he have help out molly he give she the sack to hold and pull on he boot where 's yore hoss he whisper i tie he at the corner of the nearest corral be the answer c'mon say he and take she again by the hand they have not go ten step when she stumble and fall against he whatsa matter nothing be the almost breathless reply i be -- i be all right i just step on a sharp stone yore shoe he murmur contritely i never think why do not you say something here so say he scoop she up in he arm settle she in place with due regard for the box of cap in he breast-pocket and plow on through the night she arm go round he neck and she head go down on he shoulder she sigh a gentle little sigh for a sigh like that racey would cheerfully have shoot a sheriff 's posse to piece i leave my shoe in my saddle pocket she say apologetically i -- i think it would be safer there be a sudden yell somewhere on main street it sound as if it come from uncomfortably close to the tweezy house then a sixshooter crack once twice and again at the third shot racey be run as tight as he could set foot to the ground encumber as he be with a double armful of girl and a fairly heavy sackful of papers he yet make good time to the corner of the nearest corral the increase riot in main street undoubtedly be a most potent spur which way 's the hoss he gasp when the dark rail of the corral fret the sky before they you be head straight she reply calmly thirty foot more and you 'll run into he better set I down he do -- literally he turn he foot on a tin can and go down ker-flop force to guard he box of cap with one hand he could not save molly dale a smash fall ah-ugh guggled molly squirm on the ground for she have strike the pit of she stomach on a round rock the size of a football and the wind be knock out of she racey scramble to he foot and know that if molly be able to wriggle and groan she could not be badly hurt pick up the sack and scout up molly 's horse he find it without difficulty and tie the sack with the saddle string in front of the horn he loose the horse and lead it to where molly still lay on the ground the poor girl be sit up clutch she stomach and rock back and forth and fight for she breath with gasp and crow but there be not time to wait till she should regain the full use of she lung -- not in the face of the shout and yell in main street lord the whole town be up light be flash in every house racey stooped seize molly under the armpit and heave she bodily into the saddle hang onto the horn he order and for gosh sake do not make so much noise molly obey as best she could he mount behind she and of course have to fight the horse which harbour no intention of carry double if it could help itself racey however be a rider and he jerk molly 's quirt from where it hang on the horn not more than sixty seconds be waste before they be travel toward the lone pine as tight as the horse could jump at the pine racey slip to the ground and run to untie he horse can you hang on all right at a trot if i lead yore hoss he query sharply he finger busy with the knot of the rope i cue-can and gug-guide he too she stutter pick up she rein and make a successful effort to sit up straight lul-look at tut-tweezy 's huh-house he look there be certainly three lantern bob about in the open behind the house of luke tweezy he know too well what those light mean the marysville citizen be hunting for a hot trail he swing up with a rush stick right alongside I he tell she we 'll trot at first till we get behind the li'l hill out yonder after that we can hit the landscape lively she speak no word till they have round the little hill and be gallop south then she say in she normal voice this be not the way home i know it be not we have get to lose whoever follow we before we skip for home of course she tell he humbly i might have know you always think of the right thing racey all of which be balm to a hitherto tortured soul that be all right he say modestly and how strong you be -- carry I and that heavy sack all that distance both admiration and appreciation be in she tone any man would have be make happy thereby racey be overjoyed and the daughter of eve at he side know that he be overjoyed and be make glad herself she do not realize that eve invariably employ the same method with we grandfather adam he reach across and pat she arm yo be all right he tell she when we get out of this yo be go to marry I she free hand turn under he and clasp he finger s6 they ride for a space hand-in-hand and racey 's heart be full and so be hers if they forget for the moment what dread possibility the future hold who can blame they

soul tell I you do not love anybody else he tell she later there be a time once when i think you like luke tweezy he observe lazily how horrible she murmur with a slight shudder as she snuggle closer and that be that i think dearest say molly raise she head from he shoulder some twenty minute later that it be light enough now to see what be in the sack so in the brightness of a splendid dawn snugly hide on the tree-covered flank of one of the frying pan mountain they open the bran sack and go through every paper it contain there be deed mortgage legal document of every description they find the dale mortgage but they do not find the release allege to have be sign by dale immediately prior to he death of course that mortgage be record say racey dolefully stare at the pile of papers so destroyin ' that will not help we any the release he be carry with he and i do not see anything -- here 's one we miss say molly dale in a hopeless tone pick up a slip of paper from where it have fall behind a saddle the slip of paper be fold several time she open it and spread it out against she knee why how queer she mutter huh in a instant racey be look over she shoulder when both have thoroughly digest the meaning of the write on that piece of paper they sit back and regard each other with wide eye this ought to fix thing breathe molly fix thing cry racey cinch we have get he like that he snap he finger joyfully molly reach for the bran sack you only shake it out she say i be go to turn it inside out maybe we 'll find something else they do find something else they find a document catch in the end seam they read it with care and great interest well say racey when he come to the signature no wonder jack harpe and jakey pooley want to get into the safe no wonder if we do not get the whole gang now we be no good and to think we never think of such a thing i be take in i never think anything else and it do lie just right for a cow ranch of course it do you could not help be fool none of we have any idea -- i would oughta work it out he grumble there be not any excuse for my swallow what jack harpe tell I lordy i be easy what do you care now everything 's all right and you have get I have not you and here she lean across the bran sack to kiss he she could not understand why he return kiss lack warmth \* \* \* \* \* sun 's be up two hour he announce and the hoss have have a good rest we would better be goin ' what be you climb the tree for then she demand i want to look over we back trail he tell she clamber into the branch of a tall cedar i know we cover a whole heap of ground last night but you never can tell apparently you never could tell for when he arrive near the top of the cedar and look out across a sea of treetop to the flat at the base of the mountain he see that which make he catch he breath and slide earthward in a hurry what be it ask molly in alarm at he expression they pick up we trail somehow he answer whipping up a blanket and saddle and throw both on she horse they be about three mile back on the flat just a-burnin ' the ground saddle you own horse she cry run to he side i 'll attend to mine you stuff all the papers back in the sack that be yore job hustle now i 'll get you out of this do not worry i be not worry -- not a worry she say cheerfully both hand busy with luke tweezy 's papers i would like to know how they pick up the trail after we ride up that creek for six mile i dunno say he he head under a upflung saddle-fender i shore think we would lose 'em she stop tie the sack and look at he how silly we be she cry all we have to do be show these two letter to the posse a ' -- s ` pose now the posse be lead by jack harpe and jakey pooley say he not cease to pass the cinch strap she face fall i never think of that she admit but there must be some honest man in the bunch it take a whole lot to convince a honest man when he be part of a posse racey declare reach for the bran sack they do not stop to reason a posse do not and this lot of marysville gent would not give we time to explain these two letter and before they get we back to town the two letter would disappear and then where would we be we would be in jail and like to stay awhile let 's get out of here exclaim molly crawl she horse even quicker than racey do he racey lead the way along the mountain side for three or four mile most of the time they ride at a gallop and all the time they take care to keep under cover of the tree this necessitate frequent zigzag for the tree grow sparsely in spot there be a slide ahead a way racey shout to the girl she be nearly a quarter-mile wide and over two mile long so we 'll have to take a chance and cross it molly nod she wind-whipped head and racey snatch a wistful glance at the face he love renunciation be in he eye for that second letter find catch in the bran sack 's seam have change thing he could not marry she no not now and yet he love she more than ever she look at he and smile and he smile back -- crookedly what be the matter she cry above the drum of the fly hoof nothing he shout back he hope she believe he and bitter almond be not as bitter as that hope then the wide expanse of the slide be before they now some slide have trail across they unstable back and some have not some be utterly unsafe to cross and other can be cross with small risk there be no trail across this particular slide and it do not present a dangerous appearance neither do quicksand -- till you step on it racey dismount at the edge and start across lead he horse twenty yard in the rear molly dale follow in like manner at every step the footing give a little once a round rock dislodge by the forefoot of racey 's horse bound away down the long slope the slither of a start rock behind he make he turn he head with a jerk molly 's horse be down on its knee easy boy easy soothed molly coaxingly keep the bridle rein taut the horse scramble up and plunge forward and almost overran molly she seize it short by the rein-chain the horse paw nervously and try to rear more rock skid downward under the shove of the hind hoof to racey 's imagination the whole slide seem to tremble molly 's face when the horse finally quiet and she turn around be pale and draw which be not surprising it be all right it be all right it be all right racey find himself repeat with stiff lip of course it be nodded molly bravely there be no danger no say racey better not hold he so short do not wind that rein round yore wrist s ` pose he go down you would go too here you lemme take he i 'll manage he all right i 'll manage he all right myself snap molly up in arm immediately at this slur upon she horsemanship you go on racey turn and go on it be not more than a hundred yard to where the grass grow on firm ground racey and he horse reach solid earth without incident then -- a scramble a scrape and a clatter follow in a breath by the indescribable sound of a mass of rock in motion racey have waste no time in look to see what have happen he know at the first sound of disaster he have snap he rope strap free he rope and take two half hitch round the horn then he leap toward the slide shake out he rope as he go twenty foot out and below he molly dale and she struggling horse be slide downward if the horse have remain quiet -- but the horse be not remain quiet and molly 's wrist be tangle in the bridle rein in the begin the movement be slow but as racey reach the edge of the slide a extra strong plunge of the horse drive both girl and animal downward two yard in a breath molly turn a white face upward so long racey she call bravely and wave she free hand but racey be go down to she with he rope in one hand with the other hand and he tooth he be open he pocket-knife the loose stone skitter round he ankle and turn under he boot sole he take tremendous step and with that white face below he live a age between each step grab the rope above my hand he yell although by now she be not a yard from he racey be closer to the end of he rope than he realize at the instant that she free hand clutch at the rope it tighten with a jerk as the cow pony at the other end feel the strain and know he business brace he leg and sway backward molly 's finger brush the back of racey 's hand and sweep down he arm well it be for he that he have take two turn round he wrist for she forearm go round he neck and almost the whole downward pull of girl and horse exert itself against the strength of racey dawson 's arm and shoulder muscle molly 's face and chin be press tightly against racey 's neck small blame to she if she eye be close the arm hold fast by the bridle be cruelly stretch and twist and where the rein be tight across the back of she wrist for he could reach no lower racey set the blade of he pocket-knife and saw desperately it be not a sharp knife and the leather be tough the steel do not bite well racey saw all the harder he left arm feel as if it be be wrench out of its socket the sweat be pour down he face he hat jump from he head he do not even wonder why he must cut that bridle rein in two he must -- he must snap three part cut the leather part molly 's left arm and racey 's right fall limply molly 's horse go down the slide alone neither of they see it go molly have faint and racey be too spend to do more than catch she round the waist and hold she to he in time to prevent she follow the horse smack something small and hot sprinkle racey 's cheek he look to the leave on a rock face close by be a splash of lead smack zung-g-g diminuendo as a bullet strike the side of a rock and buzz off at a angle racey turn he head abruptly at a place where tree grow thinly on the opposite side of the slide and at a considerably lower altitude than the spot where he and molly hang at the end of they rope shred of gray smoke be dissolve into the atmosphere the range be possibly seven hundred yard the hidden marksman be a good shot to drive he bullet as close as he have at that distance straight out from the place of gray smoke four man and four horse be make they way across the slide they be halfway across but they have stop the down rush of molly 's horse have apparently give they pause now two man start ahead one stand irresolute and one start to retrace he step it be a true say that he who hesitate be lose straight over the irresolute man and he horse roll the dust cloud whose center be molly 's horse when the dust cloud pass on it be much larger and both the man and he horse have disappear the man who have start to retreat continue to retreat and more rapidly the two who have hold on do not cease to advance but they proceed very slowly if that feller with the winchester do not get we we be all right for a spell racey mutter he know that on they side of the slide for a distance of several hundred yard up and down the side of the mountain and for several mile athwart it the underbrush be impenetrable for horse and wicked travel for man there have be a forest fire four year before and everyone know what happen after that in but one place where a ridge of rock rear through the soil be it possible to cross the stretch of burned-over ground naturally racey have pick this one spot whether the posse have not know of this rock ridge or whether they have simply miscalculate its position it be impossible to say those two will shore be out of luck when they get in among the stub he think to himself as he wait for he strength to come back but youth recover quickly and racey be young it may be that the lead that be be send at he and molly dale be a potent revivifier certainly within three or four minute after he have cut the bridle racey begin to work he way up the rope to where he patient and well-trained horse stand brace and steady as the proverbial boulder monotonously the man behind the winchester whip bullet after bullet into the rocky face of the slide in the immediate vicinity of racey dawson and the senseless burden in the crook of he left arm nevertheless racey take the time to work to the right and recover the hat that a bullet have flick from he head then he resume he slow journey upward age pass before he feel the good firm ground under he foot and lay the still unconscious molly on the grass behind a gray and barkless windfall that have once be a hundred-foot fir then he remove he horse farther back among the stub where it could not be see take he winchester from the scabbard under the left fender and go back to the edge of the slide to start a return argument with the individual who have for the last ten minute be endeavor to kill he chapter xxix hue and cry do you hit he i do not think so reply racey without turn he head keep down i be down how you feel pretty good -- consider close squeak -- considerin ' yes say she in a small voice it be a close squeak you -- you save my life racey shuck he say much embarrassed that be not anythin ' -- i mean -- you -- you know what i mean surely i know what you mean all the same you save my life tell I be that man shooting at we all the time after i faint until you get I under cover not all the time no but most of the time oh you can make small of it but you be very brave it be not everybody would have stick the way you do smack tchuck a bullet strike a rock two foot below where racey lay on he stomach he rifle-barrel poke out between two shrub of smooth sumac -- another bore the hole of a gray stub at he back he fire quickly at the first puff of smoke then send two bullet a little to the left of the center of the second puff not much chance of hittin ' the first feller he say to molly he be behind a log but that second sport be behind a bush same as I huh oh i be all right i get the ground in front of I he have not alla same we be not stayin ' here any longer i think i see half-a-dozen gent cuttin ' across the end of the slide give 'em time and they 'll cut in behind we which be not part of my plan a-tall let 's go he crawfish backward on he hand and knee molly follow he example when they be sufficiently far back to be able to stand upright with safety they scramble to they foot and hurry to the horse i 'll lead he for a while say racey give molly a leg up for the horse be a tall one he will not have to carry double just yet so with racey walk ahead they resume they retreat the ridge of rock cut across the burned-over area could not properly be call rimrock it be a different formation set at a angle it climb steadily upward to the very top of the mountain in place weatherworn to a slippery smoothness in other jag fragment-strewn where the rain have wash a earth-covering upon the rock the cheerful kinnikinick spread its mantle of shine green the man and the girl and the horse make good time racey 's foot begin to hurt before he have go a mile but he know that something besides a pair of foot would be irreparably damage if he do not keep go if they catch he he would be lynch that be what he would be if he be not shoot first and the girl -- well she would get at the least ten year at piegan city _ if _ they be catch but if be the longest and tallest word in the dictionary it be indeed a mighty barrier before the lord do you ever stop to think they may come up through this brush say molly on whom the silence and the sad gray stub on either hand be begin to tell no he answer i do not because they can not the farther down you go the worse it get they would never get through not with hoss we be all right be we she stand up in she stirrup and look down through a vista between the stub they have reach the top of the mountain it be a saddle-backed mountain and they be at the outer edge of the eastern hump far below be a narrow valley run north and south it be a valley without tree or stream and through it a string of dot be slip to the north be we all right she persist look down there at this he turn he head and crane he neck i guess he say step out we would better boil this kettle a li'l faster she make no comment but always she look down the mountain side and watch when the stub give she the opportunity that ominous string of dot she have never be hunt before they cross the top of the mountain keep to the ridge of rock and start down the northern slope here they pass out of the burned-over area of underbrush and stub and scuff through brushless grove of fir and spruce where no grass grow and not a ray of sunshine strike the ground and the wind sough always mournfully but here and there be comparatively open space grassy drench with sunshine and sparsely sprinkle with lovely mountain maple and solitary yellow pine in the wider open space they could see over the top of the tree below they and catch glimpse of the way they must go a deep notch almost a caon grow up in spruce divide the mountain they be descend from the next one to the north this next one thrust a rocky shoulder easterly the valley where the horseman ride bent round this shoulder in a curve measure in mile they could not see the rider now there be a trail just over the hill say racey nodding toward the mountain across the notch it be not be regularly use since the daisy peter out in '73 but i guess the bridge be all right and suppose it be not all right we 'll have to grow wing in a hurry he say soberly think of the deep cleft span by the bridge do this trail lead to farewell same thing -- it 'll take we to the farewell trail if we want to go there but we do not we be not get time we 'll stick to this trail till we get out of the frying-pan and then we 'll head northeast for the cross-in-a-box that be the nearest place where i get friend and i do not mind say we 'll be need friend bad I and you both suppose that posse reach the trail and the bridge before we do oh i guess they will not they have to go alla way round and we go straight mostly do not you worry we 'll make the riffle yet he voice be more confident than he brain it be touch and go whether they would reach the trail and the bridge first the posse in the valley -- that be what would stack the card against they and if they should pass the bridge first what then it be at least thirty mile from the bridge to the cross-in-a-box ranch-house and there be only one horse indeed the close squeak be still squeak racey you be limp not I he lie stub my toe thassall nothing of the kind it be those tight boot here you ride and let I walk so say she slip to the ground as be natural the horse stop with a jerk so do racey you get into that saddle he direct sternly we be not get time for any foolishness foolishness and she be only try to be thoughtful foolishness she turn and climb back into the saddle and sit up straight she backbone as stiff as a ramrod and look over he head and far away for the moment she be so hop mad she forget the danger they be in they make they way down into the heavy growth of engelmann spruce that fill the notch cross the floor of the notch and begin again to climb a hour later they cross the top of the second mountain and see far below they a long saddle back split in the middle by a narrow cleft at that distance it look very narrow in reality it be forty foot wide racey stop and sweep with squint eye the place where he know the bridge to be see he say suddenly point for molly 's benefit there be the daisy trail i can see she plain -- to the left of that arrowhead bunch of tree and the bridge be behind the tree but i do not see any trail grow up in grass that be why it be behind the tree mostly anyhow but she be there the trail be you can bet on it i do not want to bet on it shortly she be still mad at he he have save she life he have succeed in save the family ranch he have put she under eternal obligation but he have call she thought for he foolishness it be too much yet all the time she be ashamed of herself she know that she be small and mean and narrow and deserve a spanking if any girl do she want to cuff racey cuff he till he ear turn red and he head ring for that be the way a woman feel when she love a man and he have hurt she feeling but she feel almost precisely the same way when she hate one who have truth it be that love and hate be close akin down down they drop two thousand foot and when they come out upon the fairly level top of the saddle back racey mount behind molly he 'll have to carry double now he explain she be two mile to the bridge and my wind be not good enough to run I two mile it be not he wind that be weak it be he foot -- he tortured blistered foot that be two flaming ache later they would become numb he wish they be numb now and curse silently the man who first invent cowboy boot every jog of the trot horse whose back he bestride be a twitch torture we 'll be at the bridge in another mile he tell she thank heaven silent and grass-grown lay the daisy trail when they come out upon it wind through a meager plantation of cedar no one 's come along yet vouchsafe racey turn into the trail after a swift glance at its trackless undisturbed surface he tickle the horse with both spur and stir he into a gallop there be not much spring in that gallop racey weigh fully one hundred and seventy pound without he clothes molly a hundred and twenty with all of hers and the saddle blanket sack rifle and cartridge weigh a good sixty on top of this weight pile many weary mile the horse have travel since its last meal and you have what it be carry no wonder the gallop lack spring bridge be just beyond those tree say racey in molly 's ear the horse be nearly run out be she comment he be not dead yet they rock around the arrowhead grove of tree and see the bridge before they -- one stringer there have be two stringer and adequate flooring when racey have see it last the snow of the previous winter must have be heavy in the frying-pan mountain molly shiver at the sight of that lone stringer the horse be do and so be we she mutter nothing like that he tell she cheerfully there be one stringer leave good enough for a squirrel let alone two white folk i -- i could not shudder molly they have stop at the bridge head racey have dismount and she be look down into the dark mouth of the cleft with frightened eye it must be five hundred foot to the bottom she whisper she chin wobble not more than four hundred he say reassuringly and that log be a good strong four-foot log and she be be shave off with the broadaxe for layin ' the flooring so we get a nice smooth path almost two foot wide in reality that smooth path retain not a few of the spike that have once hold the flooring and it be no more than eighteen inch wide racey gabble on regardless if chatter would do it he would get she mind off that four-hundred-foot drop i cue-can ' t breathe molly i cue-can ' t walk across on that lul-log i would fall off i know i would you be not gonna walk across the log he tell she with a broad grin i 'll carry you pickaback c'mon molly slide off that be right now when i stoop put yore arm round my neck i 'll stick my arm under yore leg see like this now yo be all right do not worry i will not drop you close yore eye and sit still and you 'll never know what be happen close 'em now while i walk round with you a li'l bit so be to get the hang of carryin ' you she close she eye and he begin to walk about carry she at least she think he be walk about but when he stop and she open she eye she discover that the horse be stand on the other side of the cleft at first she do not understand how on earth do the horse get over she ask in wonder he do not racey say quietly set she down but we do i carry you across while you have yore eye shut i tell you you would never know what be happenin ' she sit down limply on the ground racey start back across the stringer to get the horse he hurry too that posse they have see in the valley there be no tell where it be it might be four mile away or four hundred yard c'mon feller say racey pick up the rein of the tired horse and for gawd 's sake pick up yore foot if you do not that dynamite be gonna make one awful mess at the bottom of the caon dynamite mess there be a idea although in order to spare molly a extra worry for the time be he have tell she they would push on together it have be he intention to hold the bridge with he rifle while molly ride alone to the cross-in-a-box for help but those six stick of dynamite would simplify the complex situation without difficulty he do not hurry the horse he merely walk in front hold the bridle slackly the horse follow he as good as gold -- and pick up he foot at nearly every spike once or twice a hind hoof graze a spike-head with a rasping sound that send racey 's heart bounce up into he throat lord so much depend on a safe passage for the first time in he eventful life racey dawson realize that he possess a full and work set of nerve when they reach firm ground racey fling the rein to molly unpack the dynamite he cry it be in the slicker with he bowie he begin furiously to dig under the end of the stringer where it lay embedded in the earth within ten minute he have a hole large enough and long enough to thrust in the whole of he arm he make it a little longer and a little wider and at the end he drive a offset this last that there might be no risk of the charge blow out through the hole when the hole be to he liking he sit back on he haunch and grab the dynamite stick molly hold out to he with string cut from he saddle he tie the stick into a bundle then he prepare he fuse and cap in one of the stick he make a hole in this hole he firmly insert the copper cap above the cap he tie the fuse to the bundle with several lapping of a saddle-string there he exclaim i guess that cap will stay put you and the hoss get out of here molly go along the trail a couple of hundred yard or so g ` on get a move on i 'll be with you in a minute better leave my rifle molly lay the winchester on the grass beside he mount the horse and depart reluctantly she do not like to leave racey now she have burn out she mad she ride away chin on shoulder the cedar swallow she up racey with careful caution stuff the dynamite down the hole and into the offset then he shovel in the earth with he hand and tamp it down with a rock be that the clack of a hoof on stone faint and far away another hoof clack he reach up to he hatband for a match there be no match in he hatband feverishly he search he pocket not a match -- not a match anywhere he whip out he sixshooter hold the muzzle close to the end of the fuse and fire he have to fire three time before the fuse begin to sparkle and spit clearly it come to he ear the unmistakable thudding of gallop hoof on turf the posse be ride for the bridge full tilt he pick up he rifle and dodge in among the tree along the trail forty yard from the mine stringer he meet molly ride back with a scared face what be it she cry to he i hear shot oh what be it go back go back he bawl i only cut that fuse for three minute molly wheel the horse and flee racey run to where a windfall lay near the edge of the cleft and some forty yard from the stringer behind the windfall he lay down lever a cartridge into the chamber and train he rifle on the bridge head the gallop horseman be not a hundred pace from the stringer when the dynamite let go with a soul-satisfying roar rock earth chunk and splinter of wood fly up in advance of a rolling cloud of smoke that obscure the cleft from rim to rim a crash at the bottom of the narrow caon tell racey what have happen to that part of the stringer the dynamite have not destroy racey lower the hammer of he rifle to the safety notch just as the posse begin to approach the spot where the bridge have be it approach on foot by one and two and from tree to tree racey could not see any one but he could see the tree branch move here and there i guess mutter racey as he crawfish away from the windfall i guess that settle the cat-hop \* \* \* \* \* the sun be near its rise the follow day when racey and molly they one horse stagger with fatigue reach the cross-in-a-box racey have walk all the distance he be humanly able to walk but even so the horse have carry double the better part of twenty mile it have earn a rest so have racey 's foot \* \* \* \* \* my gawd what a relief racey muttered and sit back and gingerly wiggle he toe damn shame you have to cut 'em up thataway say jack richie glance at racey 's slit boot they look like new boot it be and they be but i could not get 'em off any other way and i 'll bet i will not be able to get another pair on inside a month lordy man do you ever think natural-born foot would swell like that you better soak they awhile say jack richie c'mon out to the kitchen shore feel good say racey when he swell foot be

's interlocutor if everybody 's comfortable we 'll proceed to business i think you say this be not a trial object luke tweezy and so it be not a trial the judge rap out smartly the trial will come later luke tweezy subside he furtive eye become more furtive than ever go ahead racey say judge dolan racey still hold he sixshooter lean hipshot against the doorjamb it be this way he begin and tell what have transpire that day in the hotel corral when he have be bandage he horse 's leg and have overhear the conversation between lanpher and jack harpe and later punch-the-breeze thompson they be nothing in that declare jack harpe with contempt twist he neck to glower up at racey suppose i do wanna get hold of the dale ranch what of it shore put in luke tweezy what of it perfectly legitimate business proposition legal and all that not quite deny racey not the way you go about it nawsir well gent he resume what i hear in that corral show plain enough there be something up dale would not sell and they be bind to get he land away from he so they figure to have nebraska jone turn the trick by playin ' poker with the old man when nebraska -- they switch from nebraska to peach austin plannin ' to go through with the deal at mcfluke 's from the beginning and that be where tweezy come in he be to get the old man to mcfluke 's and with the help of peach austin cheat dale out of the ranch that be a damn lie cry tweezy i suppose you 'll deny say racey that the day i saw you ride in here to farewell -- i mean the day jack harpe speak to you in front of the happy heart and you do not answer he -- that day you come in from marysville on purpose to tell jack a ' lanpher about the mortgage have to be renew and that now be they chance i suppose you 'll deny all that huh yo be -- yo be lyin ' sputter luke tweezy be i we 'll see when playin ' card with old dale do not work they catch the old man at mcfluke 's one day and after he would get in a fight with mcfluke and mcfluke down he they see they chance to produce a forge release from dale who do the forge break in the judge i dunno for shore this here be find in tweezy 's safe he hold out a letter to the judge judge dolan take the letter and read it carefully then he look across at luke tweezy this here say he tap the letter with stiffened forefinger be a sign letter from dale to you it seem to be a reply in the negative to a letter of yore askin ' he to sell he ranch the judge pause and glance round the room then he cold eye return to the face of luke tweezy who be begin to look extremely wretched underneath the signature of dale continue the judge somebody have copy that signature some fifty or sixty time i wonder why i dunno anything about it luke tweezy deny feebly we 'll come back to that the judge observe softly g ` on racey i figure say racey that they would hatch that forgery some while before dale be kill the killing make it easier to put it on record look that way nod the judge lookit here boom jack harpe you be not get any right to judge we thisaway we be not on trial shore you be not assert the judge i always say you be not this here be just a talk a friendly talk no trial about it here be another letter judge say racey dawson the judge read the other letter and again fix luke tweezy with he eye this be not a letter exactly say judge dolan it be a quadruplicate copy of a agreement between lanpher of the 88 ranch jacob pooley of piegan city and luke tweezy of marysville party of the first part and jack harpe party of the second part to buy or otherwise obtain possession of the ranch of william dale in the northeast corner of which property be located a abandon mine tunnel in which jack harpe the party of the second part have discover a gold-bearing lode a mine muttered swing tunstall a gold mine and i think they want it for a ranch so do i racey nod i know that mine say jake rule silvertip ransom and long oscar drive the tunnel do the necessary labor get they patent and sell out when they could not get day wages to old dale for one pony and a jack but dale never work it a payin ' lode hell who have ` a ' think it old salt a ' tom loudon get a couple o ' claim on the other side of the ridge from dale 's mine put in kansas casey they buy 'em off of slippery wilson and he wife they claim oughta be right valuable now they be nodded judge dolan the agreement go on to say that jack harpe find gold-bearing lode in both of slippery 's old tunnel that these claim will be properly relocate and register -- i guess that be where jakey pooley come in -- and all three mine will be work by a company make up of these four man each man to receive one quarter of the profit this agreement be sign by jack harpe simon lanpher and jacob pooley and after pooley be arrest contribute racey dawson the piegan city marshal go through he safe and find the original of this agreement sign by tweezy lanpher and harpe luke tweezy hold up he hand one moment say he where be the agreement sign by harpe pooley and lanpher find in yore safe reply racey dawson do you find it there yep what be you do at my safe now do not get excited luke i happen to be in the

harpe in a moment the two be roll on the floor it require four man and seven minute to pry they apart chapter xxxii the end of the trail molly dale look at racey with adoring eye how on earth do you guess that the bill smith who rob the well fargo safe at keeleyville and kill the agent be jack harpe oh that be nothing you see i would hear somebody say -- i disremember exactly who now -- that jack
