produce by ted garvin david king and the online distribute proofread team a selection from the discourse of epictetus with the encheiridion translate by george long contents epictetus -lrb- biographical note -rrb- a selection from the discourse of epictetus the encheiridion or manual epictetus very little be know of the life of epictetus it be say that he be a native of hierapoli in phrygium a town between the maeander and a branch of the maeander name the lycus hierapoli be mention in the epistle of paul to the people of colossa -lrb- coloss iv 13 -rrb- from which it have be conclude that there be a christian church in hierapoli in the time of the apostle the date of the birth of epictetus be unknown the only recorded fact of he early life be that he be a slave in rome and he master be epaphroditus a profligate freedman of the emperor nero there be a story that the master break he slave 's leg by torture he but it be better to trust to the evidence of simplicius the commentator on the encheiridion or manual who say that epictetus be weak in body and lame from a early age it be not say how he become a slave but it have be assert in modern time that the parent sell the child i have not however find any authority for this statement it may be suppose that the young slave show intelligence for he master send or permit he to attend the lecture of c musonius rufus a eminent stoic philosopher it may seem strange that such a master should have wish to have he slave make into a philosopher but garnier the author of a mémoire sur les ouvrages d'epictète explain this matter very well in a communication to schweighaeuser garnier say : epictetus bear at hierapoli of phrygium of poor parent be indebted apparently for the advantage of a good education to the whim which be common at the end of the republic and under the first emperor among the great of rome to reckon among they numerous slave grammarian poet rhetorician and philosopher in the same way as rich financier in these later age have be lead to form at a great cost rich and numerous library this supposition be the only one which can explain to we how a wretched child bear as poor as irus have receive a good education and how a rigid stoic be the slave of epaphroditus one of the officer of the imperial guard for we can not suspect that it be through predilection for the stoic doctrine and for he own use that the confidant and the minister of the debauchery of nero would have desire to possess such a slave some writer assume that epictetus be manumit by he master but i can find no evidence for this statement epaphroditus accompany nero when he flee from rome before he enemy and he aid the miserable tyrant in kill himself domitian -lrb- sueton domit 14 -rrb- afterwards put epaphroditus to death for this service to nero we may conclude that epictetus in some way obtain he freedom and that he begin to teach at rome but after the expulsion of the philosopher from rome by domitian ad 89 he retire to nicopoli in epirus a city build by augustus to commemorate the victory at actium epictetus open a school or lecture room at nicopoli where he teach till he be a old man the time of he death be unknown epictetus be never marry as we learn from lucian -lrb- demonax c 55 tear ii ed hemsterh p 393 -rrb- when epictetus be find fault with demonax and advise he to take a wife and beget child for this also as epictetus say be a philosopher 's duty to leave in place of himself another in the universe demonax refute the doctrine by answering : give I then epictetus one of you own daughter simplicius say -lrb- comment c 46 p 432 ed schweigh -rrb- that epictetus live alone a long time at last he take a woman into he house as a nurse for a child which one of epictetus ' friend be go to expose on account of he poverty but epictetus take the child and bring it up epictetus write nothing and all that we have under he name be write by a affectionate pupil arrian afterwards the historian of alexander the great who as he tell we take down in write the philosopher 's discourse -lrb- epistle of arrian to lucius gellius p i -rrb- these discourse form eight book but only four be extant under the title of -lrb- greek : epichtaeton diatribaus -rrb- simplicius in he commentary on the -lrb- greek : egcheiridion -rrb- or manual state that this work also be put together by arrian who select from the discourse of epictetus what he consider to be most useful and most necessary and most adapt to move man 's mind simplicius also say that the contents of the encheiridion be find nearly altogether and in the same word in various part of the discourse arrian also write a work on the life and death of epictetus the event of the philosopher 's studious life be probably not many nor remarkable but we should have be glad if this work have be preserve which tell as simplicius say what kind of man epictetus be photius -lrb- biblioth 58 -rrb- mention among arrian 's work conversation with epictetus -lrb- greek : homiliaus epichtaeton -rrb- in twelve book upton think that this work be only another name for the discourse and that photius have make the mistake of take the conversation to be a different work from the discourse yet photius have enumerate eight book of the discourse and twelve book of the conversation schweighaeuser observe that photius have not see these work of arrian on epictetus for so he conclude from the brief notice of these work by photius the fact be that photius do not say that he have read these book as he generally do when he be speak of the book which he enumerate in he bibliotheca the conclusion be that we be not certain that there be a work of arrian entitle the conversation of epictetus upton remark in a note on iii 23 -lrb- p 184 tran -rrb- that there be many passage in these dissertation which be ambiguous or rather confuse on account of the small question and because the matter be not expand by oratorical copiousness not to mention other cause the discourse of epictetus it be suppose be speak extempore and so one thing after another would come into the thought of the speaker -lrb- wolf -rrb- schweighaeuser also observe in a note -lrb- ii 336 of he edition -rrb- that the connection of the discourse be sometimes obscure through the omission of some word which be necessary to indicate the connection of the thought the reader then will find that he can not always understand epictetus if he do not read he very carefully and some passage more than once he must also think and reflect or he will miss the meaning i do not say that the book be worth all this trouble every man must judge for himself but i should not have translate the book if i have not think it worth study and i think that all book of this kind require careful reading if they be worth read at all gl a selection from the discourse of epictetus of the thing which be in we power and not in we power -- of all the faculty -lrb- except that which i shall soon mention -rrb- you will find not one which be capable of contemplate itself and consequently not capable either of approve or disapprove how far do the grammatic art possess the contemplate power as far as form a judgment about what be write and speak and how far music as far as judge about melody do either of they then contemplate itself by no means but when you must write something to you friend grammar will tell you what word you should write but whether you should write or not grammar will not tell you and so it be with music as to musical sound but whether you should sing at the present time and play on the lute or do neither music will not tell you what faculty then will tell you that which contemplate both itself and all other thing and what be this faculty the rational faculty for this be the only faculty that we have receive which examine itself what it be and what power it have and what be the value of this gift and examine all other faculty : for what else be there which tell we that golden thing be beautiful for they do not say so themselves evidently it be the faculty which be capable of judge of appearance what else judge of music grammar and the other faculty prove they use and point out the occasion for use they nothing else what then should a man have in readiness in such circumstance what else than this what be mine and what be not mine and what be permit to I and what be not permit to I i must die must i then die lament i must be put in chain must i then also lament i must go into exile do any man then hinder I from go with smile and cheerfulness and contentment tell I the secret which you possess i will not for this be in my power but i will put you in chain man what be you talk about I in chain you may fetter my leg but my will not even zeus himself can overpower i will throw you into prison my poor body you mean i will cut you head off when then have i tell you that my head alone can not be cut off these be the thing which philosopher should meditate on which they should write daily in which they should exercise themselves what then do agrippinus say he say i be not a hindrance to myself when it be report to he that he trial be go on in the senate he say : i hope it may turn out well but it be the fifth hour of the day -- this be the time when he be use to exercise himself and then take the cold bath -- let we go and take we exercise after he have take he exercise one come and tell he you have be condemn to banishment he reply or to death to banishment what about my property it be not take from you let we go to aricium then he say and dine \* \* \* \* \* how a man on every occasion can maintain he proper character -- to the rational animal only be the irrational intolerable but that which be rational be tolerable blow be not naturally intolerable how be that see how the lacedaemonian endure whipping when they have learn that whipping be consistent with reason to hang yourself be not intolerable when then you have the opinion that it be rational you go and hang yourself in short if we observe we shall find that the animal man be pained by nothing so much as by that which be irrational and on the contrary attract to nothing so much as to that which be rational only consider at what price you sell you own will : if for no other reason at least for this that you sell it not for a small sum but that which be great and superior perhaps belong to socrate and such as be like he why then if we be naturally such be not a very great number of we like he be it true then that all horse become swift that all dog be skilled in track footprint what then since i be naturally dull shall i for this reason take no pain i hope not epictetus be not superior to socrate but if he be not inferior this be enough for I for i shall never be a milo and yet i do not neglect my body nor shall i be a croesus and yet i do not neglect my property nor in a word do we neglect look after anything because we despair of reach the highest degree \* \* \* \* \* how a man should proceed from the principle of god be the father of all man to the rest -- if a man should be able to assent to this doctrine as he ought that we be all spring from god in a especial manner and that god be the father both of man and of god i suppose that he would never have any ignoble or mean thought about himself but if cæsar -lrb- the emperor -rrb- should adopt you no one could endure you arrogance and if you know that you be the son of zeus will you not be elate yet we do not so but since these two thing be mingle in the generation of man body in common with the animal and reason and intelligence in common with the god many incline to this kinship which be miserable and mortal and some few to that which be divine and happy since then it be of necessity that every man use everything accord to the opinion which he have about it those the few who think that they be form for fidelity and modesty and a sure use of appearance have no mean or ignoble thought about themselves but with the many it be quite the contrary for they say what be i a poor miserable man with my wretched bit of flesh wretched indeed but you possess something better than you bit of flesh why then do you neglect that which be better and why do you attach yourself to this through this kinship with the flesh some of we incline to it become like wolf faithless and treacherous and mischievous some become like lion savage and bestial and untame but the greater part of we become fox and other worse animal for what else be a slanderer and malignant man than a fox or some other more wretched and meaner animal see then and take care that you do not become some one of these miserable thing \* \* \* \* \* of progress or improvement -- he who be make progress have learn from philosopher that desire mean the desire of good thing and aversion mean aversion from bad thing have learn too that happiness and tranquillity be not attainable by man otherwise than by not fail to obtain what he desire and not fall into that which he would avoid such a man take from himself desire altogether and confer it but he employ he aversion only on thing which be dependent on he will for if he attempt to avoid anything independent of he will he know that sometimes he will fall in with something which he wish to avoid and he will be unhappy now if virtue promise good fortune and tranquillity and happiness certainly also the progress towards virtue be progress towards each of these thing for it be always true that to whatever point the perfecting of anything lead we progress be a approach towards this point how then do we admit that virtue be such as i have say and yet seek progress in other thing and make a display of it what be the product of virtue tranquillity who then make improvement be it he who have read many book of chrysippus but do virtue consist in have understand chrysippus if this be so progress be clearly nothing else than know a great deal of chrysippus but now we admit that virtue produce one thing and we declare that approach near to it be another thing namely progress or improvement such a person say one be already able to read chrysippus by himself indeed sir you be make great progress what kind of progress but why do you mock the man why do you draw he away from the perception of he own misfortune will you not show he the effect of virtue that he may learn where to look for improvement seek it there wretch where you work lie and where be you work in desire and in aversion that you may not be disappoint in you desire and that you may not fall into that which you would avoid in you pursuit and avoid that you commit no error in assent and suspension of assent that you be not deceive the first thing and the most necessary be those which i have name but if with tremble and lamentation you seek not to fall into that which you avoid tell I how you be improve do you then show I you improvement in these thing if i be talk to a athlete i should say show I you shoulder and then he might say here be my haltere you and you haltere look to that i should reply i wish to see the effect of the haltere so when you say : take the treatise on the active power -lrb- -lrb- greek : hormea -rrb- -rrb- and see how i have study it i reply : slave i be not inquire about this but how you exercise pursuit and avoidance desire and aversion how you design and purpose and prepare yourself whether conformably to nature or not if conformably give I evidence of it and i will say that you be make progress but if not conformably be go and not only expound you book but write such book yourself and what will you gain by it do you not know that the whole book cost only five denarius do then the expounder seem to be worth more than five denarius never then look for the matter itself in one place and progress towards it in another where then be progress if any of you withdraw himself from externals turn to he own will -lrb- -lrb- greek : proairesis -rrb- -rrb- to exercise it and to improve it by labor so as to make it conformable to nature elevated free unrestrained unimpeded faithful modest and if he have learn that he who desire or avoid the thing which be not in he power can neither be faithful nor free but of necessity he must change with they and be toss about with they as in a tempest and of necessity must subject himself to other who have the power to procure or prevent what lie desire or would avoid finally when he rise in the morning if he observe and keep these rule bathe as a man of fidelity eat as a modest man in like manner if in every matter that occur he work out he chief principle -lrb- -lrb- greek : ta proaegoumena -rrb- -rrb- as the runner do with reference to run and the trainer of the voice with reference to the voice -- this be the man who truly make progress and this be the man who have not travel in vain but if he have strain he effort to the practice of read book and labor only at this and have travel for this i tell he to return home immediately and not to neglect he affair there for this for which he have travel be nothing but the other thing be something to study how a man can rid he life of lamentation and groan and say woe to I and wretched that i be and to rid it also of misfortune and disappointment and to learn what death be and exile and prison and poison that he may be able to say when he be in fetter dear crito if it be the will of the god that it be so let it be so and not to say wretched be i a old man : have i keep my gray hair for this who be it that speak thus do you think that i shall name some man of no repute and of low condition do not priam say this do not oedipus say this nay all king say it for what else be tragedy than the perturbation -lrb- -lrb- greek : patha -rrb- -rrb- of man who value externals exhibit in this kind of poetry but if a man must learn by fiction that no external thing which be independent of the will concern we for my part i should like this fiction by the aid of which i should live happily and undisturbed but you must consider for yourselve what you wish what then do chrysippus teach we the reply be to know that these thing be not false from which happiness come and tranquillity arise take my book and you will learn how true and conformable to nature be the thing which make I free from perturbation o great good fortune o the great benefactor who point out the way to triptolemus all man have erect temple and altar because he give we food by cultivation but to he who discover truth and bring it to light and communicate it to all not the truth which show we how to live but how to live well who of you for this reason have build a altar or a temple or have dedicate a statue or who worship god for this because the god have give the vine or wheat we sacrifice to they but because they have produce in the human mind that fruit by which they design to show we the truth which relate to happiness shall we not thank god for this \* \* \* \* \* against the academic -- if a man say epictetus oppose evident truth it be not easy to find argument by which we shall make he change he opinion but this do not arise either from the man 's strength or the teacher 's weakness for when the man though he have be confute be harden like a stone how shall we then be able to deal with he by argument now there be two kind of harden one of the understand the other of the sense of shame when a man be resolve not to assent to what be manifest nor to desist from contradiction most of we be afraid of mortification of the body and would contrive all means to avoid such a thing but we care not about the soul 's mortification and indeed with regard to the soul if a man be in such a state as not to apprehend anything or understand at all we think that he be in a bad condition but if the sense of shame and modesty be deaden this we call even power -lrb- or strength -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* of providence -- from everything which be or happen in the world it be easy to praise providence if a man possess these two quality : the faculty of see what belong and happen to all person and thing and a grateful disposition if he do not possess these two quality one man will not see the use of thing which be and which happen : another will not be thankful for they even if he do know they if god have make color but have not make the faculty of see they what would have be they use none at all on the other hand if he have make the faculty of vision but have not make object such as to fall under the faculty what in that case also would have be the use of it none at all well suppose that he have make both but have not make light in that case also they would have be of no use who be it then who have fit this to that and that to this what then be these thing do in we only many indeed in we only of which the rational animal have peculiar need but you will find many common to we with irrational animal do they then understand what be do by no means for use be one thing and understanding be another god have need of irrational animal to make use of appearance but of we to understand the use of appearance it be therefore enough for they to eat and to drink and to copulate and to do all the other thing which they severally do but for we to whom he have give also the intellectual faculty these thing be not sufficient for unless we act in a proper and orderly manner and conformably to the nature and constitution of each thing we shall never attain we true end for where the constitution of live being be different there also the act and the end be different in those animal then whose constitution be adapt only to use use alone be enough but in a animal -lrb- man -rrb- which have also the power of understand the use unless there be the due exercise of the understanding he will never attain he proper end well then god constitute every animal one to be eat another to serve for agriculture another to supply cheese and another for some like use for which purpose what need be there to understand appearance and to be able to distinguish they but god have introduce man to be a spectator of god and of he work and not only a spectator of they but a interpreter for this reason it be shameful for man to begin and to end where irrational animal do but rather he ought to begin where they begin and to end where nature end in we and nature end in contemplation and understanding and in a way of life conformable to nature take care then not to die without have be spectator of these thing but you take a journey to olympium to see the work of phidia and all of you think it a misfortune to die without have see such thing but when there be no need to take a journey and where a man be there he have the work -lrb- of god -rrb- before he will you not desire to see and understand they will you not perceive either what you be or what you be bear for or what this be for which you have receive the faculty of sight but you may say there be some thing disagreeable and troublesome in life and be there none at olympium be you not scorch be you not press by a crowd be you not without comfortable means of bathing be you not wet when it rain have you not abundance of noise clamor and other disagreeable thing but i suppose that set all these thing off against the magnificence of the spectacle you bear and endure well then and have you not receive faculty by which you will be able to bear all that happen have you not receive greatness of soul have you not receive manliness have you not receive endurance and why do i trouble myself about anything that can happen if i possess greatness of soul what shall distract my mind or disturb I or appear painful shall i not use the power for the purpose for which i receive it and shall i grieve and lament over what happen come then do you also have observe these thing look to the faculty which you have and when you have look at they say : bring now o zeus any difficulty that thou pleasest for i have means give to I by thee and power for honor myself through the thing which happen you do not so but you sit still tremble for fear that some thing will happen and weep and lament and groan for what do happen and then you blame the god for what be the consequence of such meanness of spirit but impiety and yet god have not only give we these faculty by which we shall be able to bear everything that happen without be depress or break by it but like a good king and a true father he have give we these faculty free from hindrance subject to no compulsion unimpeded and have put they entirely in we own power without even have reserve to himself any power of hinder or impede you who have receive these power free and as you own use they not you do not even see what you have receive and from whom some of you be blind to the giver and not even acknowledge you benefactor and other through meanness of spirit betake yourselve to fault-finding and make charge against god yet i will show to you that you have power and mean for greatness of soul and manliness but what power you have for find fault make accusation do you show I \* \* \* \* \* how from the fact that we be akin to god a man may proceed to the consequence -- i indeed think that the old man ought to be sit here not to contrive how you may have no mean thought nor mean and ignoble talk about yourselve but to take care that there be not among we any young man of such a mind that when they have recognize they kinship to god and that we be fetter by these bond the body i mean and its possession and whatever else on account of they be necessary to we for the economy and commerce of life they should intend to throw off these thing as if they be burden painful and intolerable and to depart to they kinsman but this be the labor that you teacher and instructor ought to be employ upon if he really be what he should be you should come to he and say : epictetus we can no longer endure be bind to this poor body and feed it and give it drink and rest and clean it and for the sake of the body comply with the wish of these and of those be not these thing indifferent and nothing to we and be not death no evil and be we not in a manner kinsman of god and do we not come from he allow we to depart to the place from which we come allow we to be release at last from these bond by which we be bind and weigh down here there be robber and thief and court of justice and those who be name tyrant and think that they have some power over we by means of the body and its possession permit we to show they that they have no power over any man and i on my part would say : friend wait for god : when he shall give the signal and release you from this service then go to he but for the present endure to dwell in this place where he have put you short indeed be this time of you dwelling here and easy to bear for those who be so disposed for what tyrant or what thief or what court of justice be formidable to those who have thus consider as thing of no value the body and the possession of the body wait then do not depart without a reason \* \* \* \* \* of contentment -- with respect to god there be some who say that a divine be do not exist other say that it exist but be inactive and careless and take no forethought about anything a third class say that such a be exist and exercise forethought but only about great thing and heavenly thing and about nothing on the earth a fourth class say that a divine be exercise forethought both about thing on the earth and heavenly thing but in a general way only and not about thing severally there be a fifth class to whom ulyss and socrate belong who say : i move not without thy knowledge -- iliad x 278 before all other thing then it be necessary to inquire about each of these opinion whether it be affirm truly or not truly for if there be no god how be it we proper end to follow they and if they exist but take no care of anything in this case also how will it be right to follow they but if indeed they do exist and look after thing still if there be nothing communicate from they to man nor in fact to myself how even so be it right -lrb- to follow they -rrb- the wise and good man then after consider all these thing submit he own mind to he who administer the whole as good citizen do to the law of the state he who be receive instruction ought to come to be instruct with this intention how shall i follow the god in all thing how shall i be contented with the divine administration and how can i become free for he be free to whom everything happen accord to he will and whom no man can hinder what then be freedom madness certainly not for madness and freedom do not consist but you say i would have everything result just as i like and in whatever way i like you be mad you be beside yourself do you not know that freedom be a noble and valuable thing but for I inconsiderately to wish for thing to happen as i inconsiderately like this appear to be not only not noble but even most base for how do we proceed in the matter of write do i wish to write the name of dion as i choose no but i be teach to choose to write it as it ought to be write and how with respect to music in the same manner and what universally in every art or science just the same if it be not so it would be of no value to know anything if knowledge be adapt to every man 's whim be it then in this alone in this which be the greatest and the chief thing i mean freedom that i be permit to will inconsiderately by no means but to be instruct be this to learn to wish that everything may happen as it do and how do thing happen as the disposer have dispose they and he have appoint summer and winter and abundance and scarcity and virtue and vice and all such opposite for the harmony of the whole and to each of we he have give a body and part of the body and possession and companion what then remain or what method be discover of hold commerce with they be there such a method by which they shall do what seem fit to they and we not the less shall be in a mood which be conformable to nature but you be unwilling to endure and be discontented and if you be alone you call it solitude and if you be with man you call they knave and robber and you find fault with you own parent and child and brother and neighbor but you ought when you be alone to call this condition by the name of tranquillity and freedom and to think yourself like to the god and when you be with many you ought not to call it crowd nor trouble nor uneasiness but festival and assembly and so accept all contentedly what then be the punishment of those who do not accept it be to be what they be be any person dissatisfy with be alone let he be alone be a man dissatisfy with he parent let he be a bad son and lament be he dissatisfy with he child let he be a bad father cast he into prison what prison where he be already for he be there against he will and where a man be against he will there he be in prison so socrate be not in prison for he be there willingly must my leg then be lame wretch do you then on account of one poor leg find fault with the world will you not willingly surrender it for the whole will you not withdraw from it will you not gladly part with it to he who give it and will you be vex and discontent with the thing establish by zeus which he with the moirae -lrb- fate -rrb- who be present and spin the thread of you generation define and put in order know you not how small a part you be compare with the whole i mean with respect to the body for as to intelligence you be not inferior to the god nor less for the magnitude of intelligence be not measure by length nor yet by height but by thought \* \* \* \* \* how everything may be do acceptably to the god -- when some one ask how may a man eat acceptably to the god he answer : if he can eat justly and contentedly and with equanimity and temperately and orderly will it not be also acceptable to the god but when you have ask for warm water and the slave have not hear or if he do hear have bring only tepid water or he be not even find to be in the house then not to be vex or to burst with passion be not this acceptable to the god how then shall a man endure such person as this slave slave yourself will you not bear with you own brother who have zeus for he progenitor and be like a son from the same seed and of the same descent from above but if you have be put in any such higher place will you immediately make yourself a tyrant will you not remember who you be and whom you rule that they be kinsman that they be brethren by nature that they be the offspring of zeus but i have purchase they and they have not purchase I do you see in what direction you be look that it be towards the earth towards the pit that it be towards these wretched law of dead man but towards the law of the god you be not look \* \* \* \* \* what philosophy promise -- when a man be consult he how he should persuade he brother to cease be angry with he epictetus reply : philosophy do not propose to secure for a man any external thing if it do -lrb- or if it be not as i say -rrb- philosophy would be allow something which be not within its province for as the carpenter 's material be wood and that of the statuary be copper so the matter of the art of living be each man 's life when then be my brother 's that again belong to he own art but with respect to yours it be one of the external thing like a piece of land like health like reputation but philosophy promise none of these in every circumstance i will maintain she say the govern part conformable to nature whose govern part he in whom i be she say how then shall my brother cease to be angry with I bring he to I and i will tell he but i have nothing to say to you about he anger when the man who be consult he say i seek to know this how even if my brother be not reconcile to I shall i maintain myself in a state conformable to nature nothing great say epictetus be produce suddenly since not even the grape or the fig be if you say to I now that you want a fig i will answer to you that it require time : let it flower first then put forth fruit and then ripen be then the fruit of a fig-tree not perfect suddenly and in one hour and would you possess the fruit of a man 's mind in so short a time and so easily do not expect it even if i tell you \* \* \* \* \* that we ought not to be angry with the error -lrb- fault -rrb- of other -- ought not then this robber and this adulterer to be destroy by no means say so but speak rather in this way : this man who have be mistaken and deceive about the most important thing and blind not in the faculty of vision which distinguish white and black but in the faculty which distinguish good and bad should we not destroy he if you speak thus you will see how inhuman this be which you say and that it be just as if you would say ought we not to destroy this blind and deaf man but if the greatest harm be the privation of the greatest thing and the greatest thing in every man be the will or choice such as it ought to be and a man be deprive of this will why be you also angry with he man you ought not to be affect contrary to nature by the bad thing of another pity he rather drop this readiness to be offend and to hate and these word which the many utter : these accursed and odious fellow how have you be make so wise at once and how be you so peevish why then be we angry be it because we value so much the thing of which these man rob we do not admire you clothes and then you will not be angry with the thief consider this matter thus : you have fine clothes you neighbor have not you have a window you wish to air the clothes the thief do not know wherein man 's good consist but he think that it consist in have fine clothes the very thing which you also think must he not then come and take they away when you show a cake to greedy person and swallow it all yourself do you expect they not to snatch it from you do not provoke they do not have a window do not air you clothes i also lately have a iron lamp place by the side of my household god hear a noise at the door i run down and find that the lamp have be carry off i reflect that he who have take the lamp have do nothing strange what then to-morrow i say you will find a earthen lamp for a man only lose that which he have i have lose my garment the reason be that you have a garment i have a pain in my head have you any pain in you horn why then be you trouble for we only lose those thing we have only pain about those thing which we possess but the tyrant will chain -- what the leg he will take away -- what the neck what then will he not chain and not take away the will this be why the ancient teach the maxim know thyself therefore we ought to exercise ourselves in small thing and begin with they to proceed to the greater i have pain in the head do not say alas i have pain in the ear do not say alas and i do not say that you be not allow to groan but do not groan inwardly and if you slave be slow in bring a bandage do not cry out and torment yourself and say every body hate I for who would not hate such a man for the future rely on these opinion walk about upright free not trust to the size of you body as a athlete for a man ought not to be invincible in the way that a ass be \* \* \* \* \* how we should behave to tyrant -- if a man possess any superiority or think that he do when he do not such a man if he be uninstructed will of necessity be puff up through it for instance the tyrant say i be master of all and what can you do for I can you give I desire which shall have no hindrance how can you have you the infallible power of avoid what you would avoid have you the power of move towards a object without error and how do you possess this power come when you be in a ship do you trust to yourself or to the helmsman and when you be in a chariot to whom do you trust but to the driver and how be it in all other art just the same in what then lie you power all man pay respect to I well i also pay respect to my platter and i wash it and wipe it and for the sake of my oil-flask i drive a peg into the wall well then be these thing superior to I no but they supply some of my want and for this reason i take care of they well do i not attend to my ass do i not wash he foot do i not clean he do you not know that every man have regard to himself and to you just the same as he have regard to he ass for who have regard to you as a man show I who wish to become like you who imitate you as he imitate socrate but i can cut off you head you say right i have forget that i must have regard to you as i would to a fever and the bile and raise a altar to you as there be at rome a altar to fever what be it then that disturb and terrify the multitude be it the tyrant and he guard -lrb- by no means -rrb- i hope that it be not so it be not possible that what be by nature free can be disturb by anything else or hinder by any other thing than by itself but it be a man 's own opinion which disturb he for when the tyrant say to a man i will chain you leg he who value he leg say do not have pity but he who value he own will say if it appear more advantageous to you chain it do you not care i do not care i will show you that i be master you can not do that zeus have set I free do you think that he intend to allow he own son to be enslave but you be master of my carcase take it so when you approach I you have no regard to I no but i have regard to myself and if you wish I to say that i have regard to you also i tell you that i have the same regard to you that i have to my pipkin what then when absurd notion about thing independent of we will as if they be good and -lrb- or -rrb- bad lie at the bottom of we opinion we must of necessity pay regard to tyrant : for i wish that man would pay regard to tyrant only and not also to the bedchamber man how be it that the man become all at once wise when cæsar have make he superintendent of the close stool how be it that we say immediately felicion speak sensibly to I i wish he be eject from the bedchamber that he might again appear to you to be a fool have a man be exalt to the tribuneship all who meet he offer they congratulation one kiss he eye another the neck and the slave kiss he hand he go to he house he find torch light he ascend the capitol he offer a sacrifice on the occasion now who ever sacrifice for have have good desire for have act conformably to nature for in fact we thank the god for those thing in which we place we good a person be talk to I to-day about the priesthood of augustus i say to he : man let the thing alone you will spend much for no purpose but he reply those who draw up agreement will write my name do you then stand by those who read they and say to such person it be i whose name be write there and if you can now be present on ail such occasion what will you do when you be dead my name will remain write it on a stone and it will remain but come what remembrance of you will there be beyond nicopoli but i shall wear a crown of gold if you desire a crown at all take a crown of rose and put it on for it will be more elegant in appearance \* \* \* \* \* against those who wish to be admire -- when a man hold he proper station in life he do not gape after thing beyond it man what do you wish to happen to you i be satisfied if i desire and avoid conformably to nature if i employ movement towards and from a object as i be by nature form to do and purpose and design and assent why then do you strut before we as if you have swallow a spit my wish have always be that those who meet I should admire I and those who follow I should exclaim o the great philosopher who be they by whom you wish to be admire be they not those of whom you be use to say that they be mad well then do you wish to be admire by madman \* \* \* \* \* on præcognitions -- præcognitions be common to all man and præcognition be not contradictory to præcognition for who of we do not assume that good be useful and eligible and in all circumstance that we ought to follow and pursue it and who of we do not assume that justice be beautiful and become when then do the contradiction arise it arise in the adaptation of the præcognitions to the particular case when one man say he have do well he be a brave man and another say not so but he have act foolishly then the dispute arise among man this be the dispute among the jew and the syrian and the egyptian and the roman not whether holiness should be prefer to all thing and in all case should be pursue but whether it be holy to eat pig 's flesh or not holy you will find this dispute also between agamemnon and achille for call they forth what do you say agamemnon ought not that to be do which be proper and right certainly well what do you say achille do you not admit that what be good ought to be do i do most certainly adapt you præcognitions then to the present matter here the dispute begin agamemnon say i ought not to give up chrysei to she father achille say you ought it be certain that one of the two make a wrong adaptation of the præcognition of ought or duty further agamemnon say then if i ought to restore chrysei it be fit that i take he prize from some of you achille reply would you then take she whom i love yes she whom you love must i then be the only man who go without a prize and must i be the only man who have no prize thus the dispute begin what then be education education be the learn how to adapt the natural præcognitions to the particular thing conformably to nature and then to distinguish that of thing some be in we power but other be not in we power be will and all act which depend on the will thing not in we power be the body the part of the body possession parent brother child country and generally all with whom we live in society in what then should we place the good to what kind of thing -lrb- -lrb- greek : ousium -rrb- -rrb- shall we adapt it to the thing which be in we power be not health then a good thing and soundness of limb and life and be not child and parent and country who will tolerate you if you deny this let we then transfer the notion of good to these thing be it possible then when a man sustain damage and do not obtain good thing that he can be happy it be not possible and can he maintain towards society a proper behavior he can not for i be naturally form to look after my own interest if it be my interest to have a estate in land it be my interest also to take it from my neighbor if it be my interest to have a garment it be my interest also to steal it from the bath this be the origin of war civil commotion tyranny conspiracy and how shall i be still able to maintain my duty towards zeus for if i sustain damage and be unlucky he take no care of I and what be he to I if he can not help I and further what be he to I if he allow I to be in the condition in which i be i now begin to hate he why then do we build temple why setup statue to zeus as well as to evil demon such as to fever and how be zeus the savior and how the giver of rain and the giver of fruit and in truth if we place the nature of good in any such thing all this follow what should we do then this be the inquiry of the true philosopher who be in labor now i do not see what the good be nor the bad be i not mad yes but suppose that i place the good somewhere among the thing which depend on the will all will laugh at I there will come some greyhead wear many gold ring on he finger and he will shake he head and say : hear my child it be right that you should philosophize but you ought to have some brain also all this that you be do be silly you learn the syllogism from philosopher but you know how to act better than philosopher do man why then do you blame I if i know what shall i say to this slave if i be silent he will burst i must speak in this way : excuse I as you would excuse lover i be not my own master i be mad \* \* \* \* \* how we should struggle with circumstance -- it be circumstance -lrb- difficulty -rrb- which show what man be therefore when a difficulty fall upon you remember that god like a trainer of wrestler have match you with a rough young man for what purpose you may say why that you may become a olympic conqueror but it be not accomplish without sweat in my opinion no man have have a more profitable difficulty than you have have if you choose to make use of it as a athlete would deal with a young antagonist we be now send a scout to rome but no man send a cowardly scout who if he only hear a noise and see a shadow anywhere come run back in terror and report that the enemy be close at hand so now if you should come and tell we : fearful be the state of affair at rome terrible be death terrible be exile terrible be calumny terrible be poverty fly my friend the enemy be near we shall answer : begone prophesy for yourself we have commit only one fault that we send such a scout diogene who be send as a scout before you make a different report to we he say that death be no evil for neither be it base he say that fame -lrb- reputation -rrb- be the noise of madman and what have this spy say about pain about pleasure and about poverty he say that to be naked be better than any purple robe and to sleep on the bare ground be the softest bed and he give as a proof of each thing that he affirm he own courage he tranquillity he freedom and the healthy appearance and compactness of he body there be no enemy near he say all be peace how so diogene see he reply if i be strike if i have be wound if i have flee from any man this be what a scout ought to be but you come to we and tell we one thing after another will you not go back and you will see clearer when you have lay aside fear \* \* \* \* \* on the same -- if these thing be true and if we be not silly and be not act hypocritically when we say that the good of man be in the will and the evil too and that everything else do not concern we why be we still disturb why be we still afraid the thing about which we have be busy be in no man 's power and the thing which be in the power of other we care not for what kind of trouble have we still but give I direction why should i give you direction have not zeus give you direction have he not give to you what be you own free from hindrance and free from impediment and what be not you own subject to hindrance and impediment what direction then what kind of order do you bring when you come from he keep by every mean what be you own do not desire what belong to other fidelity -lrb- integrity -rrb- be you own virtuous shame be you own who then can take these thing from you who else than yourself will hinder you from use they but how do you act when you seek what be not you own you lose that which be you own have such prompting and command from zeus what kind do you still ask from I be i more powerful than he be i more worthy of confidence but if you observe these do you want any other besides well but he have not give these order you will say produce you præcognitions -lrb- -lrb- greek : prolaepsei -rrb- -rrb- produce these proof of philosopher produce what you have often hear and produce what you have say yourself produce what you have read produce what you have meditate on and you will then see that all these thing be from god if i have set my admiration on the poor body i have give myself up to be a slave if on my poor possession i also make myself a slave for i immediately make it plain with what i may be catch as if the snake draw in he head i tell you to strike that part of he which he guard and do you be assure that whatever part you choose to guard that part you master will attack remember this whom will you still flatter or fear but i should like to sit where the senator sit do you see that you be put yourself in strait you be squeeze yourself how then shall i see well in any other way in the amphitheatre man do not be a spectator at all and you will not be squeeze why do you give yourself trouble or wait a little and when the spectacle be over seat yourself in the place reserve for the senator and sun yourself for remember this general truth that it be we who squeeze ourselves who put ourselves in strait that be we opinion squeeze we and put we in strait for what be it to be revile stand by a stone and revile it and what will you gain if then a man listen like a stone what profit be there to the reviler but if the reviler have as a stepping-stone -lrb- or ladder -rrb- the weakness of he who be revile then he accomplish something strip he what do you mean by he lay hold of he garment strip it off i have insult you much good may it do you this be the practice of socrate this be the reason why he always have one face but we choose to practice and study anything rather than the means by which we shall be unimpeded and free you say : philosopher talk paradox but be there no paradox in the other art and what be more paradoxical than to puncture a man 's eye in order that he may see if any one say this to a man ignorant of the surgical art would he not ridicule the speaker where be the wonder then if in philosophy also many thing which be true appear paradoxical to the inexperienced \* \* \* \* \* in how many way appearance exist and what aid we should provide against they -- appearance be to we in four way for either thing appear as they be or they be not and do not even appear to be or they be and do not appear to be or they be not and yet appear to be further in all these case to form a right judgment -lrb- to hit the mark -rrb- be the office of a educate man but whatever it be that annoy -lrb- trouble -rrb- we to that we ought to apply a remedy if the sophism of pyrrho and of the academic be what annoy -lrb- trouble -rrb- we must apply the remedy to they if it be the persuasion of appearance by which some thing appear to be good when they be not good let we seek a remedy for this if it be habit which annoy we we must try to seek aid against habit what aid then can we find against habit the contrary habit you hear the ignorant say : that unfortunate person be dead he father and mother be overpower with sorrow he be cut off by a untimely death and in a foreign land hear the contrary way of speak tear yourself from these expression oppose to one habit the contrary habit to sophistry oppose reason and the exercise and discipline of reason against persuasive -lrb- deceitful -rrb- appearance we ought to have manifest præcognitions -lrb- -lrb- greek : prolaepsei -rrb- -rrb- clear of all impurity and ready to hand when death appear a evil we ought to have this rule in readiness that it be fit to avoid evil thing and that death be a necessary thing for what shall i do and where shall i escape it suppose that i be not sarpedon the son of zeus nor able to speak in this noble way i will go and i be resolve either to behave bravely myself or to give to another the opportunity of do so if i can not succeed in do anything myself i will not grudge another the do of something noble suppose that it be above we power to act thus be it not in we power to reason thus tell I where i can escape death discover for I the country show I the man to whom i must go whom death do not visit discover to I a charm against death if i have not one what do you wish I to do i can not escape from death shall i not escape from the fear of death but shall i die lament and tremble for the origin of perturbation be this to wish for something and that this should not happen therefore if i be able to change externals accord to my wish i change they but if i can not i be ready to tear out the eye of he who hinder I for the nature of man be not to endure to be deprive of the good and not to endure the fall into the evil then at last when i be neither able to change circumstance nor to tear out the eye of he who hinder I i sit down and groan and abuse whom i can zeus and the rest of the god for if they do not care for I what be they to I yes but you will be a impious man in what respect then will it be worse for I than it be now to sum up remember that unless piety and you interest be in the same thing piety can not be maintain in any man do not these thing seem necessary -lrb- true -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* that we ought not to be angry with man and what be the small and the great thing among man -- what be the cause of assent to anything the fact that it appear to be true it be not possible then to assent to that which appear not to be true why because this be the nature of the understanding to incline to the true to be dissatisfy with the false and in matter uncertain to withhold assent what be the proof of this imagine -lrb- persuade yourself -rrb- if you can that it be now night it be not possible take away you persuasion that it be day it be not possible persuade yourself or take away you persuasion that the star be even in number it be impossible when then any man assent to that which be false be assure that he do not intend to assent to it as false for every soul be unwillingly deprive of the truth as plato say but the falsity seem to he to be true well in act what have we of the like kind as we have here truth or falsehood we have the fit and the not fit -lrb- duty and not duty -rrb- the profitable and the unprofitable that which be suitable to a person and that which be not and whatever be like these can then a man think that a thing be useful to he and not choose it he can not how say medea ` tis true i know what evil i shall do but passion overpower the better counsel she think that to indulge she passion and take vengeance on she husband be more profitable than to spare she child it be so but she be deceive show she plainly that she be deceive and she will not do it but so long as you do not show it what can she follow except that which appear to herself -lrb- she opinion -rrb- nothing else why then be you angry with the unhappy woman that she have be bewilder about the most important thing and be become a viper instead of a human creature and why not if it be possible rather pity as we pity the blind and the lame so those who be blind and maim in the faculty which be supreme whoever then clearly remember this that to man the measure of every act be the appearance -lrb- the opinion -rrb- whether the thing appear good or bad if good he be free from blame if bad himself suffer the penalty for it be impossible that he who be deceive can be one person and he who suffer another person -- whoever remember this will not be angry with any man will not be vex at any man will not revile or blame any man nor hate nor quarrel with any man so then all these great and dreadful deed have this origin in the appearance -lrb- opinion -rrb- yes this origin and no other the iliad be nothing else than appearance and the use of appearance it appear to alexander to carry off the wife of menelaus it appear to helene to follow he if then it have appear to menelaus to feel that it be a gain to be deprive of such a wife what would have happen not only would the iliad have be lose but the odyssey also on so small a matter then do such great thing depend but what do you mean by such great thing war and civil commotion and the destruction of many man and city and what great matter be this be it nothing but what great matter be the death of many ox and many sheep and many nest of swallow or stork be burnt or destroy be these thing then like those very like body of man be destroy and the body of ox and sheep the dwelling of man be burnt and the nest of stork what be there in this great or dreadful or show I what be the difference between a man 's house and a stork 's nest as far as each be a dwelling except that man build he little house of beam and tile and brick and the stork build they of stick and mud be a stork and a man then like thing what say you in body they be very much alike do a man then differ in no respect from a stork do not suppose that i say so but there be no difference in these matter -lrb- which i have mention -rrb- in what then be the difference seek and you will find that there be a difference in another matter see whether it be not in a man the understanding of what he do see if it be not in social community in fidelity in modesty in steadfastness in intelligence where then be the great good and evil in man it be where the difference be if the difference be preserved and remain fenced round and neither modesty be destroy nor fidelity nor intelligence then the man also be preserved but if any of these thing be destroy and storm like a city then the man too perish : and in this consist the great thing alexander you say sustained great damage then when the hellene invade and when they ravage troy and when he brother perish by no means for no man be damage by a action which be not he own but what happen at that time be only the destruction of stork 's nest now the ruin of alexander be when he lose the character of modesty fidelity regard to hospitality and to decency when be achille ruin be it when patroclus die not so but it happen when he begin to be angry when he weep for a girl when he forget that he be at troy not to get mistress but to fight these thing be the ruin of man this be be besiege this be the destruction of city when right opinion be destroy when they be corrupt \* \* \* \* \* on constancy -lrb- or firmness -rrb- -- the be -lrb- nature -rrb- of the good be a certain will the be of the bad be a certain kind of will what then be externals material for the will about which the will be conversant shall obtain its own good or evil how shall it obtain the good if it do not admire -lrb- over-value -rrb- the material for the opinion about the material if the opinion be right make the will good : but perverse and distorted opinion make the will bad god have fix this law and say if you would have anything good receive it from yourself you say no but i will have it from another do not so : but receive it from yourself therefore when the tyrant threaten and call I i say whom do you threaten if he say i will put you in chain i say you threaten my hand and my foot if he say i will cut off you head i reply you threaten my head if he say i will throw you into prison i say you threaten the whole of this poor body if he threaten I with banishment i say the same do he then not threaten you at all if i feel that all these thing do not concern I he do not threaten I at all but if i fear any of they it be i whom he threaten whom then do i fear the master of what the master of thing which be in my own power there be no such master do i fear the master of thing which be not in my power and what be these thing to I do you philosopher then teach we to despise king i hope not who among we teach to claim against they the power over thing which they possess take my poor body take my property take my reputation take those who be about I if i advise any person to claim these thing they may truly accuse I yes but i intend to command you opinion also and who have give you this power how can you conquer the opinion of another man by apply terror to it he reply i will conquer it do you not know that opinion conquer itself and be not conquer by another but nothing else can conquer will except the will itself for this reason too the law of god be most powerful and most just which be this : let the stronger always be superior to the weaker ten be stronger than one for what for put in chain for kill for drag whither they choose for take away what a man have the ten therefore conquer the one in this in which they be stronger in what then be the ten weaker if the one possess right opinion and the other do not well then can the ten conquer in this matter how be it possible if we be place in the scale must not the heavier draw down the scale in which it be how strange then that socrate should have be so treat by the athenian slave why do you say socrate speak of the thing as it be : how strange that the poor body of socrate should have be carry off and drag to prison by stronger man and that anyone should have give hemlock to the poor body of socrate and that it should breathe out the life do these thing seem strange do they seem unjust do you on account of these thing blame god have socrate then no equivalent for these thing where then for he be the nature of good whom shall we listen to you or he and what do socrate say anytus and melitus can kill I but they can not hurt I and further he say if it so please god so let it be but show I that he who have the inferior principle overpower he who be superior in principle you will never show this nor come near show it for this be the law of nature and of god that the superior shall always overpower the inferior in what in that in which it be superior one body be stronger than another : many be stronger than one : the thief be stronger than he who be not a thief this be the reason why i also lose my lamp because in wakefulness the thief be superior to I but the man buy the lamp at this price : for a lamp he become a thief a faithless fellow and like a wild beast this seem to he a good bargain be it so but a man have seize I by the cloak and be draw I to the public place : then other bawl out philosopher what have be the use of you opinion see you be drag to prison you be go to be behead and what system of philosophy -lrb- -lrb- greek : eisagogaen -rrb- -rrb- could i have make so that if a stronger man should have lay hold of my cloak i should not be drag off that if ten man should have lay hold of I and cast I into prison i should not be cast in have i learn nothing else then i have learn to see that everything which happen if it be independent of my will be nothing to I i may ask if you have not gain by this why then do you seek advantage in anything else than in that in which you have learn that advantage be will you not leave the small argument -lrb- -lrb- greek : logarium -rrb- -rrb- about these matter to other to lazy fellow that they may sit in a corner and receive they sorry pay or grumble that no one give they anything and will you not come forward and make use of what you have learn for it be not these small argument that be want now the writings of the stoic be full of they what then be the thing which be want a man who shall apply they one who by he act shall bear testimony to he word assume i intreat you this character that we may no longer use in the school the example of the ancient but may have some example of we own to whom then do the contemplation of these matter -lrb- philosophical inquiry -rrb- belong to he who have leisure for man be a animal that love contemplation but it be shameful to contemplate these thing as runaway slave do we should sit as in a theater free from distraction and listen at one time to the tragic actor at another time to the lute-player and not do as slave do as soon as the slave have take he station he praise the actor and at the same time look round then if any one call out he master 's name the slave be immediately frightened and disturbed it be shameful for philosopher thus to contemplate the work of nature for what be a master man be not the master of man but death be and life and pleasure and pain for if he come without these thing bring cæsar to I and you will see how firm i be but when he shall come with these thing thunder and lightning and when i be afraid of they what do i do then except to recognize my master like the runaway slave but so long as i have any respite from these terror as a runaway slave stand in the theater so do i i bathe i drink i sing but all this i do with terror and uneasiness but if i shall release myself from my master that be from those thing by means of which master be formidable what further trouble have i what master have i still what then ought we to publish these thing to all man no but we ought to accommodate ourselves to the ignorant -lrb- -lrb- greek : tois idiotais -rrb- -rrb- and to say : this man recommend to I that which he think good for himself i excuse he for socrate also excuse the jailer who have the charge of he in prison and be weep when socrate be go to drink the poison and say how generously he lament over we do he then say to the jailer that for this reason we have send away the woman no but he say it to he friend who be able to hear -lrb- understand -rrb- it and he treat the jailer as a child \* \* \* \* \* that confidence -lrb- courage -rrb- be not inconsistent with caution -- the opinion of the philosopher perhaps seem to some to be a paradox but still let we examine as well as we can if it be true that it be possible to do everything both with caution and with confidence for caution seem to be in a manner contrary to confidence and contrary be in no way consistent that which seem to many to be a paradox in the matter under consideration in my opinion be of this kind if we assert that we ought to employ caution and confidence in the same thing man might justly accuse we of bring together thing which can not be unite but now where be the difficulty in what be say for if these thing be true which have be often say and often prove that the nature of good be in the use of appearance and the nature of evil likewise and that thing independent of we will do not admit either the nature of evil or of good what paradox do the philosopher assert if they say that where thing be not dependent on the will there you should employ confidence but where they be dependent on the will there you should employ caution for if the bad consist in the bad exercise of the will caution ought only to be use where thing be dependent on the will but if thing independent of the will and not in we power be nothing to we with respect to these we must employ confidence and thus we shall both be cautious and confident and indeed confident because of we caution for by employ caution towards thing which be really bad it will result that we shall have confidence with respect to thing which be not so we be then in the condition of deer when they flee from the huntsman 's feather in fright whither do they turn and in what do they seek refuge as safe they turn to the net and thus they perish by confound thing which be object of fear with thing that they ought not to fear thus we also act : in what case do we fear in thing which be independent of the will in what case on the contrary do we behave with confidence as if there be no danger in thing dependent on the will to be deceive then or to act rashly or shamelessly or with base desire to seek something do not concern we at all if we only hit the mark in thing which be independent of we will but where there be death or exile or pain or infamy there we attempt to run away there we be strike with terror therefore as we may expect it to happen with those who err in the greatest matter we convert natural confidence -lrb- that be accord to nature -rrb- into audacity desperation rashness shamelessness and we convert natural caution and modesty into cowardice and meanness which be full of fear and confusion for if a man should transfer caution to those thing in which the will may be exercise and the act of the will he will immediately by willing to be cautious have also the power of avoid what he choose but if he transfer it to the thing which be not in he power and will and attempt to avoid the thing which be in the power of other he will of necessity fear he will be unstable he will be disturb for death or pain be not formidable but the fear of pain or death for this reason we commend the poet who say : not death be evil but a shameful death confidence -lrb- courage -rrb- then ought to be employ against death and caution against the fear of death but now we do the contrary and employ against death the attempt to escape and to we opinion about it we employ carelessness rashness and indifference these thing socrate properly use to call tragic mask for as to child mask appear terrible and fearful from inexperience we also be affect in like manner by event -lrb- the thing which happen in life -rrb- for no other reason than child be by mask for what be a child ignorance what be a child want of knowledge for when a child know these thing he be in no way inferior to we what be death a tragic mask turn it and examine it see it do not bite the poor body must be separate from the spirit either now or later as it be separate from it before why then be you trouble if it be separate now for if it be not separate now it will be separate afterwards why that the period of the universe may be complete for it have need of the present and of the future and of the past what be pain a mask turn it and examine it the poor flesh be move roughly then on the contrary smoothly if this do not satisfy -lrb- please -rrb- you the door be open if it do bear -lrb- with thing -rrb- for the door ought to be open for all occasion and so we have no trouble what then be the fruit of these opinion it be that which ought to be the most noble and the most become to those who be really educate release from perturbation release from fear freedom for in these matter we must not believe the many who say that free person only ought to be educate but we should rather believe the philosopher who say that the educate only be free how be this in this manner : be freedom anything else than the power of live as we choose nothing else tell I then ye man do you wish to live in error we do not no one then who live in error be free do you wish to live in fear do you wish to live in sorrow do you wish to live in perturbation by no mean no one then who be in a state of fear or sorrow or perturbation be free but whoever be deliver from sorrow and fear and perturbation he be at the same time also deliver from servitude how then can we continue to believe you most dear legislator when you say we only allow free person to be educate for philosopher say we allow none to be free except the educate that be god do not allow it when then a man have turn round before the prætor he own slave have he do nothing he have do something what he have turn round he own slave before the prætor have he do nothing more yes : he be also bind to pay for he the tax call the twentieth well then be not the man who have go through this ceremony become free no more than he be become free from perturbation have you who be able to turn round -lrb- free -rrb- other no master be not money you master or a girl or a boy or some tyrant or some friend of the tyrant why do you trouble then when you be go off to any trial -lrb- danger -rrb- of this kind it be for this reason that i often say study and hold in readiness these principle by which you may determine what those thing be with reference to which you ought to be cautious courageous in that which do not depend on you will cautious in that which do depend on it \* \* \* \* \* of tranquillity -lrb- freedom from perturbation -rrb- -- consider you who be go into court what you wish to maintain and what you wish to succeed in for if you wish to maintain a will conformable to nature you have every security every facility you have no trouble for if you wish to maintain what be in you own power and be naturally free and if you be content with these what else do you care for for who be the master of such thing who can take they away if you choose to be modest and faithful who shall not allow you to be so if you choose not to be restrain or compel who shall compel you to desire what you think that you ought not to desire who shall compel you to avoid what you do not think fit to avoid but what do you say the judge will determine against you something that appear formidable but that you should also suffer in try to avoid it how can he do that when then the pursuit of object and the avoid of they be in you power what else do you care for let this be you preface this you narrative this you confirmation this you victory this you peroration this you applause -lrb- or the approbation which you will receive -rrb- therefore socrate say to one who be remind he to prepare for he trial do you not think then that i have be prepare for it all my life by what kind of preparation i have maintain that which be in my own power how then i have never do anything unjust either in my private or in my public life but if you wish to maintain externals also you poor body you little property and you little estimation i advise you to make from this moment all possible preparation and then consider both the nature of you judge and you adversary if it be necessary to embrace he knee embrace he knee if to weep weep if to groan groan for when you have subject to externals what be you own then be a slave and do not resist and do not sometimes choose to be a slave and sometimes not choose but with all you mind be one or the other either free or a slave either instruct or uninstructed either a well-bred cock or a mean one either endure to be beat until you die or yield at once and let it not happen to you to receive many stripe and then to yield but if these thing be base determine immediately where be the nature of evil and good it be where truth be : where truth be and where nature be there be caution : where truth be there be courage where nature be for this reason also it be ridiculous to say suggest something to I -lrb- tell I what to do -rrb- what should i suggest to you well form my mind so as to accommodate itself to any event why that be just the same as if a man who be ignorant of letter should say tell I what to write when any name be propose to I for if i should tell he to write dion and then another should come and propose to he not the name of dion but that of theon what will be do what will he write but if you have practice write you be also prepare to write -lrb- or to do -rrb- anything that be require if you be not what can i now suggest for if circumstance require something else what will you say or what will you do remember then this general precept and you will need no suggestion but if you gape after externals you must of necessity ramble up and down in obedience to the will of you master and who be the master he who have the power over the thing which you seek to gain or try to avoid \* \* \* \* \* how magnanimity be consistent with care -- thing themselves -lrb- material -rrb- be indifferent but the use of they be not indifferent how then shall a man preserve firmness and tranquillity and at the same time be careful and neither rash nor negligent if he imitate those who play at dice the counter be indifferent the dice be indifferent how do i know what the cast will be but to use carefully and dexterously the cast of the dice this be my business thus then in life also the chief business be this : distinguish and separate thing and say : externals be not in my power : will be in my power where shall i seek the good and the bad within in the thing which be my own but in what do not belong to you call nothing either good or bad or profit or damage or anything of the kind what then should we use such thing carelessly in no way : for this on the other hand be bad for the faculty of the will and consequently against nature but we should act carefully because the use be not indifferent and we should also act with firmness and freedom from perturbation because the material be indifferent for where the material be not indifferent there no man can hinder I or compel I where i can be hinder and compel the obtain of those thing be not in my power nor be it good or bad but the use be either bad or good and the use be in my power but it be difficult to mingle and to bring together these two thing -- the carefulness of he who be affect by the matter -lrb- or thing about he -rrb- and the firmness of he who have no regard for it but it be not impossible : and if it be happiness be impossible but we should act as we do in the case of a voyage what can i do i can choose the master of the ship the sailor the day the opportunity then come a storm what more have i to care for for my part be do the business belong to another the master but the ship be sink -- what then have i to do i do the only thing that i can not to be drown full of fear nor scream nor blame god but know that what have be produce must also perish : for i be not a immortal be but a man a part of the whole as a hour be a part of the day : i must be present like the hour and past like the hour what difference then do it make to I how i pass away whether by be suffocate or by a fever for i must pass through some such means how then be it say that some external thing be accord to nature and other contrary to nature it be say as it might be say if we be separate from union -lrb- or society -rrb- : for to the foot i shall say that it be accord to nature for it to be clean but if you take it as a foot and as a thing not detach -lrb- independent -rrb- it will befit it both to step into the mud and tread on thorn and sometimes to be cut off for the good of the whole body otherwise it be no longer a foot we should think in some such way about ourselves also what be you a man if you consider yourself as detach from other man it be accord to nature to live to old age to be rich to be healthy but if you consider yourself as a man and a part of a certain whole it be for the sake of that whole that at one time you should be sick at another time take a voyage and run into danger and at another time be in want and in some case die prematurely why then be you trouble do you not know that as a foot be no longer a foot if it be detach from the body so you be no longer a man if you be separate from other man for what be a man a part of a state of that first which consist of god and of man then of that which be call next to it which be a small image of the universal state what then must i be bring to trial must another have a fever another sail on the sea another die and another be condemn yes for it be impossible in such a universe of thing among so many live together that such thing should not happen some to one and other to other it be you duty then since you be come here to say what you ought to arrange these thing as it be fit then some one say i shall charge you with do I wrong much good may it do you : i have do my part but whether you also have do yours you must look to that for there be some danger of this too that it may escape you notice \* \* \* \* \* of indifference -- the hypothetical proposition be indifferent : the judgment about it be not indifferent but it be either knowledge or opinion or error thus life be indifferent : the use be not indifferent when any man then tell you that these thing also be indifferent do not become negligent and when a man invite you to be careful -lrb- about such thing -rrb- do not become abject and strike with admiration of material thing and it be good for you to know you own preparation and power that in those matter where you have not be prepare you may keep quiet and not be vex if other have the advantage over you for you too in syllogism will claim to have the advantage over they and if other should be vex at this you will console they by say i have learn they and you have not thus also where there be need of any practice seek not that which be acquire from the need -lrb- of such practice -rrb- but yield in that matter to those who have have practice and be yourself content with firmness of mind go and salute a certain person how not meanly but i have be shut out for i have not learn to make my way through the window and when i have find the door shut i must either come back or enter through the window but still speak to he in what way not meanly but suppose that you have not get what you want be this you business and not he why then do you claim that which belong to another always remember what be you own and what belong to another and you will not be disturbed chrysippus therefore say well so long as future thing be uncertain i always cling to those which be more adapt to the conservation of that which be accord to nature for god himself have give I the faculty of such choice but if i know that it be fate -lrb- in the order of thing -rrb- for I to be sick i would even move towards it for the foot also if it have intelligence would move to go into the mud for why be ear of corn produce be it not that they may become dry and do they not become dry that they may be reap for they be not separate from communion with other thing if then they have perception ought they to wish never to be reap but this be a curse upon ear of corn to be never reap so we must know that in the case of man too it be a curse not to die just the same as not to be ripened and not to be reap but since we must be reap and we also know that we be reap we be vex at it for we neither know what we be nor have we study what belong to man as those who have study horse know what belong to horse but chrysanta when he be go to strike the enemy check himself when he hear the trumpet sound a retreat : so it seem better to he to obey the general 's command than to follow he own inclination but not one of we choose even when necessity summons readily to obey it but weep and groan we suffer what we do suffer and we call they circumstance what kind of circumstance man if you give the name of circumstance to the thing which be around you all thing be circumstance but if you call hardship by this name what hardship be there in the die of that which have be produce but that which destroy be either a sword or a wheel or the sea or a tile or a tyrant why do you care about the way of go down to hade all way be equal but if you will listen to the truth the way which the tyrant send you be shorter a tyrant never kill a man in six month : but a fever be often a year about it all these thing be only sound and the noise of empty name \* \* \* \* \* how we ought to use divination -- through a unreasonable regard to divination many of we omit many duty for what more can the diviner see than death or danger or disease or generally thing of that kind if then i must expose myself to danger for a friend and if it be my duty even to die for he what need have i then for divination have i not within I a diviner who have tell I the nature of good and of evil and have explain to I the sign -lrb- or mark -rrb- of both what need have i then to consult the viscera of victim or the flight of bird and why do i submit when he say it be for you interest for do he know what be for my interest do he know what be good and as he have learn the sign of the viscera have he also learn the sign of good and evil for if he know the sign of these he know the sign both of the beautiful and of the ugly and of the just and of the unjust do you tell I man what be the thing which be signify for I : be it life or death poverty or wealth but whether these thing be for my interest or whether they be not i do not intend to ask you why do not you give you opinion on matter of grammar and why do you give it here about thing on which we be all in error and dispute with one another what then lead we to frequent use of divination cowardice the dread of what will happen this be the reason why we flatter the diviner pray master shall i succeed to the property of my father let we see : let we sacrifice on the occasion yes master as fortune choose when he have say you shall succeed to the inheritance we thank he as if we receive the inheritance from he the consequence be that they play upon we will you not then seek the nature of good in the rational animal for if it be not there you will not choose to say that it exist in any other thing -lrb- plant or animal -rrb- what then be not plant and animal also the work of god they be but they be not superior thing nor yet part of the god but you be a superior thing you be a portion separate from the deity you have in yourself a certain portion of he why then be you ignorant of you own noble descent why do you not know whence you come will you not remember when you be eat who you be who eat and whom you feed when you be in social intercourse when you be exercise yourself when you be engage in discussion know you not that you be nourish a god that you be exercise a god wretch you be carry about a god with you and you know it not do you think that i mean some god of silver or of gold and external you carry he within yourself and you perceive not that you be pollute he by impure thought and dirty deed and if a image of god be present you would not dare to do any of the thing which you be do but when god himself be present within and see all and hear all you be not ashamed of think such thing and do such thing ignorant as you be of you own nature and subject to the anger of god then why do we fear when we be send a young man from the school into active life lest he should do anything improperly eat improperly have improper intercourse with woman and lest the rag in which he be wrap should debase he lest fine garment should make he proud this youth -lrb- if he act thus -rrb- do not know he own god he know not with whom he set out -lrb- into the world -rrb- but can we endure when he say i wish i have you -lrb- god -rrb- with I have you not god with you and do you seek for any other when you have he or will god tell you anything else than this if you be a statue of phidia either athena or zeus you would think both of yourself and of the artist and if you have any understanding -lrb- power of perception -rrb- you would try to do nothing unworthy of he who make you or of yourself and try not to appear in a unbecoming dress -lrb- attitude -rrb- to those who look upon you but now because zeus have make you for this reason do you care not how you shall appear and yet be the artist -lrb- in the one case -rrb- like the artist in the other or the work in the one case like the other and what work of a artist for instance have in itself the faculty which the artist show in make it be it not marble or bronze or gold or ivory and the athena of phidia when she have once extend the hand and receive in it the figure of victory stand in that attitude for ever but the work of god have power of motion they breathe they have the faculty of use the appearance of thing and the power of examine they be the work of such a artist do you dishonor he and what shall i say not only that he make you but also entrust you to yourself and make you a deposit to yourself will you not think of this too but do you also dishonor you guardianship but if god have entrust a orphan to you would you thus neglect he he have deliver yourself to you own care and say : i have no one fitter to entrust he to than yourself keep he for I such as he be by nature modest faithful erect unterrified free from passion and perturbation and then you do not keep he such but some will say whence have this fellow get the arrogance which he display and these supercilious look i have not yet so much gravity as befit a philosopher for i do not yet feel confidence in what i have learn and in what i have assent to i still fear my own weakness let I get confidence and then you shall see a countenance such as i ought to have and a attitude such as i ought to have then i will show to you the statue when it be perfect when it be polish what do you expect a supercilious countenance do the zeus at olympium lift up he brow no he look be fix as become he who be ready to say : irrevocable be my word and shall not fail -- iliad i 526 such will i show myself to you faithful modest noble free from perturbation what and immortal too except from old age and from sickness no but die as become a god sickening as become a god this power i possess this i can do but the rest i do not possess nor can i do i will show the nerve -lrb- strength -rrb- of a philosopher what nerve be these a desire never disappoint a aversion which never fall on that which it would avoid a proper pursuit -lrb- -lrb- greek : hormaen -rrb- -rrb- a diligent purpose a assent which be not rash these you shall see \* \* \* \* \* that when we can not fulfil that which the character of a man promise we assume the character of a philosopher -- it be no common -lrb- easy -rrb- thing to do this only to fulfil the promise of a man 's nature for what be a man the answer be a rational and mortal be then by the rational faculty from whom be we separate from wild beast and from what other from sheep and like animal take care then to do nothing like a wild beast but if you do you have lose the character of a man you have not fulfil you promise see that you do nothing like a sheep but if you do in this case also the man be lose what then do we do as sheep when we act gluttonously when we act lewdly when we act rashly filthily inconsiderately to what have we decline to sheep what have we lose the rational faculty when we act contentiously and harmfully and passionately and violently to what have we decline to wild beast consequently some of we be great wild beast and other little beast of a bad disposition and small whence we may say let I be eat by a lion but in all these way the promise of a man act as a man be destroy for when be a conjunctive -lrb- complex -rrb- proposition maintain when it fulfil what its nature promise so that the preservation of a complex proposition be when it be a conjunction of truth when be a disjunctive maintain when it fulfil what it promise when be flute a lyre a horse a dog preserved -lrb- when they severally keep they promise -rrb- what be the wonder then if man also in like manner be preserved and in like manner be lose each man be improve and preserve by correspond act the carpenter by act of carpentry the grammarian by act of grammar but if a man accustom himself to write ungrammatically of necessity he art will be corrupt and destroy thus modest action preserve the modest man and immodest action destroy he and action of fidelity preserve the faithful man and the contrary action destroy he and on the other hand contrary action strengthen contrary character : shamelessness strengthen the shameless man faithlessness the faithless man abusive word the abusive man anger the man of a angry temper and unequal receiving and give make the avaricious man more avaricious for this reason philosopher admonish we not to be satisfy with learn only but also to add study and then practice for we have long be accustom to do contrary thing and we put in practice opinion which be contrary to true opinion if then we shall not also put in practice right opinion we shall be nothing more than the expositor of the opinion of other for now who among we be not able to discourse accord to the rule of art about good and evil thing -lrb- in this fashion -rrb- that of thing some be good and some be bad and some be indifferent : the good then be virtue and the thing which participate in virtue and the bad be the contrary and the indifferent be wealth health reputation then if in the midst of we talk there should happen some greater noise than usual or some of those who be present should laugh at we we be disturbed philosopher where be the thing which you be talk about whence do you produce and utter they from the lip and thence only why then do you corrupt the aid provide by other why do you treat the weightiest matter as if you be play a game of dice for it be one thing to lay up bread and wine as in a storehouse and another thing to eat that which have be eat be digest distribute and be become sinew flesh bone blood healthy color healthy breath whatever be store up when you choose you can readily take and show it but you have no other advantage from it except so far as to appear to possess it for what be the difference between explain these doctrine and those of man who have different opinion sit down now and explain accord to the rule of art the opinion of epicurus and perhaps you will explain he opinion in a more useful manner than epicurus himself why then do you call yourself a stoic why do you deceive the many why do you act the part of a jew when you be a greek do you not see how -lrb- why -rrb- each be call a jew or a syrian or a egyptian and when we see a man incline to two side we be accustom to say this man be not a jew but he act as one but when he have assume the affect of one who have be imbue with jewish doctrine and have adopt that sect then he be in fact and he be name a jew \* \* \* \* \* how we may discover the duty of life from name -- consider who you be in the first place you be a man and this be one who have nothing superior to the faculty of the will but all other thing subject to it and the faculty itself he possess unenslaved and free from subjection consider then from what thing you have be separate by reason you have be separate from wild beast you have be separate from domestic animal -lrb- -lrb- greek : probaton -rrb- -rrb- further you be a citizen of the world and a part of it not one of the subservient -lrb- serve -rrb- but one of the principal -lrb- ruling -rrb- part for you be capable of comprehend the divine administration and of consider the connection of thing what then do the character of a citizen promise -lrb- profess -rrb- to hold nothing as profitable to himself to deliberate about nothing as if he be detach from the community but to act as the hand or foot would do if they have reason and understand the constitution of nature for they would never put themselves in motion nor desire anything otherwise than with reference to the whole therefore the philosopher say well that if the good man have foreknowledge of what would happen he would co-operate towards he own sickness and death and mutilation since he know that these thing be assign to he accord to the universal arrangement and that the whole be superior to the part and the state to the citizen but now because we do not know the future it be we duty to stick to the thing which be in they nature more suitable for we choice for we be make among other thing for this after this remember that you be a son what do this character promise to consider that everything which be the son 's belong to the father to obey he in all thing never to blame he to another nor to say or do anything which do he injury to yield to he in all thing and give way co-operate with he as far as you can after this know that you be a brother also and that to this character it be due to make concession to be easily persuade to speak good of you brother never to claim in opposition to he any of the thing which be independent of the will but readily to give they up that you may have the larger share in what be dependent on the will for see what a thing it be in place of a lettuce if it should so happen or a seat to gain for yourself goodness of disposition how great be the advantage next to this if you be a senator of any state remember that you be a senator if a youth that you be a youth if a old man that you be a old man for each of such name if it come to be examine mark out the proper duty but if you go and blame you brother i say to you you have forget who you be and what be you name in the next place if you be a smith and make a wrong use of the hammer you would have forget the smith and if you have forget the brother and instead of a brother have become a enemy would you appear not to have change one thing for another in that case and if instead of a man who be a tame animal and social you be become a mischievous wild beast treacherous and bite have you lose nothing but -lrb- i suppose -rrb- you must lose a bit of money that you may suffer damage and do the loss of nothing else do a man damage if you have lose the art of grammar or music would you think the loss of it a damage and if you shall lose modesty moderation -lrb- -lrb- greek : chtastolaen -rrb- -rrb- and gentleness do you think the loss nothing and yet the thing first mention be lose by some cause external and independent of the will and the second by we own fault and as to the first neither to have they nor to lose they be shameful but as to the second not to have they and to lose they be shameful and matter of reproach and a misfortune what then shall i not hurt he who have hurt I in the first place consider what hurt -lrb- -lrb- greek : blabae -rrb- -rrb- be and remember what you have hear from the philosopher for if the good consist in the will -lrb- purpose intention -lrb- greek : proaireei -rrb- -rrb- and the evil also in the will see if what you say be not this : what then since that man have hurt himself by do a unjust act to I shall i not hurt myself by do some unjust act to he why do we not imagine to ourselves -lrb- mentally think of -rrb- something of this kind but where there be any detriment to the body or to we possession there be harm there and where the same thing happen to the faculty of the will there be -lrb- you suppose -rrb- no harm for he who have be deceive or he who have do a unjust act neither suffer in the head nor in the eye nor in the hip nor do he lose he estate and we wish for nothing else than -lrb- security to -rrb- these thing but whether we shall have the will modest and faithful or shameless and faithless we care not the least except only in the school so far as a few word be concerned therefore we proficiency be limit to these few word but beyond they it do not exist even in the slightest degree \* \* \* \* \* what the beginning of philosophy be -- the beginning of philosophy to he at least who enter on it in the right way and by the door be a consciousness of he own weakness and inability about necessary thing for we come into the world with no natural notion of a right-angled triangle or of a diesis -lrb- a quarter tone -rrb- or of a half-tone but we learn each of these thing by a certain transmission accord to art and for this reason those who do not know they do not think that they know they but as to good and evil and beautiful and ugly and become and unbecome and happiness and misfortune and proper and improper and what we ought to do and what we ought not to do who ever come into the world without have a innate idea of they wherefore we all use these name and we endeavor to fit the preconception to the several case -lrb- thing -rrb- thus : he have do well he have not do well he have do as he ought not as he ought he have be unfortunate he have be fortunate he be unjust he be just who do not use these name who among we defer the use of they till he have learn they as he defer the use of the word about line -lrb- geometrical figure -rrb- or sound and the cause of this be that we come into the world already teach as it be by nature some thing on this matter -lrb- -lrb- greek : topon -rrb- -rrb- and proceed from these we have add to they self-conceit -lrb- -lrb- greek : oiaesin -rrb- -rrb- for why a man say do i not know the beautiful and the ugly have i not the notion of it you have do i not adapt it to particulars you do do i not then adapt it properly in that lie the whole question and conceit be add here for begin from these thing which be admit man proceed to that which be matter of dispute by means of unsuitable adaptation for if they possess this power of adaptation in addition to those thing what would hinder they from be perfect but now since you think that you properly adapt the preconception to the particulars tell I whence you derive this -lrb- assume that you do so -rrb- because i think so but it do not seem so to another and he think that he also make a proper adaptation or do he not think so he do think so be it possible then that both of you can properly apply the preconception to thing about which you have contrary opinion it be not possible can you then show we anything better towards adapt the preconception beyond you thinking that you do do the madman do any other thing than the thing which seem to he right be then this criterion sufficient for he also it be not sufficient come then to something which be superior to seem -lrb- -lrb- greek : tou dochein -rrb- -rrb- what be this observe this be the beginning of philosophy a perception of the disagreement of man with one another and a inquiry into the cause of the disagreement and a condemnation and distrust of that which only seem and a certain investigation of that which seem whether it seem rightly and a discovery of some rule -lrb- -lrb- greek : chanono -rrb- -rrb- as we have discover a balance in the determination of weight and a carpenter 's rule -lrb- or square -rrb- in the case of straight and crooked thing -- this be the beginning of philosophy must we say that all thing be right which seem so to all and how be it possible that contradiction can be right -- not all then but all which seem to we to be right -- how more to you than those which seem right to the syrian why more than what seem right to the egyptian why more than what seem right to I or to any other man not at all more what then seem to every man be not sufficient for determine what be for neither in the case of weight nor measure be we satisfy with the bare appearance but in each case we have discover a certain rule in this matter then be there no rule superior to what seem and how be it possible that the most necessary thing among man should have no sign -lrb- mark -rrb- and be incapable of be discover there be then some rule and why then do we not seek the rule and discover it and afterwards use it without vary from it not even stretch out the finger without it for this i think be that which when it be discover cure of they madness those who use mere seem as a measure and misuse it so that for the future proceeding from certain thing -lrb- principle -rrb- know and make clear we may use in the case of particular thing the preconception which be distinctly fix what be the matter present to we about which we be inquire pleasure -lrb- for example -rrb- subject it to the rule throw it into the balance ought the good to be such a thing that it be fit that we have confidence in it yes and in which we ought to confide it ought to be be it fit to trust to anything which be insecure no be then pleasure anything secure no take it then and throw it out of the scale and drive it far away from the place of good thing but if you be not sharp-sighted and one balance be not enough for you bring another be it fit to be elate over what be good yes be it proper then to be elate over present pleasure see that you do not say that it be proper but if you do i shall then not think you worthy even of the balance thus thing be test and weigh when the rule be ready and to philosophize be this to examine and confirm the rule and then to use they when they be know be the act of a wise and good man \* \* \* \* \* of disputation or discussion -- what thing a man must learn in order to be able to apply the art of disputation have be accurately show by we philosopher -lrb- the stoic -rrb- but with respect to the proper use of the thing we be entirely without practice only give to any of we whom you please a illiterate man to discuss with and he can not discover how to deal with the man but when he have move the man a little if he answer beside the purpose he do not know how to treat he but he then either abuse or ridicule he and say he be a illiterate man it be not possible to do anything with he now a guide when he have find a man out of the road lead he into the right way he do not ridicule or abuse he and then leave he do you also show the illiterate man the truth and you will see that he follow but so long as you do not show he the truth do not ridicule he but rather feel you own incapacity now this be the first and chief peculiarity of socrate never to be irritated in argument never to utter anything abusive anything insulting but to bear with abusive person and to put a end to the quarrel if you would know what great power he have in this way read the symposium of xenophon and you will see how many quarrel he put a end to hence with good reason in the poet also this power be most highly praise : quickly with skill he settle great dispute hesiod theogony v 87 \* \* \* \* \* on anxiety -lrb- solicitude -rrb- -- when i see a man anxious i say what do this man want if he do not want something which be not in he power how could he be anxious for this reason a lute player when he be singing by himself have no anxiety but when he enter the theater he be anxious even if he have a good voice and play well on the lute for he not only wish to sing well but also to obtain applause : but this be not in he power accordingly where he have skill there he have confidence bring any single person who know nothing of music and the musician do not care for he but in the matter where a man know nothing and have not be practice there he be anxious what matter be this he know not what a crowd be or what the praise of a crowd be however he have learn to strike the lowest chord and the highest but what the praise of the many be and what power it have in life he neither know nor have he think about it hence he must of necessity tremble and grow pale be any man then afraid about thing which be not evil no be he afraid about thing which be evil but still so far within he power that they may not happen certainly he be not if then the thing which be independent of the will be neither good nor bad and all thing which do depend on the will be within we power and no man can either take they from we or give they to we if we do not choose where be room leave for anxiety but we be anxious about we poor body we little property about the will of cæsar but not anxious about thing internal be we anxious about not form a false opinion no for this be in my power about not exert we movement contrary to nature no not even about this when then you see a man pale as the physician say judge from the complexion this man 's spleen be disorder that man 's liver so also say this man 's desire and aversion be disorder he be not in the right way he be in a fever for nothing else change the color or cause tremble or chatter of the tooth or cause a man to sink in he knee and shift from foot to foot iliad xiii 281 for this reason when zeno be go to meet antigonus he be not anxious for antigonus have no power over any of the thing which zeno admire and zeno do not care for those thing over which antigonus have power but antigonus be anxious when he be go to meet zeno for he wish to please zeno but this be a thing external -lrb- out of he power -rrb- but zeno do not want to please antigonus for no man who be skilled in any art wish to please one who have no such skill should i try to please you why i suppose you know the measure by which one man be estimate by another have you take pain to learn what be a good man and what be a bad man and how a man become one or the other why then be you not good yourself how he reply be i not good because no good man lament or groan or weep no good man be pale and tremble or say how will he receive I how will he listen to I slave just as it please he why do you care about what belong to other be it now he fault if he receive badly what proceeds from you certainly and be it possible that a fault should be one man 's and the evil in another no why then be you anxious about that which belong to other you question be reasonable but i be anxious how i shall speak to he can not you then speak to he as you choose but i fear that i may be disconcert if you be go to write the name of dion be you afraid that you would be disconcert by no means why be it not because you have practice write the name certainly well if you be go to read the name would you not feel the same and why because every art have a certain strength and confidence in the thing which belong to it have you then not practice speaking and what else do you learn in the school syllogism and sophistical proposition for what purpose be it not for the purpose of discourse skilfully and be not discourse skilfully the same as discourse seasonably and cautiously and with intelligence and also without make mistake and without hindrance and besides all this with confidence yes when then you be mount on a horse and go into a plain be you anxious at be match against a man who be on foot and anxious in a matter in which you be practice and he be not yes but that person -lrb- to whom i be go to speak -rrb- have power to kill I speak the truth then unhappy man and do not brag nor claim to be a philosopher nor refuse to acknowledge you master but so long as you present this handle in you body follow every man who be stronger than yourself socrate use to practice speak he who talk as he do to the tyrant to the dicast -lrb- judge -rrb- he who talk in he prison diogene have practice speak he who speak as he do to alexander to the pirate to the person who buy he these man be confident in the thing which they practice but do you walk off to you own affair and never leave they : go and sit in a corner and weave syllogism and propose they to another there be not in you the man who can rule a state \* \* \* \* \* to naso -- when a certain roman enter with he son and listen to one reading epictetus say this be the method of instruction and he stop when the roman ask he to go on epictetus say every art when it be teach cause labor to he who be unacquainted with it and be unskilled in it and indeed the thing which proceed from the art immediately show they use in the purpose for which they be make and most of they contain something attractive and please for indeed to be present and to observe how a shoemaker learn be not a pleasant thing but the shoe be useful and also not disagreeable to look at and the discipline of a smith when he be learn be very disagreeable to one who chance to be present and be a stranger to the art : but the work show the use of the art but you will see this much more in music for if you be present while a person be learn the discipline will appear most disagreeable and yet the result of music be please and delightful to those who know nothing of music and here we conceive the work of a philosopher to be something of this kind : he must adapt he wish -lrb- -lrb- greek : boulaesin -rrb- -rrb- to what be go on so that neither any of the thing which be take place shall take place contrary to we wish nor any of the thing which do not take place shall not take place when we wish that they should from this the result be to those who have so arrange the work of philosophy not to fail in the desire nor to fall in with that which they would avoid without uneasiness without fear without perturbation to pass through life themselves together with they associate maintain the relation both natural and acquire as the relation of son of father of brother of citizen of man of wife of neighbor of fellow-traveller of ruler of rule the work of a philosopher we conceive to be something like this it remain next to inquire how this must be accomplish we see then that the carpenter -lrb- -lrb- greek : techton -rrb- -rrb- when he have learn certain thing become a carpenter the pilot by learn certain thing become a pilot may it not then in philosophy also not be sufficient to wish to be wise and good and that there be also a necessity to learn certain thing we inquire then what these thing be the philosopher say that we ought first to learn that there be a god and that he provide for all thing also that it be not possible to conceal from he we act or even we intention and thought the next thing be to learn what be the nature of the god for such as they be discover to be he who would please and obey they must try with all he power to be like they if the divine be faithful man also must be faithful if it be free man also must be free if beneficent man also must be beneficent if magnanimous man also must be magnanimous as be then a imitator of god he must do and say everything consistently with this fact \* \* \* \* \* to or against those who obstinately persist in what they have determine -- when some person have hear these word that a man ought to be constant -lrb- firm -rrb- and that the will be naturally free and not subject to compulsion but that all other thing be subject to hindrance to slavery and be in the power of other they suppose that they ought without deviation to abide by everything which they have determine but in the first place that which have be determine ought to be sound -lrb- true -rrb- i require tone -lrb- sinew -rrb- in the body but such as exist in a healthy body in a athletic body but if it be plain to I that you have the tone of a frenzied man and you boast of it i shall say to you man seek the physician this be not tone but atony -lrb- deficiency in right tone -rrb- in a different way something of the same kind be feel by those who listen to these discourse in a wrong manner which be the case with one of my companion who for no reason resolve to starve himself to death i hear of it when it be the third day of he abstinence from food and i go to inquire what have happen i have resolve he say but still tell I what it be which induce you to resolve for if you have resolve rightly we shall sit with you and assist you to depart but if you have make a unreasonable resolution change you mind we ought to keep to we determination what be you do man we ought to keep not to all we determination but to those which be right for if you be now persuade that it be right do not change you mind if you think fit but persist and say we ought to abide by we determination will you not make the beginning and lay the foundation in a inquiry whether the determination be sound or not sound and so then build on it firmness and security but if you lay a rotten and ruinous foundation will not you miserable little building fall down the sooner the more and the stronger be the material which you shall lay on it without any reason would you withdraw from we out of life a man who be a friend and a companion a citizen of the same city both the great and the small city then while you be commit murder and destroy a man who have do no wrong do you say that you ought to abide by you determination and if it ever in any way come into you head to kill I ought you to abide by you determination now this man be with difficulty persuade to change he mind but it be impossible to convince some person at present so that i seem now to know what i do not know before the meaning of the common say that you can neither persuade nor break a fool may it never be my lot to have a wise fool for my friend nothing be more untractable i be determine the man say madman be also but the more firmly they form a judgment on thing which do not exist the more hellebore they require will you not act like a sick man and call in the physician -- i be sick master help I consider what i must do : it be my duty to obey you so it be here also : i know not what i ought to do but i be come to learn -- not so but speak to I about other thing : upon this i have determine -- what other thing for what be greater and more useful than for you to be persuade that it be not sufficient to have make you determination and not to change it this be the tone -lrb- energy -rrb- of madness not of health -- i will die if you compel I to this -- why man what have happen -- i have determine -- i have have a lucky escape that you have not determine to kill I -- i take no money why -- i have determine -- be assure that with the very tone -lrb- energy -rrb- which you now use in refuse to take there be nothing to hinder you at some time from incline without reason to take money and then say i have determine as in a distempered body subject to defluxion the humor incline sometimes to these part and then to those so too a sickly soul know not which way to incline but if to this inclination and movement there be add a tone -lrb- obstinate resolution -rrb- then the evil become past help and cure \* \* \* \* \* that we do not strive to use we opinion about good and evil -- where be the good in the will where be the evil in the will where be neither of they in those thing which be independent of the will well then do any one among we think of these lesson out of the school do any one meditate -lrb- strive -rrb- by himself to give a answer to thing as in the case of question -- be it day -- yes -- be it night -- no -- well be the number of star even -- i can not say -- when money be show -lrb- offer -rrb- to you have you study to make the proper answer that money be not a good thing have you practice yourself in these answer or only against sophism why do you wonder then if in the case which you have study in those you have improve but in those which you have not study in those you remain the same when the rhetorician know that he have write well that he have commit to memory what he have write and bring a agreeable voice why be he still anxious because he be not satisfy with have study what then do he want to be praise by the audience for the purpose then of be able to practice declamation he have be discipline but with respect to praise and blame he have not be discipline for when do he hear from any one what praise be what blame be what the nature of each be what kind of praise should be seek or what kind of blame should be shun and when do he practice this discipline which follow these word -lrb- thing -rrb- why then do you still wonder if in the matter which a man have learn there he surpass other and in those in which he have not be discipline there he be the same with the many so the lute player know how to play sing well and have a fine dress and yet he tremble when he enter on the stage for these matter he understand but he do not know what a crowd be nor the shout of a crowd nor what ridicule be neither do he know what anxiety be whether it be we work or the work of another whether it be possible to stop it or not for this reason if he have be praise he leave the theater puff up but if he have be ridicule the swollen bladder have be puncture and subside this be the case also with ourselves what do we admire externals about what thing be we busy externals and have we any doubt then why we fear or why we be anxious what then happen when we think the thing which be come on we to be evil it be not in we power not to be afraid it be not in we power not to be anxious then we say lord god how shall i not be anxious fool have you not hand do not god make they for you sit down now and pray that you nose may not run wipe yourself rather and do not blame he well then have he give to you nothing in the present case have he not give to you endurance have he not give to you magnanimity have he not give to you manliness when you have such hand do you still look for one who shall wipe you nose but we neither study these thing nor care for they give I a man who care how he shall do anything not for the obtain of a thing but who care about he own energy what man when he be walk about care for he own energy who when he be deliberate care about he own deliberation and not about obtain that about which he deliberate and if he succeed he be elated and say how well we have deliberate do i not tell you brother that it be impossible when we have think about anything that it should not turn out thus but if the thing should turn out otherwise the wretched man be humble he know not even what to say about what have take place who among we for the sake of this matter have consult a seer who among we as to he action have not sleep in indifference who give -lrb- name -rrb- to I one that i may see the man whom i have long be look for who be truly noble and ingenuous whether young or old name he what then be the thing which be heavy on we and disturb we what else than opinion what else than opinion lie heavy upon he who go away and leave he companion and friend and place and habit of life now little child for instance when they cry on the nurse leave they for a short time forget they sorrow if they receive a small cake do you choose then that we should compare you to little child no by zeus for i do not wish to be pacify by a small cake but by right opinion and what be these such as a man ought to study all day and not to be affect by anything that be not he own neither by companion nor place nor gymnasium and not even by he own body but to remember the law and to have it before he eye and what be the divine law to keep a man 's own not to claim that which belong to other but to use what be give and when it be not give not to desire it and when a thing be take away to give it up readily and immediately and to be thankful for the time that a man have have the use of it if you would not cry for you nurse and mamma for what matter do it make by what thing a man be subdue and on what he depend in what respect be you better than he who cry for a girl if you grieve for a little gymnasium and little portico and young man and such place of amusement another come and lament that he shall no longer drink the water of dirce be the marcian water worse than that of dirce but i be use to the water of dirce and you in turn will be use to the other then if you become attach to this also cry for this too and try to make a verse like the verse of euripide the hot bath of nero and the marcian water see how tragedy be make when common thing happen to silly man when then shall i see athen again and the acropoli wretch be you not content with what you see daily have you anything better or greater to see than the sun the moon the star the whole earth the sea but if indeed you comprehend he who administer the whole and carry he about in yourself do you still desire small stone and a beautiful rock \* \* \* \* \* how we must adapt preconception to particular case -- what be the first business of he who philosophize to throw away self-conceit -lrb- -lrb- greek : oiaesis -rrb- -rrb- for it be impossible for a man to begin to learn that which he think that he know as to thing then which ought to be do and ought not to be do and good and bad and beautiful and ugly all of we talk of they at random go to the philosopher and on these matter we praise we censure we accuse we blame we judge and determine about principle honorable and dishonorable but why do we go to the philosopher because we wish to learn what we do not think that we know and what be this theorem for we wish to learn what philosopher say as be something elegant and acute and some wish to learn that they may get profit from what they learn it be ridiculous then to think that a person wish to learn one thing and will learn another or further that a man will make proficiency in that which he do not learn but the many be deceive by this which deceive also the rhetorician theopompus when he blame even plato for wish everything to be define for what do he say do none of we before you use the word good or just or do we utter the sound in a unmeaning and empty way without understand what they severally signify now who tell you theopompus that we have not natural notion of each of these thing and preconception -lrb- -lrb- greek : prolaepsei -rrb- -rrb- but it be not possible to adapt preconception to they correspondent object if we have not distinguish -lrb- analyze -rrb- they and inquire what object must be subject to each preconception you may make the same charge against physician also for who among we do not use the word healthy and unhealthy before hippocrate live or do we utter these word as empty sound for we have also a certain preconception of health but we be not able to adapt it for this reason one say abstain from food another say give food another say bleed and another say use cup what be the reason be it any other than that a man can not properly adapt the preconception of health to particulars \* \* \* \* \* how we should struggle against appearance -- every habit and faculty be maintain and increase by the corresponding action : the habit of walk by walk the habit of run by run if you would be a good reader read if a writer write but when you shall not have read for thirty day in succession but have do something else you will know the consequence in the same way if you shall have lie down ten day get up and attempt to make a long walk and you will see how you leg be weaken generally then if you would make anything a habit do it if you would not make it a habit do not do it but accustom yourself to do something else in place of it so it be with respect to the affection of the soul : when you have be angry you must know that not only have this evil befall you but that you have also increase the habit and in a manner throw fuel upon fire in this manner certainly as philosopher say also disease of the mind grow up for when you have once desire money if reason be apply to lead to a perception of the evil the desire be stop and the ruling faculty of we mind be restore to the original authority but if you apply no means of cure it no longer return to the same state but be again excite by the corresponding appearance it be inflamed to desire quicker than before : and when this take place continually it be henceforth harden -lrb- make callous -rrb- and the disease of the mind confirm the love of money for he who have have a fever and have be relieve from it be not in the same state that he be before unless he have be completely cure something of the kind happen also in disease of the soul certain trace and blister be leave in it and unless a man shall completely efface they when he be again lash on the same place the lash will produce not blister -lrb- weal -rrb- but sore if then you wish not to be of a angry temper do not feed the habit : throw nothing on it which will increase it : at first keep quiet and count the day on which you have not be angry i use to be in passion every day now every second day then every third then every fourth but if you have intermit thirty day make a sacrifice to god for the habit at first begin to be weaken and then be completely destroy i have not be vex to-day nor the day after nor yet on any succeed day during two or three month but i take care when some exciting thing happen be assure that you be in a good way how then shall this be do be willing at length to be approve by yourself be willing to appear beautiful to god desire to be in purity with you own pure self and with god then when any such appearance visit you plato say have recourse to expiation go a suppliant to the temple of the avert deity it be even sufficient if you resort to the society of noble and just man and compare yourself with they whether you find one who be live or dead but in the first place be not hurry away by the rapidity of the appearance but say appearance wait for I a little let I see who you be and what you be about let I put you to the test and then do not allow the appearance to lead you on and draw lively picture of the thing which will follow for if you do it will carry you off wherever it please but rather bring in to oppose it some other beautiful and noble appearance and cast out this base appearance and if you be accustom to be exercise in this way you will see what shoulder what sinew what strength you have but now it be only trifling word and nothing more this be the true athlete the man who exercise himself against such appearance stay wretch do not be carry away great be the combat divine be the work it be for kingship for freedom for happiness for freedom from perturbation remember god call on he as a helper and protector as man at sea call on the dioscurus in a storm for what be a greater storm than that which come from appearance which be violent and drive away the reason for the storm itself what else be it but a appearance for take away the fear of death and suppose as many thunder and lightning as you please and you will know what calm and serenity there be in the ruling faculty but if you have once be defeat and say that you will conquer hereafter and then say the same again be assure that you will at last be in so wretched a condition and so weak that you will not even know afterwards that you be do wrong but you will even begin to make apology -lrb- defence -rrb- for you wrong-doing and then you will confirm the say of hesiod to be true with constant ill the dilatory strive \* \* \* \* \* of inconsistency -- some thing man readily confess and other thing they do not no one then will confess that he be a fool or without understand but quite the contrary you will hear all man say i wish that i have fortune equal to my understanding but man readily confess that they be timid and they say : i be rather timid i confess but as to other respects you will not find I to be foolish a man will not readily confess that he be intemperate and that he be unjust he will not confess at all he will by no means confess that he be envious or a busybody most man will confess that they be compassionate what then be the reason the chief thing -lrb- the ruling thing -rrb- be inconsistency and confusion in the thing which relate to good and evil but different man have different reason and generally what they imagine to be base they do not confess at all but they suppose timidity to be a characteristic of a good disposition and compassion also but silliness to be the absolute characteristic of a slave and they do not at all admit -lrb- confess -rrb- the thing which be offence against society but in the case of most error for this reason chiefly they be induce to confess they because they imagine that there be something involuntary in they as in timidity and compassion and if a man confess that he be in any respect intemperate he allege love -lrb- or passion -rrb- as a excuse for what be involuntary but man do not imagine injustice to be at all involuntary there be also in jealousy as they suppose something involuntary and for this reason they confess to jealousy also live then among such man who be so confuse so ignorant of what they say and of the evil which they have or have not and why they have they or how they shall be relieve of they i think it be worth the trouble for a man to watch constantly -lrb- and to ask -rrb- whether i also be one of they what imagination i have about myself how i conduct myself whether i conduct myself as a prudent man whether i conduct myself as a temperate man whether i ever say this that i have be teach to be prepare for everything that may happen have i the consciousness which a man who know nothing ought to have that i know nothing do i go to my teacher as man go to oracle prepare to obey or do i like a snivel boy go to my school to learn history and understand the book which i do not understand before and if it should happen so to explain they also to other man you have have a fight in the house with a poor slave you have turn the family upside down you have frighten the neighbor and you come to I as if you be a wise man and you take you seat and judge how i have explain some word and how i have babble whatever come into my head you come full of envy and humble because you bring nothing from home and you sit during the discussion thinking of nothing else than how you father be disposed towards you and you brother what be they say about I there now they think that i be improve and be say he will return with all knowledge i wish i could learn everything before i return but much labor be necessary and no one send I anything and the bath at nicopoli be dirty everything be bad at home and bad here \* \* \* \* \* on friendship -- what a man apply himself to earnestly that he naturally love do man then apply themselves earnestly to the thing which be bad by no means well do they apply themselves to thing which in no way concern themselves not to these either it remain then that they employ themselves earnestly only about thing which be good and if they be earnestly employ about thing they love such thing also whoever then understand what be good can also know how to love but he who can not distinguish good from bad and thing which be neither good nor bad from both how can he possess the power of loving to love then be only in the power of the wise for universally be not deceive every animal be attach to nothing so much as to its own interest whatever then appear to it a impediment to this interest whether this be a brother or a father or a child or beloved or lover it hate spurn curse for its nature be to love nothing so much as its own interest : this be father and brother and kinsman and country and god when then the god appear to we to be a impediment to this we abuse they and throw down they statue and burn they temple as alexander order the temple of aesculapius to be burn when he dear friend die for this reason if a man put in the same place he interest sanctity goodness and country and parent and friend all these be secure : but if he put in one place he interest in another he friend and he country and he kinsman and justice itself all these give way be bear down by the weight of interest for where the i and the mine be place to that place of necessity the animal incline if in the flesh there be the ruling power if in the will it be there and if it be in externals it be there if then i be there where my will be then only shall i be a friend such as i ought to be and son and father for this will be my interest to maintain the character of fidelity of modesty of patience of abstinence of active co-operation of observe my relation -lrb- towards all -rrb- but if i put myself in one place and honesty in another then the doctrine of epicurus become strong which assert either that there be no honesty or it be that which opinion hold to be honest -lrb- virtuous -rrb- it be through this ignorance that the athenian and the lacedaemonian quarrel and the theban with both and the great king quarrel with hella and the macedonian with both : and the roman with the geta and still earlier the trojan war happen for these reason alexander be the guest of menelaus and if any man have see they friendly disposition he would not have believe any one who say that they be not friend but there be cast between they -lrb- as between dog -rrb- a bit of meat a handsome woman and about she war arise and now when you see brother to be friend appear to have one mind do not conclude from this anything about they friendship not even if they swear it and say that it be impossible for they to be separate from one another for the ruling principle of a bad man can not be trust it be insecure have no certain rule by which it be direct and be overpower at different time by different appearance but examine not what other man examine if they be bear of the same parent and bring up together and under the same pedagogue but examine this only wherein they place they interest whether in externals or in the will if in externals do not name they friend no more than name they trustworthy or constant or brave or free do not name they even man if you have any judgment for that be not a principle of human nature which make they bite one another and abuse one another and occupy desert place or public place as if they be mountain and in the court of justice display the act of robber nor yet that which make they intemperate and adulterer and corrupter nor that which make they do whatever else man do against one another through this one opinion only that of place themselves and they interest in the thing which be not within the power of they will but if you hear that in truth these man think the good to be only there where will be and where there be a right use of appearance no longer trouble yourself whether they be father or son or brother or have associate a long time and be companion but when you have ascertain this only confidently declare that they be friend as you declare that they be faithful that they be just for where else be friendship than where there be fidelity and modesty where there be a communion of honest thing and of nothing else but you may say such a one treat I with regard so long and do he not love I how do you know slave if he do not regard you in the same way as he wipe he shoe with a sponge or as he take care of he beast how do you know when you have cease to be useful as a vessel he will not throw you away like a broken platter but this woman be my wife and we have live together so long and how long do eriphyle live with amphiaraus and be the mother of child and of many but a necklace come between they : and what be a necklace it be the opinion about such thing that be the bestial principle that be the thing which break asunder the friendship between husband and wife that which do not allow the woman to be a wife nor the mother to be a mother and let every man among you who have seriously resolve either to be a friend himself or to have another for he friend cut out these opinion hate they drive they from he soul and thus first of all he will not reproach himself he will not be at variance with himself he will not change he mind he will not torture himself in the next place to another also who be like himself he will be altogether and completely a friend but he will bear with the man who be unlike himself he will be kind to he gentle ready to pardon on account of he ignorance on account of he be mistake in thing of the greatest importance but he will be harsh to no man be well convinced of plato 's doctrine that every mind be deprive of truth unwillingly if you can not do this yet you can do in all other respects as friend do drink together and lodge together and sail together and you may be bear of the same parent for snake also be : but neither will they be friend nor you so long as you retain these bestial and cursed opinion \* \* \* \* \* on the power of speaking -- every man will read a book with more pleasure or even with more ease if it be write in fairer character therefore every man will also listen more readily to what be speak if it be signify by appropriate and become word we must not say then that there be no faculty of expression : for this affirmation be the characteristic of a impious and also of a timid man of a impious man because he undervalue the gift which come from god just as if he would take away the commodity of the power of vision or hearing or of see have then god give you eye to no purpose and to no purpose have he infuse into they a spirit so strong and of such skilful contrivance as to reach a long way and to fashion the form of thing which be see what messenger be so swift and vigilant and to no purpose have he make the interjacent atmosphere so efficacious and elastic that the vision penetrate through the atmosphere which be in a manner move and to no purpose have he make light without the presence of which there would be no use in any other thing man be neither ungrateful for these gift nor yet forget the thing which be superior to they but indeed for the power of see and hear and indeed for life itself and for the thing which contribute to support it for the fruit which be dry and for wine and oil give thanks to god : but remember that he have give you something else better than all these i mean the power of use they prove they and estimate the value of each for what be that which give information about each of these power what each of they be worth be it each faculty itself do you ever hear the faculty of vision say anything about itself or the faculty of hearing or wheat or barley or a horse or a dog no but they be appoint as minister and slave to serve the faculty which have the power of make use of the appearance of thing and if you inquire what be the value of each thing of whom do you inquire who answer you how then can any other faculty be more powerful than this which use the rest as minister and itself prove each and pronounce about they for which of they know what itself be and what be its own value which of they know when it ought to employ itself and when not what faculty be it which open and close the eye and turn they away from object to which it ought not to apply they and do apply they to other object be it the faculty of vision no but it be the faculty of the will what be that faculty which close and open the ear what be that by which they be curious and inquisitive or on the contrary unmoved by what be say be it the faculty of hear it be no other than the faculty of the will will this faculty then see that it be amidst all the other faculty which be blind and dumb and unable to see anything else except the very act for which they be appoint in order to minister to this -lrb- faculty -rrb- and serve it but this faculty alone see sharp and see what be the value of each of the rest will this faculty declare to we that anything else be the best or that itself be and what else do the eye do when it be open than see but whether we ought to look on the wife of a certain person and in what manner who tell we the faculty of the will and whether we ought to believe what be say or not to believe it and if we do believe whether we ought to be move by it or not who tell we be it not the faculty of the will but if you ask I what then be the most excellent of all thing what must i say i can not say the power of speaking but the power of the will when it be right -lrb- -lrb- greek : ortha -rrb- -rrb- for it be this which use the other -lrb- the power of speaking -rrb- and all the other faculty both small and great for when this faculty of the will be set right a man who be not good become good : but when it fail a man become bad it be through this that we be unfortunate that we be fortunate that we blame one another be pleased with one another in a word it be this which if we neglect it make unhappiness and if we carefully look after it make happiness what then be usually do man generally act as a traveller would do on he way to he own country when he enter a good inn and be please with it should remain there man you have forget you purpose : you be not travel to this inn but you be pass through it but this be a pleasant inn and how many other inn be pleasant and how many meadow be pleasant yet only for pass through but you purpose be this to return to you country to relieve you kinsman of anxiety to discharge the duty of a citizen to marry to beget child to fill the usual magistracy for you be not come to select more pleasant place but to live in these where you be bear and of which you be make a citizen something of the kind take place in the matter which we be consider since by the aid of speech and such communication as you receive here you must advance to perfection and purge you will and correct the faculty which make use of the appearance of thing and since it be necessary also for the teaching -lrb- delivery -rrb- of theorem to be effect by a certain mode of expression and with a certain variety and sharpness some person captivate by these very thing abide in they one captivate by the expression another by syllogism another again by sophism and still another by some other inn -lrb- -lrb- greek : paudocheiou -rrb- -rrb- of the kind and there they stay and waste away as they be among siren man you purpose -lrb- business -rrb- be to make yourself capable of use conformably to nature the appearance present to you in you desire not to be frustrate in you aversion from thing not to fall into that which you would avoid never to have no luck -lrb- as one may say -rrb- nor ever to have bad luck to be free not hinder not compel conform yourself to the administration of zeus obey it well satisfied with this blame no one charge no one with fault able from you whole soul to utter these verse : lead I o zeus and thou too destiny \* \* \* \* \* to -lrb- or against -rrb- a person who be one of those who be not value -lrb- esteem -rrb- by he -- a certain person say to he -lrb- epictetus -rrb- : frequently i desire to hear you and come to you and you never give I any answer and now if it be possible i entreat you to say something to I do you think say epictetus that as there be a art in anything else so there be also a art in speaking and that he who have the art will speak skilfully and he who have not will speak unskilfully -- i do think so -- he then who by speak receive benefit himself and be able to benefit other will speak skilfully but he who be rather damage by speak and do damage to other will he be unskilled in this art of speaking and you may find that some be damaged and other benefit by speak and be all who hear benefit by what they hear or will you find that among they also some be benefit and some damage there be both among these also he say in this case also then those who hear skilfully be benefit and those who hear unskilfully be damage he admit this be there then a skill in hearing also as there be in speak it seem so if you choose consider the matter in this way also the practice of music to whom do it belong to a musician and the proper making of a statue to whom do you think that it belong to a statuary and the look at a statue skilfully do this appear to you to require the aid of no art this also require the aid of art then if speak properly be the business of the skilful man do you see that to hear also with benefit be the business of the skilful man now as to speak and hear perfectly and usefully let we for the present if you please say no more for both of we be a long way from everything of the kind but i think that every man will allow this that he who be go to hear philosopher require some amount of practice in hearing be it not so why then do you say nothing to I i can only say this to you that he who know not who he be and for what purpose he exist and what be this world and with whom he be associate and what thing be the good and the bad and the beautiful and the ugly and who neither understand discourse nor demonstration nor what be true nor what be false and who be not able to distinguish they will neither desire accord to nature nor turn away nor move towards nor intend -lrb- to act -rrb- nor assent nor dissent nor suspend he judgment : to say all in a few word he will go about dumb and blind thinking that he be somebody but be nobody be this so now for the first time be it not the fact that ever since the human race exist all error and misfortune have arise through this ignorance this be all that i have to say to you and i say even this not willingly why because you have not rouse I for what must i look to in order to be rouse as man who be expert in ride be rouse by generous horse must i look to you body you treat it disgracefully to you dress that be luxurious to you behavior to you look that be the same as nothing when you would listen to a philosopher do not say to he you tell I nothing but only show yourself worthy of hearing or fit for hearing and you will see how you will move the speaker \* \* \* \* \* that logic be necessary -- when one of those who be present say persuade I that logic be necessary he reply do you wish I to prove this to you the answer be yes then i must use a demonstrative form of speech this be grant how then will you know if i be cheating you by my argument the man be silent do you see say epictetus that you yourself be admit that logic be necessary if without it you can not know so much as this whether logic be necessary or not necessary \* \* \* \* \* of finery in dress -- a certain young man a rhetorician come to see epictetus with he hair dress more carefully than be usual and he attire in a ornamental style whereupon epictetus say tell I if you do not think that some dog be beautiful and some horse and so of all other animal i do think so the youth reply be not then some man also beautiful and other ugly certainly do we then for the same reason call each of they in the same kind beautiful or each beautiful for something peculiar and you will judge of this matter thus since we see a dog naturally form for one thing and a horse for another and for another still as a example a nightingale we may generally and not improperly declare each of they to be beautiful then when it be most excellent accord to its nature but since the nature of each be different each of they seem to I to be beautiful in a different way be it not so he admit that it be that then which make a dog beautiful make a horse ugly and that which make a horse beautiful make a dog ugly if it be true that they nature be different it seem to be so for i think that what make a pancratiast beautiful make a wrestler to be not good and a runner to be most ridiculous and he who be beautiful for the pentathlon be very ugly for wrestle it be so say he what then make a man beautiful be it that which in its kind make both a dog and a horse beautiful it be he say what then make a dog beautiful the possession of the excellence of a dog and what make a horse beautiful the possession of the excellence of a horse what then make a man beautiful be it not the possession of the excellence of a man and do you then if you wish to be beautiful young man labor at this the acquisition of human excellence but what be this observe whom you yourself praise when you praise many person without partiality : do you praise the just or the unjust the just whether do you praise the moderate or the immoderate the moderate and the temperate or the intemperate the temperate if then you make yourself such a person you will know that you will make yourself beautiful but so long as you neglect these thing you must be ugly -lrb- -lrb- greek : aischron -rrb- -rrb- even though you contrive all you can to appear beautiful \* \* \* \* \* in what a man ought to be exercise who have make proficiency and that we neglect the chief thing -- there be three thing -lrb- topic -lrb- greek : topous -rrb- -rrb- in which a man ought to exercise himself who would be wise and good the first concern the desire and the aversion that a man may not fail to get what he desire and that he may not fall into that which he do not desire the second concern the movement towards a object and the movement from a object and generally in do what a man ought to do that he may act accord to order to reason and not carelessly the third thing concern freedom from deception and rashness in judgment and generally it concern the assent -lrb- -lrb- greek : sugchatathesei -rrb- -rrb- of these topic the chief and the most urgent be that which relate to the affect -lrb- -lrb- greek : ta patha -rrb- perturbation -rrb- for a affect be produce in no other way than by a fail to obtain that which a man desire or fall into that which a man would wish to avoid this be that which bring in perturbation disorder bad fortune misfortune sorrow lamentation and envy that which make man envious and jealous and by these cause we be unable even to listen to the precept of reason the second topic concern the duty of a man for i ought not to be free from affect -lrb- -lrb- greek : apatha -rrb- -rrb- like a statue but i ought to maintain the relation -lrb- -lrb- greek : schesei -rrb- -rrb- natural and acquire as a pious man as a son as a father as a citizen the third topic be that which immediately concern those who be make proficiency that which concern the security of the other two so that not even in sleep any appearance unexamined may surprise we nor in intoxication nor in melancholy this it may be say be above we power but the present philosopher neglect the first topic and the second -lrb- the affect and duty -rrb- employ themselves on the third use sophistical argument -lrb- -lrb- greek : metapiptonta -rrb- -rrb- make conclusion from question employ hypothesis lie for a man must it be say when employ on these matter take care that he be not deceive who must the wise and good man this then be all that be want to you have you successfully work out the rest be you free from deception in the matter of money if you see a beautiful girl do you resist the appearance if you neighbor obtain a estate by will be you not vex now be there nothing else want to you except unchangeable firmness of mind -lrb- -lrb- greek : ametaptosium -rrb- -rrb- wretch you hear these very thing with fear and anxiety that some person may despise you and with inquiry about what any person may say about you and if a man come and tell you that in a certain conversation in which the question be who be the best philosopher a man who be present say that a certain person be the chief philosopher you little soul which be only a finger 's length stretch out to two cubit but if another who be present say you be mistaken it be not worth while to listen to a certain person for what do he know he have only the first principle and no more then you be confound you grow pale you cry out immediately i will show he who i be that i be a great philosopher it be see by these very thing : why do you wish to show it by other do you not know that diogene point out one of the sophist in this way by stretch out he middle finger and then when the man be wild with rage this he say be the certain person : i have point he out to you for a man be not show by the finger as a stone or a piece of wood but when any person show the man 's principle then he show he as a man let we look at you principle also for be it not plain that you value not at all you own will -lrb- -lrb- greek : proairesis -rrb- -rrb- but you look externally to thing which be independent of you will for instance what will a certain person say and what will people think of you will you be consider a man of learn have you read chrysippus or antipater for if you have read archedamus also you have every thing -lrb- that you can desire -rrb- why you be still uneasy lest you should not show we who you be would you let I tell you what manner of man you have show we that you be you have exhibit yourself to we as a mean fellow querulous passionate cowardly finding fault with everything blame everybody never quiet vain : this be what you have exhibit to we go away now and read archedamus then if a mouse should leap down and make a noise you be a dead man for such a death await you as it do -- what be the man 's name -- crini and he too be proud because he understand archedamus wretch will you not dismiss these thing that do not concern you at all these thing be suitable to those who be able to learn they without perturbation to those who can say : i be not subject to anger to grief to envy : i be not hinder i be not restrain what remain for I i have leisure i be tranquil : let we see how we must deal with sophistical argument let we see how when a man have accept a hypothesis he shall not be lead away to any thing absurd to they such thing belong to those who be happy it be appropriate to light a fire to dine if they choose both to sing and to dance but when the vessel be sink you come to I and hoist the sail \* \* \* \* \* what be the matter on which a good man should be employ and in what we ought chiefly to practice ourselves -- the material for the wise and good man be he own ruling faculty : and the body be the material for the physician and the alipte -lrb- the man who oils person -rrb- the land be the matter for the husbandman the business of the wise and good man be to use appearance conformably to nature : and as it be the nature of every soul to assent to the truth to dissent from the false and to remain in suspense as to that which be uncertain so it be its nature to be move towards the desire for the good and to aversion from the evil and with respect to that which be neither good nor bad it feel indifferent for as the money-changer -lrb- banker -rrb- be not allow to reject cæsar 's coin nor the seller of herb but if you show the coin whether he choose or not he must give up what be sell for the coin so it be also in the matter of the soul when the good appear it immediately attract to itself the evil repel from itself but the soul will never reject the manifest appearance of the good any more than person will reject cæsar 's coin on this principle depend every movement both of man and god against -lrb- or with respect to -rrb- this kind of thing chiefly a man should exercise himself as soon as you go out in the morning examine every man whom you see every man whom you hear answer as to a question what have you see a handsome man or woman apply the rule be this independent of the will or dependent independent take it away what have you see a man lament over the death of a child apply the rule death be a thing independent of the will take it away have the proconsul meet you apply the rule what kind of a thing be a proconsul 's office independent of the will or dependent on it independent take this away also it do not stand examination cast it away it be nothing to you if we practice this and exercise ourselves in it daily from morning to night something indeed would be do but now we be forthwith catch half asleep by every appearance and it be only if ever that in the school we be rouse a little then when we go out if we see a man lament we say he be undo if we see a consul we say he be happy if we see a exile man we say he be miserable if we see a poor man we say he be wretched he have nothing to eat we ought then to eradicate these bad opinion and to this end we should direct all we effort for what be weep and lament opinion what be bad fortune opinion what be civil sedition what be divide opinion what be blame what be accusation what be impiety what be trifle all these thing be opinion and nothing more and opinion about thing independent of the will as if they be good and bad let a man transfer these opinion to thing dependent on the will and i engage for he that he will be firm and constant whatever may be the state of thing around he such as be a dish of water such be the soul such as be the ray of light which fall on the water such be the appearance when the water be move the ray also seem to be move yet it be not move and when then a man be seize with giddiness it be not the art and the virtue which be confound but the spirit -lrb- the nervous power -rrb- on which they be impressed but if the spirit be restore to its settled state those thing also be restore \* \* \* \* \* miscellaneous -- when some person ask he how it happen that since reason have be more cultivate by the man of the present age the progress make in former time be greater in what respect he answer have it be more cultivate now and in what respect be the progress greater then for in that in which it have now be more cultivate in that also the progress will now be find at present it have be cultivate for the purpose of resolve syllogism and progress be make but in former time it be cultivate for the purpose of maintain the govern faculty in a condition conformable to nature and progress be make do not then mix thing which be different and do not expect when you be labor at one thing to make progress in another but see if any man among we when he be intent upon this the keep himself in a state conformable to nature and live so always do not make progress for you will not find such a man it be not easy to exhort weak young man for neither be it easy to hold -lrb- soft -rrb- cheese with a hook but those who have a good natural disposition even if you try to turn they aside cling still more to reason \* \* \* \* \* to the administrator of the free city who be a epicurean -- when the administrator come to visit he and the man be a epicurean epictetus say it be proper for we who be not philosopher to inquire of you who be philosopher as those who come to a strange city inquire of the citizen and those who be acquaint with it what be the best thing in the world in order that we also after inquiry may go in quest of that which be best and look at it as stranger do with the thing in city for that there be three thing which relate to man -- soul body and thing external scarcely any man deny it remain for you philosopher to answer what be the best what shall we say to man be the flesh the best and be it for this that maximus sail as far as cassiope in winter -lrb- or bad weather -rrb- with he son and accompany he that he might be gratify in the flesh when the man say that it be not and add far be that from he be it not fit then epictetus say to be actively employ about the best it be certainly of all thing the most fit what then do we possess which be better than the flesh the soul he reply and the good thing of the best be they better or the good thing of the worse the good thing of the best and be the good thing of the best within the power of the will or not within the power of the will they be within the power of the will be then the pleasure of the soul a thing within the power of the will it be he reply and on what shall this pleasure depend on itself but that can not be conceive for there must first exist a certain substance or nature -lrb- -lrb- greek : ousium -rrb- -rrb- of good by obtain which we shall have pleasure in the soul he assent to this also on what then shall we depend for this pleasure of the soul for if it shall depend on thing of the soul the substance -lrb- nature -rrb- of the good be discover for good can not be one thing and that at which we be rationally delighted another thing nor if that which precede be not good can that which come after be good for in order that the thing which come after may be good that which precede must be good but you would not affirm this if you be in you right mind for you would then say what be inconsistent both with epicurus and the rest of you doctrine it remain then that the pleasure of the soul be in the pleasure from thing of the body and again that those bodily thing must be the thing which precede and the substance -lrb- nature -rrb- of the good seek for doctrine which be consistent with what i say and by make they you guide you will with pleasure abstain from thing which have such persuasive power to lead we and overpower we but if to the persuasive power of these thing we also devise such a philosophy as this which help to push we on towards they and strengthen we to this end what will be the consequence in a piece of toreutic art which be the best part the silver or the workmanship the substance of the hand be the flesh but the work of the hand be the principal part -lrb- that which precede and lead the rest -rrb- the duty then be also three : those which be direct towards the existence of a thing those which be direct towards its existence in a particular kind and third the chief or lead thing themselves so also in man we ought not to value the material the poor flesh but the principal -lrb- lead thing -lrb- greek : ta proaegoumena -rrb- -rrb- what be these engage in public business marry beget child venerate god take care of parent and generally have desire aversion -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlinein -rrb- -rrb- pursuit of thing and avoidance in the way in which we ought to do these thing and accord to we nature and how be we constitute by nature free noble modest for what other animal blush what other be capable of receive the appearance -lrb- the impression -rrb- of shame and we be so constitute by nature as to subject pleasure to these thing as a minister a servant in order that it may call forth we activity in order that it may keep we constant in act which be conformable to nature \* \* \* \* \* how we must exercise ourselves against appearance -lrb- -lrb- greek : phantasia -rrb- -rrb- -- as we exercise ourselves against sophistical question so we ought to exercise ourselves daily against appearance for these appearance also propose question to we a certain person 's son be dead answer the thing be not within the power of the will : it be not a evil a father have disinherit a certain son what do you think of it it be a thing beyond the power of the will not a evil cæsar have condemn a person it be a thing beyond the power of the will not a evil the man be afflict at this affliction be a thing which depend on the will : it be a evil he have bear the condemnation bravely that be a thing within the power of the will : it be a good if we train ourselves in this manner we shall make progress for we shall never assent to anything of which there be not a appearance capable of be comprehend you son be dead what have happen you son be dead nothing more nothing you ship be lose what have happen you ship be lose a man have be lead to prison what have happen he have be lead to prison but that herein he have fare badly every man add from he own opinion but zeus you say do not do right in these matter why because he have make you capable of endurance because he have make you magnanimous because he have take from that which befall you the power of be evil because it be in you power to be happy while you be suffer what you suffer because he have open the door to you when thing do not please you man go out and do not complain hear how the roman feel towards philosopher if you would like to know italicus who be the most in repute of the philosopher once when i be present be vex with he own friend and as if he be suffer something intolerable say : i can not bear it you be kill I you will make I such as that man be point to I \* \* \* \* \* to a certain rhetorician who be go up to rome on a suit -- when a certain person come to he who be go up to rome on account of a suit which have regard to he rank epictetus inquire the reason of he go to rome and the man then ask what he think about the matter epictetus reply : if you ask I what you will do in rome whether you will succeed or fail i have no rule -lrb- -lrb- greek : theoraema -rrb- -rrb- about this but if you ask I how you will fare i can tell you : if you have right opinion -lrb- -lrb- greek : dogma -rrb- -rrb- you will fare well if they be false you will fare ill for to every man the cause of he act be opinion for what be the reason why you desire to be elect governor of the cnossian you opinion what be the reason that you be now go up to rome you opinion and go in winter and with danger and expense i must go what tell you this you opinion then if opinion be the cause of all action and a man have bad opinion such as the cause may be such also be the effect have we then all sound opinion both you and you adversary and how do you differ but have you sounder opinion than you adversary why you think so and so do he think that he opinion be better and so do madmen this be a bad criterion but show to I that you have make some inquiry into you opinion and have take some pain about they and as now you be sail to rome in order to become governor of the cnossian and you be not content to stay at home with the honor which you have but you desire something greater and more conspicuous so when do you ever make a voyage for the purpose of examine you own opinion and cast they out if you have any that be bad whom have you approach for this purpose what time have you fix for it what age go over the time of you life by yourself if you be ashamed of I -lrb- know the fact -rrb- when you be a boy do you examine you own opinion and do you not then as you do all thing now do as you do do and when you be become a youth and attend the rhetorician and yourself practice rhetoric what do you imagine that you be deficient in and when you be a young man and engage in public matter and plead cause yourself and be gain reputation who then seem you equal and when would you have submit to any man examine and show that you opinion be bad what then do you wish I to say to you help I in this matter i have no theorem -lrb- rule -rrb- for this nor have you if you come to I for this purpose come to I as a philosopher but as to a seller of vegetable or a shoemaker for what purpose then have philosopher theorem for this purpose that whatever may happen we ruling faculty may be and continue to be conformable to nature do this seem to you a small thing no but the greatest what then do it need only a short time and be it possible to seize it as you pass by if you can seize it then you will say i meet with epictetus as i should meet with a stone or a statue : for you see I and nothing more but he meet with a man as a man who learn he opinion and in he turn show he own learn my opinion : show I yours and then say that you have visit I let we examine one another : if i have any bad opinion take it away if you have any show it this be the meaning of meeting with a philosopher not so -lrb- you say -rrb- : but this be only a pass visit and while we be hire the vessel we can also see epictetus let we see what he say then you go away and say : epictetus be nothing he use solecism and speak in a barbarous way for of what else do you come as judge well but a man may say to I if i attend to such matter -lrb- as you do -rrb- i shall have no land as you have none i shall have no silver cup as you have none nor fine beast as you have none in answer to tin it be perhaps sufficient to say : i have no need of such thing but if you possess many thing you have need of other : whether you choose or not you be poorer than i be what then have i need of of that which you have not of firmness of a mind which be conformable to nature of be free from perturbation \* \* \* \* \* in what manner we ought to bear sickness -- when the need of each opinion come we ought to have it in readiness : on the occasion of breakfast such opinion as relate to breakfast in the bath those that concern the bath in bed those that concern bed let sleep not come upon thy languid eye before each daily action thou hast scann would what be do amiss what do what leave undo from first to last examine all and then blame what be wrong in what be right rejoice and we ought to retain these verse in such way that we may use they not that we may utter they aloud as when we exclaim paean apollo again in fever we should have ready such opinion as concern a fever and we ought not as soon as the fever begin to lose and forget all a man who have a fever may say : if i philosophize any longer may i be hang : wherever i go i must take care of the poor body that a fever may not come but what be philosophize be it not a preparation against event which may happen do you not understand that you be say something of this kind if i shall still prepare myself to bear with patience what happen may i be hang but this be just as if a man after receive blow should give up the pancratium in the pancratium it be in we power to desist and not to receive blow but in the other matter if we give up philosophy what shall we gain what then should a man say on the occasion of each painful thing it be for this that i exercise myself for this i discipline myself god say to you : give I a proof that you have duly practice athletics that you have eat what you ought that you have be exercise that you have obey the alipte -lrb- the oiler and rubber -rrb- then do you show yourself weak when the time for action come now be the time for the fever let it be bear well now be the time for thirst bear it well now be the time for hunger bear it well be it not in you power who shall hinder you the physician will hinder you from drinking but he can not prevent you from bear thirst well : and he will hinder you from eat but he can not prevent you from bear hunger well but i can not attend to my philosophical study and for what purpose do you follow they slave be it not that you may be happy that you may be constant be it not that you may be in a state conformable to nature and live so what hinder you when you have a fever from have you ruling faculty conformable to nature here be the proof of the thing here be the test of the philosopher for this also be a part of life like walk like sailing like journey by land so also be fever do you read when you be walk no nor do you when you have a fever but if you walk about well you have all that belong to a man who walk if you bear a fever well you have all that belong to a man in a fever what be it to bear a fever well not to blame god or man not to be afflict at that which happen to expect death well and nobly to do what must be do : when the physician come in not to be frighten at what he say nor if he say you be do well to be overjoy for what good have he tell you and when you be in health what good be that to you and even if he say you be in a bad way do not despond for what be it to be ill be it that you be near the severance of the soul and the body what harm be there in this if you be not near now will you not afterwards be near be the world go to be turn upside down when you be dead why then do you flatter the physician why do you say if you please master i shall be well why do you give he a opportunity of raise he eyebrow -lrb- be proud or show he importance -rrb- do you not value a physician as you do a shoemaker when he be measure you foot or a carpenter when he be build you house and so treat the physician as to the body which be not yours but by nature dead he who have a fever have a opportunity of do this : if he do these thing he have what belong to he for it be not the business of a philosopher to look after these externals neither he wine nor he oil nor he poor body but he own ruling power but as to externals how must he act so far as not to be careless about they where then be there reason for fear where be there then still reason for anger and of fear about what belong to other about thing which be of no value for we ought to have these two principle in readiness that except the will nothing be good nor bad and that we ought not to lead event but to follow they my brother ought not to have behave thus to I no but he will see to that and however he may behave i will conduct myself towards he as i ought for this be my own business that belong to another : no man can prevent this the other thing can be hinder \* \* \* \* \* about exercise -- we ought not to make we exercise consist in means contrary to nature and adapt to cause admiration for if we do so we who call ourselves philosopher shall not differ at all from juggler for it be difficult even to walk on a rope and not only difficult but it be also dangerous ought we for this reason to practice walk on a rope or set up a palm-tree or embrace statue by no means every thing which be difficult and dangerous be not suitable for practice but that be suitable which conduce to the work out of that which be propose to we and what be that which be propose to we as a thing to be work out to live with desire and aversion -lrb- avoidance of certain thing -rrb- free from restraint and what be this neither to be disappoint in that which you desire nor to fall into anything which you would avoid towards this object then exercise -lrb- practice -rrb- ought to tend for since it be not possible to have you desire not disappointed and you aversion free from fall into that which you would avoid without great and constant practice you must know that if you allow you desire and aversion to turn to thing which be not within the power of the will you will neither have you desire capable of attain you object nor you aversion free from the power of avoid that which you would avoid and since strong habit lead -lrb- prevail -rrb- and we be accustom to employ desire and aversion only to thing which be not within the power of we will we ought to oppose to this habit a contrary habit and where there be great slipperiness in the appearance there to oppose the habit of exercise then at last if occasion present itself for the purpose of try yourself at a proper time you will descend into the arena to know if appearance overpower you as they do formerly but at first fly far from that which be stronger than yourself the contest be unequal between a charming young girl and a beginner in philosophy the earthen pitcher as the say be and the rock do not agree \* \* \* \* \* what solitude be and what kind of person a solitary man be -- solitude be a certain condition of a helpless man for because a man be alone he be not for that reason also solitary just as though a man be among number he be not therefore not solitary when then we have lose either a brother or a son or a friend on whom we be accustom to repose we say that we be leave solitary though we be often in rome though such a crowd meet we though so many live in the same place and sometimes we have a great number of slave for the man who be solitary as it be conceive be consider to be a helpless person and expose to those who wish to harm he for this reason when we travel then especially do we say that we be lonely when we fall among robber for it be not the sight of a human creature which remove we from solitude but the sight of one who be faithful and modest and helpful to we for if be alone be enough to make solitude you may say that even zeus be solitary in the conflagration and bewail himself say unhappy that i be who have neither hera nor athena nor apollo nor brother nor son nor descendant nor kinsman this be what some say that he do when he be alone at the conflagration for they do not understand how a man pass he life when he be alone because they set out from a certain natural principle from the natural desire of community and mutual love and from the pleasure of conversation among man but none the less a man ought to be prepare in a manner for this also -lrb- be alone -rrb- to be able to be sufficient for himself and to be he own companion for as zeus dwell with himself and be tranquil by himself and think of he own administration and of its nature and be employ in thought suitable to himself so ought we also to be able to talk with ourselves not to feel the want of other also not to be unprovided with the means of pass we time to observe the divine administration and the relation of ourselves to everything else to consider how we formerly be affect towards thing that happen and how at present what be still the thing which give we pain how these also can be cure and how remove if any thing require improvement to improve they accord to reason well then if some man should come upon I when i be alone and murder I fool not murder you but you poor body what kind of solitude then remain what want why do we make ourselves worse than child and what do child do when they be leave alone they take up shell and ash and they build something then pull it down and build something else and so they never want the means of pass the time shall i then if you sail away sit down and weep because i have be leave alone and solitary shall i then have no shell no ash but child do what they do through want of thought -lrb- or deficiency in knowledge -rrb- and we through knowledge be unhappy every great power -lrb- faculty -rrb- be dangerous to beginner you must then bear such thing as you be able but conformably to nature : but not practice sometimes a way of live like a person out of health that you may at some time live like a man in health \* \* \* \* \* certain miscellaneous matter -- as bad tragic actor can not sing alone but in company with many so some person can not walk about alone man if you be anything both walk alone and talk to yourself and do not hide yourself in the chorus examine a little at last look around stir yourself up that you may know who you be you must root out of man these two thing arrogance -lrb- pride -rrb- and distrust arrogance then be the opinion that you want nothing -lrb- be deficient in nothing -rrb- but distrust be the opinion that you can not be happy when so many circumstance surround you arrogance be remove by confutation and socrate be the first who practice this and -lrb- to know -rrb- that the thing be not impossible inquire and seek this search will do you no harm and in a manner this be philosophize to seek how it be possible to employ desire and aversion -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlisis -rrb- -rrb- without impediment i be superior to you for my father be a man of consular rank another say i have be a tribune but you have not if we be horse would you say my father be swifter i have much barley and fodder or elegant neck ornament if then you be say this i say be it so : let we run then well be there nothing in a man such as run in a horse by which it will be know which be superior and inferior be there not modesty -lrb- -lrb- greek : aido -rrb- -rrb- fidelity justice show yourself superior in these that you may be superior as a man if you tell I that you can kick violently i also will say to you that you be proud of that which be the act of a ass \* \* \* \* \* that we ought to proceed with circumspection to everything -lrb- footnote : compare encheiridion 29 -rrb- -- in every act consider what precede and what follow and then proceed to the act if you do not consider you will at first begin with spirit since you have not think at all of the thing which follow but afterwards when some consequence have show themselves you will basely desist -lrb- from that which you have begin -rrb- -- i wish to conquer at the olympic game -- -lrb- and i too by the god for it be a fine thing -rrb- but consider here what precede and what follow and then if it be for you good undertake the thing you must act accord to rule follow strict diet abstain from delicacy exercise yourself by compulsion at fixed time in heat in cold drink no cold water nor wine when there be opportunity of drink it in a word you must surrender yourself to the trainer as you do to a physician next in the contest you must be cover with sand sometimes dislocate a hand sprain a ankle swallow a quantity of dust be scourge with the whip and after undergo all this you must sometimes be conquer after reckon all these thing if you have still a inclination go to the athletic practice if you do not reckon they observe you will behave like child who at one time play as wrestler then as gladiator then blow a trumpet then act a tragedy when they have see and admire such thing so you also do : you be at one time a wrestler -lrb- athlete -rrb- then a gladiator then a philosopher then a rhetorician but with you whole soul you be nothing : like the ape you imitate all that you see and always one thing after another please you but that which become familiar displease you for you have never undertake anything after consideration nor after have explore the whole matter and put it to a strict examination but you have undertake it at hazard and with a cold desire thus some person have see a philosopher and have hear one speak like euphrate -- and yet who can speak like he -- wish to be philosopher themselves man consider first what the matter be -lrb- which you propose to do -rrb- then you own nature also what it be able to bear if you be a wrestler look at you shoulder you thigh you loin : for different man be naturally form for different thing do you think that if you do -lrb- what you be do daily -rrb- you can be a philosopher do you think that you can eat as you do now drink as you do now and in the same way be angry and out of humor you must watch labor conquer certain desire you must depart from you kinsman be despise by you slave laugh at by those who meet you in everything you must be in a inferior condition as to magisterial office in honor in court of justice when you have consider all these thing completely then if you think proper approach to philosophy if you would gain in exchange for these thing freedom from perturbation liberty tranquillity if you have not consider these thing do not approach philosophy : do not act like child at one time a philosopher then a tax collector then a rhetorician then a procurator -lrb- officer -rrb- of cæsar these thing be not consistent you must be one man either good or bad you must either labor at you own ruling faculty or at external thing you must either labor at thing within or at external thing that be you must either occupy the place of a philosopher or that of one of the vulgar a person say to rufus when galba be murder : be the world now govern by providence but rufus reply : do i ever incidentally form a argument from galba that the world be govern by providence \* \* \* \* \* that we ought with caution to enter into familiar intercourse with man -- if a man have frequent intercourse with other either for talk or drinking together or generally for social purpose he must either become like they or change they to he own fashion for if a man place a piece of quench charcoal close to a piece that be burn either the quench charcoal will quench the other or the burning charcoal will light that which be quench since then the danger be so great we must cautiously enter into such intimacy with those of the common sort and remember that it be impossible that a man can keep company with one who be cover with soot without be partaker of the soot himself for what will you do if a man speak about gladiator about horse about athlete or what be worse about man such a person be bad such a person be good this be well do this be do badly further if he scoff or ridicule or show a ill-natured disposition be any man among we prepare like a lute-player when he take a lute so that as soon as he have touch the string he discover which be discordant and tune the instrument such a power as socrate have who in all he social intercourse could lead he companion to he own purpose how should you have this power it be therefore a necessary consequence that you be carry about by the common kind of people why then be they more powerful than you because they utter these useless word from they real opinion but you utter you elegant word only from you lip for this reason they be without strength and dead and it be nauseous to listen to you exhortation and you miserable virtue which be talk of everywhere -lrb- up and down -rrb- in this way the vulgar have the advantage over you for every opinion -lrb- -lrb- greek : dogma -rrb- -rrb- be strong and invincible until then the good -lrb- -lrb- greek : chompsaus -rrb- -rrb- sentiment -lrb- -lrb- greek : hupolaepsei -rrb- -rrb- be fix in you and you shall have acquire a certain power for you security i advise you to be careful in you association with common person if you be not every day like wax in the sun there will be melt away whatever you inscribe on you mind in the school withdraw then yourselve far from the sun so long as you have these waxen sentiment for this reason also philosopher advise man to leave they native country because ancient habit distract they and do not allow a begin to be make of a different habit nor can we tolerate those who meet we and say : see such a one be now a philosopher who be once so and so thus also physician send those who have linger disease to a different country and a different air and they do right do you also introduce other habit than those which you have fix you opinion and exercise yourselve in they but you do not so you go hence to a spectacle to a show of gladiator to a place of exercise -lrb- -lrb- greek : chuston -rrb- -rrb- to a circus then you come back hither and again from this place you go to those place and still the same person and there be no pleasing -lrb- good -rrb- habit nor attention nor care about self and observation of this kind how shall i use the appearance present to I accord to nature or contrary to nature how do i answer to they as i ought or as i ought not do i say to those thing which be independent of the will that they do not concern I for if you be not yet in this state fly from you former habit fly from the common sort if you intend ever to begin to be something \* \* \* \* \* on providence-when you make any charge against providence consider and you will learn that the thing have happen accord to reason yes but the unjust man have the advantage in what in money yes for he be superior to you in this that he flatter be free from shame and be watchful what be the wonder but see if he have the advantage over you in be faithful in be modest for you will not find it to be so but wherein you be superior there you will find that you have the advantage and i once say to a man who be vex because philostorgus be fortunate : would you choose to lie with sura may it never happen he reply that this day should come why then be you vex if he receive something in return for that which he sell or how can you consider he happy who acquire those thing by such means as you abominate or what wrong do providence if he give the better thing to the better man be it not better to be modest than to be rich he admit this why be you vex then man when you possess the better thing remember then always and have in readiness the truth that this be a law of nature that the superior have a advantage over the inferior in that in which he be superior and you will never be vex but my wife treat I badly well if any man ask you what this be say my wife treat I badly be there then nothing more nothing my father give I nothing -lrb- what be this my father give I nothing be there nothing else then nothing -rrb- but to say that this be a evil be something which must be add to it externally and falsely add for this reason we must not get rid of poverty but of the opinion about poverty and then we shall be happy \* \* \* \* \* about cynicism -- when one of he pupil inquire of epictetus and he be a person who appear to be incline to cynicism what kind of person a cynic ought to be and what be the notion -lrb- -lrb- greek : prolaepsis -rrb- -rrb- of the thing we will inquire say epictetus at leisure but i have so much to say to you that he who without god attempt so great a matter be hateful to god and have no other purpose than to act indecently in public in the first place in the thing which relate to yourself you must not be in any respect like what you do now you must not blame god or man you must take away desire altogether you must transfer avoidance -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlisis -rrb- -rrb- only to the thing which be within the power of the will you must not feel anger nor resentment or envy nor pity a girl must not appear handsome to you nor must you love a little reputation nor be please with a boy or a cake for you ought to know that the rest of man throw wall around they and house and darkness when they do any such thing and they have many means of concealment a man shut the door he set somebody before the chamber if a person come say that he be out he be not at leisure but the cynic instead of all these thing must use modesty as he protection if he do not he will be indecent in he nakedness and under the open sky this be he house he door this be the slave before he bedchamber this be he darkness for he ought not to wish to hide anything that he do and if he do he be go he have lose the character of a cynic of a man who live under the open sky of a free man he have begin to fear some external thing he have begin to have need of concealment nor can he get concealment when he choose for where shall he hide himself and how and if by chance this public instructor shall be detect this pædagogue what kind of thing will he be compel to suffer when then a man fear these thing be it possible for he to be bold with he whole soul to superintend man it can not be : it be impossible in the first place then you must make you ruling faculty pure and this mode of life also now -lrb- you should say -rrb- to I the matter to work on be my understanding as wood be to the carpenter as hide to the shoemaker and my business be the right use of appearance but the body be nothing to I : the part of it be nothing to I death let it come when it choose either death of the whole or of a part fly you say and whither can any man eject I out of the world he can not but wherever i go there be the sun there be the moon there be the star dream omen and the conversation -lrb- -lrb- greek : omilium -rrb- -rrb- with god then if he be thus prepare the true cynic can not be satisfy with this but he must know that he be send a messenger from zeus to man about good and bad thing to show they that they have wander and be seek the substance of good and evil where it be not but where it be they never think and that he be a spy as diogene be carry off to philip after the battle of chaeroneium as a spy for in fact a cynic be a spy of the thing which be good for man and which be evil and it be he duty to examine carefully and to come and report truly and not to be strike with terror so as to point out as enemy those who be not enemy nor in any other way to be perturb by appearance nor confound it be he duty then to be able with a loud voice if the occasion should arise and appear on the tragic stage to say like socrate : man whither be you hurry what be you do wretch like blind people you be wander up and down you be go by another road and have leave the true road you seek for prosperity and happiness where they be not and if another show you where they be you do not believe he why do you seek it without in the body it be not there if you doubt look at myro look at ophellius in possession it be not there but if you do not believe I look at croesus : look at those who be now rich with what lamentation they life be fill in power it be not there if it be those must be happy who have be twice and thrice consul but they be not whom shall we believe in these matter you who from without see they affair and be dazzle by a appearance or the man themselves what do they say hear they when they groan when they grieve when on account of these very consulships and glory and splendor they think that they be more wretched and in greater danger be it in royal power it be not : if it be nero would have be happy and sardanapalus but neither be agamemnon happy though he be a better man than sardanapalus and nero but while other be snore what be he do much from he head he tear he rooted hair : iliad x 15 and what do he say himself i be perplexed he say and disturb would i be and my heart out of my bosom be leap iliad x 91 wretch which of you affair go badly you possession no you body no but you be rich in gold and copper what then be the matter with you that part of you whatever it be have be neglect by you and be corrupt the part with which we desire with which we avoid with which we move towards and move from thing how neglect he know not the nature of good for which he be make by nature and the nature of evil and what be he own and what belong to another and when anything that belong to other go badly he say woe to I for the hellene be in danger wretched be he ruling faculty and alone neglect and uncared for the hellene be go to die destroy by the trojan and if the trojan do not kill they will they not die yes but not all at once what difference then do it make for if death be a evil whether man die altogether or if they die singly it be equally a evil be anything else then go to happen than the separation of the soul and the body nothing and if the hellene perish be the door close and be it not in you power to die it be why then do you lament -lrb- and say -rrb- oh you be a king and have the sceptre of zeus a unhappy king do not exist more than a unhappy god what then art thou in truth a shepherd : for you weep as shepherd do when a wolf have carry off one of they sheep : and these who be govern by you be sheep and why do you come hither be you desire in any danger be you aversion -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlisis -rrb- -rrb- be you movement -lrb- pursuit -rrb- be you avoidance of thing he reply no but the wife of my brother be carry off be it not then a great gain to be deprive of a adulterous wife shall we be despise then by the trojan what kind of people be the trojan wise or foolish if they be wise why do you fight with they if they be fool why do you care about they do you possess the body then free or be it in servile condition we do not know do you not know that it be the slave of fever of gout ophthalmia dysentery of a tyrant of fire of iron of everything which be stronger yes it be a slave how then be it possible that anything which belong to the body can be free from hindrance and how be a thing great or valuable which be naturally dead or earth or mud well then do you possess nothing which be free perhaps nothing and who be able to compel you to assent to that which appear false no man and who can compel you not to assent to that which appear true no man by this then you see that there be something in you naturally free but to desire or to be averse from or to move towards a object or to move from it or to prepare yourself or to propose to do anything which of you can do this unless he have receive a impression of the appearance of that which be profitable or a duty no man you have then in these thing also something which be not hinder and be free wretched man work out this take care of this seek for good here \* \* \* \* \* that we ought not to be move by a desire of those thing which be not in we power -- let not that which in another be contrary to nature be a evil to you for you be not form by nature to be depress with other nor to be unhappy with other but to be happy with they if a man be unhappy remember that he unhappiness be he own fault for god have make all man to be happy to be free from perturbation for this purpose he have give means to they some thing to each person as he own and other thing not as he own some thing subject to hindrance and compulsion and deprivation and these thing be not a man 's own but the thing which be not subject to hindrance be he own and the nature of good and evil as it be fit to be do by he who take care of we and protect we like a father he have make we own but you say i have part from a certain person and he be grieve why do he consider as he own that which belong to another why when he look on you and be rejoice do he not also reckon that you be a mortal that it be natural for you to part from he for a foreign country therefore he suffer the consequence of he own folly but why do you or for what purpose bewail yourself be it that you also have not think of these thing but like poor woman who be good for nothing you have enjoy all thing in which you take pleasure as if you would always enjoy they both place and man and conversation and now you sit and weep because you do not see the same person and do not live in the same place indeed you deserve this to be more wretched than crow and raven who have the power of fly where they please and change they nest for other and cross the sea without lament or regret they former condition yes but this happen to they because they be irrational creature be reason then give to we by the god for the purpose of unhappiness and misery that we may pass we life in wretchedness and lamentation must all person be immortal and must no man go abroad and must we ourselves not go abroad but remain root like plant and if any of we familiar friend go abroad must we sit and weep and on the contrary when he return must we dance and clap we hand like child but my mother lament when she do not see I why have she not learn these principle and i do not say this that we should not take care that she may not lament but i say that we ought not to desire in every way what be not we own and the sorrow of another be another 's sorrow but my sorrow be my own i then will stop my own sorrow by every means for it be in my power and the sorrow of another i will endeavor to stop as far as i can but i will not attempt to do it by every means for if i do i shall be fight against god i shall be oppose zeus and shall be place myself against he in the administration of the universe and the reward -lrb- the punishment -rrb- of this fight against god and of this disobedience not only will the child of my child pay but i also shall myself both by day and by night startle by dream perturb tremble at every piece of news and have my tranquillity depend on the letter of other some person have arrive from rome i only hope there be no harm but what harm can happen to you where you be not from hella -lrb- greece -rrb- some one be come i hope that there be no harm in this way every place may be the cause of misfortune to you be it not enough for you to be unfortunate there where you be and must you be so even beyond sea and by the report of letter be this the way in which you affair be in a state of security well then suppose that my friend have die in the place which be far from I what else have they suffer than that which be the condition of mortal or how be you desirous at the same time to live to old age and at the same time not to see the death of any person whom you love know you not that in the course of a long time many and various kind of thing must happen that a fever shall overpower one a robber another and a third a tyrant such be the condition of thing around we such be those who live with we in the world cold and heat and unsuitable way of living and journey by land and voyage by sea and wind and various circumstance which surround we destroy one man and banish another and throw one upon a embassy and another into a army sit down then in a flutter at all these thing lament unhappy unfortunate dependent on another and dependent not on one or two but on ten thousand upon ten thousand do you hear this when you be with the philosopher do you learn this do you not know that human life be a warfare that one man must keep watch another must go out as a spy and a third must fight and it be not possible that all should be in one place nor be it better that it should be so but you neglect to do the command of the general complain when anything more hard than usual be impose on you and you do not observe what you make the army become as far as it be in you power that if all imitate you no man will dig a trench no man will put a rampart round nor keep watch nor expose himself to danger but will appear to be useless for the purpose of a army again in a vessel if you go as a sailor keep to one place and stick to it and if you be order to climb the mast refuse if to run to the head of the ship refuse and what master of a ship will endure you and will he not pitch you overboard as a useless thing a impediment only and bad example to the other sailor and so it be here also : every man 's life be a kind of warfare and it be long and diversified you must observe the duty of a soldier and do every thing at the nod of the general if it be possible divine what he wish be for there be no resemblance between that general and this neither in strength nor in superiority of character know you not that a good man do nothing for the sake of appearance but for the sake of do right what advantage be it then to he to have do right and what advantage be it to a man who write the name of dion to write it as he ought the advantage be to have write it be there no reward then do you seek a reward for a good man greater than do what be good and just at olympium you wish for nothing more but it seem to you enough to be crown at the game do it seem to you so small and worthless a thing to be good and happy for these purpose be introduce by the god into this city -lrb- the world -rrb- and it be now you duty to undertake the work of a man do you still want nurse also and a mamma and do foolish woman by they weep move you and make you effeminate will you thus never cease to be a foolish child know you not that he who do the act of a child the older he be the more ridiculous he be so in this matter also : if you kiss you own child or you brother or friend never give full license to the appearance -lrb- -lrb- greek : phantasian -rrb- -rrb- and allow not you pleasure to go as far as it choose but check it and curb it as those who stand behind man in they triumph and remind they that they be mortal do you also remind yourself in like manner that he whom you love be mortal and that what you love be nothing of you own it have be give to you for the present not that it should not be take from you nor have it be give to you for all time but as a fig be give to you or a bunch of grape at the appoint season of the year but if you wish for these thing in winter you be a fool so if you wish for you son or friend when it be not allow to you you must know that you be wish for a fig in winter for such as winter be to a fig such be every event which happen from the universe to the thing which be take away accord to its nature and further at the time when you be delighted with a thing place before yourself the contrary appearance what harm be it while you be kiss you child to say with a lisping voice : to-morrow you will die and to a friend also : to-morrow you will go away or i shall and never shall we see one another again but these be word of bad omen -- and some incantation also be of bad omen but because they be useful i do not care for this only let they be useful but do you call thing to be of bad omen except those which be significant of some evil cowardice be a word of bad omen and meanness of spirit and sorrow and grief and shamelessness these word be of bad omen and yet we ought not to hesitate to utter they in order to protect ourselves against the thing do you tell I that a name which be significant of any natural thing be of evil omen say that even for the ear of corn to be reap be of bad omen for it signify the destruction of the ear but not of the world say that the fall of the leaf also be of bad omen and for the dry fig to take the place of the green fig and for raisin to be make from the grape for all these thing be change from a former state into other state not a destruction but a certain fixed economy and administration such be go away from home and a small change : such be death a greater change not from the state which now be to that which be not but to that which be not now shall i then no longer exist you will not exist but you will be something else of which the world now have need for you also come into existence not when you choose but when the world have need of you let these thought be ready to hand by night and by day these you should write these you should read about these you should talk to yourself and to other ask a man : can you help I at all for this purpose and further go to another and to another then if anything that be say be contrary to you wish this reflection first will immediately relieve you that it be not unexpected for it be a great thing in all case to say : i know that i beget a son who be mortal for so you also will say : i know that i be mortal i know that i may leave my home i know that i may be eject from it i know that i may be lead to prison then if you turn round and look to yourself and seek the place from which come that which have happen you will forthwith recollect that it come from the place of thing which be out of the power of the will and of thing which be not my own what then be it to I then you will ask and this be the chief thing : and who be it that send it the leader or the general the state the law of the state give it I then for i must always obey the law in everything then when the appearance -lrb- of thing -rrb- pain you for it be not in you power to prevent this contend against it by the aid of reason conquer it : do not allow it to gain strength nor to lead you to the consequence by raise image such as it please and as it please if you be in gyara do not imagine the mode of live at rome and how many pleasure there be for he who live there and how many there would be for he who return to rome but fix you mind on this matter how a man who live in gyara ought to live in gyara like a man of courage and if you be in rome do not imagine what the life in athen be but think only of the life in rome then in the place of all other delight substitute this that of be conscious that you be obey god that not in word but in deed you be perform the act of a wise and good man for what a thing it be for a man to be able to say to himself : now whatever the rest may say in solemn manner in the school and may be judge to be say in a way contrary to common opinion -lrb- or in a strange way -rrb- this i be do and they be sit and be discourse of my virtue and inquire about I and praise I and of this zeus have will that i shall receive from myself a demonstration and shall myself know if he have a soldier such as he ought to have a citizen such as he ought to have and if he have choose to produce I to the rest of mankind as a witness of the thing which be independent of the will : see that you fear without reason that you foolishly desire what you do desire seek not the good in thing external seek it in yourselve : if you do not you will not find it for this purpose he lead I at one time hither at another time send I thither show I to man as poor without authority and sick send I to gyara lead I into prison not because he hate I -- far from he be such a meaning for who hate the best of he servant nor yet because he care not for I for he do not neglect any even of the smallest thing but he do this for the purpose of exercise I and make use of I as a witness to other be appoint to such a service do i still care about the place in which i be or with whom i be or what man say about I and do i not entirely direct my thought to god and to he instruction and command have these thing -lrb- or thought -rrb- always in hand and exercise they by yourself and keep they in readiness you will never be in want of one to comfort you and strengthen you for it be not shameful to be without something to eat but not to have reason sufficient for keep away fear and sorrow but if once you have gain exemption from sorrow and fear will there any longer be a tyrant for you or a tyrant 's guard or attendant on cæsar or shall any appointment to office at court cause you pain or shall those who sacrifice in the capitol on the occasion of be name to certain function cause pain to you who have receive so great authority from zeus only do not make a proud display of it nor boast of it but show it by you act and if no man perceive it be satisfy that you be yourself in a healthy state and happy \* \* \* \* \* to those who fall off -lrb- desist -rrb- from they purpose -- consider as to the thing which you propose to yourself at first which you have secure and which you have not and how you be pleased when you recall to memory the one and be pained about the other and if it be possible recover the thing wherein you fail for we must not shrink when we be engage in the greatest combat but we must even take blow for the combat before we be not in wrestling and the pancration in which both the successful and the unsuccessful may have the greatest merit or may have little and in truth may be very fortunate or very unfortunate but the combat be for good fortune and happiness themselves well then even if we have renounce the contest in this matter -lrb- for good fortune and happiness -rrb- no man hinder we from renew the combat again and we be not compel to wait for another four year that the game at olympium may come again but as soon as you have recover and restore yourself and employ the same zeal you may renew the combat again and if again you renounce it you may again renew it and if you once gain the victory you be like he who have never renounce the combat only do not through a habit of do the same thing -lrb- renounce the combat -rrb- begin to do it with pleasure and then like a bad athlete go about after be conquer in all the circuit of the game like quail who have run away \* \* \* \* \* to those who fear want -- be you not ashamed at be more cowardly and more mean than fugitive slave how do they when they run away leave they master on what estate do they depend and what domestic do they rely on do they not after steal a little which be enough for the first day then afterwards move on through land or through sea contrive one method after another for maintain they life and what fugitive slave ever die of hunger but you be afraid lest necessary thing should fail you and be sleepless by night wretch be you so blind and do not you see the road to which the want of necessaries lead -- well where do it lead -- to the same place to which a fever lead or a stone that fall on you to death have you not often say this yourself to you companion have you not read much of this kind and write much and how often have you boast that you be easy as to death learn then first what be the thing which be shameful and then tell we that you be a philosopher : but at present do not even if any other man call you so allow it be that shameful to you which be not you own act that of which you be not the cause that which have come to you by accident as a headache as a fever if you parent be poor and leave they property to other and if while they live they do not help you at all be this shameful to you be this what you learn with the philosopher do you never hear that the thing which be shameful ought to be blame and that which be blamable be worthy of blame whom do you blame for a act which be not he own which he do not do himself do you then make you father such as he be or be it in you power to improve he be this power give to you well then ought you to wish the thing which be not give to you or to be ashamed if you do not obtain they and have you also be accustom while you be study philosophy to look to other and to hope for nothing from yourself lament then and groan and eat with fear that you may not have food to-morrow tremble about you poor slave lest they steal lest they run away lest they die so live and continue to live you who in name only have approach philosophy and have disgrace its theorem as far as you can by show they to be useless and unprofitable to those who take they up you who have never seek constancy freedom from perturbation and from passion you who have not seek any person for the sake of this object but many for the sake of syllogism you who have never thoroughly examine any of these appearance by yourself be i able to bear or be i not able to bear what remain for I to do but as if all you affair be well and secure you have be rest on the third topic that of thing be unchanged in order that you may possess unchanged -- what cowardice mean spirit the admiration of the rich desire without attain any end and avoidance -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlisin -rrb- -rrb- which fail in the attempt about security in these thing you have be anxious ought you not to have gain something in addition from reason and then to have protect this with security and whom do you ever see build a battlement all around and encircle it with a wall and what doorkeeper be place with no door to watch but you practice in order to be able to prove -- what you practice that you may not be toss as on the sea through sophism and toss about from what show I first what you hold what you measure or what you weigh and show I the scale or the medimnus -lrb- the measure -rrb- or how long will you go on measure the dust ought you not to demonstrate those thing which make man happy which make thing go on for they in the way as they wish and why we ought to blame no man accuse no man and acquiesce in the administration of the universe \* \* \* \* \* about freedom -- he be free who live as he wish to live who be neither subject to compulsion nor to hindrance nor to force whose movement to action -lrb- -lrb- greek : hormaus -rrb- -rrb- be not impede whose desire attain they purpose and who do not fall into that which he would avoid -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchliseis aperiptotoi -rrb- -rrb- who then choose to live in error no man who choose to live deceive liable to mistake unjust unrestrained discontented mean no man not one then of the bad life as he wish nor be he then free and who choose to live in sorrow fear envy pity desire and fail in he desire attempt to avoid something and fall into it not one do we then find any of the bad free from sorrow free from fear who do not fall into that which he would avoid and do not obtain that which he wish not one nor then do we find any bad man free further then answer I this question also : do freedom seem to you to be something great and noble and valuable how should it not seem so be it possible then when a man obtain anything so great and valuable and noble to be mean it be not possible when then you see any man subject to another or flattering he contrary to he own opinion confidently affirm that this man also be not free and not only if he do this for a bit of supper but also if he do it for a government -lrb- province -rrb- or a consulship and call these man little slave who for the sake of little matter do these thing and those who do so for the sake of great thing call great slave as they deserve to be this be admit also do you think that freedom be a thing independent and self-governing certainly whomsoever then it be in the power of another to hinder and compel declare that he be not free and do not look i entreat you after he grandfather and great-grandfather or inquire about he be buy or sell but if you hear he say from he heart and with feeling master even if the twelve fasce precede he -lrb- as consul -rrb- call he a slave and if you hear he say wretch that i be how much i suffer call he a slave if finally you see he lament complain unhappy call he a slave though he wear a praetexta if then he be do nothing of this kind do not yet say that he be free but learn he opinion whether they be subject to compulsion or may produce hindrance or to bad fortune and if you find he such call he a slave who have a holiday in the saturnalia say that he master be from home he will return soon and you will know what he suffer what then be that which make a man free from hindrance and make he he own master for wealth do not do it nor consulship nor provincial government nor royal power but something else must be discover what then be that which when we write make we free from hindrance and unimpeded the knowledge of the art of write what then be it in play the lute the science of play the lute therefore in life also it be the science of life you have then hear in a general way but examine the thing also in the several part be it possible that he who desire any of the thing which depend on other can be free from hindrance no be it possible for he to be unimpeded no therefore he can not be free consider then whether we have nothing which be in we own power only or whether we have all thing or whether some thing be in we own power and other in the power of other what do you mean when you wish the body to be entire -lrb- sound -rrb- be it in you power or not it be not in my power when you wish it to be healthy neither be this in my power when you wish it to be handsome nor be this life or death neither be this in my power you body then be another 's subject to every man who be stronger than yourself it be but you estate be it in you power to have it when you please and as long as you please and such as you please no and you slave no and you clothes no and you house no and you horse not one of these thing and if you wish by all means you child to live or you wife or you brother or you friend be it in you power this also be not in my power whether then have you nothing which be in you own power which depend on yourself only and can not be take from you or have you anything of the kind i know not look at the thing then thus and examine it be any man able to make you assent to that which be false no man in the matter of assent then you be free from hindrance and obstruction grant well and can a man force you to desire to move towards that to which you do not choose he can for when he threaten I with death or bond he compel I to desire to move towards it if then you despise death and bond do you still pay any regard to he no be then the despising of death a act of you own or be it not yours it be my act when you have make this preparation and have practice this discipline to distinguish that which belong to another from that which be you own the thing which be subject to hindrance from those which be not to consider the thing free from hindrance to concern yourself and those which be not free not to concern yourself to keep you desire steadily fix to the thing which do concern yourself and turn from the thing which do not concern yourself do you still fear any man no one for about what will you be afraid about the thing which be you own in which consist the nature of good and evil and who have power over these thing who can take they away who can impede they no man can no more than he can impede god but will you be afraid about you body and you possession about thing which be not yours about thing which in no way concern you and what else have you be study from the beginning than to distinguish between you own and not you own the thing which be in you power and not in you power the thing subject to hindrance and not subject and why have you come to the philosopher be it that you may nevertheless be unfortunate and unhappy you will then in this way as i have suppose you to have do be without fear and disturbance and what be grief to you for fear come from what you expect but grief from that which be present but what further will you desire for of the thing which be within the power of the will as be good and present you have a proper and regulated desire but of the thing which be not in the power of the will you do not desire any one and so you do not allow any place to that which be irrational and impatient and above measure hasty then after receive everything from another and even yourself be you angry and do you blame the giver if he take anything from you who be you and for what purpose do you come into the world do not he -lrb- god -rrb- introduce you here do he not show you the light do he not give you fellow-worker and perception and reason and as whom do he introduce you here do he not introduce you as subject to death and as one to live on the earth with a little flesh and to observe he administration and to join with he in the spectacle and the festival for a short time will you not then as long as you have be permit after see the spectacle and the solemnity when he lead you out go with adoration of he and thanks for what you have hear and see no but i would still enjoy the feast the initiate too would wish to be longer in the initiation and perhaps also those at olympium to see other athlete but the solemnity be end go away like a grateful and modest man make room for other other also must be bear as you be and be bear they must have a place and house and necessary thing and if the first do not retire what remain why be you insatiable why be you not content why do you contract the world yes but i would have my little child with I and my wife what be they yours do they not belong to the giver and to he who make you then will you not give up what belong to other will you not give way to he who be superior why then do he introduce I into the world on these condition and if the condition do not suit you depart he have no need of a spectator who be not satisfied he want those who join in the festival those who take part in the chorus that they may rather applaud admire and celebrate with hymn the solemnity but those who can bear no trouble and the cowardly he will not unwillingly see absent from the great assembly -lrb- -lrb- greek : panaeguri -rrb- -rrb- for they do not when they be present behave as they ought to do at a festival nor fill up they place properly but they lament find fault with the deity fortune they companion not see both what they have and they own power which they receive for contrary purpose the power of magnanimity of a generous mind manly spirit and what we be now inquire about freedom for what purpose then have i receive these thing to use they how long so long as he who have lend they choose what if they be necessary to I do not attach yourself to they and they will not be necessary do not say to yourself that they be necessary and then they be not necessary you then a man may say be you free i wish by the god and pray to be free but i be not yet able to face my master i still value my poor body i value greatly the preservation of it entire though i do not possess it entire but i can point out to you a free man that you may no longer seek a example diogene be free how be he free not because he be bear of free parent but because he be himself free because he have cast off all the handle of slavery and it be not possible for any man to approach he nor have any man the means of lay hold of he to enslave he he have everything easily loose everything only hang to he if you lay hold of he property he would have rather let it go and be yours than he would have follow you for it if you have lay hold of he leg he would have let go he leg if of all he body all he poor body he intimate friend country just the same for he know from whence he have they and from whom and on what condition he true parent indeed the god and he real country he would never have desert nor would he have yield to any man in obedience to they and to they order nor would any man have die for he country more readily for he be not use to inquire when he should be consider to have do anything on behalf of the whole of thing -lrb- the universe or all the world -rrb- but he remember that everything which be do come from thence and be do on behalf of that country and be command by he who administer it therefore see what diogene himself say and write : for this reason he say diogene it be in you power to speak both with the king of the persian and with archidamus the king of the lacedaemonian as you please be it because he be bear of free parent i suppose all the athenian and all the lacedaemonian because they be bear of slave could not talk with they -lrb- these king -rrb- as they wish but fear and pay court to they why then do he say that it be in he power because i do not consider the poor body to be my own because i want nothing because law be everything to I and nothing else be these be the thing which permit he to be free think of these thing these opinion these word look to these example if you would be free if you desire the thing accord to its worth and what be the wonder if you buy so great a thing at the price of thing so many and so great for the sake of this which be call liberty some hang themselves other throw themselves down precipice and sometimes even whole city have perish and will you not for the sake of the true and unassailable and secure liberty give back to god when he demand they the thing which he have give will you not as plato say study not to die only but also to endure torture and exile and scourging and in a word to give up all which be not you own if you will not you will be a slave among slave even if you be ten thousand time a consul and if you make you way up to the palace -lrb- cæsar 's residence -rrb- you will no less be a slave and you will feel that perhaps philosopher utter word which be contrary to common opinion -lrb- paradox -rrb- as cleanthe also say but not word contrary to reason for you will know by experience that the word be true and that there be no profit from the thing which be value and eagerly seek to those who have obtain they and to those who have not yet obtain they there be a imagination -lrb- -lrb- greek : phantasium -rrb- -rrb- that when these thing be come all that be good will come with they then when they be come the feverish feeling be the same the toss to and fro be the same the satiety the desire of thing which be not present for freedom be acquire not by the full possession of the thing which be desire but by remove the desire and that you may know that this be true as you have labor for those thing so transfer you labor to these : be vigilant for the purpose of acquire a opinion which will make you free pay court to a philosopher instead of to a rich old man be see about a philosopher 's door you will not disgrace yourself by be see you will not go away empty nor without profit if you go to the philosopher as you ought and if not -lrb- if you do not succeed -rrb- try at least the trial -lrb- attempt -rrb- be not disgraceful \* \* \* \* \* on familiar intimacy -- to this matter before all you must attend that you be never so closely connect with any of you former intimate or friend as to come down to the same act as he do if you do not observe this rule you will ruin yourself but if the thought arise in you mind i shall seem disoblige to he and he will not have the same feeling towards I remember that nothing be do without cost nor be it possible for a man if he do not do the same thing to be the same man that he be choose then which of the two you will have to be equally love by those by whom you be formerly love be the same with you former self or be superior not to obtain from you friend the same that you do before \* \* \* \* \* what thing we should exchange for other thing -- keep this thought in readiness when you lose anything external what you acquire in place of it and if it be worth more never say i have have a loss neither if you have get a horse in place of a ass or a ox in place of a sheep nor a good action in place of a bit of money nor in place of idle talk such tranquillity as befit a man nor in place of lewd talk if you have acquire modesty if you remember this you will always maintain you character such as it ought to be but if you do not consider that the time of opportunity be perish and that whatever pain you take about yourself you be go to waste they all and overturn they and it need only a few thing for the loss and overturn of all -- namely a small deviation from reason for the steerer of a ship to upset it he have no need of the same means as he have need of for save it but if he turn it a little to the wind it be lose and if he do not do this purposely but have be neglect he duty a little the ship be lose something of the kind happen in this case also if you only fall a nod a little all that you have up to this time collect be go attend therefore to the appearance of thing and watch over they for that which you have to preserve be no small matter but it be modesty and fidelity and constancy freedom from the affect a state of mind undisturbed freedom from fear tranquillity in a word liberty for what will you sell these thing see what be the value of the thing which you will obtain in exchange for these -- but shall i not obtain any such thing for it -- see and if you do in return get that see what you receive in place of it i possess decency he possess a tribuneship : he possess a prætorship i possess modesty but i do not make acclamation where it be not become : i will not stand up where i ought not for i be free and a friend of god and so i obey he willingly but i must not claim -lrb- seek -rrb- anything else neither body nor possession nor magistracy nor good report nor in fact anything for he -lrb- god -rrb- do not allow I to claim -lrb- seek -rrb- they for if he have choose he would have make they good for I but he have not do so and for this reason i can not transgress he command preserve that which be you own good in everything and as to every other thing as it be permit and so far as to behave consistently with reason in respect to they content with this only if you do not you will be unfortunate you will fail in all thing you will be hinder you will be impede these be the law which have be send from thence -lrb- from god -rrb- these be the order of these law a man ought to be a expositor to these he ought to submit not to those of masurius and cassius \* \* \* \* \* to those who be desirous of pass life in tranquillity -- remember that not only the desire of power and of riches make we mean and subject to other but even the desire of tranquillity and of leisure and of travel abroad and of learn for to speak plainly whatever the external thing may be the value which we set upon it place we in subjection to other what then be the difference between desire to be a senator or not desire to be one what be the difference between desire power or be content with a private station what be the difference between say i be unhappy i have nothing to do but i be bind to my book as a corpse or say i be unhappy i have no leisure for read for as salutation and power be thing external and independent of the will so be a book for what purpose do you choose to read tell I for if you only direct you purpose to be amuse or learn something you be a silly fellow and incapable of endure labor but if you refer read to the proper end what else be this than a tranquil and happy life -lrb- -lrb- greek : eusoium -rrb- -rrb- but if reading do not secure for you a happy and tranquil life what be the use of it but it do secure this the man reply and for this reason i be vex that i be deprive of it -- and what be this tranquil and happy life which any man can impede i do not say cæsar or cæsar 's friend but a crow a piper a fever and thirty thousand other thing but a tranquil and happy life contain nothing so sure as continuity and freedom from obstacle now i be call to do something : i will go then with the purpose of observe the measure -lrb- rule -rrb- which i must keep of act with modesty steadiness without desire and aversion to thing external and then that i may attend to man what they say how they be move and this not with any bad disposition or that i may have something to blame or to ridicule but i turn to myself and ask if i also commit the same fault how then shall i cease to commit they formerly i also act wrong but now i do not : thanks to god what then be the reason of this the reason be that we have never read for this purpose we have never write for this purpose so that we may in we action use in a way conformable to nature the appearance present to we but we terminate in this in learn what be say and in be able to expound it to another in resolve a syllogism and in handle the hypothetical syllogism for this reason where we study -lrb- purpose -rrb- be there alone be the impediment would you have by all mean the thing which be not in you power be prevent then be hinder fail in you purpose but if we read what be write about action -lrb- effort -lrb- greek : horma -rrb- -rrb- not that we may see what be say about action but that we may act well if we read what be say about desire and aversion -lrb- avoid thing -rrb- in order that we may neither fail in we desire nor fall into that which we try to avoid if we read what be say about duty -lrb- officium -rrb- in order that remember the relation -lrb- of thing to one another -rrb- we may do nothing irrationally nor contrary to these relation we should not be vex in be hinder as to we reading but we should be satisfy with do the act which be conformable -lrb- to the relation -rrb- and we should be reckon not what so far we have be accustom to reckon : to-day i have read so many verse i have write so many but -lrb- we should say -rrb- to-day i have employ my action as it be teach by the philosopher i have not employ my desire i have use avoidance -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchliseus -rrb- -rrb- only with respect to thing which be within the power of my will i have not be afraid of such a person i have not be prevail upon by the entreaty of another i have exercise my patience my abstinence my co-operation with other and so we should thank god for what we ought to thank he there be only one way to happiness and let this rule be ready both in the morning and during the day and by night : the rule be not to look towards thing which be out of the power of we will to think that nothing be we own to give up all thing to the divinity to fortune to make they the superintendent of these thing whom zeus also have make so for a man to observe that only which be he own that which can not be hinder and when we read to refer we read to this only and we writing and we listen for this reason i can not call the man industrious if i hear this only that he read and write and even if a man add that he read all night i can not say so if he know not to what he should refer he reading for neither do you say that a man be industrious if he keep awake for a girl nor do i but if he do it -lrb- read and write -rrb- for reputation i say that he be a lover of reputation and if he do it for money i say that he be a lover of money not a lover of labor and if he do it through love of learn i say that he be a lover of learning but if he refer he labor to he own ruling power that he may keep it in a state conformable to nature and pass he life in that state then only do i say that he be industrious for never commend a man on account of these thing which be common to all but on account of he opinion -lrb- principle -rrb- for these be the thing which belong to each man which make he action bad or good remember these rule rejoice in that which be present and be content with the thing which come in season if you see anything which you have learn and inquire about occur to you in you course of life -lrb- or opportunely apply by you to the act of life -rrb- be delight at it if you have lay aside or have lessen bad disposition and a habit of revile if you have do so with rash temper obscene word hastiness sluggishness if you be not move by what you formerly be and not in the same way as you once be you can celebrate a festival daily to-day because you have behave well in one act and to-morrow because you have behave well in another how much greater be this a reason for make sacrifice than a consulship or the government of a province these thing come to you from yourself and from the god remember this who give these thing and to whom and for what purpose if you cherish yourself in these thought do you still think that it make any difference where you shall be happy where you shall please god be not the god equally distant from all place do they not see from all place alike that which be go on \* \* \* \* \* against the quarrelsome and ferocious -- the wise and good man neither himself fight with any person nor do he allow another so far as he can prevent it and a example of this as well as of all other thing be propose to we in the life of socrate who not only himself on all occasion avoid fight -lrb- quarrel -rrb- but would not allow even other to quarrel see in xenophon 's symposium how many quarrel he settle how further he endure thrasymachus and polus and callicle how he tolerate he wife and how he tolerate he son who attempt to confute he and to cavil with he for he remember well that no man have in he power another man 's ruling principle he wish therefore for nothing else than that which be he own and what be this not that this or that man may act accord to nature for that be a thing which belong to another but that while other be do they own act as they choose he may nevertheless be in a condition conformable to nature and live in it only do what be he own to the end that other also may be in a state conformable to nature for this be the object always set before he by the wise and good man be it to be commander -lrb- a prætor -rrb- of a army no but if it be permit he he object be in this matter to maintain he own ruling principle be it to marry no but if marriage be allow to he in this matter he object be to maintain himself in a condition conformable to nature but if he would have he son not to do wrong or he wife he would have what belong to another not to belong to another : and to be instruct be this to learn what thing be a man 's own and what belong to another how then be there leave any place for fighting -lrb- quarrel -rrb- to a man who have this opinion -lrb- which he ought to have -rrb- be he surprise at any thing which happen and do it appear new to he do he not expect that which come from the bad to be worse and more grievous than that what actually befall he and do he not reckon as pure gain whatever they -lrb- the bad -rrb- may do which fall short of extreme wickedness such a person have revile you great thanks to he for not have strike you but he have strike I also great thanks that he do not wind you but he wound I also great thanks that he do not kill you for when do he learn or in what school that man be a tame animal that man love one another that a act of injustice be a great harm to he who do it since then he have not learn this and be not convince of it why shall he not follow that which seem to be for he own interest you neighbor have throw stone have you then do anything wrong but the thing in the house have be break be you then a utensil no but a free power of will what then be give to you -lrb- to do -rrb- in answer to this if you be like a wolf you must bite in return and throw more stone but if you consider what be proper for a man examine you storehouse see with what faculty you come into the world have you the disposition of a wild beast have you the disposition of revenge for a injury when be a horse wretched when he be deprive of he natural faculty not when he can not crow like a cock but when he can not run when be a dog wretch not when he can not fly but when he can not track he game be then a man also unhappy in this way not because he can not strangle lion or embrace statue for he do not come into the world in the possession of certain power from nature for this purpose but because he have lose he probity and he fidelity people ought to meet and lament such a man for the misfortune into which he have fall not indeed to lament because a man have be bear or have die but because it have happen to he in he lifetime to have lose the thing which be he own not that which he receive from he father not he land and house and he inn and he slave for not one of these thing be a man 's own but all belong to other be servile and subject to account -lrb- -lrb- greek : hupeithuna -rrb- -rrb- at different time give to different person by those who have they in they power : but i mean the thing which belong to he as a man the mark -lrb- stamp -rrb- in he mind with which he come into the world such as we seek also on coin and if we find they we approve of the coin and if we do not find the mark we reject they what be the stamp on this sestertius the stamp of trajan present it it be the stamp of nero throw it away it can not be accept it be counterfeit so also in this case : what be the stamp of he opinion it be gentleness a sociable disposition a tolerant temper a disposition to mutual affection produce these quality i accept they : i consider this man a citizen i accept he as a neighbor a companion in my voyage only see that he have not nero 's stamp be he passionate be he full of resentment be he fault-finding if the whim seize he do he break the head of those who come in he way -lrb- if so -rrb- why then do you say that he be a man be everything judge -lrb- determine -rrb- by the bare form if that be so say that the form in wax be a apple and have the smell and the taste of a apple but the external figure be not enough : neither then be the nose enough and the eye to make the man but he must have the opinion of a man here be a man who do not listen to reason who do not know when he be refute : he be a ass in another man the sense of shame be become dead : he be good for nothing he be anything rather than a man this man seek whom he may meet and kick or bite so that he be not even a sheep or a ass but a kind of wild beast what then would you have I to be despise -- by whom by those who know you and how shall those who know you despise a man who be gentle and modest perhaps you mean by those who do not know you what be that to you for no other artisan care for the opinion of those who know not he art but they will be more hostile to I for this reason why do you say I can any man injure you will or prevent you from use in a natural way the appearance which be present to you in no way can he why then be you still disturbed and why do you choose to show yourself afraid and why do you not come forth and proclaim that you be at peace with all man whatever they may do and laugh at those chiefly who think that they can harm you these slave you can say know not either who i be nor where lie my good or my evil because they have no access to the thing which be mine in this way also those who occupy a strong city mock the besieger -lrb- and say -rrb- : what trouble these man be now take for nothing we wall be secure we have food for a very long time and all other resource these be the thing which make a city strong and impregnable but nothing else than he opinion make a man 's soul impregnable for what wall be so strong or what body be so hard or what possession be so safe or what honor -lrb- rank character -rrb- so free from assault -lrb- as a man 's opinion -rrb- all -lrb- other -rrb- thing everywhere be perishable easily take by assault and if any man in any way be attach to they he must be disturb except what be bad he must fear lament find he desire disappointed and fall into thing which he would avoid then do we not choose to make secure the only means of safety which be offer to we and do we not choose to withdraw ourselves from that which be perishable and servile and to labor at the thing which be imperishable and by nature free and do we not remember that no man either hurt another or do good to another but that a man 's opinion about each thing be that which hurt he be that which overturn he this be fight this be civil discord this be war that which make eteocle and polynice enemy be nothing else than this opinion which they have about royal power they opinion about exile that the one be the extreme of evil the other the greatest good now this be the nature of every man to seek the good to avoid the bad to consider he who deprive we of the one and involve we in the other a enemy and treacherous even if he be a brother or a son or a father for nothing be more akin to we than the good therefore if these thing -lrb- externals -rrb- be good and evil neither be a father a friend to son nor a brother to a brother but all the world be everywhere full of enemy treacherous man and sycophant but if the will -lrb- -lrb- greek : proairesis -rrb- the purpose the intention -rrb- be what it ought to be be the only good and if the will be such as it ought not to be be the only evil where be there any strife where be there revile about what about the thing which do not concern we and strife with whom with the ignorant the unhappy with those who be deceive about the chief thing remember this socrate manage he own house and endure a very ill-tempered wife and a foolish -lrb- ungrateful -rrb- son \* \* \* \* \* against those who lament over be pity -- i be grieve a man say at be pity whether then be the fact of you be pity a thing which concern you or those who pity you well be it in you power to stop this pity it be in my power if i show they that i do not require pity and whether then be you in the condition of not deserving -lrb- require -rrb- pity or be you not in that condition i think that i be not but these person do not pity I for the thing for which if they ought to pity I it would be proper i mean for my fault but they pity I for my poverty for not possess honorable office for disease and death and other such thing whether then be you prepare to convince the many that not one of these thing be a evil but that it be possible for a man who be poor and have no office -lrb- -lrb- greek : anarchontus -rrb- -rrb- and enjoy no honor to be happy or to show yourself to they as rich and in power for the second of these thing belong to a man who be boastful silly and good for nothing and consider by what mean the pretence must be support it will be necessary for you to hire slave and to possess a few silver vessel and to exhibit they in public if it be possible though they be often the same and to attempt to conceal the fact that they be the same and to have splendid garment and all other thing for display and to show that you be a man honor by the great and to try to sup at they house or to be suppose to sup there and as to you person to employ some mean art that you may appear to be more handsome and nobler than you be these thing you must contrive if you choose to go by the second path in order not to be pity but the first way be both impracticable and long to attempt the very thing which zeus have not be able to do to convince all man what thing be good and bad be this power give to you this only be give to you to convince yourself and you have not convinced yourself then i ask you do you attempt to persuade other man and who have live so long with you as you with yourself and who have so much power of convince you as you have of convincing yourself and who be better disposed and nearer to you than you be to yourself how then have you not yet convinced yourself in order to learn at present be not thing upside down be this what you have be earnest about do to learn to be free from grief and free from disturbance and not to be humble -lrb- abject -rrb- and to be free have you not hear then that there be only one way which lead to this end to give up -lrb- dismiss -rrb- the thing which do not depend on the will to withdraw from they and to admit that they belong to other for another man then to have a opinion about you of what kind be it it be a thing independent of the will -- then be it nothing to you it be nothing when then you be still vex at this and disturb do you think that you be convinced about good and evil \* \* \* \* \* on freedom from fear -- what make the tyrant formidable the guard you say and they sword and the man of the bedchamber and those who exclude they who would enter why then if you bring a boy -lrb- child -rrb- to the tyrant when he be with he guard be he not afraid or be it because the child do not understand these thing if then any man do understand what guard be and that they have sword and come to the tyrant for this very purpose because he wish to die on account of some circumstance and seek to die easily by the hand of another be he afraid of the guard no for he wish for the thing which make the guard formidable if then any man neither wish to die nor to live by all means but only as it may be permit approach the tyrant what hinder he from approach the tyrant without fear nothing if then a man have the same opinion about he property as the man whom i have instance have about he body and also about he child and he wife and in a word be so affect by some madness or despair that he care not whether he possess they or not but like child who be play with shell -lrb- quarrel -rrb- about the play but do not trouble themselves about the shell so he too have set no value on the material -lrb- thing -rrb- but value the pleasure that he have with they and the occupation what tyrant be then formidable to he or what guard or what sword what hinder a man who have clearly separate -lrb- comprehend -rrb- these thing from live with a light heart and bearing easily the rein quietly expect everything which can happen and endure that which have already happen would you have I to bear poverty come and you will know what poverty be when it have find one who can act well the part of a poor man would you have I to possess power let I have power and also the trouble of it well banishment wherever i shall go there it will be well with I for here also where i be it be not because of the place that it be well with I but because of my opinion which i shall carry off with I for neither can any man deprive I of they but my opinion alone be mine and they can not be take from I and i be satisfy while i have they wherever i may be and whatever i be do but now it be time to die why do you say to die make no tragedy show of the thing but speak of it as it be it be now time for the matter -lrb- of the body -rrb- to be resolve into the thing out of which it be compose and what be the formidable thing here what be go to perish of the thing which be in the universe what new thing or wondrous be go to happen be it for this reason that a tyrant be formidable be it for this reason that the guard appear to have sword which be large and sharp say this to other but i have consider about all these thing no man have power over I i have be make free i know he command no man can now lead I as a slave i have a proper person to assert my freedom i have proper judge -lrb- i say -rrb- be you not the master of my body what then be that to I be you not the master of my property what then be that to I be you not the master of my exile or of my chain well from all these thing and all the poor body itself i depart at you bidding when you please make trial of you power and you will know how far it reach whom then can i still fear those who be over the bedchamber lest they should do what shut I out if they find that i wish to enter let they shut I out why then do you go to the door because i think it befit I while the play -lrb- sport -rrb- last to join in it how then be you not shut out because unless some one allow I to go in i do not choose to go in but be always content with that which happen for i think that what god choose be better than what i choose i will attach myself as a minister and follower to he i have the same movement -lrb- pursuit -rrb- as he have i have the same desire in a word i have the same will -lrb- -lrb- greek : sunthelo -rrb- -rrb- there be no shut out for I but for those who would force they way in why then do not i force my way in because i know that nothing good be distribute within to those who enter but when i hear any man call fortunate because he be honor by cæsar i say what do he happen to get a province -lrb- the government of a province -rrb- do he also obtain a opinion such as he ought the office of a prefect do he also obtain the power of use he office well why do i still strive to enter -lrb- cæsar 's chamber -rrb- a man scatter dry fig and nut : the child seize they and fight with one another man do not for they think they to be a small matter but if a man should throw about shell even the child do not seize they province be distribute : let child look to that money be distribute let child look to that prætorships consulship be distribute let child scramble for they let they be shut out beat kiss the hand of the giver of the slave : but to I these be only dry fig and nut what then if you fail to get they while cæsar be scatter they about do not be trouble if a dry fig come into you lap take it and eat it for so far you may value even a fig but if i shall stoop down and turn another over or be turn over by another and shall flatter those who have get into -lrb- cæsar 's -rrb- chamber neither be a dry fig worth the trouble nor anything else of the thing which be not good which the philosopher have persuade I not to think good \* \* \* \* \* to a person who have be change to a character of shamelessness -- when you see another man in the possession of power -lrb- magistracy -rrb- set against this the fact that you have not the want -lrb- desire -rrb- of power when you see another rich see what you possess in place of riches : for if you possess nothing in place of they you be miserable but if you have not the want of riches know that you possess more than this man possess and what be worth much more \* \* \* \* \* what thing we ought to despise and what thing we ought to value -- the difficulty of all man be about external thing they helplessness be about external what shall i do how will it be how will it turn out will this happen will that all these be the word of those who be turn themselves to thing which be not within the power of the will for who say how shall i not assent to that which be false how shall i not turn away from the truth if a man be of such a good disposition as to be anxious about these thing i will remind he of this : why be you anxious the thing be in you own power be assure do not be precipitate in assent before you apply the natural rule on the other side if a man be anxious -lrb- uneasy -rrb- about desire lest it fail in its purpose and miss its end and with respect to the avoidance of thing lest he should fall into that which he would avoid i will first kiss -lrb- love -rrb- he because he throw away the thing about which other be in a flutter -lrb- other desire -rrb- and they fear and employ he thought about he own affair and he own condition then i shall say to he : if you do not choose to desire that which you will fail to obtain nor to attempt to avoid that into which you will fall desire nothing which belong to -lrb- which be in the power of -rrb- other nor try to avoid any of the thing which be not in you power if you do not observe this rule you must of necessity fail in you desire and fall into that which you would avoid what be the difficulty here where be there room for the word how will it be and how will it turn out and will this happen or that now be not that which will happen independent of the will yes and the nature of good and of evil be it not in the thing which be within the power of the will yes be it in you power then to treat accord to nature everything which happen can any person hinder you no man no longer then say to I how will it be for however it may be you will dispose of it well and the result to you will be a fortunate one what would hercule have be if he say : how shall a great lion not appear to I or a great boar or savage man and what do you care for that if a great boar appear you will fight a greater fight if bad man appear you will relieve the earth of the bad suppose then that i lose my life in this way you will die a good man do a noble act for since he must certainly die of necessity a man must be find do something either follow the employment of a husbandman or digging or trading or serve in a consulship or suffer from indigestion or from diarrhoea what then do you wish to be do when you be find by death i for my part would wish to be find do something which belong to a man beneficent suitable to the general interest noble but if i can not be find do thing so great i would be find do at least that which i can not be hinder from do that which be permit I to do correct myself cultivate the faculty which make use of appearance labor at freedom from the affect -lrb- labor at tranquillity of mind -rrb- render to the relation of life they due if i succeed so far also -lrb- i would be find -rrb- touch on -lrb- advance to -rrb- the third topic -lrb- or head -rrb- safety in form judgment about thing if death surprise I when i be busy about these thing it be enough for I if i can stretch out my hand to god and say : the means which i have receive from thee for see thy administration -lrb- of the world -rrb- and follow it i have not neglect i have not dishonor thee by my act see how i have use my perception see how i have use my preconception have i ever blame thee have i be discontent with anything that happen or wish it to be otherwise have i wish to transgress the -lrb- establish -rrb- relation -lrb- of thing -rrb- that thou hast give I life i thank thee for what thou hast give so long as i have use the thing which be thine i be content take they back and place they wherever thou mayest choose for thine be all thing thou gavest they to I be it not enough to depart in this state of mind and what life be better and more become than that of a man who be in this state of mind and what end be more happy \* \* \* \* \* about purity -lrb- cleanliness -rrb- -- some person raise a question whether the social feeling be contain in the nature of man and yet i think that these same person would have no doubt that love of purity be certainly contain in it and that if man be distinguish from other animal by anything he be distinguish by this when then we see any other animal cleaning itself we be accustom to speak of the act with surprise and to add that the animal be act like a man and on the other hand if a man blame a animal for be dirty straightway as if we be make a excuse for it we say that of course the animal be not a human creature so we suppose that there be something superior in man and that we first receive it from the god for since the god by they nature be pure and free from corruption so far as man approach they by reason so far do they cling to purity and to a love -lrb- habit -rrb- of purity but since it be impossible that man 's nature -lrb- -lrb- greek : ousium -rrb- -rrb- can be altogether pure be mixed -lrb- compose -rrb- of such material reason be apply as far as it be possible and reason endeavor to make human nature love purity the first then and highest purity be that which be in the soul and we say the same of impurity now you could not discover the impurity of the soul as you could discover that of the body but as to the soul what else could you find in it than that which make it filthy in respect to the act which be she own now the act of the soul be movement towards a object or movement from it desire aversion preparation design -lrb- purpose -rrb- assent what then be it which in these act make the soul filthy and impure nothing else than she own bad judgment -lrb- -lrb- greek : chrima -rrb- -rrb- consequently the impurity of the soul be the soul 's bad opinion and the purification of the soul be the plant in it of proper opinion and the soul be pure which have proper opinion for the soul alone in she own act be free from perturbation and pollution for we ought not even by the appearance of the body to deter the multitude from philosophy but as in other thing a philosopher should show himself cheerful and tranquil so also he should in the thing that relate to the body see ye man that i have nothing that i want nothing see how i be without a house and without a city and a exile if it happen to be so and without a hearth i live more free from trouble and more happily than all of noble birth and than the rich but look at my poor body also and observe that it be not injure by my hard way of living but if a man say this to I who have the appearance -lrb- dress -rrb- and face of a condemn man what god shall persuade I to approach philosophy if it make man such person far from it i would not choose to do so even if i be go to become a wise man i indeed would rather that a young man who be make he first movement towards philosophy should come to I with he hair carefully trim than with it dirty and rough for there be see in he a certain notion -lrb- appearance -rrb- of beauty and a desire of -lrb- attempt at -rrb- that which be become and where he suppose it to be there also he strive that it shall be it be only necessary to show he -lrb- what it be -rrb- and to say : young man you seek beauty and you do well you must know then that it -lrb- be produce -rrb- grow in that part of you where you have the rational faculty seek it there where you have the movement towards and movement from thing where you have the desire towards and the aversion from thing for this be what you have in yourself of a superior kind but the poor body be naturally only earth why do you labor about it to no purpose if you shall learn nothing else you will learn from time that the body be nothing but if a man come to I daub with filth dirty with a moustache down to he knee what can i say to he by what kind of resemblance can i lead he on for about what have he busy himself which resemble beauty that i may be able to change he and say beauty be not in this but in that would you have I to tell he that beauty consist not in be daub with muck but that it lie in the rational part have he any desire of beauty have he any form of it in he mind go and talk to a hog and tell he not to roll in the mud \* \* \* \* \* on attention -- when you have remit you attention for a short time do not imagine this that you will recover it when you choose but let this thought be present to you that in consequence of the fault commit today you affair must be in a worse condition for all that follow for first and what cause most trouble a habit of not attend be form in you then a habit of defer you attention and continually from time to time you drive away by defer it the happiness of life proper behavior the be and live conformably to nature if then the procrastination of attention be profitable the complete omission of attention be more profitable but if it be not profitable why do you not maintain you attention constant today i choose to play well then ought you not to play with attention i choose to sing what then hinder you from do so with attention be there any part of life except to which attention do not extend for will you do it -lrb- anything in life -rrb- worse by use attention and better by not attend at all and what else of the thing in life be do better by those who do not use attention do he who work in wood work better by not attend to it do the captain of a ship manage it better by not attend and be any of the smaller act do better by inattention do you not see that when you have let you mind loose it be no longer in you power to recall it either to propriety or to modesty or to moderation but you do everything that come into you mind in obedience to you inclination first then we ought to have these -lrb- rule -rrb- in readiness and to do nothing without they and we ought to keep the soul direct to this mark to pursue nothing external and nothing which belong to other -lrb- or be in the power of other -rrb- but to do as he have appoint who have the power we ought to pursue altogether the thing which be in the power of the will and all other thing as it be permit next to this we ought to remember who we be and what be we name and to endeavor to direct we duty towards the character -lrb- nature -rrb- of we several relation -lrb- in life -rrb- in this manner : what be the season for singing what be the season for play and in whose presence what will be the consequence of the act whether we associate will despise we whether we shall despise they when to jeer -lrb- -lrb- greek : schopsaus -rrb- -rrb- and whom to ridicule and on what occasion to comply and with whom and finally in comply how to maintain we own character but wherever you have deviate from any of these rule there be damage immediately not from anything external but from the action itself what then be it possible to be free from fault -lrb- if you do all this -rrb- it be not possible but this be possible to direct you effort incessantly to be faultless for we must be content if by never remit this attention we shall escape at least a few error but now when you have say tomorrow i will begin to attend you must be tell that you be say this today i will be shameless disregardful of time and place mean it will be in the power of other to give I pain today i will be passionate and envious see how many evil thing you be permit yourself to do if it be good to use attention tomorrow how much better be it to do so today if tomorrow it be in you interest to attend much more be it today that you may be able to do so tomorrow also and may not defer it again to the third day \* \* \* \* \* against or to those who readily tell they own affair -- when a man have seem to we to have talk with simplicity -lrb- candor -rrb- about he own affair how be it that at last we be ourselves also induce to discover to he we own secret and we think this to be candid behavior in the first place because it seem unfair for a man to have listen to the affair of he neighbor and not to communicate to he also in turn we own affair next because we think that we shall not present to they the appearance of candid man when we be silent about we own affair indeed man be often accustomed to say i have tell you all my affair will you tell I nothing of you own where be this do besides we have also this opinion that we can safely trust he who have already tell we he own affair for the notion rise in we mind that this man could never divulge we affair because he would be cautious that we also should not divulge he in this way also the incautious be catch by the soldier at rome a soldier sit by you in a common dress and begin to speak ill of cæsar then you as if you have receive a pledge of he fidelity by he have begin the abuse utter yourself also what you think and then you be carry off in chain something of this kind happen to we also generally now as this man have confidently intrust he affair to I shall i also do so to any man whom i meet -lrb- no -rrb- for when i have hear i keep silence if i be of such a disposition but he go forth and tell all man what he have hear then if i hear what have be do if i be a man like he i resolve to be revenge i divulge what he have tell I i both disturb other and be disturbed myself but if i remember that one man do not injure another and that every man 's act injure and profit he i secure this that i do not anything like he but still i suffer what i do suffer through my own silly talk true but it be unfair when you have hear the secret of you neighbor for you in you turn to communicate nothing to he do i ask you for you secret my man do you communicate you affair on certain term that you should in return hear mine also if you be a babbler and think that all who meet you be friend do you wish I also to be like you but why if you do well in intrust you affair to I and it be not well for I to intrust mine to you do you wish I to be so rash it be just the same as if i have a cask which be water-tight and you one with a hole in it and you should come and deposit with I you wine that i might put it into my cask and then should complain that i also do not intrust my wine to you for you have a cask with a hole in it how then be there any equality here you intrust you affair to a man who be faithful and modest to a man who think that he own action alone be injurious and -lrb- or -rrb- useful and that nothing external be would you have I intrust mine to you a man who have dishonor he own faculty of will and who wish to gain some small bit of money or some office or promotion in the court -lrb- emperor 's palace -rrb- even if you should be go to murder you own child like medea where -lrb- in what -rrb- be this equality -lrb- fairness -rrb- but show yourself to I to be faithful modest and steady show I that you have friendly opinion show that you cask have no hole in it and you will see how i shall not wait for you to trust I with you own affair but i myself shall come to you and ask you to hear mine for who do not choose to make use of a good vessel who do not value a benevolent and faithful adviser who will not willingly receive a man who be ready to bear a share as we may say of the difficulty of he circumstance and by this very act to ease the burden by take a part of it \* \* \* \* \* the encheiridion or manual i of thing some be in we power and other be not in we power be opinion -lrb- -lrb- greek : hupolaepsis -rrb- -rrb- movement towards a thing -lrb- -lrb- greek : horma -rrb- -rrb- desire aversion -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlisis -rrb- -rrb- turn from a thing and in a word whatever be we act not in we power be the body property reputation office -lrb- magisterial power -rrb- and in a word whatever be not we own act and the thing in we power be by nature free not subject to restraint or hindrance but the thing not in we power be weak slavish subject to restraint in the power of other remember then that if you think the thing which be by nature slavish to be free and the thing which be in the power of other to be you own you will be hinder you will lament you will be disturb you will blame both god and man but if you think that only which be you own to be you own and if you think that what be another 's as it really be belong to another no man will ever compel you no man will hinder you you will never blame any man you will accuse no man you will do nothing involuntarily -lrb- against you will -rrb- no man will harm you you will have no enemy for you will not suffer any harm if then you desire -lrb- aim at -rrb- such great thing remember that you must not -lrb- attempt to -rrb- lay hold of they with a small effort but you must leave alone some thing entirely and postpone other for the present but if you wish for these thing also -lrb- such great thing -rrb- and power -lrb- office -rrb- and wealth perhaps you will not gain even these very thing -lrb- power and wealth -rrb- because you aim also at those former thing -lrb- such great thing -rrb- certainly you will fail in those thing through which alone happiness and freedom be secure straightway then practice say to every harsh appearance : you be a appearance and in no manner what you appear to be then examine it by the rule which you possess and by this first and chiefly whether it relate to the thing which be in we power or to thing which be not in we power and if it relate to anything which be not in we power be ready to say that it do not concern you ii remember that desire contain in it the profession -lrb- hope -rrb- of obtain that which you desire and the profession -lrb- hope -rrb- in aversion -lrb- turn from a thing -rrb- be that you will not fall into that which you attempt to avoid and he who fail in he desire be unfortunate and he who fall into that which he would avoid be unhappy if then you attempt to avoid only the thing contrary to nature which be within you power you will not be involve in any of the thing which you would avoid but if you attempt to avoid disease or death or poverty you will be unhappy take away then aversion from all thing which be not in we power and transfer it to the thing contrary to nature which be in we power but destroy desire completely for the present for if you desire anything which be not in we power you must be unfortunate but of the thing in we power and which it would be good to desire nothing yet be before you but employ only the power of move towards a object and retire from it and these power indeed only slightly and with exception and with remission iii in everything which please the soul or supply a want or be love remember to add this to the -lrb- description notion -rrb- : what be the nature of each thing begin from the smallest if you love a earthen vessel say it be a earthen vessel which you love for when it have be break you will not be disturb if you be kiss you child or wife say that it be a human being whom you be kiss for when the wife or child die you will not be disturbed iv when you be go to take in hand any act remind yourself what kind of a act it be if you be go to bathe place before yourself what happen in the bath some splash the water other push against one another other abuse one another and some stealing and thus with more safety you will undertake the matter if you say to yourself i now intend to bathe and to maintain my will in a manner conformable to nature and so you will do in every act for thus if any hindrance to bathing shall happen let this thought be ready it be not this only that i intend but i intend also to maintain my will in a way conformable to nature but i shall not maintain it so if i be vex at what happen v man be disturb not by the thing which happen but by the opinion about the thing for example death be nothing terrible for if it be it would have seem so to socrate for the opinion about death that it be terrible be the terrible thing when then we be impede or disturb or grieve let we never blame other but ourselves -- that be we opinion it be the act of a ill-instructed man to blame other for he own bad condition it be the act of one who have begin to be instruct to lay the blame on himself and of one whose instruction be complete neither to blame another nor himself vi be not elate at any advantage -lrb- excellence -rrb- which belong to another if a horse when he be elated should say i be beautiful one might endure it but when you be elated and say i have a beautiful horse you must know that you be elate at have a good horse what then be you own the use of appearance consequently when in the use of appearance you be conformable to nature then be elate for then you will be elate at something good which be you own vii as on a voyage when the vessel have reach a port if you go out to get water it be a amusement by the way to pick up a shellfish or some bulb but you thought ought to be direct to the ship and you ought to be constantly watch if the captain should call and then you must throw away all those thing that you may not be bind and pitch into the ship like sheep so in life also if there be give to you instead of a little bulb and a shell a wife and child there will be nothing to prevent -lrb- you from take they -rrb- but if the captain should call run to the ship and leave all those thing without regard to they but if you be old do not even go far from the ship lest when you be call you make default viii seek not that the thing which happen should happen as you wish but wish the thing which happen to be as they be and you will have a tranquil flow of life ix disease be a impediment to the body but not to the will unless the will itself choose lameness be a impediment to the leg but not to the will and add this reflection on the occasion of everything that happen for you will find it a impediment to something else but not to yourself x on the occasion of every accident -lrb- event -rrb- that befall you remember to turn to yourself and inquire what power you have for turn it to use if you see a fair man or a fair woman you will find that the power to resist be temperance -lrb- continence -rrb- if labor -lrb- pain -rrb- be present to you you will find that it be endurance if it be abusive word you will find it to be patience and if you have be thus form to the -lrb- proper -rrb- habit the appearance will not carry you along with they xi never say about anything i have lose it but say i have restore it be you child dead it have be restore be you wife dead she have be restore have you estate be take from you have not then this also be restore but he who have take it from I be a bad man but what be it to you by whose hand the giver demand it back so long as he may allow you take care of it as a thing which belong to another as traveller do with they inn xii if you intend to improve throw away such thought as these : if i neglect my affair i shall not have the means of living : unless i chastise my slave he will be bad for it be better to die of hunger and so to be release from grief and fear than to live in abundance with perturbation and it be better for you slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy begin then from little thing be the oil spill be a little wine steal say on the occasion at such price be sell freedom from perturbation at such price be sell tranquillity but nothing be get for nothing and when you call you slave consider that it be possible that he do not hear and if he do hear that he will do nothing which you wish but matter be not so well with he but altogether well with you that it should be in he power for you to be not disturbed xiii if you would improve submit to be consider without sense and foolish with respect to externals wish to be consider to know nothing and if you shall seem to some to be a person of importance distrust yourself for you should know that it be not easy both to keep you will in a condition conformable to nature and -lrb- to secure -rrb- external thing : but if a man be careful about the one it be a absolute necessity that he will neglect the other xiv if you would have you child and you wife and you friend to live for ever you be silly for you would have the thing which be not in you power to be in you power and the thing which belong to other to be yours so if you would have you slave to be free from fault you be a fool for you would have badness not to be badness but something else but if you wish not to fail in you desire you be able to do that practice then this which you be able to do he be the master of every man who have the power over the thing which another person wish or do not wish the power to confer they on he or to take they away whoever then wish to be free let he neither wish for anything nor avoid anything which depend on other : if he do not observe this rule he must be a slave xv remember that in life you ought to behave as at a banquet suppose that something be carry round and be opposite to you stretch out you hand and take a portion with decency suppose that it pass by you do not detain it suppose that it be not yet come to you do not send you desire forward to it but wait till it be opposite to you do so with respect to child so with respect to a wife so with respect to magisterial office so with respect to wealth and you will be some time a worthy partner of the banquet of the god but if you take none of the thing which be set before you and even despise they then you will be not only a fellow banqueter with the god but also a partner with they in power for by act thus diogene and heracleitus and those like they be deservedly divine and be so call xvi when you see a person weep in sorrow either when a child go abroad or when he be dead or when the man have lose he property take care that the appearance do not hurry you away with it as if he be suffer in external thing but straightway make a distinction in you own mind and be in readiness to say it be not that which have happen that afflict this man for it do not afflict another but it be the opinion about this thing which afflict the man so far as word then do not be unwilling to show he sympathy and even if it happen so to lament with he but take care that you do not lament internally also xvii remember that thou art a actor in a play of such a kind as the teacher -lrb- author -rrb- may choose if short of a short one if long of a long one : if he wish you to act the part of a poor man see that you act the part naturally if the part of a lame man of a magistrate of a private person -lrb- do the same -rrb- for this be you duty to act well the part that be give to you but to select the part belong to another xviii when a raven have croak inauspiciously let not the appearance hurry you away with it but straightway make a distinction in you mind and say none of these thing be signify to I but either to my poor body or to my small property or to my reputation or to my child or to my wife : but to I all signification be auspicious if i choose for whatever of these thing result it be in my power to derive benefit from it xix you can be invincible if you enter into no contest in which it be not in you power to conquer take care then when you observe a man honor before other or possess of great power or highly esteem for any reason not to suppose he happy and be not carry away by the appearance for if the nature of the good be in we power neither envy nor jealousy will have a place in we but you yourself will not wish to be a general or senator -lrb- -lrb- greek : prutani -rrb- -rrb- or consul but a free man : and there be only one way to this to despise -lrb- care not for -rrb- the thing which be not in we power xx remember that it be not he who revile you or strike you who insult you but it be you opinion about these thing as be insulting when then a man irritate you you must know that it be you own opinion which have irritated you therefore especially try not to be carry away by the appearance for if you once gain time and delay you will more easily master yourself xxi let death and exile and every other thing which appear dreadful be daily before you eye but most of all death : and you will never think of anything mean nor will you desire anything extravagantly xxii if you desire philosophy prepare yourself from the begin to be ridicule to expect that many will sneer at you and say he have all at once return to we as a philosopher and whence do he get this supercilious look for we do you not show a supercilious look but hold on to the thing which seem to you best as one appoint by god to this station and remember that if you abide in the same principle these man who first ridicule will afterwards admire you but if you shall have be overpower by they you will bring on yourself double ridicule xxiii if it should ever happen to you to be turn to externals in order to please some person you must know that you have lose you purpose in life be satisfied then in everything with be a philosopher and if you wish to seem also to any person to be a philosopher appear so to yourself and you will be able to do this xxiv let not these thought afflict you i shall live unhonored and be nobody nowhere for if want of honor -lrb- -lrb- greek : atimium -rrb- -rrb- be a evil you can not be in evil through the means -lrb- fault -rrb- of another any more than you can be involve in anything base be it then you business to obtain the rank of a magistrate or to be receive at a banquet by no means how then can this be want of honor -lrb- dishonor -rrb- and how will you be nobody nowhere when you ought to be somebody in those thing only which be in you power in which indeed it be permit to you to be a man of the greatest worth but you friend will be without assistance what do you mean by be without assistance they will not receive money from you nor will you make they roman citizen who then tell you that these be among the thing which be in we power and not in the power of other and who can give to another what he have not himself acquire money then you friend say that we also may have something if i can acquire money and also keep myself modest and faithful and magnanimous point out the way and i will acquire it but if you ask I to lose the thing which be good and my own in order that you may gain the thing which be not good see how unfair and silly you be besides which would you rather have money or a faithful and modest friend for this end then rather help I to be such a man and do not ask I to do this by which i shall lose that character but my country you say as far as it depend on I will be without my help i ask again what help do you mean it will not have portico or bath through you and what do this mean for it be not furnish with shoe by means of a smith nor with arm by means of a shoemaker but it be enough if every man fully discharge the work that be he own : and if you provide it with another citizen faithful and modest would you not be useful to it yes then you also can not be useless to it what place then you say shall i hold in the city whatever you can if you maintain at the same time you fidelity and modesty but if when you wish to be useful to the state you shall lose these quality what profit could you be to it if you be make shameless and faithless xxv have any man be prefer before you at a banquet or in be salute or in be invite to a consultation if these thing be good you ought to rejoice that he have obtain they but if bad be not grieve because you have not obtain they and remember that you can not if you do not the same thing in order to obtain what be not in we own power be consider worthy of the same -lrb- equal -rrb- thing for how can a man obtain a equal share with another when he do not visit a man 's door as that other man do when he do not attend he when he go abroad as the other man do when he do not praise -lrb- flatter -rrb- he as another do you will be unjust then and insatiable if you do not part with the price in return for which those thing be sell and if you wish to obtain they for nothing well what be the price of lettuce a obolus perhaps if then a man give up the obolus and receive the lettuce and if you do not give up the obolus and do not obtain the lettuce do not suppose that you receive less than he who have get the lettuce for as he have the lettuce so you have the obolus which you do not give in the same way then in the other matter also you have not be invite to a man 's feast for you do not give to the host the price at which the supper be sell but he sell it for praise -lrb- flattery -rrb- he sell it for personal attention give then the price if it be for you interest for which it be sell but if you wish both not to give the price and to obtain the thing you be insatiable and silly have you nothing then in place of the supper you have indeed you have the not flattering of he whom you do not choose to flatter you have the not endure of the man when he enter the room xxvi we may learn the wish -lrb- will -rrb- of nature from the thing in which we do not differ from one another : for instance when you neighbor 's slave have break he cup or anything else we be ready to say forthwith that it be one of the thing which happen you must know then that when you cup also be break you ought to think as you do when you neighbor 's cup be break transfer this reflection to greater thing also be another man 's child or wife dead there be no one who would not say this be a event incident to man but when a man 's own child or wife be dead forthwith he call out woe to I how wretched i be but we ought to remember how we feel when we hear that it have happen to other xxvii as a mark be not set up for the purpose of miss the aim so neither do the nature of evil exist in the world xxviii if any person be intend to put you body in the power of any man whom you fall in with on the way you would be vex but that you put you understanding in the power of any man whom you meet so that if he should revile you it be disturbed and troubled be you not ashamed at this xxix in every act observe the thing which come first and those which follow it and so proceed to the act if you do not at first you will approach it with alacrity without have think of the thing which will follow but afterwards when certain base -lrb- ugly -rrb- thing have show themselves you will be ashamed a man wish to conquer at the olympic game i also wish indeed for it be a fine thing but observe both the thing which come first and the thing which follow and then begin the act you must do everything accord to rule eat accord to strict order abstain from delicacy exercise yourself as you be bid at appoint time in heat in cold you must not drink cold water nor wine as you choose in a word you must deliver yourself up to the exercise master as you do to the physician and then proceed to the contest and sometimes you will strain the hand put the ankle out of joint swallow much dust sometimes be flog and after all this be defeat when you have consider all this if you still choose go to the contest : if you do not you will behave like child who at one time play at wrestler another time as flute player again as gladiator then as trumpeter then as tragic actor so you also will be at one time a athlete at another a gladiator then a rhetorician then a philosopher but with you whole soul you will be nothing at all but like a ape you imitate everything that you see and one thing after another please you for you have not undertake anything with consideration nor have you survey it well but carelessly and with cold desire thus some who have see a philosopher and have hear one speak as euphrate speak -- and who can speak as he do -- they wish to be philosopher themselves also my man first of all consider what kind of thing it be and then examine you own nature if you be able to sustain the character do you wish to be a pentathlete or a wrestler look at you arm you thigh examine you loin for different man be form by nature for different thing do you think that if you do these thing you can eat in the same manner drink in the same manner and in the same manner loathe certain thing you must pass sleepless night endure toil go away from you kinsman be despise by a slave in everything have the inferior part in honor in office in the court of justice in every little matter consider these thing if you would exchange for they freedom from passion liberty tranquillity if not take care that like little child you be not now a philosopher then a servant of the publicanus then a rhetorician then a procurator -lrb- manager -rrb- for cæsar these thing be not consistent you must be one man either good or bad you must either cultivate you own ruling faculty or external thing you must either exercise you skill on internal thing or on external thing that be you must either maintain the position of a philosopher or that of a common person xxx duty be universally measure by relation -lrb- -lrb- greek : tais schsesi -rrb- -rrb- be a man a father the precept be to take care of he to yield to he in all thing to submit when he be reproachful when he inflict blow but suppose that he be a bad father be you then by nature make akin to a good father no but to a father do a brother wrong you maintain then you own position towards he and do not examine what he be do but what you must do that you will shall be conformable to nature for another will not damage you unless you choose : but you will be damage then when you shall think that you be damage in this way then you will discover you duty from the relation of a neighbor from that of a citizen from that of a general if you be accustom to contemplate the relation xxxi as to piety towards the god you must know that this be the chief thing to have right opinion about they to think that they exist and that they administer the all well and justly and you must fix yourself in this principle -lrb- duty -rrb- to obey they and to yield to they in everything which happen and voluntarily to follow it as be accomplish by the wisest intelligence for if you do so you will never either blame the god nor will you accuse they of neglect you and it be not possible for this to be do in any other way than by withdraw from the thing which be not in we power and by place the good and the evil only in those thing which be in we power for if you think that any of the thing which be not in we power be good or bad it be absolutely necessary that when you do not obtain what you wish and when you fall into those thing which you do not wish you will find fault and hate those who be the cause of they for every animal be form by nature to this to fly from and to turn from the thing which appear harmful and the thing which be the cause of the harm but to follow and admire the thing which be useful and the cause of the useful it be impossible then for a person who think that he be harm to be delighted with that which he think to be the cause of the harm as it be also impossible to be please with the harm itself for this reason also a father be revile by he son when he give no part to he son of the thing which be consider to be good and it be this which make polynice and eteocle enemy the opinion that royal power be a good it be for this reason that the cultivator of the earth revile the god for this reason the sailor do and the merchant and for this reason those who lose they wife and they child for where the useful -lrb- you interest -rrb- be there also piety be consequently he who take care to desire as he ought and to avoid -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlinein -rrb- -rrb- as he ought at the same time also care after piety but to make libation and to sacrifice and to offer first-fruits accord to the custom of we father purely and not meanly nor carelessly nor scantily nor above we ability be a thing which belong to all to do xxxii when you have recourse to divination remember that you do not know how it will turn out but that you be come to inquire from the diviner but of what kind it be you know when you come if indeed you be a philosopher for if it be any of the thing which be not in we power it be absolutely necessary that it must be neither good nor bad do not then bring to the diviner desire or aversion -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlinein -rrb- -rrb- : if you do you will approach he with fear but have determine in you mind that everything which shall turn out -lrb- result -rrb- be indifferent and do not concern you and whatever it may be for it will be in you power to use it well and no man will hinder this come then with confidence to the god as you adviser and then when any advice shall have be give remember whom you have take as adviser and whom you will have neglect if you do not obey they and go to divination as socrate say that you ought about those matter in which all the inquiry have reference to the result and in which mean be not give either by reason nor by any other art for know the thing which be the subject of the inquiry wherefore when we ought to share a friend 's danger or that of we country you must not consult the diviner whether you ought to share it for even if the diviner shall tell you that the sign of the victim be unlucky it be plain that this be a token of death or mutilation of part of the body or of exile but reason prevail that even with these risk we should share the danger of we friend and of we country therefore attend to the greater diviner the pythian god who eject from the temple he who do not assist he friend when he be be murder xxxiii immediately prescribe some character and some form to yourself which you shall observe both when you be alone and when you meet with man and let silence be the general rule or let only what be necessary be say and in few word and rarely and when the occasion call we shall say something but about none of the common subject not about gladiator nor horse-race nor about athlete nor about eat or drink which be the usual subject and especially not about man as blame they or praise they or compare they if then you be able bring over by you conversation the conversation of you associate to that which be proper but if you should happen to be confine to the company of stranger be silent let not you laughter be much nor on many occasion nor excessive refuse altogether to take a oath if it be possible if it be not refuse as far as you be able avoid banquet which be give by stranger and by ignorant person but if ever there be occasion to join in they let you attention be carefully fix that you slip not into the manners of the vulgar -lrb- the uninstructed -rrb- for you must know that if you companion be impure he also who keep company with he must become impure though he should happen to be pure take -lrb- apply -rrb- the thing which relate to the body as far as the bare use as food drink clothing house and slave but exclude everything which be for show or luxury as to pleasure with woman abstain as far as you can before marriage but if you do indulge in it do it in the way which be conformable to custom do not however be disagreeable to those who indulge in these pleasure or reprove they and do not often boast that you do not indulge in they yourself if a man have report to you that a certain person speak ill of you do not make any defense -lrb- answer -rrb- to what have be tell you but reply the man do not know the rest of my fault for he would not have mention these only it be not necessary to go to the theater often : but if there be ever a proper occasion for go do not show yourself as be a partisan of any man except yourself that be desire only that to be do which be do and for he only to gain the prize who gain the prize for in this way you will meet with no hindrance but abstain entirely from shout and laughter at any -lrb- thing or person -rrb- or violent emotion and when you be come away do not talk much about what have pass on the stage except about that which may lead to you own improvement for it be plain if you do talk much that you admire the spectacle -lrb- more than you ought -rrb- do not go to the hearing of certain person ' recitation nor visit they readily but if you do attend observe gravity and sedateness and also avoid make yourself disagreeable when you be go to meet with any person and particularly one of those who be consider to be in a superior condition place before yourself what socrate or zeno would have do in such circumstance and you will have no difficulty in make a proper use of the occasion when you be go to any of those who be in great power place before yourself that you will not find the man at home that you will be exclude that the door will not be open to you that the man will not care about you and if with all this it be you duty to visit he bear what happen and never say to yourself that it be not worth the trouble for this be silly and mark the character of a man who be offend by externals in company take care not to speak much and excessively about you own act or danger for as it be pleasant to you to make mention of you own danger it be not so pleasant to other to hear what have happen to you take care also not to provoke laughter for this be a slippery way towards vulgar habit and be also adapt to diminish the respect of you neighbor it be a dangerous habit also to approach obscene talk when then anything of this kind happen if there be a good opportunity rebuke the man who have proceed to this talk but if there be not a opportunity by you silence at least and blush and expression of dissatisfaction by you countenance show plainly that you be displeased at such talk xxxiv if you have receive the impression -lrb- -lrb- greek : phantasion -rrb- -rrb- of any pleasure guard yourself against be carry away by it but let the thing wait for you and allow yourself a certain delay on you own part then think of both time of the time when you will enjoy the pleasure and of the time after the enjoyment of the pleasure when you will repent and will reproach yourself and set against these thing how you will rejoice if you have abstain from the pleasure and how you will commend yourself but if it seem to you seasonable to undertake -lrb- do -rrb- the thing take care that the charm of it and the pleasure and the attraction of it shall not conquer you but set on the other side the consideration how much better it be to be conscious that you have gain this victory xxxv when you have decide that a thing ought to be do and be do it never avoid be see do it though the many shall form a unfavorable opinion about it for if it be not right to do it avoid do the thing but if it be right why be you afraid of those who shall find fault wrongly xxxvi as the proposition it be either day or it be night be of great importance for the disjunctive argument but for the conjunctive be of no value so in a symposium -lrb- entertainment -rrb- to select the larger share be of great value for the body but for the maintenance of the social feeling be worth nothing when then you be eat with another remember to look not only to the value for the body of the thing set before you but also to the value of the behavior towards the host which ought to be observe xxxvii if you have assume a character above you strength you have both act in this manner in a unbecoming way and you have neglect that which you might have fulfil xxxviii in walk about as you take care not to step on a nail or to sprain you foot so take care not to damage you own ruling faculty and if we observe this rule in every act we shall undertake this act with more security xxxix the measure of possession -lrb- property -rrb- be to every man the body as the foot be of the shoe if then you stand on this rule -lrb- the demand of the body -rrb- you will maintain the measure but if you pass beyond it you must then of necessity be hurry as it be down a precipice as also in the matter of the shoe if you go beyond the -lrb- necessity of the -rrb- foot the shoe be gilded then of a purple color then embroider for there be no limit to that which have once pass the true measure xl woman forthwith from the age of fourteen be call by the man mistress -lrb- -lrb- greek : churiaus -rrb- dominæ -rrb- therefore since they see that there be nothing else that they can obtain but only the power of lie with man they begin to decorate themselves and to place all they hope in this it be worth we while then to take care that they may know that they be value -lrb- by man -rrb- for nothing else than appear -lrb- be -rrb- decent and modest and discreet xli it be a mark of a mean capacity to spend much time on the thing which concern the body such as much exercise much eating much drinking much easing of the body much copulation but these thing should be do as subordinate thing and let all you care be direct to the mind xlii when any person treat you ill or speak ill of you remember that he do this or say this because he think that it be he duty it be not possible then for he to follow that which seem right to you but that which seem right to himself accordingly if he be wrong in he opinion he be the person who be hurt for he be the person who have be deceive for if a man shall suppose the true conjunction to be false it be not the conjunction which be hinder but the man who have be deceive about it if you proceed then from these opinion you will be mild in temper to he who revile you for say on each occasion it seem so to he xliii everything have two handle the one by which it may be bear the other by which it may not if you brother act unjustly do not lay hold of the act by that handle wherein he act unjustly for this be the handle which can not be bear but lay hold of the other that he be you brother that he be nurture with you and you will lay hold of the thing by that handle by which it can be bear xliv these reasoning do not cohere : i be richer than you therefore i be better than you i be more eloquent than you therefore i be better than you on the contrary these rather cohere : i be richer than you therefore my possession be greater than yours i be more eloquent than you therefore my speech be superior to yours but you be neither possession nor speech xlv do a man bathe quickly -lrb- early -rrb- do not say that he bathe badly but that he bathe quickly do a man drink much wine do not say that he do this badly but say that he drink much for before you shall have determine the opinion how do you know whether he be act wrong thus it will not happen to you to comprehend some appearance which be capable of be comprehend but to assent to other xlvi on no occasion call yourself a philosopher and do not speak much among the uninstructed about theorem -lrb- philosophical rule precept -rrb- but do that which follow from they for example at a banquet do not say how a man ought to eat but eat as you ought to eat for remember that in this way socrate also altogether avoid ostentation person use to come to he and ask to be recommend by he to philosopher and he use to take they to philosopher so easily do he submit to be overlook accordingly if any conversation should arise among uninstructed person about any theorem generally be silent for there be great danger that you will immediately vomit up what you have not digest and when a man shall say to you that you know nothing and you be not vex then be sure that you have begin the work -lrb- of philosophy -rrb- for even sheep do not vomit up they grass and show to the shepherd how much they have eat but when they have internally digest the pasture they produce externally wool and milk do you also show not you theorem to the uninstructed but show the act which come from they digestion xlvii when at a small cost you be supply with everything for the body do not be proud of this nor if you drink water say on every occasion i drink water but consider first how much more frugal the poor be than we and how much more endure of labor and if you ever wish to exercise yourself in labor and endurance do it for yourself and not for other do not embrace statue but if you be ever very thirsty take a draught of cold water and spit it out and tell no man xlviii the condition and characteristic of a uninstructed person be this : he never expect from himself profit -lrb- advantage -rrb- nor harm but from externals the condition and characteristic of a philosopher be this : he expect all advantage and all harm from himself the sign -lrb- mark -rrb- of one who be make progress be these : he censure no man he praise no man he blame no man he accuse no man he say nothing about himself as if he be somebody or know something when he be impede at all or hinder he blame himself if a man praise he he ridicule the praiser to himself if a man censure he he make no defense he go about like weak person be careful not to move any of the thing which be place before they be firmly fix he remove all desire from himself and he transfer aversion -lrb- -lrb- greek : echchlisin -rrb- -rrb- to those thing only of the thing within we power which be contrary to nature he employ a moderate movement towards everything whether he be consider foolish or ignorant he care not and in a word he watch himself as if he be a enemy and lie in ambush xlix when a man be proud because he can understand and explain the writings of chrysippus say to yourself if chrysippus have not write obscurely this man would have have nothing to be proud of but what be it that i wish to understand nature and to follow it i inquire therefore who be the interpreter and when i have hear that it be chrysippus i come to he -lrb- the interpreter -rrb- but i do not understand what be write and therefore i seek the interpreter and so far there be yet nothing to be proud of but when i shall have find the interpreter the thing that remain be to use the precept -lrb- the lesson -rrb- this itself be the only thing to be proud of but if i shall admire the exposition what else have i be make unless a grammarian instead of a philosopher except in one thing that i be explain chrysippus instead of homer when then any man say to I read chrysippus to I i rather blush when i can not show my act like to and consistent with he word l whatever thing -lrb- rule -rrb- be propose to you -lrb- for the conduct of life -rrb- abide by they as if they be law as if you would be guilty of impiety if you transgress any of they and whatever any man shall say about you do not

-lrb- rule -rrb- which it be you duty to agree to and have you agree to they what teacher then do you still expect that you defer to he the correction of yourself you be no longer a youth but already a full-grown man if then you be negligent and slothful and be continually make procrastination after procrastination and proposal -lrb- intention -rrb- after proposal and fix day after day after which you will attend to yourself you will not know that you be not make improvement but you will continue ignorant -lrb- uninstructed -rrb- both while you live and till you die immediately then think it right to live as a full-grown man and one who be make proficiency and let everything which appear to you to be the best be to you a law which must not be transgress and if anything laborious or pleasant or glorious or inglorious be present to you remember that now be the contest now be the olympic game and they can not be defer and that it depend on one defeat and one give way that progress
