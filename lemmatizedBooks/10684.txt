that thought be free a man can never be hinder from think whatever he choose so long as he conceal what he think the working of he mind be limit only by the bound of he experience and the power of he imagination but this natural liberty of private thinking be of little value it be unsatisfactory and even painful to the thinker himself if he be not permit to communicate he thought to other and it be obviously of no value to he neighbor moreover it be extremely difficult to hide thought that have any power over the mind if a man 's thinking lead he to call in question idea and custom which regulate the behavior of those about he to reject belief which they hold to see better way of life than those they follow it be almost -lrb- 8 -rrb- impossible for he if he be convince of the truth of he own reasoning not to betray by silence chance word or general attitude that he be different from they and do not share they opinion some have prefer like socrate some would prefer to-day to face death rather than conceal they thought thus freedom of think in any valuable sense include freedom of speech at present in the most civilized country freedom of speech be take as a matter of course and seem a perfectly simple thing we be so accustomed to it that we look on it as a natural right but this right have be acquire only in quite recent time and the way to its attainment have lie through lake of blood it have take century to persuade the most enlighten people that liberty to publish one 's opinion and to discuss all question be a good and not a bad thing human society -lrb- there be some brilliant exception -rrb- have be generally oppose to freedom of thought or in other word to new idea and it be easy to see why the average brain be naturally lazy and tend to take the line of least resistance the mental world of the ordinary man consist of belief which he have accept without question and to which he be firmly attach he be instinctively hostile to anything which -lrb- 9 -rrb- would upset the established order of this familiar world a new idea inconsistent with some of the belief which he hold mean the necessity of rearrange he mind and this process be laborious require a painful expenditure of brain-energy to he and he fellow who form the vast majority new idea and opinion which cast doubt on established belief and institution seem evil because they be disagreeable the repugnance due to mere mental laziness be increase by a positive feeling of fear the conservative instinct harden into the conservative doctrine that the foundation of society be endanger by any alteration in the structure it be only recently that man have be abandon the belief that the welfare of a state depend on rigid stability and on the preservation of its tradition and institution unchanged wherever that belief prevail novel opinion be feel to be dangerous as well as annoying and any one who ask inconvenient question about the why and the wherefore of accept principle be consider a pestilent person the conservative instinct and the conservative doctrine which be its consequence be strengthen by superstition if the social structure include the whole body of custom and opinion be associate intimately -lrb- 10 -rrb- with religious belief and be suppose to be under divine patronage criticism of the social order savor of impiety while criticism of the religious belief be a direct challenge to the wrath of supernatural power the psychological motive which produce a conservative spirit hostile to new idea be reinforce by the active opposition of certain powerful section of the community such as a class a caste or a priesthood whose interest be bind up with the maintenance of the established order and the idea on which it rest let we suppose for instance that a people believe that solar eclipse be sign employ by they deity for the special purpose of communicate useful information to they and that a clever man discover the true cause of eclipse he compatriot in the first place dislike he discovery because they find it very difficult to reconcile with they other idea in the second place it disturb they because it upset a arrangement which they consider highly advantageous to they community finally it frighten they as a offence to they divinity the priest one of whose function be to interpret the divine sign be alarmed and enraged at a doctrine which menace they power in prehistoric day these motive operating -lrb- 11 -rrb- strongly must have make change slow in community which progress and hinder some community from progress at all but they have continue to operate more or less throughout history obstruct knowledge and progress we can observe they at work to-day even in the most advanced society where they have no longer the power to arrest development or repress the publication of revolutionary opinion we still meet people who consider a new idea a annoyance and probably a danger of those to whom socialism be repugnant how many be there who have never examine the argument for and against it but turn away in disgust simply because the notion disturb they mental universe and imply a drastic criticism on the order of thing to which they be accustomed and how many be there who would refuse to consider any proposal for alter we imperfect matrimonial institution because such a idea offend a mass of prejudice associate with religious sanction they may be right or not but if they be it be not they fault they be actuate by the same motive which be a bar to progress in primitive society the existence of people of this mentality rear in a atmosphere of freedom side by side with other who be always look out for new idea and -lrb- 12 -rrb- regret that there be not more about enable we to realize how when public opinion be form by the view of such man think be fetter and the impediment to knowledge enormous although the liberty to publish one 's opinion on any subject without regard to authority or the prejudice of one 's neighbor be now a well - established principle i imagine that only the minority of those who would be ready to fight to the death rather than surrender it could defend it on rational grounds we be apt to take for grant that freedom of speech be a natural and inalienable birthright of man and perhaps to think that this be a sufficient answer to all that can be say on the other side but it be difficult to see how such a right can be establish if a man have any `` natural rights '' the right to preserve he life and the right to reproduce he kind be certainly such yet human society impose upon they member restriction in the exercise of both these rights a starving man be prohibit from take food which belong to somebody else promiscuous reproduction be restrict by various law or custom it be admit that society be justified in restrict these elementary rights because without such restriction a order society could not exist if then we -lrb- 13 -rrb- concede that the expression of opinion be a right of the same kind it be impossible to contend that on this ground it can claim immunity from interference or that society act unjustly in regulate it but the concession be too large for whereas in the other case the limitation affect the conduct of every one restriction on freedom of opinion affect only the comparatively small number who have any opinion revolutionary or unconventional to express the truth be that no valid argument can be found on the conception of natural rights because it involve a untenable theory of the relation between society and its member on the other hand those who have the responsibility of govern a society can argue that it be as incumbent on they to prohibit the circulation of pernicious opinion as to prohibit any anti-social action they can argue that a man may do far more harm by propagate anti-social doctrine than by steal he neighbor 's horse or make love to he neighbor 's wife they be responsible for the welfare of the state and if they be convince that a opinion be dangerous by menace the political religious or moral assumption on which the society be base it be they duty to protect society against it as against any other danger -lrb- 14 -rrb- the true answer to this argument for limit freedom of thought will appear in due course it be far from obvious a long time be need to arrive at the conclusion that coercion of opinion be a mistake and only a part of the world be yet convince that conclusion so far as i can judge be the most important ever reach by man it be the issue of a continuous struggle between authority and reason -- the subject of this volume the word authority require some comment if you ask somebody how he know something he may say `` i have it on good authority '' or `` i read it in a book '' or `` it be a matter of common knowledge '' or `` i learn it at school '' any of these reply mean that he have accept information from other trust in they knowledge without verify they statement or think the matter out for himself and the greater part of most man 's knowledge and belief be of this kind take without verification from they parent teacher acquaintance book newspaper when a english boy learn french he take the conjugation and the meaning of the word on the authority of he teacher or he grammar the fact that in a certain place mark on the map there be a populous city call calcutta be for most -lrb- 15 -rrb- people a fact accept on authority so be the existence of napoleon or julius caesar familiar astronomical fact be know only in the same way except by those who have study astronomy it be obvious that every one 's knowledge would be very limited indeed if we be not justified in accept fact on the authority of other but we be justified only under one condition the fact which we can safely accept must be capable of demonstration or verification the example i have give belong to this class the boy can verify when he go to france or be able to read a french book that the fact which he take on authority be true i be confront every day with evidence which prove to I that if i take the trouble i could verify the existence of calcutta for myself i can not convince myself in this way of the existence of napoleon but if i have doubt about it a simple process of reasoning show I that there be host of fact which be incompatible with he non-existence i have no doubt that the earth be some 93 million of mile distant from the sun because all astronomer agree that it have be demonstrate and they agreement be only explicable on the supposition that this have be demonstrate and that if i take the trouble to work out the calculation i should reach the same result -lrb- 16 -rrb- but all we mental furniture be not of this kind the thought of the average man consist not only of fact open to verification but also of many belief and opinion which he have accept on authority and can not verify or prove belief in the trinity depend on the authority of the church and be clearly of a different order from belief in the existence of calcutta we can not go behind the authority and verify or prove it if we accept it we do so because we have such implicit faith in the authority that we credit its assertion though incapable of proof the distinction may seem so obvious as to be hardly worth make but it be important to be quite clear about it the primitive man who have learn from he elder that there be bear in the hill and likewise evil spirit soon verify the former statement by see a bear but if he do not happen to meet a evil spirit it do not occur to he unless he be a prodigy that there be a distinction between the two statement he would rather have argue if he argue at all that as he tribesman be right about the bear they be sure to be right also about the spirit in the middle age a man who believe on authority that there be a city call constantinople and that comet be portent signify divine wrath would not -lrb- 17 -rrb- distinguish the nature of the evidence in the two case you may still sometimes hear argument amount to this : since i believe in calcutta on authority be i not entitle to believe in the devil on authority now people at all time have be command or expect or invite to accept on authority alone -- the authority for instance of public opinion or a church or a sacred book -- doctrine which be not prove or be not capable of proof most belief about nature and man which be not found on scientific observation have serve directly or indirectly religious and social interest and hence they have be protect by force against the criticism of person who have the inconvenient habit of use they reason nobody mind if he neighbor disbelieve a demonstrable fact if a sceptic deny that napoleon exist or that water be compose of oxygen and hydrogen he cause amusement or ridicule but if he deny doctrine which can not be demonstrate such as the existence of a personal god or the immortality of the soul he incur serious disapprobation and at one time he might have be put to death we mediaeval friend would have only be call a fool if he doubt the existence of constantinople but if he have question the significance of comet he -lrb- 18 -rrb- might have get into trouble it be possible that if he have be so mad as to deny the existence of jerusalem he would not have escape with ridicule for jerusalem be mention in the bible in the middle age a large field be cover by belief which authority claim to impose as true and reason be warn off the ground but reason can not recognize arbitrary prohibition or barrier without be untrue to herself the universe of experience be she province and as its part be all link together and interdependent it be impossible for she to recognize any territory on which she may not tread or to surrender any of she rights to a authority whose credentials she have not examine and approve the uncompromising assertion by reason of she absolute rights throughout the whole domain of thought be term rationalism and the slight stigma which be still attach to the word reflect the bitterness of the struggle between reason and the force array against she the term be limit to the field of theology because it be in that field that the self-assertion of reason be most violently and pertinaciously oppose in the same way free think the refusal of think to be control by any authority but its own have a definitely theological reference throughout -lrb- 19 -rrb- the conflict authority have have great advantage at any time the people who really care about reason have be a small minority and probably will be so for a long time to come reason 's only weapon have be argument authority have employ physical and moral violence legal coercion and social displeasure sometimes she have attempt to use the sword of she adversary thereby wound herself indeed the weakest point in the strategical position of authority be that she champion be human could not help make use of reasoning process and the result be that they be divide among themselves this give reason she chance operating as it be in the enemy 's camp and professedly in the enemy 's cause she be prepare she own victory it may be object that there be a legitimate domain for authority consist of doctrine which lie outside human experience and therefore can not be prove or verify but at the same time can not be disprove of course any number of proposition can be invent which can not be disprove and it be open to any one who possess exuberant faith to believe they but no one will maintain that they all deserve credence so long as they falsehood be not demonstrate and if only some deserve credence who except reason -lrb- 20 -rrb- be to decide which if the reply be authority we be confront by the difficulty that many belief back by authority have be finally disprove and be universally abandon yet some people speak as if we be not justified in reject a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false but the burden of proof do not lie upon the rejecter i remember a conversation in which when some disrespectful remark be make about hell a loyal friend of that establishment say triumphantly `` but absurd as it may seem you can not disprove it '' if you be tell that in a certain planet revolve round sirius there be a race of donkey who talk the english language and spend they time in discuss eugenics you could not disprove the statement but would it on that account have any claim to be believe some mind would be prepare to accept it if it be reiterate often enough through the potent force of suggestion this force exercise largely by emphatic repetition -lrb- the theoretical basis as have be observe of the modern practice of advertising -rrb- have play a great part in establish authoritative opinion and propagate religious creed reason fortunately be able to avail herself of the same help the follow sketch be confine to western -lrb- 21 -rrb- civilization it begin with greece and attempt to indicate the chief phase it be the merest introduction to a vast and intricate subject which treat adequately would involve not only the history of religion of the church of heresy of persecution but also the history of philosophy of the natural science and of political theory from the sixteenth century to the french revolution nearly all important historical event bear in some way on the struggle for freedom of think it would require a lifetime to calculate and many book to describe all the direction and interaction of the intellectual and social force which since the fall of ancient civilization have hinder and help the emancipation of reason all one can do all one could do even in a much bigger volume than this be to indicate the general course of the struggle and dwell on some particular aspect which the writer may happen to have specially study -lrb- 21 -rrb- chapter ii reason free -lrb- greece and rome -rrb- when we be ask to specify the debt which civilization owe to the greek they -lrb- 22 -rrb- achievement in literature and art naturally occur to we first of all but a truer answer may be that we deepest gratitude be due to they as the originator of liberty of thought and discussion for this freedom of spirit be not only the condition of they speculation in philosophy they progress in science they experiment in political institution it be also a condition of they literary and artistic excellence they literature for instance could not have be what it be if they have be debar from free criticism of life but apart from what they actually accomplish even if they have not achieve the wonderful thing they do in most of the realm of human activity they assertion of the principle of liberty would place they in the highest rank among the benefactor of the race for it be one of the greatest step in human progress we do not know enough about the earliest history of the greek to explain how it be that they attain they free outlook upon the world and come to possess the will and courage to set no bound to the range of they criticism and curiosity we have to take this character as a fact but it must be remember that the greek consist of a large number of separate people who vary largely in temper custom and tradition -lrb- 23 -rrb- though they have important feature common to all some be conservative or backward or unintellectual compare with other in this chapter `` the greek '' do not mean all the greek but only those who count most in the history of civilization especially the ionian and athenian ionia in asia minor be the cradle of free speculation the history of european science and european philosophy begin in ionium here -lrb- in the sixth and fifth century bc -rrb- the early philosopher by use they reason seek to penetrate into the origin and structure of the world they could not of course free they mind entirely from receive notion but they begin the work of destroy orthodox view and religious faith xenophane may specially be name among these pioneer of thought -lrb- though he be not the most important or the ablest -rrb- because the toleration of he teaching illustrate the freedom of the atmosphere in which these man live he go about from city to city calling in question on moral grounds the popular belief about the god and goddess and ridicule the anthropomorphic conception which the greek have form of they divinity `` if ox have hand and the capacity of man they would make god in the shape of ox '' this attack on receive -lrb- 24 -rrb- theology be a attack on the veracity of the old poet especially homer who be consider the highest authority on mythology xenophane criticize he severely for ascribe to the god act which commit by man would be consider highly disgraceful we do not hear that any attempt be make to restrain he from thus assail traditional belief and brand homer as immoral we must remember that the homeric poem be never suppose to be the word of god it have be say that homer be the bible of the greek the remark exactly miss the truth the greek fortunately have no bible and this fact be both a expression and a important condition of they freedom homer 's poem be secular not religious and it may be note that they be freer from immorality and savagery than sacred book that one could mention they authority be immense but it be not bind like the authority of a sacred book and so homeric criticism be never hamper like biblical criticism in this connexion notice may be take of another expression and condition of freedom the absence of sacerdotalism the priest of the temple never become powerful caste tyrannize over the community in they own interest and able to silence voice raise against religious belief the civil authority -lrb- 25 -rrb- keep the general control of public worship in they own hand and if some priestly family might have considerable influence yet as a rule the priest be virtually state servant whose voice carry no weight except concern the technical detail of ritual to return to the early philosopher who be mostly materialist the record of they speculation be a interesting chapter in the history of rationalism two great name may be select heraclitus and democritus because they do more perhaps than any of the other by sheer hard thinking to train reason to look upon the universe in new way and to shock the unreasoned conception of common sense it be startling to be teach for the first time by heraclitus that the appearance of stability and permanence which material thing present to we sens be a false appearance and that the world and everything in it be change every instant democritus perform the amazing feat of work out a atomic theory of the universe which be revive in the seventeenth century and be connect in the history of speculation with the most modern physical and chemical theory of matter no fantastic tale of creation impose by sacred authority hamper these powerful brain all this philosophical speculation prepared -lrb- 26 -rrb- the way for the educationalist who be know as the sophist they begin to appear after the middle of the fifth century they work here and there throughout greece constantly travel training young man for public life and teach they to use they reason as educator they have practical end in view they turn away from the problem of the physical universe to the problem of human life -- morality and polity here they be confront with the difficulty of distinguish between truth and error and the ablest of they investigate the nature of knowledge the method of reason -- logic -- and the instrument of reason -- speech whatever they particular theory might be they general spirit be that of free inquiry and discussion they seek to test everything by reason the second half of the fifth century might be call the age of illumination it may be remark that the knowledge of foreign country which the greek have acquire have a considerable effect in promote a sceptical attitude towards authority when a man be acquaint only with the habit of he own country they seem so much a matter of course that he ascribe they to nature but when he travel abroad and find totally different habit and standard of conduct prevail he begin to understand -lrb- 27 -rrb- the power of custom and learn that morality and religion be matter of latitude this discovery tend to weaken authority and to raise disquieting reflection as in the case of one who bring up as a christian come to realize that if he have be bear on the gange or the euphrate he would have firmly believe in entirely different dogma of course these movement of intellectual freedom be as in all age confine to the minority everywhere the mass be exceedingly superstitious they believe that the safety of they city depend on the good-will of they god if this superstitious spirit be alarm there be always a danger that philosophical speculation might be persecute and this occur in athen about the middle of the fifth century athen have not only become the most powerful state in greece but be also take the highest place in literature and art she be a full-fledged democracy political discussion be perfectly free at this time she be guide by the statesman pericle who be personally a freethinker or at least be in touch with all the subversive speculation of the day he be especially intimate with the philosopher anaxagora who have come from ionium to teach at athen in regard to the popular god anaxagora be a thorough-going -lrb- 28 -rrb- unbeliever the political enemy of pericle strike at he by attack he friend they introduce and carry a blasphemy law to the effect that unbeliever and those who teach theory about the celestial world might be impeach it be easy to prove that anaxagora be a blasphemer who teach that the god be abstraction and that the sun to which the ordinary athenian say prayer morning and evening be a mass of flaming matter the influence of pericle save he from death he be heavily fine and leave athen for lampsacus where he be treat with consideration and honor other case be record which show that anti-religious thought be liable to be persecute protagora one of the greatest of the sophist publish a book on the god the object of which seem to have be to prove that one can not know the god by reason the first word run : `` concern the god i can not say that they exist nor yet that they do not exist there be more reason than one why we can not know there be the obscurity of the subject and there be the brevity of human life '' a charge of blasphemy be lodge against he and he flee from athen but there be no systematic policy of suppress free thought copy of the work of protagora be collect and -lrb- 29 -rrb- burn but the book of anaxagoras set forth the view for which he have be condemn be for sale on the athenian book-stall at a popular price rationalistic idea moreover be venture to appear on the stage though the dramatic performance at the feast of the god dionysus be religious solemnity the poet euripide be saturate with modern speculation and while different opinion may be hold as to the tendency of some of he tragedy he often allow he character to express highly unorthodox view he be prosecute for impiety by a popular politician we may suspect that during the last thirty year of the fifth century unorthodoxy spread considerably among the educate class there be a large enough section of influential rationalist to render impossible any organize repression of liberty and the chief evil of the blasphemy law be that it could be use for personal or party reason some of the prosecution about which we know be certainly due to such motive other may have be prompt by genuine bigotry and by the fear lest sceptical thought should extend beyond the highly educate and leisured class it be a generally accept principle among the greek and afterwards among the roman that religion be a good and necessary thing -lrb- 30 -rrb- for the common people man who do not believe in its truth believe in its usefulness as a political institution and as a rule philosopher do not seek to diffuse disturbing `` truth '' among the mass it be the custom much more than at the present day for those who do not believe in the established cult to conform to they externally popular higher education be not a article in the program of greek statesman or thinker and perhaps it may be argue that in the circumstance of the ancient world it would have be hardly practicable there be however one illustrious athenian who think differently -- socrate the philosopher socrate be the greatest of the educationalist but unlike the other he teach gratuitously though he be a poor man he teaching always take the form of discussion the discussion often end in no positive result but have the effect of show that some receive opinion be untenable and that truth be difficult to ascertain he have indeed certain definite view about knowledge and virtue which be of the highest importance in the history of philosophy but for we present purpose he significance lie in he enthusiasm for discussion and criticism he teach those with whom he converse -- and he converse indiscriminately -lrb- 31 -rrb- with all who would listen to he -- to bring all popular belief before the bar of reason to approach every inquiry with a open mind and not to judge by the opinion of majority or the dictate of authority in short to seek for other test of the truth of a opinion than the fact that it be hold by a great many people among he disciple be all the young man who be to become the lead philosopher of the next generation and some who play prominent part in athenian history if the athenian have have a daily press socrate would have be denounce by the journalist as a dangerous person they have a comic drama which constantly hold up to ridicule philosopher and sophist and they vain doctrine we possess one play -lrb- the cloud of aristophane -rrb- in which socrate be pillory as a typical representative of impious and destructive speculation apart from annoyance of this kind socrate reach old age pursue the task of instruct he fellow-citizen without any evil befall he then at the age of seventy he be prosecute as a atheist and corrupter of youth and be put to death -lrb- 399 bc -rrb- it be strange that if the athenian really think he dangerous they should have suffer he so long there can i think be -lrb- 32 -rrb- little doubt that the motive of the accusation be political -lrb- 1 -rrb- socrate look at thing as he do could not be sympathetic with unlimited democracy or approve of the principle that the will of the ignorant majority be a good guide he be probably know to sympathize with those who wish to limit the franchise when after a struggle in which the constitution have be more than once overthrow democracy emerge triumphant -lrb- 403 bc -rrb- there be a bitter feeling against those who have not be its friend and of these disloyal person socrate be choose as a victim if he have wish he could easily have escape if he have give a undertaking to teach no more he would almost certainly have be acquit as it be of the 501 ordinary athenian who be he judge a very large minority vote for he acquittal even then if he have adopt a different tone he would not have be condemn to death he rise to the great occasion and vindicate freedom of discussion in a wonderful unconventional speech the apology of socrate which be compose by he most brilliant pupil plato the philosopher reproduce -lrb- 33 -rrb- the general tenor of he defense it be clear that he be not able to meet satisfactorily the charge that he do not acknowledge the god worship by the city and he explanation on this point be the weak part of he speech but he meet the accusation that he corrupt the mind of the young by a splendid plea for free discussion this be the most valuable section of the apology it be as impressive to-day as ever i think the two principal point which he make be these -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- he maintain that the individual should at any cost refuse to be coerce by any human authority or tribunal into a course which he own mind condemn as wrong that be he assert the supremacy of the individual conscience as we should say over human law he represent he own life-work as a sort of religious quest he feel convinced that in devote himself to philosophical discussion he have do the bidding of a super-human guide and he go to death rather than be untrue to this personal conviction `` if you propose to acquit I '' he say `` on condition that i abandon my search for truth i will say : i thank you o athenian but i will obey god who as i believe set I this task rather than you and so long as i have breath and strength i will never -lrb- 34 -rrb- cease from my occupation with philosophy i will continue the practice of accost whomever i meet and say to he ` be you not ashamed of set you heart on wealth and honor while you have no care for wisdom and truth and make you soul better ' i know not what death be -- it may be a good thing and i be not afraid of it but i do know that it be a bad thing to desert one 's post and i prefer what may be good to what i know to be bad '' -lrb- 2 -rrb- he insist on the public value of free discussion `` in I you have a stimulate critic persistently urge you with persuasion and reproach persistently test you opinion and try to show you that you be really ignorant of what you suppose you know daily discussion of the matter about which you hear I converse be the highest good for man life that be not test by such discussion be not worth live '' thus in what we may call the earliest justification of liberty of thought we have two significant claim affirm : the indefeasible right of the conscience of the individual -- a claim on which later struggle for liberty be to turn and the social importance of discussion and criticism the former claim be not base on argument but on intuition it rest in fact on the assumption -lrb- 35 -rrb- of some sort of superhuman moral principle and to those who not have the same personal experience as socrate reject this assumption he plead do not carry weight the second claim after the experience of more than 2000 year can be formulate more comprehensively now with bearing of which he do not dream the circumstance of the trial of socrate illustrate both the tolerance and the intolerance which prevail at athen he long immunity the fact that he be at last indict from political motive and perhaps personal also the large minority in he favor all show that thought be normally free and that the mass of intolerance which exist be only fitfully invoke and perhaps most often to serve other purpose i may mention the case of the philosopher aristotle who some seventy year later leave athen because he be menace by a prosecution for blasphemy the charge be a pretext for attack one who belong to a certain political party the persecution of opinion be never organize it may seem curious that to find the persecute spirit in greece we have to turn to the philosopher plato the most brilliant disciple of socrate construct in he later year a ideal state in this state he institute -lrb- 36 -rrb- a religion considerably different from the current religion and propose to compel all the citizen to believe in he god on pain of death or imprisonment all freedom of discussion be exclude under the cast-iron system which he conceive but the point of interest in he attitude be that he do not care much whether a religion be true but only whether it be morally useful he be prepare to promote morality by edify fable and he condemn the popular mythology not because it be false but because it do not make for righteousness the outcome of the large freedom permit at athen be a series of philosophy which have a common source in the conversation of socrate plato aristotle the stoic the epicurean the sceptic -- it may be maintain that the effort of thought represent by these name have have a deeper influence on the progress of man than any other continuous intellectual movement at least until the rise of modern science in a new epoch of liberty the doctrine of the epicurean stoic and sceptic all aim at secure peace and guidance for the individual soul they be widely propagate throughout the greek world from the third century bc and we may say that from this time onward most -lrb- 37 -rrb- well-educated greek be more or less rationalist the teaching of epicurus have a distinct anti-religious tendency he consider fear to be the fundamental motive of religion and to free man 's mind from this fear be a principal object of he teaching he be a materialist explain the world by the atomic theory of democritus and deny any divine government of the universe -lrb- 2 -rrb- he do indeed hold the existence of god but so far as man be concern he god be as if they be not -- live in some remote abode and enjoy a `` sacred and everlasting calm '' they just serve as a example of the realization of the ideal epicurean life there be something in this philosophy which have the power to inspire a poet of singular genius to expound it in verse the roman lucretius -lrb- first century bc -rrb- regard epicurus as the great deliverer of the human race and determine to proclaim the glad tiding of he philosophy in a poem on the nature of the world -lrb- 3 -rrb- with all the fervor -lrb- 38 -rrb- of a religious enthusiast he denounce religion sound every note of defiance loathing and contempt and branding in burn word the crime to which it have urge man on he ride forth as a leader of the host of atheism against the wall of heaven he explain the scientific argument as if they be the radiant revelation of a new world and the rapture of he enthusiasm be a strange accompaniment of a doctrine which aim at perfect calm although the greek thinker have do all the work and the latin poem be a hymn of triumph over prostrate deity yet in the literature of free thought it must always hold a eminent place by the sincerity of its audacious defiant spirit in the history of rationalism its interest would be greater if it have explode in the midst of a orthodox community but the educate roman in the day of lucretius be sceptical in religious matter some of they be epicurean and we may suspect that not many of those who read it be shock or influence by the audacity of the champion of irreligion the stoic philosophy make notable contribution to the cause of liberty and could hardly have flourish in a atmosphere where discussion be not free it assert the rights of individual against public -lrb- 39 -rrb- authority socrate have see that law may be unjust and that people may go wrong but he have find no principle for the guidance of society the stoic discover it in the law of nature prior and superior to all the custom and write law of people and this doctrine spreading outside stoic circle catch hold of the roman world and affect roman legislation these philosophy have carry we from greece to rome in the later roman republic and the early empire no restriction be impose on opinion and these philosophy which make the individual the first consideration spread widely most of the lead man be unbeliever in the official religion of the state but they consider it valuable for the purpose of keep the uneducated populace in order a greek historian express high approval of the roman policy of cultivate superstition for the benefit of the mass this be the attitude of cicero and the view that a false religion be indispensable as a social machine be general among ancient unbeliever it be common in one form or another to-day at least religion be constantly defend on the ground not of truth but of utility this defense belong to the statecraft of machiavellus who teach that religion be necessary for government -lrb- 40 -rrb- and that it may be the duty of a ruler to support a religion which he believe to be false a word must be say of lucian -lrb- second century ad -rrb- the last greek man of letter whose writings appeal to everybody he attack the popular mythology with open ridicule it be impossible to say whether he satire have any effect at the time beyond afford enjoyment to educate infidel who read they zeus in a tragedy part be one of the most effective the situation which lucian imagine here would be parallel if a modern writer be blasphemously to represent the person of the trinity with some eminent angel and saint discuss in a celestial smoke-room the alarming growth of unbelief in england and then by means of a telephonic apparatus overhear a dispute between a freethinker and a parson on a public platform in london the absurdity of anthropomorphism have never be the subject of more brilliant jesting than in lucian 's satire the general rule of roman policy be to tolerate throughout the empire all religion and all opinion blasphemy be not punish the principle be express in the maxim of the emperor tiberius : `` if the god be insult let they see to it themselves '' a exception to the rule of tolerance -lrb- 41 -rrb- be make in the case of the christian sect and the treatment of this oriental religion may be say to have inaugurate religious persecution in europe it be a matter of interest to understand why emperor who be able humane and not in the least fanatical adopt this exceptional policy for a long time the christian be only know to those roman who happen to hear of they as a sect of the jew the jewish be the one religion which on account of its exclusiveness and intolerance be regard by the tolerant pagan with disfavor and suspicion but though it sometimes come into collision with the roman authority and some ill-advised attack upon it be make it be the constant policy of the emperor to let it alone and to protect the jew against the hatred which they own fanaticism arouse but while the jewish religion be endure so long as it be confine to those who be bear into it the prospect of its dissemination raise a new question grave misgiving might arise in the mind of a ruler at see a creed spreading which be aggressively hostile to all the other creed of the world -- creed which live together in amity -- and have earn for its adherent the reputation of be the enemy of the human race might not its expansion -lrb- 42 -rrb- beyond the israelite involve ultimately a danger to the empire for its spirit be incompatible with the tradition and basis of roman society the emperor domitian seem to have see the question in this light and he take severe measure to hinder the proselytizing of roman citizen some of those whom he strike may have be christian but if he be aware of the distinction there be from he point of view no difference christianity resemble judaism from which it spring in intolerance and in hostility towards roman society but it differ by the fact that it make many proselyte while judaism make few under trajan we find that the principle have be lay down that to be a christian be a offence punishable by death henceforward christianity remain a illegal religion but in practice the law be not apply rigorously or logically the emperor desire if possible to extirpate christianity without shed blood trajan lay down that christian be not to be seek out that no anonymous charge be to be notice and that a informer who fail to make good he charge should be liable to be punish under the law against calumny christian themselves recognize that this edict practically protect they there be -lrb- 43 -rrb- some execution in the second century -- not many that be well attest -- and christian court the pain and glory of martyrdom there be evidence to show that when they be arrest they escape be often connive at in general the persecution of the christian be rather provoke by the populace than desire by the authority the populace feel a horror of this mysterious oriental sect which openly hate all the god and pray for the destruction of the world when flood famine and especially fire occur they be apt to be attribute to the black magic of the christian when any one be accuse of christianity he be require as a means of test the truth of the charge to offer incense to the god or to the statue of deified emperor he compliance at once exonerate he the objection of the christian -- they and the jew be the only objector -- to the worship of the emperor be in the eye of the roman one of the most sinister sign that they religion be dangerous the purpose of this worship be to symbolize the unity and solidarity of a empire which embrace so many people of different belief and different god its intention be political to promote union and loyalty and it be not surprising that those who denounce it should -lrb- 44 -rrb- be suspect of a disloyal spirit but it must be note that there be no necessity for any citizen to take part in this worship no conformity be require from any inhabitant of the empire who be not serve the state as soldier or civil functionary thus the effect be to debar christian from military and official career the apology for christianity which appear at this period -lrb- second century -rrb- might have help if the emperor -lrb- to whom some of they be address -rrb- have read they to confirm the view that it be a political danger it would have be easy to read between the line that if the christian ever get the upper hand they would not spare the cult of the state the contemporary work of tatian -lrb- a discourse to the greek -rrb- reveal what the apologist more or less seek to disguise invincible hatred towards the civilization in which they live any reader of the christian literature of the time could not fail to see that in a state where christian have the power there would be no tolerance of other religious practice -lrb- 4 -rrb- if the emperor make a exception to they tolerant policy in the case of christianity they purpose be to safeguard tolerance -lrb- 45 -rrb- in the third century the religion though still forbid be quite openly tolerate the church organize itself without concealment ecclesiastical council assemble without interference there be some brief and local attempt at repression there be only one grave persecution -lrb- begin by decius ad 250 and continue by valerian -rrb- in fact throughout this century there be not many victim though afterwards the christian invent a whole mythology of martyrdom many cruelty be imputed to emperor under whom we know that the church enjoy perfect peace a long period of civil confusion in which the empire seem to be totter to its fall have be terminate by the emperor diocletian who by he radical administrative reform help to preserve the roman power in its integrity for another century he desire to support he work of political consolidation by revive the roman spirit and he attempt to infuse new life into the official religion to this end he determine to suppress the grow influence of the christian who though a minority be very numerous and he organize a persecution it be long cruel and bloody it be the most whole-hearted general and systematic effort to crush the forbid faith it be a -lrb- 46 -rrb- failure the christian be now too numerous to be crush after the abdication of diocletian the emperor who reign in different part of the realm do not agree as to the expediency of he policy and the persecution end by edict of toleration -lrb- ad 311 and 313 -rrb- these document have a interest for the history of religious liberty the first issue in the eastern province run as follow : -- `` we be particularly desirous of reclaim into the way of reason and nature the deluded christian who have renounce the religion and ceremony institute by they father and presumptuously despise the practice of antiquity have invent extravagant law and opinion accord to the dictate of they fancy and have collect a various society from the different province of we empire the edict which we have publish to enforce the worship of the god have expose many of the christian to danger and distress many have suffer death and many more who still persist in they impious folly be leave destitute of any public exercise of religion we be dispose to extend to those unhappy man the effect of we wonted clemency we permit they therefore freely to profess they private opinion and to assemble in they conventicle -lrb- 47 -rrb- without fear or molestation provide always that they preserve a due respect to the established law and government '' -lrb- 5 -rrb- the second of which constantine be the author know as the edict of milan be to a similar effect and base toleration on the emperor 's care for the peace and happiness of he subject and on the hope of appease the deity whose seat be in heaven the relation between the roman government and the christian raise the general question of persecution and freedom of conscience a state with a official religion but perfectly tolerant of all creed and cult find that a society have arise in its midst which be uncompromisingly hostile to all creed but its own and which if it have the power would suppress all but its own the government in self-defence decide to check the dissemination of these subversive idea and make the profession of that creed a crime not on account of its particular tenet but on account of the social consequence of those tenet the member of the society can not without violate they conscience and incur damnation abandon they exclusive doctrine the principle of freedom of conscience be assert as superior to all obligation to the state and the state confront -lrb- 48 -rrb- by this new claim be unable to admit it persecution be the result even from the standpoint of a orthodox and loyal pagan the persecution of the christian be indefensible because blood be shed uselessly in other word it be a great mistake because it be unsuccessful for persecution be a choice between two evil the alternative be violence -lrb- which no reasonable defender of persecution would deny to be a evil in itself -rrb- and the spread of dangerous opinion the first be choose simply to avoid the second on the ground that the second be the greater evil but if the persecution be not so devise and carry out as to accomplish its end then you have two evil instead of one and nothing can justify this from they point of view the emperor have good reason for regard christianity as dangerous and anti-social but they should either have let it alone or take systematic measure to destroy it if at a early stage they have establish a drastic and systematic inquisition they might possibly have exterminate it this at least would have be statesmanlike but they have no conception of extreme measure and they do not understand -- they have no experience to guide they -- the sort of problem they have to deal with they hope to succeed by intimidation -lrb- 49 -rrb- they attempt at suppression be vacillate fitful and ridiculously ineffectual the later persecution -lrb- of ad 250 and 303 -rrb- have no prospect of success it be particularly to be observe that no effort be make to suppress christian literature the higher problem whether persecution even if it attain the desire end be justifiable be not consider the struggle hinge on antagonism between the conscience of the individual and the authority and suppose interest of the state it be the question which have be raise by socrate raise now on a wider platform in a more pressing and formidable shape : what be to happen when obedience to the law be inconsistent with obedience to a invisible master be it incumbent on the state to respect the conscience of the individual at all cost or within what limit the christian do not attempt a solution the general problem do not interest they they claim the right of freedom exclusively for themselves from a non-christian government and it be hardly go too far to suspect that they would have applaud the government if it have suppress the gnostic sect whom they hate and calumniate in any case when a christian state be establish they would completely forget the principle which they -lrb- 50 -rrb- have invoke the martyr die for conscience but not for liberty to-day the greatest of the church demand freedom of conscience in the modern state which she do not control but refuse to admit that where she have the power it would be incumbent on she to concede it if we review the history of classical antiquity as a whole we may almost say that freedom of thought be like the air man breathe it be take for grant and nobody think about it if seven or eight thinker at athen be penalize for heterodoxy in some and perhaps in most of these case heterodoxy be only a pretext they do not invalidate the general fact that the advance of knowledge be not impede by prejudice or science retard by the weight of unscientific authority the educate greek be tolerant because they be friend of reason and do not set up any authority to overrule reason opinion be not impose except by argument you be not expect to receive some `` kingdom of heaven '' like a little child or to prostrate you intellect before a authority claim to be infallible but this liberty be not the result of a conscious policy or deliberate conviction and therefore it be precarious the problem -lrb- 51 -rrb- of freedom of thought religious liberty toleration have not be force upon society and be never seriously consider when christianity confront the roman government no one see that in the treatment of a small obscure and to pagan thinker uninteresting or repugnant sect a principle of the deepest social importance be involve a long experience of the theory and practice of persecution be require to base securely the theory of freedom of think the lurid policy of coercion which the christian church adopt and its consequence would at last compel reason to wrestle with the problem and discover the justification of intellectual liberty the spirit of the greek and roman alive in they work would after a long period of obscuration again enlighten the world and aid in re-establish the reign of reason which they have carelessly enjoy without assure its foundation -lrb- 1 -rrb- this have be show very clearly by professor jackson in the article on `` socrate '' in the encyclopoedium britannica last edition -lrb- 2 -rrb- he state the theological difficulty as to the origin of evil in this form : god either wish to abolish evil and can not or can and will not or neither can nor will or both can and will the first three be unthinkable if he be a god worthy of the name therefore the last alternative must be true why then do evil exist the inference be that there be no god in the sense of a governor of the world -lrb- 3 -rrb- a admirable appreciation of the poem will be find in r v tyrrell 's lecture on latin poetry -lrb- 4 -rrb- for the evidence of the apologist see a bouch-leclercq religious intolerance and politics -lrb- french 1911 -rrb- -- a valuable review of the whole subject -lrb- 5 -rrb- this be gibbon 's translation chapter iii reason in prison -lrb- the middle age -rrb- about ten year after the edict of toleration constantine the great adopted christianity this momentous decision inaugurate -lrb- 52 -rrb- a millennium in which reason be enchain thought be enslave and knowledge make no progress during the two century in which they have be a forbid sect the christian have claim toleration on the ground that religious belief be voluntary and not a thing which can be enforce when they faith become the predominant creed and have the power of the state behind it they abandon this view they embark on the hopeful enterprise of bring about a complete uniformity in man 's opinion on the mystery of the universe and begin a more or less definite policy of coerce think this policy be adopt by emperor and government partly on political grounds religious division bitter as they be seem dangerous to the unity of the state but the fundamental principle lay in the doctrine that salvation be to be find exclusively in the christian church the profound conviction that those who do not believe in its doctrine would be damned eternally and that god punish theological error as if it be the most heinous of crime lead naturally to persecution it be a duty to impose on man the only true doctrine see that they own eternal interest be at stake and to hinder error from spread heretic be more -lrb- 53 -rrb- than ordinary criminal and the pain that man could inflict on they be as nothing to the torture await they in hell to rid the earth of man who however virtuous be through they religious error enemy of the almighty be a plain duty they virtue be no excuse we must remember that accord to the humane doctrine of the christian pagan that be merely human virtue be vice and infant who die unbaptized pass the rest of time in creep on the floor of hell the intolerance arise from such view could not but differ in kind and intensity from anything that the world have yet witness besides the logic of its doctrine the character of its sacred book must also be hold partly accountable for the intolerant principle of the christian church it be unfortunate that the early christian have include in they scripture the jewish writings which reflect the idea of a low stage of civilization and be full of savagery it would be difficult to say how much harm have be do in corrupt the moral of man by the precept and example of inhumanity violence and bigotry which the reverent reader of the old testament implicitly believe in its inspiration be bind to approve it furnish a armoury for the theory of -lrb- 54 -rrb- persecution the truth be that sacred book be a obstacle to moral and intellectual progress because they consecrate the idea of a give epoch and its custom as divinely appoint christianity by adopt book of a long past age place in the path of human development a particularly nasty stumbling-block it may occur to one to wonder how history might have be alter -- altered it surely would have be -- if the christian have cut jehovah out of they program and content with the new testament have reject the inspiration of the old under constantine the great and he successor edict after edict fulminate against the worship of the old pagan god and against heretical christian sect julian the apostate who in he brief reign -lrb- ad 361 -- 3 -rrb- seek to revive the old order of thing proclaim universal toleration but he place christian at a disadvantage by forbid they to teach in school this be only a momentary check paganism be finally shatter by the severe law of theodosius i -lrb- end of fourth century -rrb- it linger on here and there for more than another century especially at rome and athen but have little importance the christian be more concern in strive among themselves than in -lrb- 55 -rrb- crush the prostrate spirit of antiquity the execution of the heretic priscillian in spain -lrb- fourth century -rrb- inaugurate the punishment of heresy by death it be interesting to see a non-christian of this age teach the christian sect that they should suffer one another themistius in a address to the emperor valen urge he to repeal he edict against the christian with whom he do not agree and expound a theory of toleration `` the religious belief of individual be a field in which the authority of a government can not be effective compliance can only lead to hypocritical profession every faith should be allow the civil government should govern orthodox and heterodox to the common good god himself plainly show that he wish various form of worship there be many road by which one can reach he '' no father of the church have be more esteemed or enjoy higher authority than st augustine -lrb- die ad 410 -rrb- he formulate the principle of persecution for the guidance of future generation base it on the firm foundation of scripture -- on word use by jesus christ in one of he parable `` compel they to come in '' till the end of the twelfth century the church work hard to suppress heterodoxy there be much -lrb- 56 -rrb- persecution but it be not systematic there be reason to think that in the pursuit of heresy the church be mainly guide by consideration of its temporal interest and be rouse to severe action only when the spread of false doctrine threaten to reduce its revenue or seem a menace to society at the end of the twelfth century innocent iii become pope and under he the church of western europe reach the height of its power he and he immediate successor be responsible for imagine and begin a organize movement to sweep heretic out of christendom languedoc in southwestern france be largely populate by heretic whose opinion be consider particularly offensive know as the albigeoi they be the subject of the count of toulouse and be a industrious and respectable people but the church get far too little money out of this anti- clerical population and innocent call upon the count to extirpate heresy from he dominion as he would not obey the pope announce a crusade against the albigeoi and offer to all who would bear a hand the usual reward grant to crusader include absolution from all they sin a series of sanguinary war follow in which the englishman simon de montfort take part there be -lrb- 57 -rrb- wholesale burning and hanging of man woman and child the resistance of the people be break down though the heresy be not eradicate and the struggle end in 1229 with the complete humiliation of the count of toulouse the important point of the episode be this : the church introduce into the public law of europe the new principle that a sovran hold he crown on the condition that he should extirpate heresy if he hesitate to persecute at the command of the pope he must be coerce he land be forfeit and he dominion be throw open to be seize by any one whom the church could induce to attack he the pope thus establish a theocratic system in which all other interest be to be subordinate to the grand duty of maintain the purity of the faith but in order to root out heresy it be necessary to discover it in its most secret retreat the albigeoi have be crush but the poison of they doctrine be not yet destroy the organized system of search out heretics know as the inquisition be found by pope gregory ix about ad 1233 and fully establish by a bull of innocent iv -lrb- ad 1252 -rrb- which regulate the machinery of persecution `` as a integral part of the social edifice in every city and every -lrb- 58 -rrb- state '' this powerful engine for the suppression of the freedom of man 's religious opinion be unique in history the bishop be not equal to the new talk undertake by the church and in every ecclesiastical province suitable monk be select and to they be delegate the authority of the pope for discover heretic these inquisitor have unlimited authority they be subject to no supervision and responsible to no man it would not have be easy to establish this system but for the fact that contemporary secular ruler have inaugurate independently a merciless legislation against heresy the emperor frederick ii who be himself undoubtedly a freethinker make law for he extensive dominion in italy and germany -lrb- between 1220 and 1235 -rrb- enact that all heretic should be outlaw that those who do not recant should be burn those who recant should be imprison but if they relapse should be execute that they property should be confiscate they house destroy and they child to the second generation ineligible to position of emolument unless they have betray they father or some other heretic frederick 's legislation consecrate the stake as the proper punishment for heresy this -lrb- 59 -rrb- cruel form of death for that crime seem to have be first inflict on heretic by a french king -lrb- 1017 -rrb- we must remember that in the middle age and much later crime of all kind be punish with the utmost cruelty in england in the reign of henry viii there be a case of prisoner be boil to death heresy be the foulest of all crime and to prevail against it be to prevail against the legion of hell the cruel enactment against heretic be strongly support by the public opinion of the mass when the inquisition be fully develop it cover western christendom with a net from the mesh of which it be difficult for a heretic to escape the inquisitor in the various kingdom co-operate and communicate information there be `` a chain of tribunal throughout continental europe '' england stand outside the system but from the age of henry iv and henry v the government repress heresy by the stake under a special statute -lrb- ad 1400 repeal 1533 revive under mary finally repeal in 1676 -rrb- in its task of impose unity of belief the inquisition be most successful in spain here towards the end of the fifteenth century a system be institute which have peculiarity of its own and be very jealous of -lrb- 60 -rrb- roman interference one of the achievement of the spanish inquisition -lrb- which be not abolish till the nineteenth century -rrb- be to expel the morisco or convert moor who retain many of they old mohammedan opinion and custom it be also say to have eradicate judaism and to have preserve the country from the zeal of protestant missionary but it can not be prove that it deserve the credit of have protect spain against protestantism for it be quite possible that if the seed of protestant opinion have be sow they would in any case have fall dead on a uncongenial soil freedom of thought however be entirely suppress one of the most efficacious means for hunting down heresy be the `` edict of faith '' which enlist the people in the service of the inquisition and require every man to be a informer from time to time a certain district be visit and a edict issue command those who know anything of any heresy to come forward and reveal it under fearful penalty temporal and spiritual in consequence no one be free from the suspicion of he neighbor or even of he own family `` no more ingenious device have be invent to subjugate a whole population to paralyze its intellect and to reduce it -lrb- 61 -rrb- to blind obedience it elevate delation to the rank of high religious duty '' the process employ in the trial of those accuse of heresy in spain reject every reasonable means for the ascertainment of truth the prisoner be assume to be guilty the burden of prove he innocence rest on he he judge be virtually he prosecutor all witness against he however infamous be admit the rule for allow witness for the prosecution be lax those for reject witness for the defense be rigid jew morisco and servant could give evidence against the prisoner but not for he and the same rule apply to kinsman to the fourth degree the principle on which the inquisition proceed be that better a hundred innocent should suffer than one guilty person escape indulgence be grant to any one who contribute wood to the pile but the tribunal of the inquisition do not itself condemn to the stake for the church must not be guilty of the shed of blood the ecclesiastical judge pronounce the prisoner to be a heretic of whose conversion there be no hope and hand he over -lrb- `` relax '' he be the official term -rrb- to the secular authority ask and charge the magistrate `` to treat he benignantly and mercifully '' but this -lrb- 62 -rrb- formal plea for mercy could not be entertain by the civil power it have no choice but to inflict death if it do otherwise it be a promoter of heresy all prince and official accord to the canon law must punish duly and promptly heretics hand over to they by the inquisition under pain of excommunication it be to be note that the number of death at the stake have be much over-estimate by popular imagination but the sum of suffering cause by the method of the system and the punishment that fall short of death can hardly be exaggerate the legal process employ by the church in these persecution exercise a corrupting influence on the criminal jurisprudence of the continent lea the historian of the inquisition observe : `` of all the curse which the inquisition bring in its train this perhaps be the greatest -- that until the closing year of the eighteenth century throughout the greater part of europe the inquisitorial process as develop for the destruction of heresy become the customary method of deal with all who be under any accusation '' the inquisitor who as gibbon say `` defend nonsense by cruelty '' be often regard as monster it may be say for they and for the king who do they will that -lrb- 63 -rrb- they be not a bit worse than the priest and monarch of primitive age who sacrifice human being to they deity the greek king agamemnon who immolate he daughter iphigenia to obtain favourable wind from the god be perhaps a most affectionate father and the seer who advise he to do so may have be a man of high integrity they act accord to they belief and so in the middle age and afterwards man of kindly temper and the purest zeal for morality be absolutely devoid of mercy where heresy be suspect hatred of heresy be a sort of infectious germ generate by the doctrine of exclusive salvation it have be observe that this dogma also injure the sense of truth as man 's eternal fate be at stake it seem plainly legitimate or rather imperative to use any means to enforce the true belief -- even falsehood and imposture there be no scruple about the invention of miracle or any fiction that be edify a disinterested appreciation of truth will not begin to prevail till the seventeenth century while this principle with the associate doctrine of sin hell and the last judgment lead to such consequence there be other doctrine and implication in christianity which form a solid rampart against the -lrb- 64 -rrb- advance of knowledge block the path of science in the middle age and obstruct its progress till the latter half of the nineteenth century in every important field of scientific research the ground be occupy by false view which the church declare to be true on the infallible authority of the bible the jewish account of creation and the fall of man inextricably bind up with the christian theory of redemption exclude from free inquiry geology zoology and anthropology the literal interpretation of the bible involve the truth that the sun revolve round the earth the church condemn the theory of the antipode one of the charge against servetus -lrb- who be burn in the sixteenth century see below p 79 -rrb- be that he believe the statement of a greek geographer that judea be a wretched barren country in spite of the fact that the bible describe it as a land flow with milk and honey the greek physician hippocrate have base the study of medicine and disease on experience and methodical research in the middle age man relapse to the primitive notion of a barbarous age bodily ailment be ascribe to occult agency -- the malice of the devil or the wrath of god st augustine say that the disease of christian be cause by demon -lrb- 65 -rrb- and luther in the same way attribute they to satan it be only logical that supernatural remedy should be seek to counteract the effect of supernatural cause there be a immense traffic in relic with miraculous virtue and this have the advantage of bring in a large revenue to the church physician be often expose to suspicion of sorcery and unbelief anatomy be forbid partly perhaps on account of the doctrine of the resurrection of the body the opposition of ecclesiastic to inoculation in the eighteenth century be a survival of the mediaeval view of disease chemistry -lrb- alchemy -rrb- be consider a diabolical art and in 1317 be condemn by the pope the long imprisonment of roger bacon -lrb- thirteenth century -rrb- who while he profess zeal for orthodoxy have a inconvenient instinct for scientific research illustrate the mediaeval distrust of science it be possible that the knowledge of nature would have progress little even if this distrust of science on theological grounds have not prevail for greek science have cease to advance five hundred year before christianity become powerful after about 200 bc no important discovery be make the explanation of this decay be not easy but we may be sure that it be to be seek in the -lrb- 66 -rrb- social condition of the greek and roman world and we may suspect that the social condition of the middle age would have prove unfavourable to the scientific spirit -- the disinterested quest of fact -- even if the control belief have not be hostile we may suspect that the rebirth of science would in any case have be postpone till new social condition which begin to appear in the thirteenth century -lrb- see next chapter -rrb- have reach a certain maturity theological prejudice may have injure knowledge principally by its survival after the middle age have pass away in other word the harm do by christian doctrine in this respect may lie less in the obscurantism of the dark interval between ancient and modern civilization than in the obstruction which they offer when science have revive in spite of they and could no longer be crush the firm belief in witchcraft magic and demon be inherit by the middle age from antiquity but it become far more lurid and make the world terrible man believe that they be surround by fiend watch for every opportunity to harm they that pestilence storm eclipse and famine be the work of the devil but they believe as firmly that ecclesiastical rite be capable of cope with these enemy some of the -lrb- 67 -rrb- early christian emperor legislate against magic but till the fourteenth century there be no systematic attempt to root out witchcraft the fearful epidemic know as the black death which devastate europe in that century seem to have aggravate the haunting terror of the invisible world of demon trial for witchcraft multiply and for three hundred year the discovery of witchcraft and the destruction of those who be accuse of practise it chiefly woman be a standing feature of european civilization both the theory and the persecution be support by holy scripture `` thou shalt not suffer a witch to live '' be the clear injunction of the highest authority pope innocent viii issue a bull on the matter -lrb- 1484 -rrb- in which he assert that plague and storm be the work of witch and the ablest mind believe in the reality of they devilish power no story be more painful than the persecution of witch and nowhere be it more atrocious than in england and scotland i mention it because it be the direct result of theological doctrine and because as we shall see it be rationalism which bring the long chapter of horror to a end in the period then in which the church exercise its greatest influence reason be -lrb- 68 -rrb- enchain in the prison which christianity have build around the human mind it be not indeed inactive but its activity take the form of heresy or to pursue the metaphor those who break chain be unable for the most part to scale the wall of the prison they freedom extend only so far as to arrive at belief which like orthodoxy itself be base on christian mythology there be some exception to the rule at the end of the twelfth century a stimulus from another world begin to make itself feel the philosophy of aristotle become know to learn man in western christendom they teacher be jew and mohammedan among the mohammedan there be a certain amount of free thought provoke by they knowledge of ancient greek speculation the work of the freethinker averro -lrb- twelfth century -rrb- which be base on aristotle 's philosophy propagate a small wave of rationalism in christian country averro hold the eternity of matter and deny the immortality of the soul he general view may be describe as pantheism but he seek to avoid difficulty with the orthodox authority of islam by lay down the doctrine of double truth that be the coexistence of two independent and contradictory truth the one philosophical and the other religious this -lrb- 69 -rrb- do not save he from be banish from the court of the spanish caliph in the university of pari he teaching produce a school of freethinker who hold that the creation the resurrection of the body and other essential dogma might be true from the standpoint of religion but be false from the standpoint of reason to a plain mind this seem much as if one say that the doctrine of immortality be true on sunday but not on week-day or that the apostle ' creed be false in the drawing-room and true in the kitchen this dangerous movement be crushed and the saving principle of double truth condemn by pope john xxi the spread of averroistic and similar speculation call forth the theology of thoma of aquino in south italy -lrb- die 1274 -rrb- a most subtle thinker whose mind have a natural turn for scepticism he enlist aristotle hitherto the guide of infidelity on the side of orthodoxy and construct a ingenious christian philosophy which be still authoritative in the roman church but aristotle and reason be dangerous ally for faith and the treatise of thoma be perhaps more calculate to unsettle a believe mind by the doubt which it powerfully state than to quiet the scruple of a doubter by its solution there must always have be some private -lrb- 70 -rrb- and underground unbelief here and there which do not lead to any serious consequence the blasphemous statement that the world have be deceive by three impostor mose jesus and mohammed be current in the thirteenth century it be attribute to the freethinking emperor frederick ii -lrb- die 1250 -rrb- who have be describe as `` the first modern man '' the same idea in a milder form be express in the story of the three ring which be at least as old a mohammedan ruler desire to extort money from a rich jew summon he to he court and lay a snare for he `` my friend '' he say `` i have often hear it report that thou art a very wise man tell I therefore which of the three religion that of the jew that of the mohammedan and that of the christian thou believest to be the truest '' the jew see that a trap be lay for he and answer as follow : `` my lord there be once a rich man who among he treasure have a ring of such great value that he wish to leave it as a perpetual heirloom to he successor so he make a will that whichever of he son should be find in possession of this ring after he death should be consider he heir the son to whom he give the ring act in the same way as he father and so the ring pass from hand to -lrb- 71 -rrb- hand at last it come into the possession of a man who have three son whom he love equally unable to make up he mind to which of they he should leave the ring he promise it to each of they privately and then in order to satisfy they all cause a goldsmith to make two other ring so closely resemble the true ring that he be unable to distinguish they himself on he death-bed he give each of they a ring and each claim to be he heir but no one could prove he title because the ring be indistinguishable and the suit at law last till this day it be even so my lord with the three religion give by god to the three people they each think they have the true religion but which of they really have it be a question like that of the ring still undecided '' this sceptical story become famous in the eighteenth century when the german poet lessing build upon it he drama nathan the sage which be intend to show the unreasonableness of intolerance chapter iv prospect of deliverance -lrb- the renaissance and the reformation -rrb- the intellectual and social movement which be to dispel the darkness of the -lrb- 72 -rrb- middle age and prepare the way for those who would ultimately deliver reason from she prison begin in italy in the thirteenth century the misty veil weave of credulity and infantile navet which have hang over man 's soul and protect they from understand either themselves or they relation to the world begin to lift the individual begin to feel he separate individuality to be conscious of he own value as a person apart from he race or country -lrb- as in the later age of greece and rome -rrb- and the world around he begin to emerge from the mist of mediaeval dream the change be due to the political and social condition of the little italian state of which some be republic and other govern by tyrant to the human world thus unveil itself the individual who seek to make it serve he purpose require a guide and the guide be find in the ancient literature of greece and rome hence the whole transformation which presently extend from italy to northern europe be know as the renaissance or rebirth of classical antiquity but the awaken interest in classical literature while it color the character and stimulate the growth of the movement supply new ideal and suggest new point of view be only the form in which the change of spirit -lrb- 73 -rrb- begin to express itself in the fourteenth century the change might conceivably have take some other shape its true name be humanism at the time man hardly feel that they be pass into a new age of civilization nor do the culture of the renaissance immediately produce any open or general intellectual rebellion against orthodox belief the world be gradually assume a aspect decidedly unfriendly to the teaching of mediaeval orthodoxy but there be no explosion of hostility it be not till the seventeenth century that war between religion and authority be systematically wage the humanist be not hostile to theological authority or to the claim of religious dogma but they have discover a purely human curiosity about this world and it absorb they interest they idolize pagan literature which abound in poisonous germ the secular side of education become all-important religion and theology be keep in a separate compartment some speculative mind which be sensitive to the contradiction might seek to reconcile the old religion with new idea but the general tendency of thinker in the renaissance period be to keep the two world distinct and to practice outward conformity to the creed without any real intellectual submission -lrb- 74 -rrb- i may illustrate this double-facedness of the renaissance by montaigne -lrb- second half of sixteenth century -rrb- he essay make for rationalism but contain frequent profession of orthodox catholicism in which he be perfectly sincere there be no attempt to reconcile the two point of view in fact he take the sceptical position that there be no bridge between reason and religion the human intellect be incapable in the domain of theology and religion must be place aloft out of reach and beyond the interference of reason to be humbly accept but while he humbly accept it on sceptical grounds which would have induce he to accept mohammadanism if he have be bear in cairo he soul be not in its dominion it be the philosopher and wise man of antiquity cicero and seneca and plutarch who mould and possess he mind it be to they and not to the consolation of christianity that he turn when he discuss the problem of death the religious war in france which he witness and the massacre of st bartholomew 's day -lrb- 1572 -rrb- be calculate to confirm he in he scepticism he attitude to persecution be express in the remark that `` it be set a high value on one 's opinion to roast man on account of they '' the logical result of montaigne 's scepticism -lrb- 75 -rrb- be make visible by he friend charron who publish a book on wisdom in 1601 here it be teach that true morality be not found on religion and the author survey the history of christianity to show the evil which it have produce he say of immortality that it be the most generally receive doctrine the most usefully believe and the most weakly establish by human reason but he modify this and some other passage in a second edition a contemporary jesuit place charron in the catalogue of the most dangerous and wicked atheist he be really a deist but in those day and long after no one scruple to call a non - christian deist a atheist he book would doubtless have be suppress and he would have suffer but for the support of king henry iv it have a particular interest because it transport we directly from the atmosphere of the renaissance represent by montaigne into the new age of more or less aggressive rationalism what humanism do in the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth century at first in italy then in other country be to create a intellectual atmosphere in which the emancipation of reason could begin and knowledge could resume its progress the period see the invention of printing and -lrb- 76 -rrb- the discovery of new part of the globe and these thing be to aid powerfully in the future defeat of authority but the triumph of freedom depend on other cause also it be not to be bring about by the intellect alone the chief political fact of the period be the decline of the power of the pope in europe the decay of the holy roman empire and the growth of strong monarchy in which worldly interest determine and dictate ecclesiastical policy and from which the modern state be to develop the success of the reformation be make possible by these condition its victory in north germany be due to the secular interest of the prince who profit by the confiscation of church land in england there be no popular movement the change be carry through by the government for its own purpose the principal cause of the reformation be the general corruption of the church and the flagrancy of its oppression for a long time the papacy have have no higher aim than to be a secular power exploit its spiritual authority for the purpose of promote its worldly interest by which it be exclusively govern all the european state base they diplomacy on this assumption since the fourteenth century every one acknowledge -lrb- 77 -rrb- the need of reform the church and reform have be promise but thing go from bad to worse and there be no resource but rebellion the rebellion lead by luther be the result not of a revolt of reason against dogma but of widely spread anti-clerical feeling due to the ecclesiastical method of extort money particularly by the sale of indulgence the most glaring abuse of the time it be he study of the theory of papal indulgence that lead luther on to he theological heresy it be a elementary error but one which be still share by many people who have read history superficially that the reformation establish religious liberty and the right of private judgment what it do be to bring about a new set of political and social condition under which religious liberty could ultimately be secure and by virtue of its inherent inconsistency to lead to result at which its leader would have shudder but nothing be further from the mind of the leading reformer than the toleration of doctrine differ from they own they replace one authority by another they set up the authority of the bible instead of that of the church but it be the bible accord to luther or the bible accord to calvin so far as the spirit of intolerance go there -lrb- 78 -rrb- be nothing to choose between the new and the old church the religious war be not for the cause of freedom but for particular set of doctrine and in france if the protestant have be victorious it be certain that they would not have give more liberal term to the catholic than the catholic give to they luther be quite oppose to liberty of conscience and worship a doctrine which be inconsistent with scripture as he read it he might protest against coercion and condemn the burning of heretic when he be in fear that he and he party might be victim but when he be safe and in power he assert he real view that it be the duty of the state to impose the true doctrine and exterminate heresy which be a abomination that unlimited obedience to they prince in religious as in other matter be the duty of subject and that the end of the state be to defend the faith he hold that anabaptist should be put to the sword with protestant and catholic alike the dogma of exclusive salvation lead to the same place calvin 's fame for intolerance be blackest he do not like luther advocate the absolute power of the civil ruler he stand for the control of the state by the church -- a form of government which be commonly call theocracy -lrb- 79 -rrb- and he establish a theocracy at geneva here liberty be completely crushed false doctrine be put down by imprisonment exile and death the punishment of servetus be the most famous exploit of calvin 's warfare against heresy the spaniard servetus who have write against the dogma of the trinity be imprison at lyon -lrb- partly through the machination of calvin -rrb- and have escape come rashly to geneva he be try for heresy and commit to the flame -lrb- 1553 -rrb- though geneva have no jurisdiction over he melanchthon who formulate the principle of persecution praise this act as a memorable example to posterity posterity however be one day to be ashamed of that example in 1903 the calvinist of geneva feel impel to erect a expiatory monument in which calvin `` we great reformer '' be excuse as guilty of a error `` which be that of he century '' thus the reformer like the church from which they part care nothing for freedom they only care for `` truth '' if the mediaeval ideal be to purge the world of heretic the object of the protestant be to exclude all dissident from he own land the people at large be to be drive into a fold to accept they faith at the command of they sovran this be the principle lay down in the -lrb- 80 -rrb- religious peace which -lrb- 1555 -rrb- compose the struggle between the catholic emperor and the protestant german prince it be recognize by catherine de ' medici when she massacre the french protestant and signify to queen elizabeth that she might do likewise with english catholic nor do the protestant creed represent enlightenment the reformation on the continent be as hostile to enlightenment as it be to liberty and science if it seem to contradict the bible have as little chance with luther as with the pope the bible interpret by the protestant or the roman church be equally fatal to witch in germany the development of learn receive a long set-back yet the reformation involuntarily help the cause of liberty the result be contrary to the intention of its leader be indirect and long delay in the first place the great rent in western christianity substitute a number of theological authority instead of one -- several god we may say instead of one god -- produce a weakening of ecclesiastical authority in general the religious tradition be break in the second place in the protestant state the supreme ecclesiastical power be vest in the sovran the sovran have other interest besides those of -lrb- 81 -rrb- the church to consider and political reason would compel he sooner or later to modify the principle of ecclesiastical intolerance catholic state in the same way be force to depart from the duty of not suffer heretic the religious war in france end in a limited toleration of protestant the policy of cardinal richelieu who support the protestant cause in germany illustrate how secular interest obstruct the cause of faith again the intellectual justification of the protestant rebellion against the church have be the right of private judgment that be the principle of religious liberty but the reformer have assert it only for themselves and as soon as they have frame they own article of faith they have practically repudiate it this be the most glaring inconsistency in the protestant position and the claim which they have thrust aside could not be permanently suppress once more the protestant doctrine rest on a insecure foundation which no logic could defend and inevitably lead from one untenable position to another if we be to believe on authority why should we prefer the upstart dictation of the lutheran confession of augsburg or the english thirty - nine article to the venerable authority of the church of rome if we decide against rome we must do so by means -lrb- 82 -rrb- of reason but once we exercise reason in the matter why should we stop where luther or calvin or any of the other rebel stop unless we assume that one of they be inspire if we reject superstition which they reject there be nothing except they authority to prevent we from reject all or some of the superstition which they retain moreover they bible-worship promote result which they do not foresee -lrb- 1 -rrb- the inspired record on which the creed depend become a open book public attention be direct to it as never before though it can not be say to have be universally read before the nineteenth century study lead to criticism the difficulty of the dogma of inspiration be appreciate and the bible be ultimately to be submit to a remorseless dissection which have alter at least the quality of its authority in the eye of intelligent believer this process of biblical criticism have be conduct mainly in a protestant atmosphere and the new position in which the bible be place by the reformation must be hold partly accountable in these way protestantism be adapt to be a stepping-stone to rationalism and thus serve the cause of freedom -lrb- 83 -rrb- that cause however be powerfully and directly promote by one sect of reformer who in the eye of all the other be blasphemer and of whom most people never think when they talk of the reformation i mean the socinian of they far-reaching influence something will be say in the next chapter another result of the reformation have still to be mention its renovate effect on the roman church which have now to fight for its existence a new series of pope who be in earnest about religion begin with paul iii -lrb- 1534 -rrb- and reorganize the papacy and its resource for a struggle of century -lrb- 2 -rrb- the institution of the jesuit order the establishment of the inquisition at rome the council of trent the censorship of the press -lrb- index of forbid book -rrb- be the expression of the new spirit and the means to cope with the new situation the reform papacy be good fortune for believe child of the church but what here concern we be that one of its chief object be to repress freedom more effectually savonarolum who preach right live at florence have be execute -lrb- 1498 -rrb- under pope alexander vi who be a notorious profligate if savonarolum have live -lrb- 84 -rrb- in the new era he might have be canonize but giordano bruno be burn giordano bruno have construct a religious philosophy base partly upon epicurus from whom he take the theory of the infinity of the universe but epicurean materialism be transform into a pantheistic mysticism by the doctrine that god be the soul of matter accept the recent discovery of copernicus which catholic and protestant alike reject that the earth revolve round the sun bruno take the further step of regard the fix star as sun each with its invisible satellite he seek to come to a understanding with the bible which -lrb- he hold -rrb- be intend for the vulgar have to accommodate itself to they prejudice leave italy because he be suspect of heresy he live successively in switzerland france england and germany and in 1592 induce by a false friend to return to venice he be seize by order of the inquisition finally condemn in rome he be burn -lrb- 1600 -rrb- in the campo de ' fiorus where a monument now stand in he honor erect some year ago to the great chagrin of the roman church much be make of the fate of bruno because he be one of the world 's famous man no country have so illustrious a victim of that era to commemorate as italy but in other land -lrb- 85 -rrb- blood just as innocent be shed for heterodox opinion in france there be rather more freedom than elsewhere under the relatively tolerant government of henry iv and of the cardinal richelieu and mazarin till about 1660 but at toulouse -lrb- 1619 -rrb- lucilio vaninus a learn italian who like bruno wander about europe be convict as a atheist and blasphemer he tongue be tear out and he be burn protestant england under elizabeth and jame i do not lag behind the roman inquisition but on account of the obscurity of the victim she zeal for faith have be unduly forget yet but for a accident she might have cover herself with the glory of have do to death a heretic not less famous than giordano bruno the poet marlowe be accuse of atheism but while the prosecution be hang over he he be kill in a sordid quarrel in a tavern -lrb- 1593 -rrb- another dramatist -lrb- kyd -rrb- who be implicate in the charge be put to the torture at the same time sir walter raleigh be prosecute for unbelief but not convict other be not so fortunate three or four person be burn at norwich in the reign of elizabeth for unchristian doctrine among they franci kett who have be a fellow of corpus christus cambridge under jame i who -lrb- 86 -rrb- interested himself personally in such matter bartholomew legate be charge with hold various pestilent opinion the king summon he to he presence and ask he whether he do not pray daily to jesus christ legate reply he have pray to christ in the day of he ignorance but not for the last seven year `` away base fellow '' say jame spurn he with he foot `` it shall never be say that one stayeth in my palace that have never pray to we savior for seven year together '' legate have be imprison for some time in newgate be declare a incorrigible heretic and burn at smithfield -lrb- 1611 -rrb- just a month later one wightman be burn at lichfield by the bishop of coventry for heterodox doctrine it be possible that public opinion be shock by these two burning they be the last case in england of death for unbelief puritan intolerance indeed pass a ordinance in 1648 by which all who deny the trinity christ 's divinity the inspiration of scripture or a future state be liable to death and person guilty of other heresy to imprisonment but this do not lead to any execution the renaissance age see the first sign of the beginning of modern science but the mediaeval prejudice against the investigation -lrb- 87 -rrb- of nature be not dissipate till the seventeenth century and in italy they continue to a much later period the history of modern astronomy begin in 1543 with the publication of the work of copernicus reveal the truth about the motion of the earth the appearance of this work be important in the history of free thought because it raise a clear and definite issue between science and scripture and osiander who edit it -lrb- copernicus be die -rrb- forsee the outcry it would raise state untruly in the preface that the earth 's motion be put forward only as a hypothesis the theory be denounce by catholic and reformer and it do not convince some man -lrb- eg bacon -rrb- who be not influence by theological prejudice the observation of the italian astronomer galileo de ' galileus demonstrate the copernican theory beyond question he telescope discover the moon of jupiter and he observation of the spot in the sun confirm the earth 's rotation in the pulpit of florence where he live under the protection of the grand duke he sensational discovery be condemn `` man of galilee why stand ye gaze up into heaven '' he be then denounce to the holy office of the inquisition by two dominican monk learn that he investigation be be consider -lrb- 88 -rrb- at rome galileo go thither confident that he would be able to convince the ecclesiastical authority of the manifest truth of copernicanism he do not realize what theology be capable of in February 1616 the holy office decide that the copernican system be in itself absurd and in respect of scripture heretical cardinal bellarmin by the pope 's direction summon galileo and officially admonish he to abandon he opinion and cease to teach it otherwise the inquisition would proceed against he galileo promise to obey the book of copernicus be place on the index it have be remark that galileo 's book on solar spot contain no mention of scripture and thus the holy office in its decree which related to that book pass judgment on a scientific not a theological question galileo be silence for a while but it be impossible for he to be mute for ever under a new pope -lrb- urban viii -rrb- he look for greater liberty and there be many in the papal circle who be well disposed to he he hope to avoid difficulty by the device of place the argument for the old and the new theory side by side and pretend not to judge between they he write a treatise on the two system -lrb- the ptolemaic and the copernican -rrb- in the form -lrb- 89 -rrb- of dialogue of which the preface declare that the purpose be to explain the pro and con of the two view but the spirit of the work be copernican he receive permission quite definite as he think from father riccardus -lrb- master of the sacred palace -rrb- to print it and it appear in 1632 the pope however disapprove of it the book be examine by a commission and galileo be summon before the inquisition he be old and ill and the humiliation which he have to endure be a painful story he would probably have be more severely treat if one of the member of the tribunal have not be a man of scientific training -lrb- macolano a dominican -rrb- who be able to appreciate he ability under examination galileo deny that he have uphold the motion of the earth in the dialogue and assert that he have show the reason of copernicus to be inconclusive this defense be in accordance with the statement in he preface but contradict he deepest conviction in struggle with such a tribunal it be the only line which a man who be not a hero could take at a later session he force himself ignominiously to confess that some of the argument on the copernican side have be put too strongly and to declare himself ready to confute the -lrb- 90 -rrb- theory in the final examination he be threaten with torture he say that before the decree of 1616 he have hold the truth of the copernican system to be arguable but since then he have hold the ptolemaic to be true next day he publicly abjure the scientific truth which he have demonstrate he be allow to retire to the country on condition that he see no one in the last month of he life he write to a friend to this effect : `` the falsity of the copernican system can not be doubt especially by we catholic it be refute by the irrefragable authority of scripture the conjecture of copernicus and he disciple be all disposed of by the one solid argument : god 's omnipotence can operate in infinitely various way if something appear to we observation to happen in one particular way we must not curtail god 's arm and sustain a thing in which we may be deceive '' the irony be evident rome do not permit the truth about the solar system to be teach till after the middle of the eighteenth century and galileo 's book remain on the index till 1835 the prohibition be fatal to the study of natural science in italy the roman index remind we of the significance of the invention of printing in the struggle for freedom of think by make -lrb- 91 -rrb- it easy to propagate new idea far and wide authority speedily realize the danger and take measure to place its yoke on the new contrivance which promise to be such a powerful ally of reason pope alexander vi inaugurate censorship of the press by he bull against unlicensed printing -lrb- 1501 -rrb- in france king henry ii make printing without official permission punishable by death in germany censorship be introduce in 1529 in england under elizabeth book could not be print without a license and printing press be not allow except in london oxford and cambridge the regulation of the press be under the authority of the star chamber nowhere do the press become really free till the nineteenth century while the reformation and the renovate roman church mean a reaction against the renaissance the vital change which the renaissance signify -- individualism a new intellectual attitude to the world the cultivation of secular knowledge -- be permanent and destine to lead amid the compete intolerance of catholic and protestant power to the goal of liberty we shall see how reason and the growth of knowledge undermine the basis of theological authority at each step in this process in which philosophical speculation historical -lrb- 92 -rrb- criticism natural science have all take part the opposition between reason and faith deepen doubt clear or vague increase and secularism derive from the humanist and always imply scepticism whether latent or conscious substitute a interest in the fortune of the human race upon earth for the interest in a future world and along with this steady intellectual advance toleration gain ground and freedom win more champion in the meantime the force of political circumstance be compelling government to mitigate they maintenance of one religious creed by measure of relief to other christian sect and the principle of exclusiveness be break down for reason of worldly expediency religious liberty be a important step towards complete freedom of opinion -lrb- 1 -rrb- the danger however be feel in germany and in the seventeenth century the study of scripture be not encourage at german university -lrb- 2 -rrb- see barry papacy and modern time -lrb- in this series -rrb- 113 seq chapter v religious toleration in the third century bc the indian king asoka a man of religious zeal but of tolerant spirit confront by the struggle between two hostile religion -lrb- brahmanism and buddhism -rrb- decide that both should be equally privileged and honor in he dominion he ordinance on the matter be memorable -lrb- 93 -rrb- as the earliest exist edict of toleration in europe as we see the principle of toleration be for the first time definitely express in the roman imperial edict which terminate the persecution of the christian the religious strife of the sixteenth century raise the question in its modern form and for many generation it be one of the chief problem of statesman and the subject of endless controversial pamphlet toleration mean incomplete religious liberty and there be many degree of it it might be grant to certain christian sect it might be grant to christian sect but these alone it might be grant to all religion but not to freethinker or to deist but not to atheist it might mean the concession of some civil rights but not of other it might mean the exclusion of those who be tolerate from public office or from certain profession the religious liberty now enjoy in western land have be gain through various stage of toleration we owe the modern principle of toleration to the italian group of reformer who reject the doctrine of the trinity and be the father of unitarianism the reformation movement have spread to italy but rome be successful in suppress it and many heretic flee to switzerland the anti-trinitarian -lrb- 94 -rrb- group be force by the intolerance of calvin to flee to transylvanium and poland where they propagate they doctrine the unitarian creed be mould by fausto sozzinus generally know as socinus and in the catechism of he sect -lrb- 1574 -rrb- persecution be condemn this repudiation of the use of force in the interest of religion be a consequence of the socinian doctrine for unlike luther and calvin the socinian concede such a wide room to individual judgment in the interpretation of scripture that to impose socinianism would have be inconsistent with its principle in other word there be a strong rationalistic element which be lack in the trinitarian creed it be under the influence of the socinian spirit that castellion of savoy sound the trumpet of toleration in a pamphlet denounce the burning of servetus whereby he earn the malignant hatred of calvin he maintain the innocence of error and ridicule the importance which the church lay on obscure question such as predestination and the trinity `` to discuss the difference between the law and the gospel gratuitous remission of sin or imputed righteousness be as if a man be to discuss whether a prince be to come on horseback -lrb- 95 -rrb- or in a chariot or dress in white or in red '' -lrb- 1 -rrb- religion be a curse if persecution be a necessary part of it for a long time the socinian and those who come under they influence when drive from poland they pass into germany and holland be the only sect which advocate toleration it be adopt from they by the anabaptist and by the arminian section of the reform church of holland and in holland the founder of the english congregationalist who -lrb- under the name of independent -rrb- play such a important part in the history of the civil war and the commonwealth learn the principle of liberty of conscience socinus think that this principle could be realize without abolish the state church he contemplate a close union between the state and the prevail church combine with complete toleration for other sect it be under this system -lrb- which have be call jurisdictional -rrb- that religious liberty have be realize in european state but there be another and simpler method that of separate church from state and place all religion on a equality this be the solution which the anabaptist would have prefer they detest the state and the doctrine of religious liberty be not -lrb- 96 -rrb- precious to they they ideal system would have be a anabaptist theocracy separation be the second best in europe public opinion be not ripe for separation inasmuch as the most powerful religious body be alike in regard toleration as wicked indifference but it be introduce in a small corner of the new world beyond the atlantic in the seventeenth century the puritan who flee from the intolerance of the english church and state and found colony in new england be themselves equally intolerant not only to anglican and catholic but to baptist and quaker they set up theocratical government from which all who do not belong to they own sect be exclude roger william have imbibe from the dutch arminian the idea of separation of church from state on account of this heresy he be drive from massachusett and he found providence to be a refuge for those whom the puritan colonist persecute here he set up a democratic constitution in which the magistrate have power only in civil matter and could not interfere with religion other town be presently found in rhode island and a charter of charle ii -lrb- 1663 -rrb- confirm the constitution which secure to all citizen profess christianity of whatever -lrb- 97 -rrb- form the full enjoyment of political rights non-christian be tolerate but be not admit to the political rights of christian so far the new state fall short of perfect liberty but the fact that jew be soon admit notwithstanding to full citizenship show how free the atmosphere be to roger william belong the glory of have found the first modern state which be really tolerant and be base on the principle of take the control of religious matter entirely out of the hand of the civil government toleration be also establish in the roman catholic colony of maryland but in a different way through the influence of lord baltimore a act of toleration be pass in 1649 notable as the first decree vote by a legal assembly grant complete freedom to all christian no one profess faith in christ be to be molest in regard to he religion but the law be heavy on all outside this pale any one who blaspheme god or attack the trinity or any member of the trinity be threaten by the penalty of death the tolerance of maryland attract so many protestant settler from virginium that the protestant become a majority and as soon as they win political preponderance they introduce a act -lrb- 1654 -rrb- -lrb- 98 -rrb- exclude papist and prelatist from toleration the rule of the baltimore be restore after 1660 and the old religious freedom be revive but with the accession of william iii the protestant again come into power and the toleration which the catholic have institute in maryland come to a end it will be observe that in both these case freedom be incomplete but it be much larger and more fundamental in rhode island where it have be ultimately derive from the doctrine of socinus -lrb- 2 -rrb- when the colony become independent of england the federal constitution which they set up be absolutely secular but it be leave to each member of the union to adopt separation or not -lrb- 1789 -rrb- if separation have become the rule in the american state it may be largely due to the fact that on any other system the government would have find it difficult to impose mutual tolerance on the sect it must be add that in maryland and a few southern state atheist still suffer from some political disability in england the experiment of separation would have be try under the commonwealth if the independent have have they way this policy be overrule by cromwell -lrb- 99 -rrb- the new national church include presbyterian independent and baptist but liberty of worship be grant to all christian sect except roman catholic and anglican if the parliament have have the power this toleration would have be a mere name the presbyterian regard toleration as a work of the devil and would have persecute the independent if they could but under cromwell 's autocratic rule even the anglican live in peace and toleration be extend to the jew in these day voice be raise from various quarter advocate toleration on general grounds -lrb- 3 -rrb- the most illustrious advocate be milton the poet who be in favor of the severance of church from state in milton 's areopagitica : a speech for the liberty of unlicensed printing -lrb- 1644 -rrb- the freedom of the press be eloquently sustain by argument which be valid for freedom of think in general it be show that the censorship will conduce `` to the discouragement of all learning and the stop of truth not only by disexercise and blunt we ability in what we know already but by hinder and crop the discovery that might be yet further make both in religious -lrb- 100 -rrb- and civil wisdom '' for knowledge be advance through the utterance of new opinion and truth be discover by free discussion if the water of truth `` flow not in a perpetual progression they sicken into a muddy pool of conformity and tradition '' book which be authorize by the licenser be apt to be as bacon say `` but the language of the time '' and do not contribute to progress the example of the country where the censorship be severe do not suggest that it be useful for moral : `` look into italy and spain whether those place be one scruple the better the honester the wiser the chaster since all the inquisitional rigor that have be execute upon book '' spain indeed could reply `` we be what be more important more orthodox '' it be interesting to notice that milton place freedom of think above civil liberty : `` give I the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely accord to conscience above all other liberty '' with the restoration of the monarchy and the anglican church religious liberty be extinguish by a series of law against dissenter to the revolution we owe the act of toleration -lrb- 1689 -rrb- from which the religious freedom which england enjoy at present be derive it grant freedom of worship to presbyterian congregationalist -lrb- 101 -rrb- baptist and quaker but only to these catholic and unitarian be expressly except and the repressive legislation of charle ii remain in force against they it be a characteristically english measure logically inconsistent and absurd a mixture of tolerance and intolerance but suitable to the circumstance and the state of public opinion at the time in the same year john locke 's famous -lrb- first -rrb- letter concern toleration appear in latin three subsequent letter develop and illustrate he thesis the main argument be base on the principle that the business of civil government be quite distinct from that of religion that the state be a society constitute only for preserve and promote the civil interest of its member -- civil interest mean life liberty health and the possession of property the care of soul be not commit to magistrate more than to other man for the magistrate can only use outward force but true religion mean the inward persuasion of the mind and the mind be so make that force can not compel it to believe so too it be absurd for a state to make law to enforce a religion for law be useless without penalty and penalty be impertinent because they can not convince moreover even if penalty could change -lrb- 102 -rrb- man 's belief this would not conduce to the salvation of soul would more man be save if all blindly resign themselves to the will of they ruler and accept the religion of they country for as the prince of the world be divide in religion one country alone would be in the right and all the rest of the world would have to follow they prince to destruction `` and that which heighten the absurdity and very ill suit the notion of a deity man would owe they eternal happiness or they eternal misery to the place of they nativity '' this be a principle on which locke repeatedly insist if a state be justified in impose a creed it follow that in all the land except the one or few in which the true faith prevail it be the duty of the subject to embrace a false religion if protestantism be promote in england popery by the same rule will be promote in france `` what be true and good in england will be true and good at rome too in china or geneva '' toleration be the principle which give to the true faith the best chance of prevail locke would concede full liberty to idolater by whom he mean the indian of north america and he make some scathing remark on the ecclesiastical zeal which force these `` innocent pagan '' to forsake -lrb- 103 -rrb- they ancient religion but he toleration though it extend beyond the christian pale be not complete he except in the first place roman catholic not on account of they theological dogma but because they `` teach that faith be not to be keep with heretic '' that `` king excommunicate forfeit they crown and kingdom '' and because they deliver themselves up to the protection and service of a foreign prince -- the pope in other word they be politically dangerous he other exception be atheist `` those be not all to be tolerate who deny the being of god promise covenant and oath which be the bond of human society can have no hold upon a atheist the take away of god though but even in think dissolve all besides also those that by they atheism undermine and destroy all religion can have no pretence of religion to challenge the privilege of a toleration '' thus locke be not free from the prejudice of he time these exception contradict he own principle that `` it be absurd that thing should be enjoin by law which be not in man 's power to perform and to believe this or that to be true do not depend upon we will '' this apply to roman catholic as to protestant to atheist as to deist locke however perhaps think -lrb- 104 -rrb- that the speculative opinion of atheism which be uncommon in he day do depend on the will he would have exclude from he state he great contemporary spinoza but in spite of its limitation locke 's toleration be a work of the highest value and its argument take we further than its author go it assert unrestrictedly the secular principle and its logical issue be disestablishment a church be merely `` a free and voluntary society '' i may notice the remark that if infidel be to be convert by force it be easier for god to do it `` with army of heavenly legion than for any son of the church how potent soever with all he dragoon '' this be a polite way of state a maxim analogous to that of the emperor tiberius -lrb- above p 41 -rrb- if false belief be a offence to god it be really he affair the toleration of nonconformist be far from please extreme anglican and the influence of this party at the beginning of the eighteenth century menace the liberty of dissenter the situation provoke defoe who be a zealous nonconformist to write he pamphlet the shortest way with the dissenter -lrb- 1702 -rrb- a ironical attack upon the principle of toleration it pretend to show that the dissenter be at heart incorrigible rebel that a gentle policy be useless and suggest -lrb- 105 -rrb- that all preacher at conventicle should be hang and all person find attend such meeting should be banish this exceedingly amusing but terribly earnest caricature of the sentiment of the high anglican party at first deceive and alarm the dissenter themselves but the high churchman be furious defoe be fine expose in the pillory three time and send to newgate prison but the tory reaction be only temporary during the eighteenth century a relatively tolerant spirit prevail among the christian sect and new sect be found the official church become less fanatical many of its lead divine be influence by rationalistic thought if it have not be for the opposition of king george iii the catholic might have be free from they disability before the end of the century this measure eloquently advocate by burke and desire by pitt be not carry till 1829 and then under the threat of a revolution in ireland in the meantime legal toleration have be extend to the unitarian in 1813 but they be not relieve from all disability till the forty jew be not admit to the full rights of citizenship till 1858 the achievement of religious liberty in england in the nineteenth century have be mainly the work of liberal the liberal -lrb- 106 -rrb- party have be move towards the ultimate goal of complete secularization and the separation of the church from the state -- the logical result of locke 's theory of civil government the disestablishment of the church in ireland in 1869 partly realize this ideal and now more than forty year later the liberal party be seek to apply the principle to wale it be highly characteristic of english politics and english psychology that the change should be carry out in this piecemeal fashion in the other country of the british empire the system of separation prevail there be no connection between the state and any sect no church be anything more than a voluntary society but secularization have advance under the state church system it be enough to mention the education act of 1870 and the abolition of religious test at university -lrb- 1871 -rrb- other gain for freedom will be notice when i come to speak in another chapter of the progress of rationalism if we compare the religious situation in france in the seventeenth with that in the eighteenth century it seem to be sharply contrast with the development in england in england there be a great advance towards religious liberty in france there be a fall away until 1676 the french protestant -lrb- 107 -rrb- -lrb- huguenot -rrb- be tolerate for the next hundred year they be outlaw but the toleration which they charter -lrb- the edict of nante 1598 -rrb- secure they be of a limited kind they be exclude for instance from the army they be exclude from pari and other city and district and the liberty which they enjoy be confine to they it be not grant to any other sect the charter be faithfully maintain by the two great cardinal -lrb- richelieu and mazarin -rrb- who govern france under loui xiii and loui xiv but when the latter assume the active power in 1661 he begin a series of law against the protestant which culminate in the revoke of the charter -lrb- 1676 -rrb- and the beginning of a protestant persecution the french clergy justify this policy by the notorious text `` compel they to come in '' and appeal to st augustine they argument evoke a defense of toleration by bayle a french protestant who have take refuge in holland it be entitle a philosophical commentary on the text `` compel they to come in '' -lrb- 1686 -rrb- and in importance stand beside locke 's work which be be compose at the same time many of the argument urge by the two writer be identical they agree and for the same reason in exclude roman catholic the -lrb- 108 -rrb- most characteristic thing in bayle 's treatise be he sceptical argument that even if it be a right principle to suppress error by force no truth be certain enough to justify we in apply the theory we shall see -lrb- next chapter -rrb- this eminent scholar 's contribution to rationalism though there be a immense exodus of protestant from france loui do not succeed in he design of extirpate heresy from he land in the eighteenth century under loui xv the presence of protestant be tolerate though they be outlaw they marriage be not recognize as legal and they be liable at any moment to persecution about the middle of the century a literary agitation begin conduct mainly by rationalist but finally support by enlighten catholic to relieve the affliction of the oppressed sect it result at last in a edict of toleration -lrb- 1787 -rrb- which make the position of the protestant endurable though it exclude they from certain career the most energetic and forceful leader in the campaign against intolerance be voltaire -lrb- see next chapter -rrb- and he exposure of some glaring case of unjust persecution do more than general argument to achieve the object the most infamous case be that of jean cala a protestant merchant of toulouse whose son commit suicide a report -lrb- 109 -rrb- be set abroad that the young man have decide to join the catholic church and that he father mother and brother fill with protestant bigotry kill he with the help of a friend they be all put in iron try and condemn though there be no argument for they guilt except the conjecture of bigotry jean cala be break on the wheel he son and daughter cast into convent he wife leave to starve through the activity of voltaire then live near geneva the widow be induce to go to pari where she be kindly receive and assist by eminent lawyer a judicial inquiry be make the toulouse sentence be reverse and the king grant pension to those who have suffer this scandal could only have happen in the province accord to voltaire : `` at paris '' he say `` fanaticism powerful though it may be be always control by reason '' the case of sirven though it do not end tragically be similar and the government of toulouse be again responsible he be accuse of have drown he daughter in a well to hinder she from become a catholic and be with he wife sentence to death fortunately he and he family have escape to switzerland where they persuade voltaire of they innocence to get the sentence reverse be the work of nine year and this -lrb- 110 -rrb- time it be reverse at toulouse when voltaire visit paris in 1778 he be acclaimed by crowd as the `` defender of cala and the sirven '' he disinterested practical activity against persecution be of far more value than the treatise on toleration which he write in connexion with the cala episode it be a poor work compare with those of locke and bayle the tolerance which he advocate be of a limited kind he would confine public office and dignity to those who belong to the state religion but if voltaire 's system of toleration be limit it be wide compare with the religious establishment advocate by he contemporary rousseau though of swiss birth rousseau belong to the literature and history of france but it be not for nothing that he be bring up in the tradition of calvinistic geneva he ideal state would in its way have be little better than any theocracy he propose to establish a `` civil religion '' which be to be a sort of undogmatic christianity but certain dogma which he consider essential be to be impose on all citizen on pain of banishment such be the existence of a deity the future bliss of the good and punishment of the bad the duty of tolerance towards all those who accept the fundamental -lrb- 111 -rrb- article of faith it may be say that a state found on this basis would be fairly inclusive -- that all christian sect and many deist could find a place in it but by impose indispensable belief it deny the principle of toleration the importance of rousseau 's idea lie in the fact that it inspire one of the experiment in religious policy which be make during the french revolution the revolution establish religious liberty in france most of the leader be unorthodox they rationalism be naturally of the eighteenth-century type and in the preamble to the declaration of rights -lrb- 1789 -rrb- deism be assert by the word `` in the presence and under the auspices of the supreme be '' -lrb- against which only one voice protest -rrb- the declaration lay down that no one be to be vex on account of he religious opinion provide he do not thereby trouble public order catholicism be retain as the `` dominant '' religion protestant -lrb- but not jew -rrb- be admit to public office mirabeau the greatest statesman of the day protest strongly against the use of word like `` tolerance '' and `` dominant '' he say : `` the most unlimited liberty of religion be in my eye a right so sacred that to express it by the word ` toleration ' seem to I itself a sort of tyranny -lrb- 112 -rrb- since the authority which tolerate might also not tolerate '' the same protest be make in thoma paine 's rights of man which appear two year later : `` toleration be not the opposite of intolerance but be the counterfeit of it both be despotism the one assume itself the right of withholding liberty of conscience and the other of grant it '' paine be a ardent deist and he add : `` be a bill bring into any parliament entitle ` a act to tolerate or grant liberty to the almighty to receive the worship of a jew or a turk ' or ` to prohibit the almighty from receive it ' all man would startle and call it blasphemy there would be a uproar the presumption of toleration in religious matter would then present itself unmask '' the revolution begin well but the spirit of mirabeau be not in the ascendant throughout its course the vicissitude in religious policy from 1789 to 1801 have a particular interest because they show that the principle of liberty of conscience be far from possess the mind of the man who be proud of abolish the intolerance of the government which they have overthrow the state church be reorganize by the civil constitution of the clergy -lrb- 1790 -rrb- by which french citizen be forbid to acknowledge the authority of the pope and -lrb- 113 -rrb- the appointment of bishop be transfer to the elector of the department so that the commanding influence pass from the crown to the nation doctrine and worship be not touch under the democratic republic which succeed the fall of the monarchy -lrb- 1792 -- 5 -rrb- this constitution be maintain but a movement to dechristianize france be inaugurate and the commune of pari order the church of all religion to be close the worship of reason with rite model on the catholic be organize in pari and the province the government violently anti-catholic do not care to use force against the prevalent faith direct persecution would have weaken the national defense and scandalize europe they navely hope that the superstition would disappear by degree robespierre declare against the policy of unchristianize france and when he have the power -lrb- April 1795 -rrb- he establish as a state religion the worship of the supreme be `` the french people recognize the existence of the supreme be and the immortality of the soul '' the liberty of other cult be maintain thus for a few month rousseau 's idea be more or less realize it mean intolerance atheism be regard as a vice and `` all be atheist who do not think like robespierre '' -lrb- 114 -rrb- the democratic be succeed by the middle-class republic -lrb- 1795 -- 9 -rrb- and the policy of its government be to hinder the preponderance of any one religious group to hold the balance among all the creed but with a certain partiality against the strongest the catholic which threaten as be think to destroy the other or even the republic the plan be to favor the growth of new rationalistic cult and to undermine reveal religion by a secular system of education accordingly the church be separate from the state by the constitution of 1795 which affirm the liberty of all worship and withdraw from the catholic clergy the salary which the state have hitherto pay the elementary school be laicize the declaration of rights the article of the constitution and republican morality be teach instead of religion a enthusiast declare that `` the religion of socrate marcus aurelius and cicero would soon be the religion of the world '' a new rationalistic religion be introduce under the name of theophilanthropy it be the `` natural religion '' of the philosopher and poet of the century of voltaire and the english deist -- not the purify christianity of rousseau but anterior and superior to christianity its doctrine briefly formulate -lrb- 115 -rrb- be : god immortality fraternity humanity no attack on other religion but respect and honor towards all gathering in a family or in a temple to encourage one another to practice morality protect by the government sometimes secretly sometimes openly it have a certain success among the cultivate class the idea of the lay state be popularize under this rule and by the end of the century there be virtually religious peace in france under the consulate -lrb- from 1799 -rrb- the same system continue but napoleon cease to protect theophilanthropy in 1801 though there seem to have be little discontent with the exist arrangement napoleon decide to upset it and bring the pope upon the scene the catholic religion as that of the majority be again take under the special protection of the state the salary of the clergy again pay by the nation and the papal authority over the church again recognize within well-defined limit while full toleration of other religion be maintain this be the effect of the concordat between the french republic and the pope it be the judgment of a high authority that the nation if it have be consult would have pronounce against the change it may be doubt whether this be true but napoleon 's policy -lrb- 116 -rrb- seem to have be prompt by the calculation that use the pope as a instrument he could control the conscience of man and more easily carry out he plan of empire apart from its ecclesiastical policy and its experiment in new creed base on the principle of rationalistic thinker the french revolution itself have a interest in connexion with we subject as a example of the coercion of reason by a intolerant faith the leader believe that by apply certain principle they could regenerate france and show the world how the lasting happiness of mankind can be secure they act in the name of reason but they principle be article of faith which be accept just as blindly and irrationally as the dogma of any supernatural creed one of these dogma be the false doctrine of rousseau that man be a be who be naturally good and love justice and order another be the illusion that all man be equal by nature the puerile conviction prevail that legislation could completely blot out the past and radically transform the character of a society `` liberty equality and fraternity '' be as much a creed as the creed of the apostle it hypnotize man 's mind like a revelation from on high and reason have as little part in its propagation as in the spread -lrb- 117 -rrb- of christianity or of protestantism it mean anything but equality fraternity or liberty especially liberty when it be translate into action by the fanatical apostle of `` reason '' who be blind to the fact of human nature and defy the fact of econnomic terror the usual instrument in propagate religion be never more mercilessly apply any one who question the doctrine be a heretic and deserve a heretic 's fate and as in most religious movement the milder and less unreasonable spirit succumb to the fanatic never be the name of reason more grievously abused than by those who believe they be inaugurate she reign religious liberty however among other good thing do emerge from the revolution at first in the form of separation and then under the concordat the concordat last for more than a century under monarchy and republic till it be abolish in December 1905 when the system of separation be introduce again in the german state the history of religious liberty differ in many way but it resemble the development in france in so far as toleration in a limited form be at first bring about by war the thirty year ' war which divide germany in the first half -lrb- 118 -rrb- of the seventeenth century and in which as in the english civil war religion and politics be mix be terminate by the peace of westphalium -lrb- 1648 -rrb- by this act three religion the catholic the lutheran and the reform -lrb- 4 -rrb- be legally recognize by the holy roman empire and place on a equality all other religious be exclude but it be leave to each of the german state of which the empire consist to tolerate or not any religion it please that be every prince could impose on he subject whichever of the three religion he choose and refuse to tolerate the other in he territory but he might also admit one or both of the other and he might allow the follower of other creed to reside in he dominion and practice they religion within the precinct of they own house thus toleration vary from state to state accord to the policy of each particular prince as elsewhere so in germany consideration of political expediency promote the growth of toleration especially in prussium and as elsewhere theoretical advocate exercise great influence on public opinion but the case for toleration be base by its german defender chiefly on legal not as in -lrb- 119 -rrb- england and france on moral and intellectual grounds they regard it as a question of law and discuss it from the point of view of the legal relation between state and church it have be consider long ago from this standpoint by a original italian thinker marsilius of padua -lrb- thirteenth century -rrb- who have maintain that the church have no power to employ physical coercion and that if the lay authority punish heretics the punishment be inflict for the violation not of divine ordinance but of the law of the state which exclude heretics from its territory christian thomasius may be take as a lead exponent of the theory that religious liberty logically follow from a right conception of law he lay down in a series of pamphlet -lrb- 1693 -- 1697 -rrb- that the prince who alone have the power of coercion have no right to interfere in spiritual matter while the clergy step beyond they province if they interfere in secular matter or defend they faith by any other means than teaching but the secular power have no legal right to coerce heretics unless heresy be a crime and heresy be not a crime but a error for it be not a matter of will thomasius moreover urge the view that the public welfare have nothing to gain from unity of faith that it make no -lrb- 120 -rrb- difference what faith a man profess so long as he be loyal to the state he toleration indeed be not complete he be much influence by the writings of he contemporary locke and he except from the benefit of toleration the same class which locke excepted besides the influence of the jurist we may note that the pietistic movement -- a reaction of religious enthusiasm against the formal theology of the lutheran divine -- be animated by a spirit favourable to toleration and that the cause be promote by the lead man of letter especially by less in the second half of the eighteenth century but perhaps the most important fact of all in hasten the realization of religious liberty in germany be the accession of a rationalist to the throne of prussium in the person of frederick the great a few month after he accession -lrb- 1740 -rrb- he write in the margin of a state paper in which a question of religious policy occur that every one should be allow to get to heaven in he own way he view that morality be independent of religion and therefore compatible with all religion and that thus a man could be a good citizen -- the only thing which the state be entitle to demand -- whatever faith he might profess lead to the logical consequence of complete religious liberty catholic -lrb- 121 -rrb- be place on a equality with protestant and the treaty of westphalium be violate by the extension of full toleration to all the forbid sect frederick even conceive the idea of introduce mohammedan settler into some part of he realm contrast england under george iii france under loui xv italy under the shadow of the pope it be a important fact in history which have hardly be duly emphasize that full religious liberty be for the first time in any country in modern europe realize under a free-thinking ruler the friend of the great `` blasphemer '' voltaire the policy and principle of frederick be formulate in the prussian territorial code of 1794 by which unrestricted liberty of conscience be guarantee and the three chief religion the lutheran the reform and the catholic be place on the same footing and enjoy the same privilege the system be `` jurisdictional '' only three church here occupy the position which the anglican church alone occupy in england the rest of germany do not begin to move in the direction point out by prussium until by one of the last act of the holy roman empire -lrb- 1803 -rrb- the westphalian settlement have be modify before the foundation of the new empire -lrb- 1870 -rrb- freedom be establish throughout germany -lrb- 122 -rrb- in austrium the emperor joseph ii issue a edict of toleration in 1781 which may be consider a broad measure for a catholic state at that time joseph be a sincere catholic but he be not impervious to the enlighten idea of he age he be a admirer of frederick and he edict be prompt by a genuinely tolerant spirit such as have not inspire the english act of 1689 it extend only to the lutheran and reform sect and the community of the greek church which have enter into union with rome and it be of a limited kind religious liberty be not establish till 1867 the measure of joseph apply to the austrian state in italy and help to prepare that country for the idea of religious freedom it be notable that in italy in the eighteenth century toleration find its advocate not in a rationalist or a philosopher but in a catholic ecclesiastic tamburinnus who -lrb- under the name of he friend trautmansdorf -rrb- publish a work on ecclesiastical and civil toleration -lrb- 1783 -rrb- a sharp line be draw between the province of the church and the state persecution and the inquisition be condemn coercion of conscience be declare inconsistent with the christian spirit and the principle be lay down that the sovran should only exercise coercion where -lrb- 123 -rrb- the interest of public safety be concern like locke the author think that atheism be a legitimate case for such coercion the new state which napoleon set up in italy exhibit toleration in various degree but real liberty be first introduce in piedmont by cavor -lrb- 1848 -rrb- a measure which prepare the way for the full liberty which be one of the first-fruit of the foundation of the italian kingdom in 1870 the union of italy with all that it mean be the most signal and dramatic act in the triumph of the idea of the modern state over the traditional principle of the christian church rome which preserve those principle most faithfully have offer a steadfast we may say a heroic resistance to the liberal idea which sweep europe in the nineteenth century the guide of she policy grasp thoroughly the danger which liberal thought mean for a institution which found in a remote past claim to be unchangeable and never out of date gregory xvi issue a solemn protest maintain authority against freedom the mediaeval against the modern ideal in a encyclical letter -lrb- 1832 -rrb- which be intend as a rebuke to some young french catholic -lrb- lamennai and he friend -rrb- who have conceive the promising idea of transform the church by the liberal spirit -lrb- 124 -rrb- of the day the pope denounce `` the absurd and erroneous maxim or rather insanity that liberty of conscience should be procure and guarantee to every one the path to this pernicious error be prepare by that full and unlimited liberty of thought which be spread abroad to the misfortune of church and state and which certain person with excessive impudence venture to represent as a advantage for religion hence come the corruption of youth contempt for religion and for the most venerable law and a general mental change in the world -- in short the most deadly scourge of society since the experience of history have show that the state which have shine by they wealth and power and glory have perish just by this evil -- immoderate freedom of opinion licence of conversation and love of novelty with this be connect the liberty of publish any writing of any kind this be a deadly and execrable liberty for which we can not feel sufficient horror though some man dare to acclaim it noisily and enthusiastically '' a generation later pius ix be to astonish the world by a similar manifesto -- he syllabus of modern error -lrb- 1864 -rrb- yet notwithstanding the fundamental antagonism between the principle of the church and the drift of modern civilization the papacy survive -lrb- 125 -rrb- powerful and respect in a world where the idea which it condemn have become the commonplace condition of life the progress of western nation from the system of unity which prevail in the fifteenth to the system of liberty which be the rule in the nineteenth century be slow and painful illogical and waver generally dictate by political necessity seldom inspire by deliberate conviction we have see how religious liberty have be realize so far as the law be concern under two distinct system `` jurisdiction '' and `` separation '' but legal toleration may coexist with much practical intolerance and liberty before the law be compatible with serious disability of which the law can not take account for instance the expression of unorthodox opinion may exclude a man from obtain a secular post or hinder he advancement the question have be ask which of the two system be more favourable to the creation of a tolerant social atmosphere ruffinus -lrb- of whose excellent work on religious liberty i have make much use in this chapter -rrb- decide in favor of jurisdiction he point out that while socinus a true friend of liberty of thought contemplate this system the anabaptist whose spirit be intolerant seek separation more important -lrb- 126 -rrb- be the observation that in germany england and italy where the most powerful church or church be under the control of the state there be more freedom more tolerance of opinion than in many of the american state where separation prevail a hundred year ago the american show appalling ingratitude to thoma paine who have do they eminent service in the war of independence simply because he publish a very unorthodox book it be notorious that free thought be still a serious hindrance and handicap to a american even in most of the university this prove that separation be not a infallible receipt for produce tolerance but i see no reason to suppose that public opinion in america would be different if either the federal republic or the particular state have adopt jurisdiction give legal liberty under either system i should say that the tolerance of public opinion depend on social condition and especially on the degree of culture among the educate class from this sketch it will be see that toleration be the outcome of new political circumstance and necessity bring about by the disunion of the church through the reformation but it mean that in those state which grant toleration the opinion of -lrb- 127 -rrb- a sufficiently influential group of the govern class be ripe for the change and this new mental attitude be in a great measure due to the scepticism and rationalism which be diffuse by the renaissance movement and which subtly and unconsciously have affect the mind of many who be sincerely devote to rigidly orthodox belief so effective be the force of suggestion in the next two chapter the advance of reason at the expense of faith will be trace through the seventeenth eighteenth and nineteenth century -lrb- 1 -rrb- translate by lecky -lrb- 2 -rrb- complete toleration be establish by penn in the quaker colony of pennsylvanium in 1682 -lrb- 3 -rrb- especially chillingworth 's religion of protestant -lrb- 1637 -rrb- and jeremy taylor 's liberty of prophesy -lrb- 1646 -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- the reform church consist of the follower of calvin and zwingli chapter vi the growth of rationalism -lrb- seventeenth and eighteenth century -rrb- during the last three hundred year reason have be slowly but steadily destroy christian mythology and expose the pretension of supernatural revelation the progress of rationalism fall naturally into two period -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the seventeenth and eighteenth century those thinker who reject christian theology and the book on which it rely be mainly influence by the inconsistency contradiction and absurdity which they discover in the evidence and by the moral -lrb- 128 -rrb- difficulty of the creed some scientific fact be know which seem to reflect on the accuracy of revelation but argument base on science be subsidiary -lrb- 2 -rrb- in the nineteenth century the discovery of science in many field bear with full force upon fabric which have be construct in a nave and ignorant age and historical criticism undermine methodically the authority of the sacred document which have hitherto be expose chiefly to the acute but unmethodical criticism of common sense a disinterested love of fact without any regard to the bearing which those fact may have on one 's hope or fear or destiny be a rare quality in all age and it have be very rare indeed since the ancient day of greece and rome it mean the scientific spirit now in the seventeenth century we may say -lrb- without disrespect to a few precursor -rrb- that the modern study of natural science begin and in the same period we have a series of famous thinker who be guide by a disinterested love of truth of the most acute mind some reach the conclusion that the christian scheme of the world be irrational and accord to they temperament some reject it whilst other like the great frenchman pascal fall back upon a unreasoning act of faith bacon who profess -lrb- 129 -rrb- orthodoxy be perhaps at heart a deist but in any case the whole spirit of he writings be to exclude authority from the domain of scientific investigation which he do so much to stimulate descarte illustrious not only as the founder of modern metaphysics but also by he original contribution to science might seek to conciliate the ecclesiastical authority -- he temper be timid -- but he philosophical method be a powerful incentive to rationalistic think the general tendency of superior intellect be to exalt reason at the expense of authority and in england this principle be establish so firmly by locke that throughout the theological warfare of the eighteenth century both party rely on reason and no theologian of repute assume faith to be a higher faculty a striking illustration of the gradual encroachment of reason be the change which be silently work in public opinion on the subject of witchcraft the famous effort of jame i to carry out the biblical command `` thou shalt not suffer a witch to live '' be outdo by the zeal of the puritan under the commonwealth to suppress the wicked old woman who have commerce with satan after the restoration the belief in witchcraft decline among educate people -- though -lrb- 130 -rrb- some able writer maintain it -- and there be few execution the last trial of a witch be in 1712 when some clergyman in hertfordshire prosecute jane wenham the jury find she guilty but the judge who have sum up in she favor be able to procure the remission of she sentence and the law against witchcraft be repeal in 1735 john wesley say with perfect truth that to disbelieve in witchcraft be to disbelieve in the bible in france and in holland the decline of belief and interest in this particular form of satan 's activity be simultaneous in scotland where theology be very powerful a woman be burn in 1722 it can be no mere coincidence that the general decline of this superstition belong to the age which see the rise of modern science and modern philosophy hobbe who be perhaps the most brilliant english thinker of the seventeenth century be a freethinker and materialist he have come under the influence of he friend the french philosopher gassendus who have revive materialism in its epicurean shape yet he be a champion not of freedom of conscience but of coercion in its most uncompromising form in the political theory which he expound in leviathan the sovran have autocratic power in the domain of doctrine -lrb- 131 -rrb- as in everything else and it be the duty of subject to conform to the religion which the sovran impose religious persecution be thus defend but no independent power be leave to the church but the principle on which hobbe build up he theory be rationalistic he separate morality from religion and identify `` the true moral philosophy '' with the `` true doctrine of the law of nature '' what he really think of religion could be infer from he remark that the fanciful fear of thing invisible -lrb- due to ignorance -rrb- be the natural seed of that feeling which in himself a man call religion but in those who fear or worship the invisible power differently superstition in the reign of charle ii hobbe be silence and he book be burn spinoza the jewish philosopher of holland owe a great deal to descarte and -lrb- in political speculation -rrb- to hobbe but he philosophy mean a far wider and more open breach with orthodox opinion than either of he master have venture on he conceive ultimate reality which he call god as a absolutely perfect impersonal be a substance whose nature be constitute by two `` attribute '' -- think and spatial extension when spinoza speak of love of god in which he consider happiness to consist he mean knowledge -lrb- 132 -rrb- and contemplation of the order of nature include human nature which be subject to fix invariable law he reject free-will and the `` superstition '' as he call it of final cause in nature if we want to label he philosophy we may say that it be a form of pantheism it have often be describe as atheism if atheism mean as i suppose in ordinary use it be generally take to mean rejection of a personal god spinoza be a atheist it should be observe that in the seventeenth and eighteenth century atheist be use in the wildest way as a term of abuse for freethinker and when we read of atheist -lrb- except in careful writer -rrb- we may generally assume that the person so stigmatize be really deist that be they believe in a personal god but not in revelation -lrb- 1 -rrb- spinoza 's daring philosophy be not in harmony with the general trend of speculation at the time and do not exert any profound influence on thought till a much later period the thinker whose writings appeal most to the man of he age and be most opportune and effective be john locke who profess more or less orthodox anglicanism he great contribution to philosophy be equivalent to a very powerful defense -lrb- 133 -rrb- of reason against the usurpation of authority the object of he essay on the human understanding -lrb- 1690 -rrb- be to show that all knowledge be derive from experience he subordinate faith completely to reason while he accept the christian revelation he hold that revelation if it contradict the higher tribunal of reason must be reject and that revelation can not give we knowledge as certain as the knowledge which reason give `` he that take away reason to make room for revelation put out the light of both and do much what the same as if he would persuade a man to put out he eye the better to receive the remote light of a invisible star by a telescope '' he write a book to show that the christian revelation be not contrary to reason and its title the reasonableness of christianity sound the note of all religious controversy in england during the next hundred year both the orthodox and they opponent warmly agree that reasonableness be the only test of the claim of reveal religion it be under the direct influence of locke that toland a irishman who have be convert from roman catholicism compose a sensational book christianity not mysterious -lrb- 1696 -rrb- he assume that christianity be true and argue that there can be no mystery in it because mystery that -lrb- 134 -rrb- be unintelligible dogma can not be accept by reason and if a reasonable deity give a revelation its purpose must be to enlighten not to puzzle the assumption of the truth of christianity be a mere pretence as a intelligent reader could not fail to see the work be important because it draw the logical inference from locke 's philosophy and it have a wide circulation lady mary wortley montagu meet a turkish effendi at belgrade who ask she for news of mr toland it be characteristic of this stage of the struggle between reason and authority that -lrb- except the lead french thinker in the eighteenth century -rrb- the rationalist who attack theology generally feign to acknowledge the truth of the idea which they be assail they pretend that they speculation do not affect religion they could separate the domain of reason and of faith they could show that revelation be superfluous without question it they could do homage to orthodoxy and lay down view with which orthodoxy be irreconcilable the error which they expose in the sphere of reason be ironically allow to be truth in the sphere of theology the mediaeval principle of double truth and other shift be resort to in self-protection -lrb- 135 -rrb- against the tyranny of orthodoxy -- though they do not always avail and in read much of the rationalistic literature of this period we have to read between the line bayle be a interesting instance if locke 's philosophy by set authority in its place and derive all knowledge from experience be a powerful aid to rationalism he contemporary bayle work in the same direction by the investigation of history drive from france -lrb- see above p 107 -rrb- he live at amsterdam where he publish he philosophical dictionary he be really a freethinker but he never drop the disguise of orthodoxy and this lend a particular piquancy to he work he take a delight in marshal all the objection which heretic have make to essential christian dogma he expose without mercy the crime and brutality of david and show that this favorite of the almighty be a person with whom one would refuse to shake hand there be a great outcry at this unedifying candor bayle in reply adopt the attitude of montaigne and pascal and oppose faith to reason the theological virtue of faith he say consist in believe reveal truth simply and solely on god 's authority if you believe in the immortality of the soul for -lrb- 136 -rrb- philosophical reason you be orthodox but you have no part in faith the merit of faith become greater in proportion as the reveal truth surpass all the power of we mind the more incomprehensible the truth and the more repugnant to reason the greater be the sacrifice we make in accept it the deeper we submission to god therefore a merciless inventory of the objection which reason have to urge against fundamental doctrine serve to exalt the merit of faith the dictionary be also criticize for the justice do to the moral excellency of person who deny the existence of god bayle reply that if he have be able to find any atheistical thinker who live bad life he would have be delighted to dwell on they vice but he know of none such as for the criminal you meet in history whose abominable action make you tremble they impiety and blasphemy prove they believe in a divinity this be a natural consequence of the theological doctrine that the devil who be incapable of atheism be the instigator of all the sin of man for man 's wickedness must clearly resemble that of the devil and must therefore be join to a belief in god 's existence since the devil be not a atheist and be it not a proof of the infinite wisdom of god that the worst criminal -lrb- 137 -rrb- be not atheist and that most of the atheist whose name be record have be honest man by this arrangement providence set bound to the corruption of man for if atheism and moral wickedness be unite in the same person the society of earth would be expose to a fatal inundation of sin there be much more in the same vein and the upshot be under the thin veil of serve faith to show that the christian dogma be essentially unreasonable bayle 's work mark by scholarship and extraordinary learning have a great influence in england as well as in france it supply weapon to assailant of christianity in both country at first the assault be carry on with most vigor and ability by the english deist who though they writings be little read now do memorable work by they polemic against the authority of reveal religion the controversy between the deist and they orthodox opponent turn on the question whether the deity of natural religion -- the god whose existence as be think could be prove by reason -- can be identify with the author of the christian revelation to the deist this seem impossible the nature of the alleged revelation seem inconsistent with the character -lrb- 138 -rrb- of the god to whom reason point the defender of revelation at least all the most competent agree with the deist in make reason supreme and through this reliance on reason some of they fall into heresy clarke for instance one of the ablest be very unsound on the dogma of the trinity it be also to be notice that with both section the interest of morality be the principal motive the orthodox hold that the reveal doctrine of future reward and punishment be necessary for morality the deist that morality depend on reason alone and that revelation contain a great deal that be repugnant to moral ideal throughout the eighteenth century morality be the guide consideration with anglican churchman and religious emotion finding no satisfaction within the church be drive as it be outside and seek a outlet in the methodism of wesley and whitefield spinoza have lay down the principle that scripture must be interpret like any other book -lrb- 1670 -rrb- -lrb- 2 -rrb- and with the deist this principle be fundamental in order to avoid persecution they generally veil they conclusion -lrb- 139 -rrb- under sufficiently thin disguise hitherto the press licensing act -lrb- 1662 -rrb- have very effectually prevent the publication of heterodox work and it be from orthodox work denounce infidel opinion that we know how rationalism be spread but in 1695 the press law be allow to drop and immediately deistic literature begin to appear there be however the danger of prosecution under the blasphemy law there be three legal weapon for coerce those who attack christianity : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the ecclesiastical court have and have the power of imprison for a maximum term of six month for atheism blasphemy heresy and damnable opinion -lrb- 2 -rrb- the common law as interpret by lord chief justice hale in 1676 when a certain taylor be charge with have say that religion be a cheat and blaspheme against christ the accuse be condemn to a fine and the pillory by the judge who rule that the court of king 's bench have jurisdiction in such a case inasmuch as blasphemous word of the kind be a offence against the law and the state and to speak against christianity be to speak in subversion of the law since christianity be `` parcel of the law of england '' -lrb- 3 -rrb- the statute of 1698 enact that if any person educate in the christian religion `` shall by -lrb- 140 -rrb- write printing teaching or advise speak deny any one of the person in the holy trinity to be god or shall assert or maintain there be more god than one or shall deny the christian religion to be true or shall deny the holy scripture of the old and new testament to be of divine authority '' be convict he shall for the first offence be adjudge incapable to hold any public office or employment and on the second shall lose he civil rights and be imprison for three year this statute expressly state as its motive the fact that `` many person have of late year openly avowed and publish many blasphemous and impious opinion contrary to the doctrine and principle of the christian religion '' as a matter of fact most trial for blasphemy during the past two hundred year fall under the second head but the new statute of 1698 be very intimidating and we can easily understand how it drive heterodox writer to ambiguous disguise one of these disguise be allegorical interpretation of scripture they show that literal interpretation lead to absurdity or to inconsistency with the wisdom and justice of god and pretend to infer that allegorical interpretation must be substitute but they mean the reader to reject they pretended -lrb- 141 -rrb- solution and draw a conclusion damaging to revelation among the argument use in favor of the truth of revelation the fulfilment of prophecy and the miracle of the new testament be conspicuous anthony collin a country gentleman who be a disciple of locke publish in 1733 he discourse on the grounds and reason of the christian religion in which he drastically expose the weakness of the evidence for fulfilment of prophecy depend as it do on force and unnatural figurative interpretation twenty year before he have write a discourse of free-thinking -lrb- in which bayle 's influence be evident -rrb- plead for free discussion and the reference of all religious question to reason he complain of the general intolerance which prevail but the same fact which testify to intolerance testify also to the spread of unbelief collin escape with comparative impunity but thoma woolston a fellow of sidney sussex college cambridge who write six aggressive discourse on the miracle of we savior -lrb- 1727 -- 1730 -rrb- pay the penalty for he audacity deprive of he fellowship he be prosecute for libel and sentence to a fine of # 100 and a year 's imprisonment unable to pay he die in prison he do -lrb- 142 -rrb- not adopt the line of argue that miracle be incredible or impossible he examine the chief miracle relate in the gospel and show with great ability and shrewd common sense that they be absurd or unworthy of the performer he point out as huxley be to point out in a controversy with gladstone that the miraculous driving of devil into a herd of swine be a unwarrantable injury to somebody 's property on the story of the divine blasting of the fig tree he remark : `` what if a yeoman of kent should go to look for pippin in he orchard at easter -lrb- the suppose time that jesus seek for these fig -rrb- and because of a disappointment cut down he tree what then would he neighbor make of he nothing less than a laughing-stock and if the story get into we publick news he would be the jest and ridicule of mankind '' or take he comment on the miracle of the pool of bethesda where a angel use to trouble the water and the man who first enter the pool be cure of he infirmity `` a odd and a merry way of confer a divine mercy and one would think that the angel of god do this for they own diversion more than to do good to mankind just as some throw a bone among a kennel of hound for the pleasure of see they -lrb- 143 -rrb- quarrel for it or as other cast a piece of money among a company of boy for the sport of see they scramble for it so be the pastime of the angel here '' in deal with the healing of the woman who suffer from a bloody flux he ask : `` what if we have be tell of the pope 's cure a hemorrhage like this before we what would protestant have say to it why ` that a foolish credulous and superstitious woman have fancy herself cure of some slight indisposition and the crafty pope and he adherent aspire after popular applause magnify the presumed cure into a miracle ' the application of such a suppose story of a miracle work by the pope be easy and if infidel jew and mahometan who have no better opinion of jesus than we have of the pope should make it there be no help for it '' woolston profess no doubt of the inspiration of scripture while he argue that it be out of the question to suppose the miracle literally true he pretend to believe in the fantastic theory that they be intend allegorically as figure of christ 's mysterious operation in the soul of man origen a not very orthodox christian father have employ the allegorical method and woolston quote he in he favor he -lrb- 144 -rrb- vigorous criticism vary in value but many of they hit the nail on the head and the fashion of some modern critic to pass over woolston 's production as unimportant because they be `` ribald '' or coarse be perfectly unjust the pamphlet have a enormous sale and woolston 's notoriety be illustrate by the anecdote of the `` jolly young woman '' who meet he walk abroad and accost he with `` you old rogue be you not hang yet '' mr woolston answer `` good woman i know you not pray what have i do to offend you '' `` you have writ against my savior '' she say `` what would become of my poor sinful soul if it be not for my dear savior '' about the same time matthew tindal -lrb- a fellow of all soul -rrb- attack revelation from a more general point of view in he christianity as old as the creation -lrb- 1730 -rrb- he undertake to show that the bible as a revelation be superfluous for it add nothing to natural religion which god reveal to man from the very first by the sole light of reason he argue that those who defend reveal religion by its agreement with natural religion and thus set up a double government of reason and authority fall between the two `` it be a odd jumble '' he observe `` to prove the truth of a book by the truth -lrb- 145 -rrb- of the doctrine it contain and at the same time conclude those doctrine to be true because contain in that book '' he go on to criticize the bible in detail in order to maintain its infallibility without do violence to reason you have when you find irrational statement to torture they and depart from the literal sense would you think that a mohammedan be govern by he koran who on all occasion depart from the literal sense `` nay would you not tell he that he inspired book fall infinitely short of cicero 's uninspired writings where there be no such occasion to recede from the letter '' as to chronological and physical error which seem to endanger the infallibility of the scripture a bishop have meet the argument by say reasonably enough that in the bible god speak accord to the conception of those to whom he speak and that it be not the business of revelation to rectify they opinion in such matter tindal make this rejoinder : -- `` be there no difference between god 's not rectify man 's sentiment in those matter and use himself such sentiment as need be rectify or between god 's not mend man 's logic and rhetoric where ' t be defective and use such himself or between god 's -lrb- 146 -rrb- not contradict vulgar notion and confirm they by speak accord to they can infinite wisdom despair of gain or keep people 's affection without have recourse to such mean act '' he expose with considerable effect the monstrosity of the doctrine of exclusive salvation must we not consider he ask whether one can be say to be send as a savior of mankind if he come to shut heaven 's gate against those to whom before he come it be open provide they follow the dictate of they reason he criticize the inconsistency of the impartial and universal goodness of god know to we by the light of nature with act commit by jehovah or he prophet take the case in which the order of nature be violate to punish man for crime of which they be not guilty such as elijah 's hinder rain from fall for three year and a half if god could break in upon the ordinary rule of he providence to punish the innocent for the guilty we have no guarantee that if he deal thus with we in this life he will not act in the same way in the life to come `` since if the eternal rule of justice be once break how can we imagine any stop '' but the ideal of holiness and justice in the old testament be strange indeed the holier man -lrb- 147 -rrb- be represent to be the more cruel they seem and the more addict to cursing how surprising to find the holy prophet elisha cursing in the name of the lord little child for call he bald - pate and what be still more surprising two she-bear immediately devour forty-two little child i have remark that theologian at this time generally take the line of base christianity on reason and not on faith a interesting little book christianity not found on argument couch in the form of a letter to a young gentleman at oxford by henry dodwell -lrb- junior -rrb- appear in 1741 and point out the danger of such confidence in reason it be a ironical development of the principle of bayle work out the thesis that christianity be essentially unreasonable and that if you want to believe reasoning be fatal the cultivation of faith and reasoning produce contrary effect the philosopher be disqualify for divine influence by he very progress in carnal wisdom the gospel must be receive with all the obsequious submission of a babe who have no other disposition but to learn he lesson christ do not propose he doctrine to investigation he do not lay the argument for he mission before he disciple and give they time to consider -lrb- 148 -rrb- calmly of they force and liberty to determine as they reason should direct they the apostle have no qualification for the task be the most artless and illiterate person live dodwell expose the absurdity of the protestant position to give all man liberty to judge for themselves and to expect at the same time that they shall be of the preacher 's mind be such a scheme for unanimity as one would scarcely imagine any one could be weak enough to devise in speculation and much less that any could ever be find hardy enough to avow and propose it to practice the man of rome `` shall rise up in the judgment -lrb- of all consider person -rrb- against this generation and shall condemn it for they invent but the one absurdity of infallibility and behold a greater absurdity than infallibility be here '' i have still to speak of the -lrb- third -rrb- earl of shaftesbury whose style have rescue he writings from entire neglect he special interest be ethic while the valuable work of most of the heterodox writer of this period lay in they destructive criticism of supernatural religion they cling as we have see to what be call natural religion -- the belief in a kind and wise personal god who create the world govern it by natural law and desire we happiness the idea -lrb- 149 -rrb- be derive from ancient philosopher and have be revive by lord herbert of cherbury in he latin treatise on truth -lrb- in the reign of jame i -rrb- the deist contend that this be a sufficient basis for morality and that the christian inducement to good behavior be unnecessary shaftesbury in he inquiry concern virtue -lrb- 1699 -rrb- debate the question and argue that the scheme of heaven and hell with the selfish hope and fear which they inspire corrupt morality and that the only worthy motive for conduct be the beauty of virtue in itself he do not even consider deism a necessary assumption for a moral code he admit that the opinion of atheist do not undermine ethic but he think that the belief in a good governor of the universe be a powerful support to the practice of virtue he be a thorough optimist and be perfectly satisfy with the admirable adaptation of means to end whereby it be the function of one animal to be food for another he make no attempt to reconcile the red claw and tooth of nature with the beneficence of its powerful artist `` in the main all thing be kindly and well disposed '' the atheist might have say that he prefer to be at the mercy of blind chance than in the hand of a autocrat who if he please lord shaftesbury 's sense -lrb- 150 -rrb- of order have create fly to be devour by spider but this be a aspect of the universe which do not much trouble thinker in the eighteenth century on the other hand the character of the god of the old testament rouse shaftesbury 's aversion he attack scripture not directly but by allusion or with irony he hint that if there be a god he would be less displeased with atheist than with those who accept he in the guise of jehovah as plutarch say `` i have rather man should say of I that there neither be nor ever be such a one as plutarch than they should say ` there be a plutarch a unsteady changeable easily provokable and revengeful man ' '' shaftesbury 's significance be that he build up a positive theory of moral and although it have no philosophical depth he influence on french and german thinker of the eighteenth century be immense in some way perhaps the ablest of the deist and certainly the most scholarly be rev conyer middleton who remain within the church he support christianity on grounds of utility even if it be a imposture he say it would be wrong to destroy it for it be establish by law and it have a long tradition behind it some traditional religion be necessary and it would -lrb- 151 -rrb- be hopeless to supplant christianity by reason but he writings contain effective argument which go to undermine revelation the most important be he free inquiry into christian miracle -lrb- 1748 -rrb- which put in a new and dangerous light a old question : at what time do the church cease to have the power of perform miracle we shall see presently how gibbon apply middleton 's method the lead adversary of the deist appeal like they to reason and in appeal to reason do much to undermine authority the ablest defense of the faith bishop butler 's analogy -lrb- 1736 -rrb- be suspect of have raise more doubt than it appease this be the experience of william pitt the younger and the analogy make jame mill -lrb- the utilitarian -rrb- a unbeliever the deist argue that the unjust and cruel god of revelation could not be the god of nature butler point to nature and say there you behold cruelty and injustice the argument be perfectly good against the optimism of shaftesbury but it plainly admit of the conclusion -- opposite to that which butler wish to establish -- that a just and beneficent god do not exist butler be drive to fall back on the sceptical argument that we be extremely ignorant that all thing -lrb- 152 -rrb- be possible even eternal hell fire and that therefore the safe and prudent course be to accept the christian doctrine it may be remark that this reasoning with a few modification could be use in favor of other religion at mecca or at timbuctoo he have in effect revive the argument use by pascal that if there be one chance in any very large number that christianity be true it be a man 's interest to be a christian for if it prove false it will do he no harm to have believe it if it prove true he will be infinitely the gainer butler seek indeed to show that the chance in favor amount to a probability but he argument be essentially of the same intellectual and moral value as pascal 's it have be point out that it lead by a easy logical step from the anglican to the roman church catholic and protestant -lrb- as king henry iv of france argue -rrb- agree that a catholic may be save the catholic assert that a protestant will be damned therefore the safe course be to embrace catholicism -lrb- 3 -rrb- i have dwell at some length upon some of the english deist because while they occupy a important place in the history of -lrb- 153 -rrb- rationalism in england they also supply along with bayle a great deal of the thought which manipulate by brilliant writer on the other side of the channel capture the educate class in france we be now in the age of voltaire he be a convinced deist he consider that the nature of the universe prove that it be make by a conscious architect he hold that god be require in the interest of conduct and he ardently combate atheism he great achievement be he efficacious labor in the cause of toleration and he systematic warfare against superstition he be profoundly influence by english thinker especially locke and bolingbroke this statesman have conceal he infidelity during he lifetime except from he intimate he have live long as a exile in france and he rationalistic essay be publish -lrb- 1754 -rrb- after he death voltaire whose literary genius convert the work of the english thinker into a world-force do not begin he campaign against christianity till after the middle of the century when superstitious practice and religious persecution be become a scandal in he country he assail the catholic church in every field with ridicule and satire in a little work call the tomb of fanaticism -lrb- write 1736 -lrb- 154 -rrb- publish 1767 -rrb- he begin by observe that a man who accept he religion -lrb- as most people do -rrb- without examine it be like a ox which allow itself to be harness and proceed to review the difficulty in the bible the rise of christianity and the course of church history from which he conclude that every sensible man should hold the christian sect in horror `` man be blind to prefer a absurd and sanguinary creed support by executioner and surround by fiery faggot a creed which can only be approve by those to whom it give power and riches a particular creed only accept in a small part of the world -- to a simple and universal religion '' in the sermon of the fifty and the question of zapa we can see what he owe to bayle and english critic but he touch be lighter and he irony more tell he comment on geographical mistake in the old testament be : `` god be evidently not strong in geography '' have call attention to the `` horrible crime '' of lot 's wife in look backward and she conversion into a pillar of salt he hope that the story of scripture will make we better if they do not make we more enlighten one of he favorite method be to approach christian doctrine as a person who have just hear of the existence of christian or jew for the first time in he life -lrb- 155 -rrb- he drama saul -lrb- 1763 -rrb- which the police try to suppress present the career of david the man after god 's own heart in all its naked horror the scene in which samuel reprove saul for not have slay agag will give a idea of the spirit of the piece samuel : god command I to tell you that he repent of have make you king saul : god repent only they who commit error repent he eternal wisdom can not be unwise god can not commit error samuel : he can repent of have set on the throne those who do saul : well who do not tell I what be my fault samuel : you have pardon a king agag : what be the fairest of virtue consider a crime in judea samuel -lrb- to agag -rrb- : silence do not blaspheme -lrb- to saul -rrb- saul formerly king of the jew do not god command you by my mouth to destroy all the amalekite without spare woman or maiden or child at the breast agag : you god -- give such a command you be mistaken you mean to say you devil samuel : saul do you obey god saul : i do not suppose such a command -lrb- 156 -rrb- be positive i think that goodness be the first attribute of the supreme be and that a compassionate heart could not displease he samuel : you be mistaken unbeliever god reprove you you sceptre will pass into other hand perhaps no writer have ever rouse more hatred in christendom than voltaire he be look on as a sort of anti-christ that be natural he attack be so tremendously effective at the time but he have be sometimes decry on the ground that he only demolish and make no effort to build up where he have pull down this be a narrow complaint it might be reply that when a sewer be spread plague in a town we can not wait to remove it till we have a new system of drain and it may fairly be say that religion as practice in contemporary france be a poisonous sewer but the true answer be that knowledge and therefore civilization be advance by criticism and negation as well as by construction and positive discovery when a man have the talent to attack with effect falsehood prejudice and imposture it be he duty if there be any social duty to use it for constructive thinking we must go to the other great leader of french thought -lrb- 157 -rrb- rousseau who contribute to the growth of freedom in a different way he be a deist but he deism unlike that of voltaire be religious and emotional he regard christianity with a sort of reverent scepticism but he thought be revolutionary and repugnant to orthodoxy it make against authority in every sphere and it have a enormous influence the clergy perhaps dread he theory more than the scoff and negation of voltaire for some year he be a fugitive on the face of the earth mile he brilliant contribution to the theory of education appear in 1762 it contain some remarkable page on religion `` the profession of faith of a savoyard vicar '' in which the author 's deistic faith be strongly affirm and revelation and theology reject the book be publicly burn in pari and a order issue for rousseau 's arrest force by he friend to flee he be debar from return to geneva for the government of that canton follow the example of pari he seek refuge in the canton of bern and be order to quit he then flee to the principality of neufchtel which belong to prussia frederick the great the one really tolerant ruler of the age give he protection but he be persecute and calumniate by the local clergy who but for frederick would -lrb- 158 -rrb- have expel he and he go to england for a few month -lrb- 1766 -rrb- then return to france where he be leave unmolested till he death the religious view of rousseau be only a minor point in he heretical speculation it be by he daring social and political theory that he set the world on fire he social contract in which these theory be set forth be burn at geneva though he principle will not stand criticism for a moment and though he doctrine work mischief by its extraordinary power of turn man into fanatic yet it contribute to progress by help to discredit privilege and to establish the view that the object of a state be to secure the wellbeing of all its member deism -- whether in the semi-christian form of rousseau or the anti- christian form of voltaire -- be a house build on the sand and thinker arise in france england and germany to shatter its foundation in france it prove to be only a half-way inn to atheism in 1770 french reader be startle by the appearance of baron d?holbach 's system of nature in which god 's existence and the immortality of the soul be deny and the world declare to be matter spontaneously move holbach be a friend of diderot who have also come to reject deism all the lead -lrb- 159 -rrb- idea in the revolt against the church have a place in diderot 's great work the encyclopedia in which a number of lead thinker collaborate with he it be not merely a scientific book of reference it be representative of the whole movement of the enemy of faith it be intend to lead man from christianity with its original sin to a new conception of the world as a place which can be make agreeable and in which the actual evil be due not to radical fault of human nature but to perverse institution and perverse education to divert interest from the dogma of religion to the improvement of society to persuade the world that man 's felicity depend not on revelation but on social transformation -- this be what diderot and rousseau in they different way do so much to effect and they work influence those who do not abandon orthodoxy it affect the spirit of the church itself contrast the catholic church in france in the eighteenth and in the nineteenth century without the work of voltaire rousseau diderot and they fellow-combatant would it have be reform `` the christian church '' -lrb- i quote lord morley -rrb- `` be assimilate as rapidly as they formula will permit the new light and the more generous moral idea and the higher spirituality of -lrb- 160 -rrb- teacher who have abandon all church and who be systematically denounce as enemy of the soul of man '' in england the prevalent deistic thought do not lead to the same intellectual consequence as in france yet hume the greatest english philosopher of the century show that the argument commonly adduce for a personal god be untenable i may first speak of he discussion on miracle in he essay on miracle and in he philosophical inquiry concern human understanding -lrb- 1748 -rrb- hitherto the credibility of miracle have not be submit to a general examination independent of theological assumption hume point out that there must be a uniform experience against every miraculous event -lrb- otherwise it would not merit the name of miracle -rrb- and that it will require stronger testimony to establish a miracle than a event which be not contrary to experience lay down the general maxim that `` no testimony be sufficient to establish a miracle unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavor to establish '' but as a matter of fact no testimony exist of which the falsehood would be a prodigy we can not find in history any miracle attest by a sufficient number of man of such unquestionable good -lrb- 161 -rrb- sense education and learning as to secure we against all delusion in themselves of such undoubted integrity as to place they beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive other of such credit in the eye of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of they be detect in any falsehood and at the same time attesting fact perform in such a public manner as to render detection unavoidable -- all which circumstance be requisite to give we a full assurance in the testimony of man in the dialogue on natural religion which be not publish till after he death -lrb- 1776 -rrb- hume make a attack on the `` argument from design '' on which deist and christian alike rely to prove the existence of a deity the argument be that the world present clear mark of design endless adaptation of means to end which can only be explain as due to the deliberate plan of a powerful intelligence hume dispute the inference on the ground that a mere intelligent being be not a sufficient cause to explain the effect for the argument must be that the system of the material world demand as a cause a corresponding system of interconnected idea but such a mental system would demand a explanation of its existence just as much as the material world and thus we find ourselves -lrb- 162 -rrb- commit to a endless series of cause but in any case even if the argument hold it would prove only the existence of a deity whose power though superior to man 's might be very limited and whose workmanship might be very imperfect for this world may be very faulty compare to a superior standard it may be the first rude experiment `` of some infant deity who afterwards abandon it ashamed of he lame performance '' or the work of some inferior deity at which he superior would scoff or the production of some old superannuated deity which since he death have pursue a adventurous career from the first impulse which he give it a argument which leave such deity in the running be worse than useless for the purpose of deism or of christianity the sceptical philosophy of hume have less influence on the general public than gibbon 's decline and fall of the roman empire of the numerous freethinking book that appear in england in the eighteenth century this be the only one which be still a widely read classic in what a lady friend of dr johnson call `` the two offensive chapter '' -lrb- xv and xvi -rrb- the cause of the rise and success of christianity be for the first time critically investigate as a simple historical phenomenon like most freethinker of the -lrb- 163 -rrb- time gibbon think it well to protect himself and he work against the possibility of prosecution by pay ironical lip-homage to the orthodox creed but even if there have be no such danger he could not have choose a more incisive weapon for he merciless criticism of orthodox opinion than the irony which he wield with superb ease have point out that the victory of christianity be obviously and satisfactorily explain by the convincing evidence of the doctrine and by the ruling providence of its great author he proceed `` with become submission '' to inquire into the secondary cause he trace the history of the faith up to the time of constantine in such a way as clearly to suggest that the hypothesis of divine interposition be superfluous and that we have to do with a purely human development he marshal with ironical protest the obvious objection to the alleged evidence for supernatural control he do not himself criticize mose and the prophet but he reproduce the objection which be make against they authority by `` the vain science of the gnostic '' he note that the doctrine of immortality be omit in the law of mose but this doubtless be a mysterious dispensation of providence we can not entirely remove `` the imputation of ignorance and -lrb- 164 -rrb- obscurity which have be so arrogantly cast on the first proselyte of christianity '' but we must `` convert the occasion of scandal into a subject of edification '' and remember that `` the lower we depress the temporal condition of the first christian the more reason we shall find to admire they merit and success '' gibbon 's treatment of miracle from the purely historical point of view -lrb- he owe a great deal to middleton see above p 150 -rrb- be particularly disconcerting in the early age of christianity `` the law of nature be frequently suspend for the benefit of the church but the sage of greece and rome turn aside from the awful spectacle and pursue the ordinary occupation of life and study appear unconscious of any alteration in the moral or physical government of the world under the reign of tiberius the whole earth or at least a celebrated province of the roman empire be involve in a praeternatural darkness of three hour even this miraculous event which ought to have excite the wonder the curiosity and the devotion of mankind pass without notice in a age of science and history it happen during the lifetime of seneca and the elder pliny who must have experience the immediate effect or receive the earliest intelligence of the prodigy each of these -lrb- 165 -rrb- philosopher in a laborious work have record all the great phenomenon of nature earthquake meteor comet and eclipse which he indefatigable curiosity could collect both the one and the other have omit to mention the greatest phenomenon to which the mortal eye have be witness since the creation of the globe '' how `` shall we excuse the supine inattention of the pagan and philosophic world to those evidence which be present by the hand of omnipotence not to they reason but to they sens '' again if every believer be convince of the reality of miracle every reasonable man be convince of they cessation yet every age bear testimony to miracle and the testimony seem no less respectable than that of the precede generation when do they cease how be it that the generation which see the last genuine miracle perform could not distinguish they from the imposture which follow have man so soon forget `` the style of the divine artist '' the inference be that genuine and spurious miracle be indistinguishable but the credulity or `` softness of temper '' among early believer be beneficial to the cause of truth and religion `` in modern time a latent and even involuntary scepticism adhere to the most pious disposition they -lrb- 166 -rrb- admission of supernatural truth be much less a active consent than a cold and passive acquiescence accustomed long since to observe and to respect the invariable order of nature we reason or at least we imagination be not sufficiently prepare to sustain the visible action of the deity '' gibbon have not the advantage of the minute critical labor which in the following century be expend on he source of information but he masterly exposure of the conventional history of the early church remain in many of its most important point perfectly valid to-day i suspect that he artillery have produce more effect on intelligent mind in subsequent generation than the archery of voltaire for he book become indispensable as the great history of the middle age the most orthodox could not do without it and the poison must have often work we have see how theological controversy in the first half of the eighteenth century have turn on the question whether the reveal religion be consistent and compatible with natural religion the deistic attack on this line be almost exhaust by the middle of the century and the orthodox think that they have be satisfactorily answer but it be not enough to show that the revelation -lrb- 167 -rrb- be reasonable it be necessary to prove that it be real and rest on a solid historical basis this be the question raise in a acute form by the criticism of hume and middleton -lrb- 1748 -rrb- on miracle the ablest answer be give by paley in he evidence of christianity -lrb- 1794 -rrb- the only one of the apology of that age which be still read though it have cease to have any value paley 's theology illustrate how orthodox opinion be color unconsciously by the spirit of the time he prove -lrb- in he natural theology -rrb- the existence of god by the argument from design -- without take any account of the criticism of hume on that argument just as a watchmaker be infer from a watch so a divine workman be infer from contrivance in nature paley take he instance of such contrivance largely from the organ and constitution of the human body he idea of god be that of a ingenious contriver deal with rather obstinate material paley 's `` god '' -lrb- mr leslie stephen remark -rrb- `` have be civilized like man he have become scientific and ingenious he be superior to watt or priestley in devise mechanical and chemical contrivance and be therefore make in the image of that generation of which watt and priestley be conspicuous light '' when a god of this kind -lrb- 168 -rrb- be establish there be no difficulty about miracle and it be on miracle that paley basis the case for christianity -- all other argument be subsidiary and he proof of the new testament miracle be that the apostle who be eye-witness believe in they for otherwise they would not have act and suffer in the cause of they new religion paley 's defense be the performance of a able legal adviser to the almighty the list of the english deistic writer of the eighteenth century close with one whose name be more familiar than any of he predecessor thoma paine a norfolk man he migrate to america and play a leading part in the revolution then he return to england and in 1791 publish he rights of man in two part i have be consider almost exclusively freedom of think in religion because it may be take as the thermometer for freedom of think in general at this period it be as dangerous to publish revolutionary opinion in politics as in theology paine be a enthusiastic admirer of the american constitution and a supporter of the french revolution -lrb- in which also he be to play a part -rrb- he rights of man be a indictment of the monarchical form of government and a plea for representative democracy it have a enormous -lrb- 169 -rrb- sale a cheap edition be issue and the government finding

commit a new offence by the publication of a anti-christian work the age of reason -lrb- 1794 and 1796 -rrb- which he begin to write in the pari prison into which he have be throw by robespierre this book be remarkable as the first important english publication in which the christian scheme of salvation and the bible be assail in plain language without any disguise or reserve in the second place it be write in such a way as to reach the mass and thirdly while the criticism on the bible be in the same vein as those of the earlier deist paine be the first to present with force the incongruity of the christian scheme with the conception of the universe attain by astronomical science -lrb- 171 -rrb- `` though it be not a direct article of the christian system that this world that we inhabit

once little and ridiculous and scatter it in the mind like feather in the air the two belief can not be hold together in the same mind and he who think that he believe both have think but little of either '' as a ardent deist who regard nature as god 's revelation paine be able to press this argument with particular force refer to some of the tale in the old testament he say : `` when we contemplate the immensity of that be who direct and govern the incomprehensible whole of which the utmost ken of human sight can discover but a part we ought to feel shame at call such paltry story the word of god '' the book draw a reply from bishop watson one of those admirable eighteenth-century divine who admit the right of private judgment and think that argument -lrb- 172 -rrb- should be meet by argument and not by force he reply have the rather significant title a apology for the bible george iii remark that he be not aware that any apology be need for that book it be a weak defense but be remarkable for the concession which it make to several of paine 's criticism of scripture -- admission which be calculate to damage the doctrine of the infallibility of the bible it be doubtless in consequence of the enormous circulation of the age of reason that a society for the suppression of vice decide to prosecute the publisher unbelief be common among the ruling class but the view be firmly hold that religion be necessary for the populace and that any attempt to disseminate unbelief among the lower class must be suppress religion be regard as a valuable instrument to keep the poor in order it be notable that of the earlier rationalist -lrb- apart from the case of woolston -rrb- the only one who be punish be peter annet a schoolmaster who try to popularize freethought

if he publisher suffer in england the author himself suffer in america where bigotry do all it could to make the last year of he life bitter the age of enlightenment begin in germany in the middle of the eighteenth century in most of the german state think be considerably less free than in england under frederick the great 's father the philosopher wolff be banish from prussium for accord to the moral teaching of the chinese sage confucius a praise which it be think ought to be reserve for christianity he return after the accession of frederick under whose tolerant rule prussium be a asylum for those writer who suffer for they opinion in neighbouring state frederick indeed hold the view which be hold by so many english rationalist of the time and be still hold widely enough that freethought be not desirable for the multitude because they be incapable of understand philosophy germany feel the influence of the english deist of the french freethinker and of spinoza but in the german rationalistic propaganda of this period there be nothing very original or interesting -lrb- 175 -rrb- the name of edelmann and bahrdt may be mention the work of edelmann who attack the inspiration of the bible be burn in various city and he be force to seek frederick 's protection at berlin bahrdt be more aggressive than any other writer of the time originally a preacher it be by slow degree that he move away from the orthodox faith he translation of the new testament cut short he ecclesiastical career he last year be spend as a inn-keeper he writings for instance he popular letter on the bible must have have a considerable effect if we may judge by the hatred which he excite among theologian it be not however in direct rationalistic propaganda but in literature and philosophy that the german enlightenment of this century express itself the most illustrious man of letter goethe -lrb- who be profoundly influence by spinoza -rrb- and schiller stand outside the church and the effect of they writings and of the whole literary movement of the time make for the freest treatment of human experience one german thinker shake the world -- the philosopher kant he critic of pure reason demonstrate that when we attempt to prove by the fight of the intellect the existence of -lrb- 176 -rrb- god and the immortality of the soul we fall helplessly into contradiction he destructive criticism of the argument from design and all natural theology be more complete than that of hume and he philosophy different though he system be issue in the same practical result as that of locke to confine knowledge to experience it be true that afterwards in the interest of ethic he try to smuggle in by a back-door the deity whom he have turn out by the front gate but the attempt be not a success he philosophy -- while it lead to new speculative system in which the name of god be use to mean something very different from the deistic conception -- be a significant step further in the deliverance of reason from the yoke of authority -lrb- 1 -rrb- for the sake of simplicity i use `` deist '' in this sense throughout though `` theist '' be now the usual term -lrb- 2 -rrb- spinoza 's theological political treatise which deal with the interpretation of scripture be translate into english in 1689 -lrb- 3 -rrb- see benn rationalism in the nineteenth century vol i p 138 seq for a good exposure of the fallacy and sophistry of butler chapter vii the progress of rationalism -lrb- nineteenth century -rrb- modern science herald by the research of copernicus be found in the seventeenth century which see the demonstration of the copernican theory the discovery of gravitation the discovery of the circulation of the blood and the foundation -lrb- 177 -rrb- of modern chemistry and physics the true nature of comet be ascertain and they cease to be regard as sign of heavenly wrath but several generation be to pass before science become in protestant country a involuntary arch-enemy of theology till the nineteenth century it be only in minor point such as the movement of the earth that prove scientific fact seem to conflict with scripture and it be easy enough to explain away these inconsistency by a new interpretation of the sacred text yet remarkable fact be accumulate which though not explain by science seem to menace the credibility of biblical history if the story of noah 's ark and the flood be true how be it that beast unable to swim or fly inhabit america and the island of the ocean and what about the new species which be constantly be find in the new world and do not exist in the old where do the kangaroo of australia drop from the only explanation compatible with receive theology seem to be the hypothesis of innumerable new act of creation later than the flood it be in the field of natural history that scientific man of the eighteenth century suffer most from the coercion of authority linnaeus feel it in sweden buffon -lrb- 178 -rrb- in france buffon be compel to retract hypothesis which he put forward about the formation of the earth in he natural history -lrb- 1749 -rrb- and to state that he believe implicitly in the bible account of creation at the beginning of the nineteenth century laplace work out the mechanic of the universe on the nebular hypothesis he result dispense as he say to napoleon with the hypothesis of god and be duly denounce he theory involve a long physical process before the earth and solar system come to be form but this be not fatal for a little ingenuity might preserve the credit of the first chapter of genesis geology be to prove a more formidable enemy to the biblical story of the creation and the deluge the theory of a french naturalist -lrb- cuvier -rrb- that the earth have repeatedly experience catastrophe each of which necessitate a new creative act help for a time to save the belief in divine intervention and lyell in he principle of geology -lrb- 1830 -rrb- while he undermine the assumption of catastrophe by show that the earth 's history could be explain by the ordinary process which we still see in operation yet hold fast to successive act of creation it be not till 1863 that he present fully in he antiquity of man the -lrb- 179 -rrb- evidence which show that the human race have inhabit the earth for a far longer period than could be reconcile with the record of scripture that record might be adapt to the result of science in regard not only to the earth itself but also to the plant and lower animal by explain the word `` day '' in the jewish story of creation to signify some long period of time but this way out be impossible in the case of the creation of man for the sacred chronology be quite definite a english divine of the seventeenth century ingeniously calculate that man be create by the trinity on October 23 bc 4004 at 9 o?clock in the morning and no reckoning of the bible date could put the event much further back other evidence reinforce the conclusion from geology but geology alone be sufficient to damage irretrievably the historical truth of the jewish legend of creation the only means of rescue it be to suppose that god have create misleading evidence for the express purpose of deceive man geology shake the infallibility of the bible but leave the creation of some prehistoric adam and eve a still admissible hypothesis here however zoology step in and pronounced upon the origin of man it be a old conjecture that the higher form of life include -lrb- 180 -rrb- man have develop out of lower form and advance thinker have be reach the conclusion that the universe as we find it be the result of a continuous process unbroken by supernatural interference and explicable by uniform natural law but while the reign of law in the world of non-living matter seem to be establish the world of life could be consider a field in which the theory of divine intervention be perfectly valid so long as science fail to assign satisfactory cause for the origination of the various kind of animal and plant the publication of darwin 's origin of species in 1859 be therefore a landmark not only in science but in the war between science and theology when this book appear bishop wilberforce truly say that `` the principle of natural selection be incompatible with the word of god '' and theologian in germany and france as well as in england cry aloud against the threaten dethronement of the deity the appearance of the descent of man -lrb- 1871 -rrb- in which the evidence for the pedigree of the human race from lower animal be marshal with masterly force renew the outcry the bible say that god create man in he own image darwin say that man descend from a ape the feeling of the orthodox world may be -lrb- 181 -rrb- express in the word of mr gladstone : `` upon the grounds of what be call evolution god be relieve of the labor of creation and in the name of unchangeable law be discharge from govern the world '' it be a discharge which as spencer observe have begin with newton 's discovery of gravitation if darwin do not as be now recognize supply a complete explanation of the origin of species he research shatter the supernatural theory and confirm the view to which many able thinker have be lead that development be continuous in the living as in the non-living world another nail be drive into the coffin of creation and the fall of adam and the doctrine of redemption could only be rescue by make it independent of the jewish fable on which it be found darwinism as it be call have have the larger effect of discrediting the theory of the adaptation of means to end in nature by a external and infinitely powerful intelligence the inadequacy of the argument from design as a proof of god 's existence have be show by the logic of hume and kant but the observation of the life-process of nature show that the very analogy between nature and art on which the argument depend break down the impropriety of the analogy have be -lrb- 182 -rrb- point out in a tell way by a german writer -lrb- lange -rrb- if a man want to shoot a hare which be in a certain field he do not procure thousand of gun surround the field and cause they all to be fire off or if he want a house to live in he do not build a whole town and abandon to weather and decay all the house but one if he do either of these thing we should say he be mad or amazingly unintelligent he action certainly would not be hold to indicate a powerful mind expert in adapt means to end but these be the sort of thing that nature do she wastefulness in the propagation of life be reckless for the production of one life she sacrifice innumerable germ the `` end '' be achieve in one case out of thousand the rule be destruction and failure if intelligence have anything to do with this bungling process it would be a intelligence infinitely low and the finish product if regard as a work of design point to incompetence in the designer take the human eye a illustrious man of science -lrb- helmholtz -rrb- say `` if a optician send it to I as a instrument i should send it back with reproach for the carelessness of he work and demand the return of my money darwin show how the phenomenon might be explain as event not bring about -lrb- 183 -rrb- intentionally but due to exceptional concurrence of circumstance the phenomenon of nature be a system of thing which co-exist and follow each other accord to invariable law this deadly proposition be assert early in the nineteenth century to be a axiom of science it be formulate by mill -lrb- in he system of logic 1843 -rrb- as the foundation on which scientific induction rest it mean that at any moment the state of the whole universe be the effect of its state at the precede moment the casual sequence between two successive state be not break by any arbitrary interference suppress or alter the relation between cause and effect some ancient greek philosopher be convince of this principle the work do by modern science in every field seem to be a verification of it but it need not be state in such a absolute form recently scientific man have be incline to express the axiom with more reserve and less dogmatically they be prepare to recognize that it be simply a postulate without which the scientific comprehension of the universe would be impossible and they be incline to state it not as a law of causation -- for the idea of causation lead into metaphysics -- but rather as uniformity of experience but they be not -lrb- 184 -rrb- readier to admit exception to this uniformity than they predecessor be to admit exception to the law of causation the idea of development have be apply not only to nature but to the mind of man and to the history of civilization include thought and religion the first who attempt to apply this idea methodically to the whole universe be not a student of natural science but a metaphysician hegel he extremely difficult philosophy have such a wide influence on thought that a few word must be say about its tendency he conceive the whole of existence as what he call the absolute idea which be not in space or time and be compel by the law of its be to manifest itself in the process of the world first externalize itself in nature and then become conscious of itself as spirit in individual mind he system be hence call absolute idealism the attraction which it exercise have probably be in great measure due to the fact that it be in harmony with nineteenth-century thought in so far as it conceive the process of the world both in nature and spirit as a necessary development from lower to higher stage in this respect indeed hegel 's vision be limit he treat the process as if it be practically complete already and do not take into account -lrb- 185 -rrb- the probability of further development in the future to which other thinker of he own time be turn they attention but what concern we here be that while hegel 's system be `` idealistic '' find the explanation of the universe in thought and not in matter it tend as powerfully as any materialistic system to subvert orthodox belief it be true that some have claim it as support christianity a certain color be lend to this by hegel 's view that the christian creed as the highest religion contain doctrine which express imperfectly some of the idea of the highest philosophy -- he own along with the fact that he sometimes speak of the absolute idea as if it be a person though personality would be a limitation inconsistent with he conception of it but it be sufficient to observe that whatever value be assign to christianity he regard it from the superior standpoint of a purely intellectual philosophy not as a special revelation of truth but as a certain approximation to the truth which philosophy alone can reach and it may be say with some confidence that any one who come under hegel 's spell feel that he be in possession of a theory of the universe which relieve he from the need or desire of any reveal religion he influence in germany russium and elsewhere have entirely make for highly unorthodox thought -lrb- 186 -rrb- hegel be not aggressive he be superior he french contemporary comte who also think out a comprehensive system aggressively and explicitly reject theology as a obsolete way of explain the universe he reject metaphysics likewise and all that hegel stand for as equally useless on the ground that metaphysician explain nothing but merely describe phenomenon in abstract term and that question about the origin of the world and why it exist be quite beyond the reach of reason both theology and metaphysics be supersede by science -- the investigation of cause and effect and coexistence and the future progress of society will be guide by the scientific view of the world which confines itself to the positive datum of experience comte be convince that religion be a social necessity and to supply the place of the theological religion which he pronounce to be doom he invent a new religion -- the religion of humanity it differ from the great religion of the world in have no supernatural or non-rational article of belief and on that account he have few adherent but the `` positive philosophy '' of comte have exercise great influence not least in england where its principle have be promulgate especially by mr frederic harrison who in the latter -lrb- 187 -rrb- half of the nineteenth century have be one of the most indefatigable worker in the cause of reason against authority another comprehensive system be work out by a englishman herbert spencer like comte 's it be base on science and attempt to show how start with a nebular universe the whole knowable world psychical and social as well as physical can be deduce he synthetic philosophy perhaps do more than anything else to make the idea of evolution familiar in england i must mention one other modern explanation of the world that of haeckel the zoologist professor at jena who may be call the prophet of evolution he creation of man -lrb- 1868 -rrb- cover the same ground as darwin 's descent have a enormous circulation and be translate i believe into fourteen language he world-riddle -lrb- 1899 -rrb- enjoy the same popularity he have teach like spencer that the principle of evolution apply not only to the history of nature but also to human civilization and human thought he differ from spencer and comte in not assume any unknowable reality behind natural phenomenon he adversary commonly stigmatize he theory as materialism but this be a mistake like spinoza he recognize matter and mind body and think as -lrb- 188 -rrb- two inseparable side of ultimate reality which he call god in fact he identify he philosophy with that of spinoza and he logically proceed to conceive material atom as think he idea of the physical world be base on the old mechanical conception of matter which in recent year have be discredit but haeckel 's monism -lrb- 1 -rrb- as he call he doctrine have lately be reshape and in its new form promise to exercise wide influence on thoughtful people in germany i will return later to this monistic movement it have be a fundamental principle of comte that human action and human history be as strictly subject as nature be to the law of causation two psychological work appear in england in 1855 -lrb- bain 's sens and intellect and spencer 's principle of psychology -rrb- which teach that we volition be completely determine be the inevitable consequence of chain of cause and effect but a far deeper impression be produce two year later by the first volume of buckle 's history of civilization in england -lrb- a work of much less permanent value -rrb- which attempt to apply this principle to history man act in consequence of motive they motive be the result of precede fact so that `` if we be acquaint with the whole of the antecedent -lrb- 189 -rrb- and with all the law of they movement we could with unerring certainty predict the whole of they immediate result '' thus history be a unbroken chain of cause and effect chance be exclude it be a mere name for the defect of we knowledge mysterious and providential interference be exclude buckle maintain god 's existence but eliminate he from history and he book deal a resounding blow at the theory that human action be not submit to the law of universal causation the science of anthropology have in recent year arouse wide interest inquiry into the condition of early man have show -lrb- independently of darwinism -rrb- that there be nothing to be say for the view that he fall from a higher to a lower state the evidence point to a slow rise from mere animality the origin of religious belief have be investigate with result disquieting for orthodoxy the research of student of anthropology and comparative religion -- such as tylor robertson smith and frazer -- have go to show that mysterious idea and dogma and rite which be hold to be peculiar to the christian revelation be derive from the crude idea of primitive religion that the mystery of the eucharist come from the common savage rite of eat a dead god -lrb- 190 -rrb- that the death and resurrection of a god in human form which form the central fact of christianity and the miraculous birth of a savior be feature which it have in common with pagan religion -- such conclusion be supremely unedifying it may be say that in themselves they be not fatal to the claim of the current theology it may be hold for instance that as part of christian revelation such idea acquire a new significance and that god wisely avail himself of familiar belief -- which though false and lead to cruel practice he himself have inspire and permit -- in order to construct a scheme of redemption which should appeal to the prejudice of man some mind may find satisfaction in this sort of explanation but it may be suspect that most of the few who study modern research into the origin of religious belief will feel the line which be suppose to mark off the christian from all other faith dissolve before they eye the general result of the advance of science include anthropology have be to create a coherent view of the world in which the christian scheme base on the notion of a unscientific age and on the arrogant assumption that the universe be make for man have no suitable or reasonable place if paine feel this a hundred year ago it be far -lrb- 191 -rrb- more apparent now all mind however be not equally impressed with this incongruity there be many who will admit the proof furnish by science that the biblical record as to the antiquity of man be false but be not affect by the incongruity between the scientific and theological conception of the world for such mind science have only succeed in carry some entrenchment which may be abandon without much harm it have make the old orthodox view of the infallibility of the bible untenable and upset the doctrine of the creation and fall but it would still be possible for christianity to maintain the supernatural claim by modify its theory of the authority of the bible and revise its theory of redemption if the evidence of natural science be the only group of fact with which it collide it might be argue that the law of universal causation be a hypothesis infer from experience but that experience include the testimony of history and must therefore take account of the clear evidence of miraculous occurrence in the new testament -lrb- evidence which be valid even if that book be not inspire -rrb- thus a stand could be take against the generalization of science on the firm ground of historical fact that solid ground however have give -lrb- 192 -rrb- way undermine by historical criticism which have be more deadly than the common-sense criticism of the eighteenth century the methodical examination of the record contain in the bible deal with they as if they be purely human document be the work of the nineteenth century something indeed have already be do spinoza for instance -lrb- above p 138 -rrb- and simon a frenchman whose book be burn be pioneer and the modern criticism of the old testament be begin by astruc -lrb- professor of medicine at pari -rrb- who discover a important clue for distinguish different document use by the compiler of the book of genesis -lrb- 1753 -rrb- he german contemporary reimarus a student of the new testament anticipate the modern conclusion that jesus have no intention of found a new religion and see that the gospel of st john present a different figure from the jesus of the other evangelist but in the nineteenth century the method of criticism apply by german scholar to homer and to the record of early roman history be extend to the investigation of the bible the work have be do principally in germany the old tradition that the pentateuch be write by mose have be completely discredit it be now -lrb- 193 -rrb- agree unanimously by all who have study the fact that the pentateuch be put together from a number of different document of different age the earliest date from the ninth the last from the fifth century bc and there be later minor addition a important though undesigned contribution be make to this exposure by a englishman colenso bishop of natal it have be hold that the oldest of the document which have be distinguish be a narrative which begin in genesis chapter i but there be the difficulty that this narrative seem to be closely associate with the legislation of leviticus which could be prove to belong to the fifth century in 1862 colenso publish the first part of he pentateuch and the book of joshua critically examine he doubt of the truth of old testament history have be awaken by a convert zulu who ask the intelligent question whether he could really believe in the story of the flood `` that all the beast and bird and creep thing upon the earth large and small from hot country and cold come thus by pair and enter into the ark with noah and do noah gather food for they all for the beast and bird of prey as well as the rest '' the bishop then proceed to test the accuracy of the inspired book by examine -lrb- 194 -rrb- the numerical statement which they contain the result be fatal to they as historical record quite apart from miracle -lrb- the possibility of which he do not question -rrb- he show that the whole story of the sojourn of the israelite in egypt and the wilderness be full of absurdity and impossibility colenso 's book raise a storm of indignation in england -- he be know as `` the wicked bishop '' but on the continent its reception be very different the portion of the pentateuch and joshua which he prove to be unhistorical belong precisely to the narrative which have cause perplexity and critic be lead by he result to conclude that like the levitical law with which it be connect it be as late as the fifth century one of the most striking result of the research on the old testament have be that the jew themselves handle they tradition freely each of the successive document which be afterwards weave together be write by man who adopt a perfectly free attitude towards the older tradition and have no suspicion that they be of divine origin do not bow down before they authority it be reserve for the christian to invest with infallible authority the whole indiscriminate lump of these jewish document inconsistent not -lrb- 195 -rrb- only in they tendency -lrb- since they reflect the spirit of different age -rrb- but also in some respects in substance the examination of most of the other old testament book have lead to conclusion likewise adverse to the orthodox view of they origin and character new knowledge on many point have be derive from the babylonian literature which have be recover during the last half century one of the earliest -lrb- 1872 -rrb- and most sensational discovery be that the jew get they story of the flood from babylonian mythology modern criticism of the new testament begin with the stimulate work of baur and of strauss whose life of jesus -lrb- 1835 -rrb- in which the supernatural be entirely reject have a immense success and cause furious controversy both these rationalist be influence by hegel at the same time a classical scholar lachmann lay the foundation of the criticism of the greek text of the new testament by issue the first scientific edition since then seventy year of work have lead to some certain result which be generally accept in the first place no intelligent person who have study modern criticism hold the old view that each of the four biography of jesus be a independent work and a independent -lrb- 196 -rrb- testimony to the fact which be related it be acknowledge that those portion which be common to more than one and be write in identical language have the same origin and represent only one testimony in the second place it be allow that the first gospel be not the oldest and that the apostle matthew be not its author there be also a pretty general agreement that mark 's book be the oldest the authorship of the fourth gospel which like the first be suppose to have be write by a eye-witness be still contest but even those who adhere to the tradition admit that it represent a theory about jesus which be widely different from the view of the three other biographer the result be that it can no longer be say that for the life of jesus there be the evidence of eye-witness the oldest account -lrb- mark -rrb- be compose at the earliest some thirty year after the crucifixion if such evidence be consider good enough to establish the supernatural event describe in that document there be few alleged supernatural occurrence which we shall not be equally entitle to believe as a matter of fact a interval of thirty year make little difference for we know that legend require little time to grow in the east you will hear of miracle which happen the day before -lrb- 197 -rrb- yesterday the birth of religion be always envelop in legend and the miraculous thing would be as m salomon reinach have observe if the story of the birth of christianity be pure history another disturbing result of unprejudiced examination of the first three gospel be that if you take the record word of jesus to be genuine tradition he have no idea of found a new religion and he be fully persuade that the end of the world be at hand at present the chief problem of advanced criticism seem to be whether he entire teaching be not determine by this delusive conviction it may be say that the advance of knowledge have throw no light on one of the most important belief that we be ask to accept on authority the doctrine of immortality physiology and psychology have indeed emphasize the difficulty of conceive a think mind without a nervous system some be sanguine enough to think that by scientific examination of psychical phenomenon we may possibly come to know whether the `` spirit '' of dead people exist if the existence of such a world of spirit be ever establish it would possibly be the greatest blow ever sustain by christianity for the great appeal of this and of some other religion -lrb- 198 -rrb- lie in the promise of a future life of which otherwise we should have no knowledge if existence after death be prove and become a scientific fact like the law of gravitation a reveal religion might lose its power for the whole point of a reveal religion be that it be not base on scientific fact so far as i know those who be convince by spiritualistic experiment that they have actual converse with spirit of the dead and for whom this converse however delusive the evidence may be be a fact prove by experience cease to feel any interest in religion they possess knowledge and can dispense with faith the havoc which science and historical criticism have work among orthodox belief during the last hundred year be not tamely submit to and controversy be not the only weapon employ strauss be deprive of he professorship at tbingen and he career be ruin renan whose sensational life of jesus also reject the supernatural lose he chair in the collge de france bchner be drive from tbingen -lrb- 1855 -rrb- for he book on force and matter which appeal to the general public set forth the futility of supernatural explanation of the universe a attempt be make to chase haeckel from jena in recent year -lrb- 199 -rrb- a french catholic the abb loisy have make notable contribution to the study of the new testament and he be reward by major excommunication in 1907 loisy be the most prominent figure in a grow movement within the catholic church know as modernism -- a movement which some think be the gravest crisis in the history of the church since the thirteenth century the modernist do not form a organize party they have no program they be devote to the church to its tradition and association but they look on christianity as a religion which have develop and whose vitality depend upon its continue to develop they be bent on reinterpret the dogma in the light of modern science and criticism the idea of development have already be apply by cardinal newman to catholic theology he teach that it be a natural and therefore legitimate development of the primitive creed but he do not draw the conclusion which the modernist draw that if catholicism be not to lose its power of growth and die it must assimilate some of the result of modern thought this be what they be attempt to do for it pope pius x have make every effort to suppress the modernist in 1907 -lrb- July -rrb- he -lrb- 200 -rrb- issue a decree denounce various result of modern biblical criticism which be defend in loisy 's work the two fundamental proposition that `` the organic constitution of the church be not immutable but that christian society be subject like every human society to a perpetual evolution '' and that `` the dogma which the church regard as reveal be not fall from heaven but be a interpretation of religious fact at which the human mind laboriously arrive '' -- both of which might be deduce from newman 's writings -- be condemn three month later the pope issue a long encyclical letter contain a elaborate study of modernist opinion and ordain various measure for stamp out the evil no modernist would admit that this document represent he view fairly yet some of the remark seem very much to the point take one of they book : `` one page might be sign by a catholic turn over and you think you be read the work of a rationalist in write history they make no mention of christ 's divinity in the pulpit they proclaim it loudly '' a plain man may be puzzle by these attempt to retain the letter of old dogma empty of they old meaning and may think it natural enough that the head of the catholic -lrb- 201 -rrb- church should take a clear and definite stand against the new learning which seem fatal to its fundamental doctrine for many year past liberal divine in the protestant church have be do what the modernist be do the phrase `` divinity of christ '' be use but be interpret so as not to imply a miraculous birth the resurrection be preach but be interpret so as not to imply a miraculous bodily resurrection the bible be say to be a inspired book but inspiration be use in a vague sense much as when one say that plato be inspire and the vagueness of this new idea of inspiration be even put forward as a merit between the extreme view which discard the miraculous altogether and the old orthodoxy there be many gradation of belief in the church of england to-day it would be difficult to say what be the minimum belief require either from its member or from its clergy probably every lead ecclesiastic would give a different answer the rise of rationalism within the english church be interesting and illustrate the relation between church and state the pietistic movement know as evangelicalism which wilberforce 's practical view of christianity -lrb- 1797 -rrb- do much to make popular introduce the spirit of methodism -lrb- 202 -rrb- within the anglican church and soon put a end to the delightful type of eighteenth-century divine who as gibbon say `` subscribe with a sigh or a smile '' the article of faith the rigorous taboo of the sabbath be revive the theater be denounce the corruption of human nature become the dominant theme and the bible more a fetish than ever the success of this religious `` reaction '' as it be call be aid though not cause by the common belief that the french revolution have be mainly due to infidelity the revolution be take for a object lesson show the value of religion for keep the people in order there be also a religious `` reaction '' in france itself but in both case this mean not that free thought be less prevalent but that the belief of the majority be more aggressive and have powerful spokesman while the eighteenth-century form of rationalism fall out of fashion a new form of rationalism which seek to interpret orthodoxy in such a liberal way as to reconcile it with philosophy be represent by coleridge who be influence by german philosopher coleridge be a supporter of the church and he contribute to the foundation of a school of liberal theology which be to make itself feel after the middle of the century -lrb- 203 -rrb- newman the most eminent of the new high church party say that he indulge in a liberty of speculation which no christian could tolerate the high church movement which mark the second quarter of the century be as hostile as evangelicalism to the freedom of religious think the change come after the middle of the century when the effect of the philosophy of hegel and comte and of foreign biblical criticism begin to make themselves feel within the english church two remarkable freethinking book appear at this period which be widely read f w newman 's phase of faith and w r greg 's creed of christendom -lrb- both in 1850 -rrb- newman -lrb- brother of cardinal newman -rrb- entirely break with christianity and in he book he describe the mental process by which he come to abandon the belief he have once hold perhaps the most interesting point he make be the deficiency of the new testament teaching as a system of moral greg be a unitarian he reject dogma and inspiration but he regard himself as a christian sir j f stephen wittily describe he position as that of a disciple `` who have hear the sermon on the mount whose attention have not be call to the miracle and who die before the resurrection '' -lrb- 204 -rrb- there be a few english clergyman -lrb- chiefly oxford man -rrb- who be interested in german criticism and lean to broad view which to the evangelical and high churchman seem indistinguishable from infidelity we may call they the broad church -- though the name do not come in till later in 1855 jowett -lrb- afterwards master of balliol -rrb- publish a edition of some of st paul 's epistle in which he show the cloven hoof it contain a annihilate criticism of the doctrine of the atonement a explicit rejection of original sin and a rationalistic discussion of the question of god 's existence but this and some other unorthodox work of liberal theologian attract little public attention though they author have to endure petty persecution five year later jowett and some other member of the small liberal group decide to defy the `` abominable system of terrorism which prevent the statement of the plainest fact '' and issue a volume of essay and review -lrb- 1860 -rrb- by seven writer of whom six be clergyman the view advocate in these essay seem mild enough to-day and many of they would be accept by most well-educated clergyman but at the time they produce a very painful impression the author be call the `` seven against christ '' it be -lrb- 205 -rrb- lay down that the bible be to be interpret like any other book `` it be not a useful lesson for the young student to apply to scripture principle which he would hesitate to apply to other book to make formal reconcilement of discrepancy which he would not think of reconcile in ordinary history to divide simple word into double meaning to adopt the fancy or conjecture of father and commentator as real knowledge '' it be suggest that the hebrew prophecy do not contain the element of prediction contradictory account or account which can only be reconcile by conjecture can not possibly have be dictate by god the discrepancy between the genealogy of jesus in matthew and luke or between the account of the resurrection can be attribute `` neither to any defect in we capacity nor to any reasonable presumption of a hidden wise design nor to any partial spiritual endowment in the narrator '' the orthodox argument which lay stress on the assertion of witness as the supreme evidence of fact in support of miraculous occurrence be set aside on the ground that testimony be a blind guide and can avail nothing against reason and the strong grounds we have for believe in permanent order it be argue that under the thirty-nine -lrb- 206 -rrb- article it be permissible to accept as `` parable or poetry or legend '' such story as that of a ass speaking with a man 's voice of water stand in a solid heap of witch and a variety of apparition and to judge for ourselves of such question as the personality of satan or the primeval institution of the sabbath the whole spirit of this volume be perhaps express in the observation that if any one perceive `` to how great a extent the origin itself of christianity rest upon probable evidence he principle will relieve he from many difficulty which might otherwise be very disturbing for relation which may repose on doubtful grounds as matter of history and as history be incapable of be ascertain or verify may yet be equally suggestive of true idea with fact absolutely certain '' -- that be they may have a spiritual significance although they be historically false the most daring essay be the rev baden powell 's study of the evidence of christianity he be a believer in evolution who accept darwinism and consider miracle impossible the volume be denounce by the bishop and in 1862 two of the contributor who be beneficed clergyman and thus open to a legal attack be prosecute and try in the ecclesiastical court condemn on -lrb- 207 -rrb- certain point acquit on other they be sentence to be suspend for a year and they appeal to the privy council lord westbury -lrb- lord chancellor -rrb- pronounce the judgment of the judicial committee of the council which reverse the decision of the ecclesiastical court the committee hold among other thing that it be not essential for a clergyman to believe in eternal punishment this prompt the follow epitaph on lord westbury : `` towards the close of he earthly career he dismiss hell with cost and take away from orthodox member of the church of england they last hope of everlasting damnation '' this be a great triumph for the broad church party and it be a interesting event in the history of the english state-church layman decide -lrb- overrule the opinion of the archbishop of canterbury and york -rrb- what theological doctrine be and be not bind on a clergyman and grant within the church a liberty of opinion which the majority of the church 's representative regard as pernicious this liberty be formally establish in 1865 by a act of parliament which alter the form in which clergyman be require to subscribe the thirty-nine article the episode of essay and review be a landmark in the history of religious thought in england -lrb- 208 -rrb- the liberal view of the broad churchman and they attitude to the bible gradually produce some effect upon those who differ most from they and nowadays there be probably no one who would not admit at least that such a passage as genesis chapter xix might have be compose without the direct inspiration of the deity during the next few year orthodox public opinion be shock or disturb by the appearance of several remarkable book which criticize ignore or defy authority -- lyell 's antiquity of man seeley 's ecce homo -lrb- which the pious lord shaftesbury say be `` vomit from the jaw of hell '' -rrb- lecky 's history of rationalism and a new poet of liberty arise who do not fear to sound the loudest note of defiance against all that authority hold sacred all the great poet of the nineteenth century be more or less unorthodox wordsworth in the year of he highest inspiration be a pantheist and the greatest of all shelley be a declare atheist in fearless utterance in unfaltering zeal against the tyranny of god and government swinburne be like shelley he drama atalanta in calydon -lrb- 1865 -rrb- even though a poet be strictly not answerable for what the person in he drama say yet with its denunciation of `` the supreme evil god '' herald the come -lrb- 209 -rrb- of a new champion who would defy the fortress of authority and in the following year he poem and ballad express the spirit of a pagan who flout all the prejudice and sanctity of the christian world but the most intense and exciting period of literary warfare against orthodoxy in england begin about 1869 and last for about a dozen year during which enemy of dogma of all complexion be less reticent and more aggressive than at any other time in the century lord morley have observe that `` the force of speculative literature always hang on practical opportuneness '' and this remark be illustrate by the rationalistic literature of the seventy it be a time of hope and fear of progress and danger secularist and rationalist be encourage by the disestablishment of the church in ireland -lrb- 1869 -rrb- by the act which allow atheist to give evidence in a court of justice -lrb- 1869 -rrb- by the abolition of religious test at all the university -lrb- a measure frequently attempt in vain -rrb- in 1871 on the other hand the education act of 1870 progressive though it be disappoint the advocate of secular education and be a unwelcome sign of the strength of ecclesiastical influence then there be the general alarm feel in europe by all outside the roman church -lrb- 210 -rrb- and by some within it at the decree of the infallibility of the pope -lrb- by the vatican council 1869 -- 70 -rrb- and a englishman -lrb- cardinal manning -rrb- be one of the most active spirit in bring about this decree it would perhaps have cause less alarm if the pope 's denunciation of modern error have not be fresh in man 's memory at the end of 1864 he startle the world by issue a syllabus `` embrace the principal error of we age '' among these be the proposition that every man be free to adopt and profess the religion he consider true accord to the light of reason that the church have no right to employ force that metaphysics can and ought to be pursue without reference to divine and ecclesiastical authority that catholic state be right to allow foreign immigrant to exercise they own religion in public that the pope ought to make term with progress liberalism and modern civilization the document be take as a declaration of war against enlightenment and the vatican council as the first strategic move of the host of darkness it seem that the power of obscurantism be lift up they head with a new menace and there be a instinctive feeling that all the force of reason should be bring into the field the history of the last forty year show that the theory of -lrb- 211 -rrb- infallibility since it have become a dogma be not more harmful than it be before but the effort of the catholic church in the year follow the council to overthrow the french republic and to rupture the new german empire be sufficiently disquieting against this be to be set the destruction of the temporal power of the pope and the complete freedom of italy this event be the sunrise of swinburne 's song before sunrise -lrb- which appear in 1871 -rrb- a seedplot of atheism and revolution sow with implacable hatred of creed and tyrant the most wonderful poem in the volume the hymn of man be write while the vatican council be sit it be a song of triumph over the god of the priest stricken by the doom of the pope 's temporal power the conclude verse will show the spirit `` by thy name that in hellfire be write and burn at the point of thy sword thou art smitten thou god thou art smitten thy death be upon thee o lord and the lovesong of earth as thou diest resound through the wind of she wing -- glory to man in the highest for man be the master of thing '' -lrb- 212 -rrb- the fact that such a volume could appear with impunity vividly illustrate the english policy of enforce the law for blasphemy only in the case of publication address to the mass political circumstance thus invite and stimulate rationalist to come forward boldly but we must not leave out of account the influence of the broad church movement and of darwinism the descent of man appear precisely in 1871 a new undogmatic christianity be be preach in pulpit mr leslie stephen remark -lrb- 1873 -rrb- that `` it may be say with little exaggeration that there be not only no article in the creed which may not be contradict with impunity but that there be none which may not be contradict in a sermon calculate to win the reputation of orthodoxy and be regard as a judicious bid for a bishopric the popular state of mind seem to be typify in the well - know anecdote of the cautious churchwarden who whilst commend the general tendency of he incumbent 's sermon feel bind to hazard a protest upon one point ` you see sir ' as he apologetically explain ` i think there be a god ' he think it a error of taste or perhaps of judgment to hint a doubt as to the first article of the creed '' the influence exert among the cultivate -lrb- 213 -rrb- class by the aesthetic movement -lrb- ruskin morri the pre - raphaelite painter then pater 's lecture on the renaissance 1873 -rrb- be also a sign of the time for the attitude of these critic artist and poet be essentially pagan the saving truth of theology be for they as if they do not exist the ideal of happiness be find in a region in which heaven be ignore the time then seem opportune for speak out of the unorthodox book and essay -lrb- 2 -rrb- which influence the young and alarmed believer in these exciting year most be the work of man who may be most fairly describe by the comprehensive term agnostic -- a name which have be recently invent by professor huxley the agnostic hold that there be limit to human reason and that theology lie outside those limit within those limit lie the world with which science -lrb- include psychology -rrb- deal science deal entirely with phenomenon and have nothing to say to the nature of the ultimate reality which may lie behind phenomenon there be four possible -lrb- 214 -rrb- attitude to this ultimate reality there be the attitude of the metaphysician and theologian who be convince not only that it exist but that it can be at least partly know there be the attitude of the man who deny that it exist but he must be also a metaphysician for its existence can only be disprove by metaphysical argument then there be those who assert that it exist but deny that we can know anything about it and finally there be those who say that we can not know whether it exist or not these last be `` agnostic '' in the strict sense of the term man who profess not to know the third class go beyond phenomenon in so far as they assert that there be a ultimate though unknowable reality beneath phenomenon but agnostic be commonly use in a wide sense so as to include the third as well as the fourth class -- those who assume a unknowable as well as those who do not know whether there be a unknowable or not comte and spencer for instance who believe in a unknowable be count as agnostic the difference between a agnostic and a atheist be that the atheist positively deny the existence of a personal god the agnostic do not believe in it the writer of this period who hold agnosticism -lrb- 215 -rrb- in its purest form and who turn the dry light of reason on to theological opinion with the most merciless logic be mr leslie stephen he best-known essay `` a agnostic 's apology '' -lrb- fortnightly review 1876 -rrb- raise the question have the dogma of orthodox theologian any meaning do they offer for this be what we want a intelligible reconciliation of the discord in the universe it be show in detail that the various theological explanation of the dealings of god with man when logically press issue in a confession of ignorance and what be this but agnosticism you may call you doubt a mystery but mystery be only the theological phrase for agnosticism `` why when no honest man will deny in private that every ultimate problem be wrap in the profoundest mystery do honest man proclaim in pulpit that unhesitate certainty be the duty of the most foolish and ignorant we be a company of ignorant being dimly discerning light enough for we daily need but hopelessly differ whenever we attempt to describe the ultimate origin or end of we path and yet when one of we venture to declare that we do not know the map of the universe as well as the map of we infinitesimal parish he be hoot revile -lrb- 216 -rrb- and perhaps tell that he will be damned to all eternity for he faithlessness '' the characteristic of leslie stephen 's essay be that they be less direct to show that orthodox theology be untrue as that there be no reality about it and that its solution of difficulty be sham solution if it solve any part of the mystery it would be welcome but it do not it only add new difficulty it be `` a mere edifice of moonshine '' the writer make no attempt to prove by logic that ultimate reality lie outside the limit of human reason he base this conclusion on the fact that all philosopher hopelessly contradict one another if the subject-matter of philosophy be like physical science within the reach of the intelligence some agreement must have be reach the broad church movement the attempt to liberalize christianity to pour its old wine into new bottle to make it unsectarian and undogmatic to find compromise between theology and science find no favor in leslie stephen 's eye and he criticize all this with a certain contempt there be a controversy about the efficacy of prayer be it reasonable for instance to pray for rain here science and theology be at issue on a practical -lrb- 217 -rrb- point which come within the domain of science some theologian adopt the compromise that to pray against a eclipse would be foolish but to pray for rain might be sensible `` one phenomenon '' stephen write `` be just as much the result of fix cause as the other but it be easier for the imagination to suppose the interference of a divine agent to be hide away somewhere amidst the infinitely complex play of force which elude we calculation in meteorological phenomenon than to believe in it where the force be simple enough to admit of prediction the distinction be of course invalid in a scientific sense almighty power can interfere as easily with the event which be as with those which be not in the nautical almanac one can not suppose that god retreat as science advance and that he speak in thunder and lightning till franklin unravel the law of they phenomenon '' again when a controversy about hell engage public attention and some otherwise orthodox theologian bethink themselves that eternal punishment be a horrible doctrine and then find that the evidence for it be not quite conclusive and be bold enough to say so leslie stephen step in to point out that if so historical -lrb- 218 -rrb- christianity deserve all that its most virulent enemy have say about it in this respect when the christian creed really rule man 's conscience nobody could utter a word against the truth of the dogma of hell if that dogma have not a intimate organic connection with the creed if it have be a mere unimportant accident it could not have be so vigorous and persistent wherever christianity be strongest the attempt to eliminate it or soften it down be a sign of decline `` now at last you creed be decay people have discover that you know nothing about it that heaven and hell belong to dreamland that the impertinent young curate who tell I that i shall be burnt everlastingly for not share he superstition be just as ignorant as i be myself and that i know as much as my dog and then you calmly say again ` it be all a mistake only believe in a something -- and we will make it as easy for you as possible hell shall have no more than a fine equable temperature really good for the constitution there shall be nobody in it except juda iscariot and one or two other and even the poor devil shall have a chance if he will resolve to mend he way ' '' mr matthew arnold may i suppose be number among the agnostic but he be -lrb- 219 -rrb- of a very different type he introduce a new kind of criticism of the bible -- literary criticism deeply concerned for morality and religion a supporter of the established church he take the bible under he special protection and in three work st paul and protestantism 1870 literature and dogma 1873 and god and the bible 1875 he endeavor to rescue that book from its orthodox exponent whom he regard as the corrupter of christianity it would be just he say `` but hardly perhaps christian '' to fling back the word infidel at the orthodox theologian for they bad literary and scientific criticism of the bible and to speak of `` the torrent of infidelity which pour every Sunday from we pulpit '' the corruption of christianity have be due to theology `` with its insane licence of affirmation about god its insane licence of affirmation about immortality '' to the hypothesis of `` a magnify and non-natural man at the head of mankind 's and the world 's affair '' and the fancy account of god `` make up by put scatter expression of the bible together and take they literally '' he chastise with urbane persiflage the knowledge which the orthodox think they possess about the proceedings and plan of god `` to think they know what pass in the council of the -lrb- 220 -rrb- trinity be not hard to they they could easily think they even know what be the hanging of the trinity 's council-chamber '' yet `` the very expression the trinity jar with the whole idea and character of bible-religion but lest the socinian should be unduly elated at hear this let we hasten to add that so too and just as much do the expression a great personal first cause '' he use god as the least inadequate name for that universal order which the intellect feel after as a law and the heart feel after as a benefit and define it as `` the stream of tendency by which all thing strive to fulfil the law of they be '' he define it further as a power that make for righteousness and thus go considerably beyond the agnostic position he be impatient of the minute criticism which analyze the biblical document and discover inconsistency and absurdity and he do not appreciate the importance of the comparative study of religion but when we read of a dignitary in a recent church congress lay down that the narrative in the book of jonah and daniel must be accept because jesus quote they we may wish that arnold be here to reproach the orthodox for `` want of intellectual seriousness '' these year also see the appearance of -lrb- 221 -rrb- mr john morley 's sympathetic study of the french freethinker of the eighteenth century voltaire -lrb- 1872 -rrb- rousseau -lrb- 1873 -rrb- and diderot -lrb- 1878 -rrb- he edit the fortnightly review and for some year this journal be distinguish by brilliant criticism on the popular religion contribute by able man write from many point of view a part of the book which he afterwards publish under the title compromise appear in the fortnightly in 1874 in compromise `` the whole system of objective proposition which make up the popular belief of the day '' be condemn as mischievous and it be urge that those who disbelieve should speak out plainly speak out be a intellectual duty englishman have a strong sense of political responsibility and a correspondingly weak sense of intellectual responsibility even mind that be not commonplace be affect for the worse by the political spirit which `` be the great force in throw love of truth and accurate reasoning into a secondary place '' and the principle which have prevail in politics have be adopt by theology for she own use in the one case convenience first truth second in the other emotional comfort first truth second if the immorality be less gross in the case of religion -lrb- 222 -rrb- there be `` the stain of intellectual improbity '' and this be a crime against society for `` they who tamper with veracity from whatever motive be tamper with the vital force of human progress '' the intellectual insincerity which be here blame be just as prevalent to - day the english have not change they nature the `` political '' spirit be still rampant and we be rule by the view that because compromise be necessary in politics it be also a good thing in the intellectual domain the fortnightly under mr morley 's guidance be a effective organ of enlightenment i have no space to touch on the work of other man of letter and of man of science in these combative year but it be to be note that while denunciation of modern thought pour from the pulpit a popular diffusion of freethought be carry on especially by mr bradlaugh in public lecture and in he paper the national reformer not without collision with the civil authority if we take the case in which the civil authority in england have intervene to repress the publication of unorthodox opinion during the last two century we find that the object have always be to prevent the spread of freethought among the mass -lrb- 223 -rrb- the victim have be either poor uneducated people or man who propagate freethought in a popular form i touch upon this before in speaking of paine and it be bear out by the prosecution of the nineteenth and twentieth century the unconfessed motive have be fear of the people theology have be regard as a good instrument for keep the poor in order and unbelief as a cause or accompaniment of dangerous political opinion the idea have not altogether disappear that free thought be peculiarly indecent in the poor that it be highly desirable to keep they superstitious in order to keep they contented that they should be duly thankful for all the theological as well as social arrangement which have be make for they by they betters i may quote from a essay of mr frederic harrison a anecdote which admirably express the become attitude of the poor towards ecclesiastical institution `` the master of a workhouse in essex be once call in to act as chaplain to a die pauper the poor soul faintly murmur some hope of heaven but this the master abruptly cut short and warn he to turn he last thought towards hell ` and thankful you ought to be ' say he ` that you have a hell to go to ' '' -lrb- 224 -rrb- the most important english freethinker who appeal to the mass be holyoake -lrb- 3 -rrb- the apostle of `` secularism '' and bradlaugh the great achievement for which bradlaugh will be best remember be the secure of the right of unbeliever to sit in parliament without take a oath -lrb- 1888 -rrb- the chief work to which holyoake -lrb- who in he early year be imprison for blasphemy -rrb- contribute be the abolition of tax on the press which seriously hamper the popular diffusion of knowledge -lrb- 4 -rrb- in england censorship of the press have long ago disappear -lrb- above p 139 -rrb- in most other european country it be abolish in the course of the nineteenth century -lrb- 5 -rrb- in the progressive country of europe there have be a marked growth of tolerance -lrb- i do not mean legal toleration but the tolerance -lrb- 225 -rrb- of public opinion -rrb- during the last thirty year a generation ago lord morley write : `` the preliminary stage have scarcely be reach -- the stage in which public opinion grant to every one the unrestricted right of shape he own belief independently of those of the people who surround he '' i think this preliminary stage have now be pass take england we be now far from the day when dr arnold would have send the elder mill to botany bay for irreligious opinion but we be also far from the day when darwin 's descent create a uproar darwin have be bury in westminster abbey to-day book can appear deny the historical existence of jesus without cause any commotion it may be doubt whether what lord acton write in 1877 would be true now : `` there be in we day many educate man who think it right to persecute '' in 1895 lecky be a candidate for the representation of dublin university he rationalistic opinion be indeed bring up against he but he be successful though the majority of the constituent be orthodox in the seventy he candidature would have be hopeless the old commonplace that a freethinker be sure to be immoral be no longer hear we may say that we have now -lrb- 226 -rrb- reach a stage at which it be admit by every one who count -lrb- except at the vatican -rrb- that there be nothing in earth or heaven which may not legitimately be treat without any of the assumption which in old day authority use to impose in this brief review of the triumph of reason in the nineteenth century we have be consider the discovery of science and criticism which make the old orthodoxy logically untenable but the advance in freedom of think the marked difference in the general attitude of man in all land towards theological authority to-day from the attitude of a hundred year ago can not altogether be explain by the power of logic it be not so much criticism of old idea as the appearance of new idea and interest that change the view of man at large it be not logical demonstration but new social conception that bring about a general transformation of attitude towards ultimate problem now the idea of the progress of the human race must i think be hold largely answerable for this change of attitude it must i think be hold to have operate powerfully as a solvent of theological belief i have speak of the teaching of diderot and he friend that man 's energy should be devote to make the earth pleasant a -lrb- 227 -rrb- new ideal be substitute for the old ideal base on theological proposition it inspire the english utilitarian philosopher -lrb- bentham jame mill j s mill grote -rrb- who preach the greatest happiness of the greatest number as the supreme object of action and the basis of morality this ideal be powerfully reinforce by the doctrine of historical progress which be start in france -lrb- 1750 -rrb- by turgot who make progress the organic principle of history it be develop by condorcet -lrb- 1793 -rrb- and put forward by priestley in england the idea be seize upon by the french socialistic philosopher saint-simon and fourier the optimism of fourier go so far as to anticipate the time when the sea would be turn by man 's ingenuity into lemonade when there would be 37 million poet as great as homer 37 million writer as great as molire 37 million man of science equal to newton but it be comte who give the doctrine weight and power he social philosophy and he religion of humanity be base upon it the triumph of science endorse it it have be associate with though it be not necessarily imply in the scientific theory of evolution and it be perhaps fair to say that it have be the guide spiritual force of the nineteenth century it have introduce -lrb- 228 -rrb- the new ethical principle of duty to posterity we shall hardly be far wrong if we say that the new interest in the future and the progress of the race have do a great deal to undermine unconsciously the old interest in a life beyond the grave and it have dissolve the blight doctrine of the radical corruption of man nowhere have the theory of progress be more emphatically recognize than in the monistic movement which have be exciting great interest in germany -lrb- 1910 -- 12 -rrb- this movement be base on the idea of haeckel who be look up to as the master but those idea have be considerably change under the influence of ostwald the new leader while haeckel be a biologist ostwald 's brilliant work be do in chemistry and physics the new monism differ from the old in the first place in be much less dogmatic it declare that all that be in we experience can be the object of a corresponding science it be much more a method than a system for its sole ultimate object be to comprehend all human experience in unify knowledge secondly while it maintain with haeckel evolution as the guide principle in the history of live thing it reject he pantheism and he theory of think atom the old mechanical theory of the -lrb- 229 -rrb- physical world have be gradually supplant by the theory of energy and ostwald who be one of the foremost exponent of energy have make it a lead idea of monism what have be call matter be so far as we know now simply a complex of energy and he have seek to extend the `` energetic '' principle from physical or chemical to biological psychical and social phenomenon but it be to be observe that no finality be claim for the conception of energy it be simply a hypothesis which correspond to we present stage of knowledge and may as knowledge advance be supersede monism resemble the positive philosophy and religion of comte in so far as it mean a outlook on life base entirely on science and exclude theology mysticism and metaphysics it may be call a religion if we adopt mr mactaggart 's definition of religion as `` a emotion rest on a conviction of the harmony between ourselves and the universe at large '' but it be much better not to use the word religion in connexion with it and the monist have no thought of find a monistic as comte found a positivist church they insist upon the sharp opposition between the outlook of science and the outlook of religion and find the mark of spiritual progress in the fact that religion be -lrb- 230 -rrb- gradually become less indispensable the further we go back in the past the more valuable be religion as a element in civilization as we advance it retreat more and more into the background to be replace by science religion have be in principle pessimistic so far as the present world be concerned monism be in principle optimistic for it recognize that the process of he evolution have overcome in increase measure the bad element in man and will go on overcome it still more monism proclaim that development and progress be the practical principle of human conduct while the church especially the catholic church have be steadily conservative and though they have be unable to put a stop to progress have endeavor to suppress its symptom -- to bottle up the steam -lrb- 6 -rrb- the monistic congress at hamburg in 1911 have a success which surprise its promoter the movement bid fair to be a powerful influence in diffuse rationalistic thought -lrb- 7 -rrb- if we take the three large state of -lrb- 231 -rrb- western europe in which the majority of christian be catholic we see how the ideal of progress freedom of thought and the decline of ecclesiastical power go together in spain where the church have enormous power and wealth and can still dictate to the court and the politician the idea of progress which be vital in france and italy have not yet make its influence seriously feel liberal thought indeed be widely spread in the small educate class but the great majority of the whole population be illiterate and it be the interest of the church to keep they so the education of the people as all enlighten spaniard confess be the press need of the country how formidable be the obstacle which will have to be overcome before modern education be allow to spread be show four year ago by the tragedy of francisco ferrer which remind everybody that in one corner of western europe the mediaeval spirit be still vigorous ferrer have devote himself to the founding of modern school in the province of catalonium -lrb- since 1901 -rrb- he be a rationalist and he school which have a marked success be entirely secular the ecclesiastical authority execrate he and in the summer of 1909 chance give they the means of destroy he a strike of workman at -lrb- 232 -rrb- barcelona develop into a violent revolution ferrer happen to be in barcelona for some day at the beginning of the movement with which he have no connection whatever and he enemy seize the opportunity to make he responsible for it false evidence -lrb- include forge document -rrb- be manufacture evidence which would have help he case be suppress the catholic papers agitate against he and the lead ecclesiastic of barcelona urge the government not to spare the man who found the modern school the root of all the trouble ferrer be condemn by a military tribunal and shot -lrb- oct 13 -rrb- he suffer in the cause of reason and freedom of think though as there be no longer a inquisition he enemy have to kill he under the false charge of anarchy and treason it be possible that the indignation which be feel in europe and be most loudly express in france may prevent the repetition of such extreme measure but almost anything may happen in a country where the church be so powerful and so bigoted and the politician so corrupt -lrb- 1 -rrb- from greek mono alone -lrb- 2

edward clodd have be for many year chairman this be the chief society in england for propagate rationalism and its main object be to diffuse in a cheap form the work of freethinker of mark -lrb- cp

have be bring up in the free atmosphere of a modern state sympathize with liberty in its long struggle with authority and may find it difficult to see that anything can be say for the tyrannical and as they think extraordinarily perverse policy by which community and government persistently seek to stifle new idea and suppress free speculation the conflict sketch in these page appear as a war between light and darkness we exclaim that altar and throne form a sinister conspiracy against the progress of humanity we look back with horror at the thing which so many champion of reason endure at the hand of blind if not malignant bearer of authority but a more or less plausible case can be make out for coercion let we take the most limited view of the lawful power of society over its individual member let we lay down with mill that `` the sole end for which mankind be warrant individually and collectively in interfere with the liberty of action of any of they member be self - protection '' and that coercion be only justified -lrb- 234 -rrb- for the prevention of harm to other this be the minimum claim the state can make and it will be admit that it be not only the right but the duty of the state to prevent harm to its member that be what it be for now no abstract or independent principle be discoverable why liberty of speech should be a privileged form of liberty of action or why society should lay down its arm of defense and fold its hand when it be persuade that harm be threaten to it through the speech of any of its member the government have to judge of the danger and its judgment may be wrong but if it be convince that harm be be do be it not its plain duty to interfere this argument supply a apology for the suppression of free opinion by government in ancient and modern time it can be urge for the inquisition for censorship of the press for blasphemy law for all coercive measure of the kind that if excessive or ill-judged they be intend to protect society against what they author sincerely believe to be grave injury and be simple act of duty -lrb- this apology of course do not extend to act do for the sake of the allege good of the victim themselves namely to secure they future salvation -rrb- nowadays we condemn all such measure -lrb- 235 -rrb- and disallow the right of the state to interfere with the free expression of opinion so deeply be the doctrine of liberty seat in we mind that we find it difficult to make allowance for the coercive practice of we misguided ancestor how be this doctrine justify it rest on no abstract basis on no principle independent of society itself but entirely on consideration of utility we see how socrate indicate the social value of freedom of discussion we see how milton observe that such freedom be necessary for the advance of knowledge but in the period during which the cause of toleration be fight for and practically win the argument more generally use be the injustice of punish a man for opinion which he honestly hold and could not help hold since conviction be not a matter of will in other word the argument that error be not a crime and that it be therefore unjust to punish it this argument however do not prove the case for freedom of discussion the advocate of coercion may reply : we admit that it be unjust to punish a man for private erroneous belief but it be not unjust to forbid the propagation of such belief if we be convince that they be harmful it be not unjust to punish he not for hold they but for publish they the truth -lrb- 236 -rrb- be that in examine principle the word just be mislead all the virtue be base on experience physiological or social and justice be no exception just designate a class of rule or principle of which the social utility have be find by experience to be paramount and which be recognize to be so important as to override all consideration of immediate expediency and social utility be the only test it be futile therefore to say to a government that it act unjustly in coerce opinion unless it be show that freedom of opinion be a principle of such overmaster social utility as to render other consideration negligible socrate have a true instinct in take the line that freedom be valuable to society the reason justification of liberty of thought be due to j s mill who set it forth in he work on liberty publish in 1859 this book treat of liberty in general and attempt to fix the frontier of the region in which individual freedom should be consider absolute and unassailable the second chapter consider liberty of thought and discussion and if many may think that mill unduly minimize the function of society underrate its claim as against the individual few will deny the justice of the chief argument or question the general soundness of he conclusion -lrb- 237 -rrb- point out that no fixed standard be recognize for test the propriety of the interference on the part of the community with its individual member he find the test in self-protection that be the prevention of harm to other he base the proposition not on abstract rights but on `` utility in the largest sense ground on the permanent interest of man as a progressive be '' he then use the follow argument to show that to silence opinion and discussion be always contrary to those permanent interest those who would suppress a opinion -lrb- it be assume that they be honest -rrb- deny its truth but they be not infallible they may be wrong or right or partly wrong and partly right -lrb- 1 -rrb- if they be wrong and the opinion they would crush be true they have rob or do they utmost to rob mankind of a truth they will say : but we be justified for we exercise we judgment to the best of we ability and be we to be tell that because we judgment be fallible we be not to use it we forbid the propagation of a opinion which we be sure be false and pernicious this imply no greater claim to infallibility than any act do by public authority if we be to act at all we must assume we own opinion to be true to this mill acutely reply : `` there be the greatest difference -lrb- 238 -rrb- between assume a opinion to be true because with every opportunity for contest it it have not be refute and assume its truth for the purpose of not permit its refutation complete liberty of contradict and disprove we opinion be the very condition which justify we in assume its truth for purpose of action and on no other term can a be with human faculty have any rational assurance of be right '' -lrb- 2 -rrb- if the receive opinion which it be seek to protect against the intrusion of error be true the suppression of discussion be still contrary to general utility a receive opinion may happen to be true -lrb- it be very seldom entirely true -rrb- but a rational certainty that it be so can only be secure by the fact that it have be fully canvass but have not be shake commoner and more important be -lrb- 3 -rrb- the case where the conflict doctrine share the truth between they here mill have little difficulty in prove the utility of supplement one-sided popular truth by other truth which popular opinion omit to consider and he observe that if either of the opinion which share the truth have a claim not merely to be tolerate but to be encourage it be the one which happen to be hold by the minority since this be the one `` which -lrb- 239 -rrb- for the time be represent the neglect interest '' he take the doctrine of rousseau which might conceivably have be suppress as pernicious to the self-complacent eighteenth century those doctrine come as `` a salutary shock dislocate the compact mass of one-sided opinion '' the current opinion be indeed nearer to the truth than rousseau 's they contain much less of error `` nevertheless there lay in rousseau 's doctrine and have float down the stream of opinion along with it a considerable amount of exactly those truth which the popular opinion want and these be the deposit which we leave behind when the flood subside '' such be the drift of mill 's main argument the present writer would prefer to state the justification of freedom of opinion in a somewhat different form though in accordance with mill 's reasoning the progress of civilization if it be partly condition by circumstance beyond man 's control depend more and in a increase measure on thing which be within he own power prominent among these be the advancement of knowledge and the deliberate adaptation of he habit and institution to new condition to advance knowledge and to correct error unrestricted freedom of discussion be require -lrb- 240 -rrb- history show that knowledge grow when speculation be perfectly free in greece and that in modern time since restriction on inquiry have be entirely remove it have advance with a velocity which would seem diabolical to the slave of the mediaeval church then it be obvious that in order to readjust social custom institution and method to new need and circumstance there must be unlimited freedom of canvassing and criticize they of express the most unpopular opinion no matter how offensive to prevail sentiment they may be if the history of civilization have any lesson to teach it be this : there be one supreme condition of mental and moral progress which it be completely within the power of man himself to secure and that be perfect liberty of thought and discussion the establishment of this liberty may be consider the most valuable achievement of modern civilization and as a condition of social progress it should be deem fundamental the consideration of permanent utility on which it rest must outweigh any calculation of present advantage which from time to time might be think to demand its violation it be evident that this whole argument depend on the assumption that the progress of the race its intellectual and moral development -lrb- 241 -rrb- be a reality and be valuable the argument will not appeal to any one who hold with cardinal newman that `` we race 's progress and perfectibility be a dream because revelation contradict it '' and he may consistently subscribe to the same writer 's conviction that `` it would be a gain to this country be it vastly more superstitious more bigoted more gloomy more fierce in its religion than at present it show itself to be '' while mill be write he brilliant essay which every one should read the english government of the day -lrb- 1858 -rrb- institute prosecution for the circulation of the doctrine that it be lawful to put tyrant to death on the ground that the doctrine be immoral fortunately the prosecution be not persist in mill refer to the matter and maintain that such a doctrine as tyrannicide -lrb- and let we add anarchy -rrb- do not form any exception to the rule that `` there ought to exist the fullest liberty of profess and discuss as a matter of ethical conviction any doctrine however immoral it may be consider '' exception case where the interference of the authority be proper be only apparent for they really come under another rule for instance if there be a direct instigation -lrb- 242 -rrb- to particular act of violence there may be a legitimate case for interference but the incitement must be deliberate and direct if i write a book condemn exist society and defend a theory of anarchy and a man who read it presently commit a outrage it may clearly be establish that my book make the man a anarchist and induce he to commit the crime but it would be illegitimate to punish I or suppress the book unless it contain a direct incitement to the specific crime which he commit it be conceivable that difficult case might arise where a government might be strongly tempt and might be urge by public clamor to violate the principle of liberty let we suppose a case very improbable but which will make the issue clear and definite imagine that a man of highly magnetic personality endowed with a wonderful power of infect other with he own idea however irrational in short a typical religious leader be convince that the world will come to a end in the course of a few month he go about the country preach and distribute pamphlet he word have a electrical effect and the mass of the uneducated and half-educated be persuade that they have indeed only a few week to prepare for the day of judgment multitude leave they -lrb- 243 -rrb- occupation abandon they work in order to spend the short time that remain in prayer and listen to the exhortation of the prophet the country be paralyze by the gigantic strike traffic and industry come to a standstill the people have a perfect legal right to give up they work and the prophet have a perfect legal right to propagate he opinion that the end of the world be at hand -- a opinion which jesus christ and he follower in they day hold quite as erroneously it would be say that desperate ill have desperate remedy and there would be a strong temptation to suppress the fanatic but to arrest a man who be not break the law or exhort any one to break it or cause a breach of the peace would be a act of glaring tyranny many will hold that the evil of set back the clock of liberty would out - balance all the temporary evil great as they might be cause by the propagation of a delusion it would be absurd to deny that liberty of speech may sometimes cause particular harm every good thing sometimes do harm government for instance which make fatal mistake law which so often bear hardly and inequitably in individual case and can the christian urge any other plea for they religion when they be unpleasantly remind that it have cause untold -lrb- 244 -rrb- suffering by its principle of exclusive salvation once the principle of liberty of thought be accept as a supreme condition of social progress it pass from the sphere of ordinary expediency into the sphere of higher expediency which we call justice in other word it become a right on which every man should be able to count the fact that this right be ultimately base on utility do not justify a government in curtail it on the ground of utility in particular case the recent rather alarming infliction of penalty for blasphemy in england illustrate this point it be commonly suppose that the blasphemy law -lrb- see above p 139 -rrb- though unrepealed be a dead letter but since December 1911 half a dozen person have be imprison for this offence in these case christian doctrine be attack by poor and more or less uneducated person in language which may be describe as coarse and offensive some of the judge seem to have take the line that it be not blasphemy to attack the fundamental doctrine provide `` the decency of controversy '' be preserved but that `` indecent '' attack constitute blasphemy this imply a new definition of legal blasphemy and be entirely contrary to the intention of the law sir -lrb- 245 -rrb- j f stephen point out that the decision of judge from the time of lord hale -lrb- xviith century -rrb- to the trial of foote -lrb- 1883 -rrb- lay down the same doctrine and base it on the same principle : the doctrine be that it be a crime either to deny the truth of the fundamental doctrine of the christian religion or to hold they up to contempt or ridicule and the principle be that christianity be a part of the law of the land the apology offer for such prosecution be that they object be to protect religious sentiment from insult and ridicule sir j f stephen observe : `` if the law be really impartial and punish blasphemy only because it offend the feeling of believer it ought also to punish such preach as offend the feeling of unbeliever all the more earnest and enthusiastic form of religion be extremely offensive to those who do not believe they '' if the law do not in any sense recognize the truth of christian doctrine it would have to apply the same rule to the salvation army in fact the law `` can be explain and justify only on what i regard as its true principle -- the principle of persecution '' the opponent of christianity may justly say : if christianity be false why be it to be attack only in polite language its goodness depend on its truth if you -lrb- 246 -rrb- grant its falsehood you can not maintain that it deserve special protection but the law impose no restraint on the christian however offensive he teaching may be to those who do not agree with he therefore it be not base on a impartial desire to prevent the use of language which cause offence therefore it be base on the hypothesis that christianity be true and therefore its principle be persecution of course the present administration of the common law in regard to blasphemy do not endanger the liberty of those unbeliever who have the capacity for contribute to progress but it violate the supreme principle of liberty of opinion and discussion it hinder uneducated people from say in the only way in which they know how to say it what those who have be bring up differently say with impunity far more effectively and far more insidiously some of the man who have be imprison during the last two year only utter in language of deplorable taste view that be express more or less politely in book which be in the library of a bishop unless he be a very ignorant person and against which the law if it have any validity ought to have be enforce thus the law as now administer simply penalize bad taste and place disability -lrb- 247 -rrb- upon uneducated freethinker if they word offend they audience so far as to cause a disturbance they should be prosecute for a breach of public order -lrb- 1 -rrb- not because they word be blasphemous a man who rob or injure a church or even a episcopal palace be not prosecute for sacrilege but for larceny or malicious damage or something of the kind the abolition of penalty for blasphemy be propose in the house of common -lrb- by bradlaugh -rrb- in 1889 and reject the reform be urgently need it would `` prevent the recurrence at irregular interval of scandalous prosecution which have never in any one instance benefit any one least of all the cause which they be intend to serve and which sometimes afford a channel for the gratification of private malice under the cloak of religion '' -lrb- 2 -rrb- the struggle of reason against authority have end in what appear now to be a decisive and permanent victory for liberty in the most civilized and progressive country freedom of discussion be recognize as a -lrb- 248 -rrb- fundamental principle in fact we may say it be accept as a test of enlightenment and the man in the street be forward in acknowledge that country like russium and spain where opinion be more or less fettered must on that account be consider less civilized than they neighbor all intellectual people who count take it for grant that there be no subject in heaven or earth which ought not to be investigate without any deference or reference to theological assumption no man of science have any fear of publish he research whatever consequence they may involve for current belief criticism of religious doctrine and of political and social institution be free hopeful people may feel confident that the victory be permanent that intellectual freedom be now assure to mankind as a possession for ever that the future will see the collapse of those force which still work against it and its gradual diffusion in the more backward part of the earth yet history may suggest that this prospect be not assure can we be certain that there may not come a great set - back for freedom of discussion and speculation be as we see fully realize in the greek and roman world and then a unforeseen force in the shape of christianity come in and lay chain upon the human mind and -lrb- 249 -rrb- suppress freedom and impose upon man a weary struggle to recover the freedom which he have lose be it not conceivable that something of the same kind may occur again that some new force emerge from the unknown may surprise the world and cause a similar set-back the possibility can not be deny but there be some consideration which render it improbable -lrb- apart from a catastrophe sweeping away european culture -rrb- there be certain radical difference between the intellectual situation now and in antiquity the fact know to the greek about the nature of the physical universe be few much that be teach be not prove compare what they know and what we know about astronomy and geography -- to take the two branch in which -lrb- besides mathematics -rrb- they make most progress when there be so few demonstrate fact to work upon there be the widest room for speculation now to suppress a number of rival theory in favor of one be a very different thing from suppress whole system of established fact if one school of astronomer hold that the earth go round the sun another that the sun go round the earth but neither be able to demonstrate its proposition it be easy for a authority which have coercive power -lrb- 250 -rrb- to suppress one of they successfully but once it be agree by all astronomer that the earth go round the sun it be a hopeless task for any authority to compel man to accept a false view in short because she be in possession of a vast mass of ascertain fact about the nature of the universe reason hold a much stronger position now than at the time when christian theology lead she captive all these fact be she fortification again it be difficult to see what can arrest the continuous progress of knowledge in the future in ancient time this progress depend on a few nowadays many nation take part in the work a general conviction of the importance of science prevail to-day which do not prevail in greece and the circumstance that the advance of material civilization depend on science be perhaps a practical guarantee that scientific research will not come to a abrupt halt in fact science be now a social institution as much as religion but if science seem pretty safe it be always possible that in country where the scientific spirit be hold in honor nevertheless serious restriction may be lay on speculation touch social political and religious question russium have man of science inferior to none and russium have its notorious censorship it -lrb- 251 -rrb- be by no means inconceivable that in land where opinion be now free coercion might be introduce if a revolutionary social movement prevail lead by man inspire by faith in formula -lrb- like the man of the french revolution -rrb- and resolve to impose they creed experience show that coercion would almost inevitably be resort to nevertheless while it would be silly to suppose that attempt may not be make in the future to put back the clock liberty be in a far more favourable position now than under the roman empire for at that time the social importance of freedom of opinion be not appreciate whereas now in consequence of the long conflict which be necessary in order to re - establish it man consciously realize its value perhaps this conviction will be strong enough to resist all conspiracy against liberty meanwhile nothing should be leave undo to impress upon the young that freedom of thought be a axiom of human progress it may be fear however that this be not likely to be do for a long time to come for we method of early education be found on authority it be true that child be sometimes exhort to think for themselves but the parent or instructor who give this excellent advice be confident that the result of the child 's thinking for -lrb- 252 -rrb- himself will agree with the opinion which he elder consider desirable it be assume that he will reason from principle which have already be instil into he by authority but if he think for himself take the form of question these principle whether moral or religious he parent and teacher unless they be very exceptional person will be extremely displeased and will certainly discourage he it be of course only singularly promising child whose freedom of thought will go so far in this sense it might be say that `` distrust thy father and mother '' be the first commandment with promise it should be a part of education to explain to child as soon as they be old enough to understand when it be reasonable and when it be not to accept what they
