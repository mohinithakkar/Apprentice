the fare she ` ad not get any change and when we get to the hall she do such eggsterrordinary thing try to find ` er pocket that i try to look as if she do not belong to I when she leave off she smile and say she be farther off than ever and arter three or four wot be stand there ` ad beg ` er to have another try i ` ad to pay for the two the ` ouse be pretty full when we get in but she do not take no notice of that she idea be that she could walk about all over the place look for cap'n tarbell and it take three man in button and a policeman to persuade ` er different we be push into a couple o ' seat at last and then she start find fault with I ` where be cap'n tarbell ' she se ` why do not you find he ' ` i 'll go and look for ` im in the bar presently ' i ses ` he be sure to be there arter a turn or two ' i manage to keep ` er quiet for ` arf a hour -- with the ` elp of the people wot sit near we -- and then i ` ad to go i ` ad a glass o ' beer to pass the time away and while i be drink it who should come up but the cook and one of the hand from the _ lizzie and annie _ ` we see you ' se the cook wink ` do not we bob ' ` yes ' se bob shake he silly ` ead ` but it be not no

' e be not there but i would ` ave another look for he by and by if she would ha ' whisper back it would ha ' be all right but she would not and arter a most unpleasant scene she walk out with she ` ead in the air foller by I with two man in button and a policeman o ' course nothing would do but she must go back to the wharf and wait for cap'n tarbell and all the way there i be wonder wot would ` appen if she go on board and find ` im there with mr plimmer however when we get there i persuade ` er to go into the office while i go aboard to see if i could find out where he be and three minute

with surprising ease push he bulky friend into the bar of the ship and anchor mr chase mellow by a long draught place he mug on the counter and eye he kindly say -- i have be in my lodgings thirteen

suppose to be out late you come ` ome let yourself in with you key and spot the hiding-place i get the cash and give you ten-golden-sovereign -- all to you little self it only occur to I after bert tell I about it that i be not be in the house alone for year he order some more beer and draw mr chase to a bench sit down to a long and steady argument it shake he faith in human nature to find that he friend estimate the affair as a twenty-pound job but he be in no position to bargain they come out smoking twopenny cigar whose strength be remarkable for they age and before they part mr chase be pledge to the hilt to do all that he could to save mr teak from the vice of avarice it be a more difficult undertaking than he have suppose the house small and compact seem to offer few opportunity for the concealment of large sum of money and after a fortnight 's residence he come to the conclusion that the treasure must have be hide in the garden the unalloyed pleasure however with which mr teak regard the effort of she husband to put under cultivation land that have lie fallow for twenty year convinced both man that they be on a wrong scent mr teak who do the digging be the first to realize it but he friend point out the suspicion that might be engender by a sudden cessation of labor induce he to persevere and try and look as if you like it he say severely why from the window even the back view of you look disagreeable i be fair sick of it declare mr teak anybody might ha ' know she would not have bury it in the garden she must ` ave be save for pretty near thirty year week by week and she could not keep come out here to hide it ` tai not likely mr chase ponder let she know casual like that i sha 'n' t be ` ome till late on Saturday he say slowly then you come ` ome in the afternoon and take she out as soon as you be go i 'll pop in and have a thorough good hunt round be she fond of animal i b ` lieve so say the other stare why take ` er to the zoo say mr chase

i feel sure mr smithson screw he lip together and remain silent when he feel that it be right and proper for he to come back pursue mr phipp turn she eye upwards he will come he have leave he comfortable home just for my sake and i shall not forget it mr smithson coughed-a short dry cough mean to convey incredulity i shall not do anything to this house till he come back say mr phipp i expect he would like to have a voice in it he always use to admire it and say how comfortable it be well well we never know what be before we mr smithson repeat the substance of the interview to mr clarkson by letter and in the lengthy correspondence that follow keep he post as to the movement of mr phipp by dint of warning and entreaty he keep the bridegroom-elect in london for three month by that time little molton be begin to talk they be begin to see how the land lay say mr smithson on the evening of he friend 's return and if you keep quiet and do as i tell you she 'll begin to see it too as i say before she can not name the day till you ask she mr clarkson agree and the follow morning when he call upon mr phipp at she request he manner be so distant that she attribute it to ill-health follow business worry and the atmosphere of london in the front parlor mr digson a small builder and contractor be busy whitewashing i think we might as well get on with that say mr phipp there be only one way of do whitewashing and the room have get to be do to-morrow mr digson will bring up some papers and if you 'll come round you can help I choose mr clarkson hesitate why not choose 'em yourself he say at last just what i tell she say mr digson stroke he black beard what 'll please you will be sure to please he i say and if it do not it ought to mr clarkson start perhaps

phipp after a faint protest give way and mr digson smile broadly mount he perch again mr clarkson 's first idea be to consult mr smithson then he resolve to wait upon event the idea be fantastic to begin with but if thing do take such a satisfactory turn he could not help reflect that it would not be due to any effort on the part of mr smithson and he would no longer be under any testamentary obligation to that enterprising gentleman by the end of a week he be jubilant a child could have tell mr digson 's intention -- and mr phipp be anything but a child mr clarkson admit cheerfully that mr digson be a younger and better-looking man than himself -- a more suitable match in every way and so far as he could judge mr phipp seem to think so at any rate she have cease to make the faintest allusion to any tie between they he leave she one day painting a door while the attentive digson guide the brush and walk homewards smile morning say a voice behind he morning bignell say mr clarkson when -- when be it to be inquire he friend walk beside he mr clarkson frown when be what to be he demand disagreeably mr bignell lower he voice you 'll lose she if you be not careful he say mark my

dazed condition in the center of the foot-path recover himself by a effort he walk slowly away and after prowl about for some time in a aimless fashion make he way back to mr phipp 's house he emerge a hour later a engage man with the date of the wedding fix with jaunty step he walk round and put up the banns and then with the air of a man who have complete a successful stroke of business walk homewards little molton be a small town and news travels fast but it do not travel faster than mr smithson as soon as he have hear it he burst into mr clarkson 's room like the proverbial hurricane and gasp for breath lean against the table and point at he a incriminate finger you you have be run say mr clarkson uneasily what -- what -- what do you -- mean by it gasp mr smithson after all my
