the principal the startling thing in the illuminate room on the ground-floor be a dressing-gown of the color between heliotrope and purple know to a previous generation as puce a quilted garment stuff with swansdown light as hydrogen -- nearly and warm as the smile of a kind heart old perhaps possibly worn in its outlying region and allow fluff of feathery white to escape through its satin pore but a dressing-gown to dream of it dominate the unkempt naked apartment its voluptuous fold glitter crudely under the sun-replacing oil lamp which be set on a cigar-box on the stain deal table the oil lamp have a glass reservoir a chip chimney and a cardboard shade and have probably cost less than a florin five florin would have purchase the table and all the rest of the furniture include the arm-chair in which the dressing-gown recline a stool a easel three packet of cigarette and a trouser-stretcher might have be replace for another ten florin up in the corner of the ceiling obscure in the eclipse of the cardboard shade be a complicated system of cobweb to match the dust on the bare floor within the dressing-gown there be a man this man have reach the interesting age i mean the age when you think you have shed all the illusion of infancy when you think you understand life and when you be often occupy in speculate upon the delicious surprise which existence may hold for you the age in sum that be the most romantic and tender of all age -- for a male i mean the age of fifty a age absurdly misunderstand by all those who have not reach it a thrilling age appearance be tragically deceptive the inhabitant of the puce dressing-gown have a short greying beard and moustache he plenteous hair be pass from pepper into salt there be many minute wrinkle in the hollow between he eye and the fresh crimson of he cheek and the eye be sad they be very sad have he stand erect and look perpendicularly down he would have perceive not he slipper but a protuberant button of the dressing-gown understand I : i conceal nothing i admit the figure write in the measurement-book of he tailor he be fifty yet like most man of fifty he be still very young and like most bachelor of fifty he be rather helpless he be quite sure that he have not have the best of luck if he have excavate he soul he would have discover somewhere in its deep a wistful appealing desire to be take care of to be sheltered from the inconvenience and harshness of the world but he would not have admit the discovery a bachelor of fifty can not be expect to admit that he resemble a girl of nineteen nevertheless it be a strange fact that the resemblance between the heart of a experienced adventurous bachelor of fifty and the simple heart of a girl of nineteen be stronger than girl of nineteen imagine especially when the bachelor of fifty be sit solitary and unfriended at two o'clock in the night in the forlorn atmosphere of a house that have outlive its hope bachelor of fifty alone will comprehend I it have never be decide what young girl do meditate upon when they meditate young girl themselves can not decide as a rule the lonely fancy of middle-aged bachelor be scarcely less amenable to definition but the case of the inhabitant of the puce dressing-gown be a exception to the rule he know and he could have say precisely what he be think about in that sad hour and place he melancholy thought be centre upon the resplendent unique success in life of a gifted and glorious be know to nation and newspaper as priam farll _ riches and renown _ in the day when the new gallery be new a picture sign by the unknown name of priam farll be exhibit there and arouse such terrific interest that for several month no conversation among culture person be regard as complete without some reference to it that the artist be a very great painter indeed be admit by every one the only question which culture person feel it they duty to settle be whether he be the greatest painter that ever live or merely the greatest painter since velasquez culture person might have continue to discuss that nice point to the present hour have it not leak out that the picture have be refuse by the royal academy the culture of london then at once heal up its strife and combine to fall on the royal academy as a institution which have no right to exist the affair even get into parliament and occupy three minute of the imperial legislature useless for the royal academy to argue that it have overlook the canvas for its dimension be seven foot by five it represent a policeman a simple policeman life-size and it be not merely the most striking portrait imaginable but the first appearance of the policeman in great art criminal one hear instinctively flee before it no the royal academy really could not argue that the work have be overlook and in truth the royal academy do not argue accidental negligence it do not argue about its own right to exist it do not argue at all it blandly go on exist and take about a hundred and fifty pound a day in shilling at its polished turnstile no detail be obtainable concern priam farll whose address be poste restante st martin 's - le-grand various collector animated by deep faith in they own judgment and a sincere desire to encourage british art be anxious to purchase the picture for a few pound and these enthusiast be astonished and pained to learn that priam farll have mark a figure of # 1000 -- the price of a rare postage stamp in consequence the picture be not sell and after a enterprising journal have unsuccessfully offer a reward for the identification of the portray policeman the matter go gently to sleep while the public employ its annual holiday as usual in discuss the big gooseberry of matrimonial relation every one naturally expect that in the following year the mysterious priam farll would in accordance with the universal rule for a successful career in british art contribute another portrait of another policeman to the new gallery -- and so on for about twenty year at the end of which period england would have learn to recognize he as its favorite painter of policeman but priam farll contribute nothing to the new gallery he have apparently forget the new gallery : which be consider to be ungracious if not ungrateful on he part instead he adorn the paris salon with a large seascape show penguin in the foreground now these penguin become the penguin of the continental year they make penguin the fashionable bird in pari and also -lrb- twelve month later -rrb- in london the french government offer to buy the picture on behalf of the republic at its customary price of five hundred franc but priam farll sell it to the american connoisseur whitney c whitt for five thousand dollar shortly afterwards he sell the policeman whom he have keep by he to the same connoisseur for ten thousand dollar whitney c whitt be the expert who have pay two hundred thousand dollar for a madonna and st joseph with donor of raphael the enterprising journal before mention calculate that count the space actually occupy on the canvas by the policeman the daring connoisseur have expend two guinea per square inch on the policeman at which stage the vast newspaper public suddenly wake up and demand with one voice : who be this priam farll though the query remain unanswered priam farll 's reputation be henceforward absolutely assure and this in spite of the fact that he omit to comply with the regulation ordain by english society for the conduct of successful painter he ought first to have take the elementary precaution of be bear in the united state he ought after have refuse all interview for month to have ultimately grant a special one to a newspaper with the largest circulation he ought to have return to england grow a mane and a tufted tail and become the king of beast or at least to have make a speech at a banquet about the noble and purifying mission of art assuredly he ought to have paint the portrait of he father or grandfather as a artisan to prove that he be not a snob but no not content with make each of he picture utterly different from all the other he neglect all the above formality -- and yet manage to pile triumph on triumph there be some man of whom it may be say that like a punter on a good day they can not do wrong priam farll be one such in a few year he have become a legend a standing side-dish of a riddle no one know he no one see he no one marry he constantly abroad he be ever the subject of conflict rumor parfitt themselves he london agent know naught of he but he handwriting -- on the back of cheque in four figure they sell a average of five large and five small picture for he every year these picture arrive out of the unknown and the cheque go into the unknown young artist mute in admiration before the masterpiece from he brush which enrich all the national gallery of europe -lrb- save of course that in trafalgar square -rrb- dream of he worship he and quarrel fiercely about he as the very symbol of glory luxury and flawless accomplishment never conceive he as a man like themselves with boot to lace up a palette to clean a beating heart and a instinctive fear of solitude finally there come to he the paramount distinction the last proof that he be appreciate the press actually fall into the habit of mention he name without explanatory comment exactly as it do not write mr aj balfor the eminent statesman or sarah bernhardt the renowned actress or charle peace the historic murderer but simply mr aj balfor sarah bernhardt or charle peace so it write simply mr priam farll and no occupant of a smoker in a morning train ever take he pipe out of he mouth to ask what be the johnny greater honor in england have no man priam farll be the first english painter to enjoy this supreme social reward and now he be inhabit the puce dressing-gown _ the dreadful secret _ a bell startle the forlorn house its loud old-fashioned jangle come echoingly up the basement stair and strike the ear of priam farll who half rise and then sit down again he know that it be a urgent summons to the front door and that none but he could answer it and yet he hesitate leave priam farll the great and wealthy artist we return to that far more interesting person priam farll the private human creature and come at once to the dreadful secret of he character the trait in he which explain the peculiar circumstance of he life as a private human creature he happen to be shy he be quite different from you or I we never feel secret qualm at the prospect of meeting stranger or of take quarter at a grand hotel or of enter a large house for the first time or of walk across a room full of seat people or of dismiss a servant or of argue with a haughty female aristocrat behind a post-office counter or of pass a shop where we owe money as for blush or hang back or even look awkward when face with any such simple everyday act the idea of conduct so childish would not occur to we we behave naturally under all circumstance -- for why should a sane man behave otherwise priam farll be different to call the world 's attention visually to the fact of he own existence be anguish to he but in a letter he could be absolutely brazen give he a pen and he be fearless now he know that he would have to go and open the front door both humanity and self-interest urge he to go instantly for the visitant be assuredly the doctor come at last to see the sick man lie upstairs the sick man be henry leek and henry leek be priam farll 's bad habit while somewhat of a rascal -lrb- as he master guess -rrb- leek be a very perfect valet like you and I he be never shy he always do the natural thing naturally he have become little by little indispensable to priam farll the sole means of live communication between priam farll and the universe of man the master 's shyness resemble a deer 's keep the pair almost entirely out of england and on they continuous travels the servant invariably stand between that sensitive diffidence and the world leek see every one who have to be see and do everything that involve personal contact and be a bad habit he have of course grow on priam farll and thus year after year for a quarter of a century farll 's shyness with he riches and he glory have increase happily leek be never ill that be to say he never have be ill until this day of they sudden incognito arrival in london for a brief sojourn he could hardly have choose a more inconvenient moment for in london of all place in that inherit house in selwood terrace which he so seldom use priam farll could not carry on daily life without he it really be unpleasant and disturbing in the highest degree this illness of leek 's the fellow have apparently catch cold on the night-boat he have fight the approach of insidious disease for several hour go forth to make purchase and incidentally consult a doctor and then without warn in the very act of make up farll 's couch he have abandon the struggle and since he own bed be not ready he have take to he master 's he always do the natural thing naturally and farll have be force to help he to undress from this point onward priam farll opulent though he be and illustrious have sink to a tragic impotence he could do nothing for himself and he could do nothing for leek because leek refuse both brandy and sandwich and the larder consist solely of brandy and sandwich the man lay upstairs there comatose still silent wait for the doctor who have promise to pay a evening visit and the summer day have darken into the summer night the notion of issue out into the world and personally obtain food for himself or aid for leek do genuinely seem to priam farll a impossible notion he have never do such thing for he a shop be a impregnable fort garrison by ogre besides it would have be necessary to ` ask ' and ` ask ' be the torture of torture so he have wander solicitous and helpless up and down the stair until at length leek cease to be a valet and deteriorate into a mere human organism have feebly yet curtly request to be just let alone assert that he be right enough whereupon the envy of all painter the symbol of artistic glory and triumph have assume the valet 's notorious puce dressing-gown and establish himself in a hard chair for a night of discomfort

horrible suspicion suppose he be _ seriously _ ill priam farll spring up nervously brace to meet ringer and knocker _ cure for shyness _ on the other side of the door dress in frock coat and silk hat there stand hesitate a tall thin weary man who have be afoot for exactly twenty hour in pursuit of he usual business of cure imaginary ailment by means of medicine and suggestion and leave real ailment to nature aid by color water he attitude towards the medical profession be somewhat sardonic partly because he be convince that only the gluttony of south kensington provide he with a livelihood but more because he wife and two fully-developed daughter spend too much on they frock for year lose sight of the fact that he be a immortal soul they have be treat he as a breakfast-in-the-slot machine : they put a breakfast in the slot push a button of he waistcoat and draw out banknote for this he have neither partner nor assistant nor carriage nor holiday : he wife and daughter could not afford he these luxury he be able conscientious chronically tired bald and fifty he be also strange as it may seem shy though indeed he have grow use to it as a man get use to a hollow tooth or a eel to skin no quality of the young girl 's heart about the heart of dr cashmore he really do know human nature and he never dream of anything more paradisaical than a Sunday pullman

begin nervous and abashed by she formidable stare be you want room she ask yes say he i be if i could just see -- will you come in she say and she morose face under stringent command from she brain begin a imitation of a smile which as a imitation be wonderful it make you wonder how she have ever teach she face to do it priam farll find himself blush on a turkey carpet and a sort of cathedral gloom around he he be disconcerted but the turkey carpet assure he somewhat as he eye grow habituate to the light he see that the cathedral be very narrow and that instead of the choir be a staircase also clothe in turkey carpet on the lowest step repose a object whose nature he could not at first determine would it be for long the lip opposite he mutter cautiously he reply -- the reply of a impulsive shy nature -- be to rush out of the palace he have identify the object on the stair it be a slop-pail with a wrung cloth on its head he feel profoundly discourage and pessimistic all he energy have leave he london have become hard hostile cruel impossible he long for leek with a great longing _ tea _ a hour later have at the kind suggestion of the cabman deposit leek 's goods at the cloak-room of south kensington station he be wander on foot out of old london into the central ring of new london where people never do anything except take the air in park lounge in club-windows roll to and fro in peculiar vehicle that have venture out without horse and be make the best of it buy flower and egyptian cigarette look at picture and eat and drink nearly all the building be higher than they use to be and the street wider and at interval of a hundred yard or so crane that rent the cloud and defy the law of gravity be continually swing brick and marble into the upper layer of the air violet be on sale at every corner and the atmosphere be impregnate with a intoxicating perfume of methylate spirit presently he arrive at a immense arched façade bearing principally the legend ` tea ' and he see within hundred of person sip tea and next to that be another arched façade bearing principally the word ` tea ' and he see within more hundred sip tea and then another and then another and then suddenly he come to a open circular place that seem vaguely familiar by jove he say this be piccadilly circus and just at that moment over a narrow doorway he perceive the image of a green tree and the word ` the elm tree ' it be the entrance to the elm tree tea room so well speak of in the _ telegraph _ in certain way he be a man of advanced and humane idea and the thought of delicately nurture needy gentlewoman bravely battle with the world instead of starve as they use to starve in the past appeal to he chivalry he determine to assist they by take tea in the advertised drawing-room gathering together he courage he penetrate into a corridor light by pink electricity and then up pink stair a pink door stop he at last it might have hide mysterious and questionable thing but it say laconically ` push ' and he courageously push he be in a kind of boudoir thickly populate with table and chair the swift transmigration from the blatant street to a drawing-room have a startling effect on he : it cause he to whip off he hat as though he hat have be red hot except for two tall elegant creature who stand together at the other end of the boudoir the chair and table have the place to themselves he be about to stammer a excuse and fly when one of the gentlewoman turn she eye on he for a moment and so he sit down the gentlewoman then resume they conversation he glance cautiously about he elm-tree firmly root in a border of indian matting grow round all the wall in exotic profusion and they topmost branch splash over on to the ceiling a card on the trunk of a tree announce curtly dog not allow seem to enhearten he after a pause one of the gentlewoman swim haughtily towards he and look he between the eye she speak no word but she firm austere glance say : now out with it and see you behave yourself he have be ready to smile chivalrously but the smile be put to sudden death some tea please he say faintly and he intimidate tone say if it be not trouble you too much what do you want with it ask the gentlewoman abruptly and as he be plainly at a loss she add crumpet or tea-cake tea-cake he reply though he hate tea-cake but he be afraid you have escape this time say the drapery of she muslin as she swim from he sight but no nonsense while i be away when she sternly and mutely thrust the refection before he he find that everything on the table except the tea-cake and the spoon be grow elm-tree after one cup and one slice when the tea have become stewed and undrinkable and the tea-cake a material suitable for the manufacture of shooting boot he resume at any rate partially he presence of mind and remember that he have do nothing positively criminal in enter the boudoir or drawing-room and request food in return for money besides the gentlewoman be now pretend to each other that he do not exist and no other rash person have be drive by hunger into the virgin forest of elm-tree he begin to meditate and he meditation take -- for he -- a unusual turn cause he surreptitiously to examine henry leek 's pocket-book -lrb- previously only know to he by sight -rrb- he have not for many year trouble himself concern money but the discovery that when he have pay for the deposit of luggage at the cloak-room a solitary sovereign rest in the pocket of leek 's trousers have suggest to he that it would be advisable sooner or later to consider the financial aspect of existence there be two banknote for ten pound each in leek 's pocket-book also five french banknote of a thousand franc each and a number of italian banknote of small denomination : the equivalent of two hundred and thirty pound altogether not count a fold inch-rule some postage stamp and a photograph of a pleasant-faced woman of forty or so this sum seem neither vast nor insignificant to priam farll it seem to he merely a tangible something which would enable he to banish the fiscal question from he mind for a indefinite period he scarcely even trouble to wonder what leek be do with over two year of leek 's income in he pocket-book he know or at least he with certainty guess that leek have be a rascal still he have have a sort of grim cynical affection for leek and the think that leek would never again shave he nor tell he in accent that brook no delay that he hair must be cut nor register he luggage and secure he seat on long-distance express fill he with very real melancholy he do not feel sorry for leek nor say to himself poor leek nobody who have have the advantage of leek 's acquaintance would have say poor leek for leek 's greatest speciality have always be the speciality of look after leek and wherever leek might be it be a surety that leek 's interest would not suffer therefore priam farll 's pity be mainly self-centred and though he dignity have be considerably damage during the final moment at selwood terrace there be matter for congratulation the doctor for instance have shake hand with he at parting have shake hand openly in the presence of duncan farll : a flattering tribute to he personality but the chief of priam farll 's satisfaction in that desolate hour be that he have suppress himself that for the world he exist no more i shall admit frankly that this satisfaction nearly outweigh he grief he sigh -- and it be a sigh of tremendous relief for now by a miracle he would be free from the menace of lady sophium entwistle look back in calmness at the still recent entwistle episode in paris -- the real originate cause of he sudden flight to london -- he be stagger by he latent capacity for downright impulsive foolishness like all shy people he have fit of amazing audacity -- and he recklessness usually take the form of make himself agreeable to woman whom he encounter in travel -lrb- he be much less shy with woman than with man -rrb- but to propose marriage to a weather-beaten haunter of hotel like lady sophium entwistle and to reveal he identity to she and to allow she to accept he proposal -- the thing have be unimaginably inept and now he be free for he be dead he be conscious of a chill in the spine as he dwell on the awful fate which he have escape he a man of fifty a man of set habit a man habituate to the liberty of the wild stag to bow he proud neck under the solid footwear of lady sophium entwistle yes there be most decidedly a silver line to the dark cloud of leek 's translation to another sphere of activity in replace the pocket-book he hand encounter the letter which have arrive for leek in the morning argue with himself whether he ought to open it he open it it run : dear mr leek i be so glad to have you letter and i think the photograph be most gentlemanly but i do wish you would not write with a typewriter you do not know how this affect a woman or you would not do it however i shall be so glad to meet you now as you suggest suppose we go to maskelyne and cook 's together to-morrow afternoon -lrb- Saturday -rrb- you know it be not the egyptian hall any more it be in st george 's hall i think but you will see it in the _ telegraph _ also the time i will be there when the door open you will recognize I from my photograph but i shall wear red rose in my hat so _ au revoir _ for the present yours sincerely alice challice p -- there be always a lot of dark part at maskelyne and cook 's i must ask you to behave as a gentleman should excuse I i merely mention it in case -- a c infamous leek here be at any rate one explanation of a mysterious little typewriter which the valet have always carry but which priam have leave at selwood terrace priam glance at the photograph in the pocket-book and also strange to say at the _ telegraph _ a lady with three child burst into the drawing-room and instantly occupy the whole of it the child cry mathaw mathah mathaw in shrill tone of varied joy as one of the gentlewoman pass near he he ask modestly -- how much please she drop a flake of paper on to he table without arrest she course and say warningly : you pay at the desk when he hit on the desk which be hide behind a screen of elm-tree he have to face a true aristocrat -- and not in muslin either if the other be the daughter of earl this be the authentic countess in a tea-gown he put down leek 's sovereign have not you anything smaller snap the countess i be sorry i have not he reply she pick up the sovereign scornfully and turn it over it be very awkward she mutter then she unlock two drawer and unwillingly give he eighteen and sixpence in silver and copper without another word and without look at he thank you say he pocket it nervously and amid reiterate cry of mathah mathaw mathah he hurry away unregarded unregretted splendidly repudiate by these delicate refined creature who be struggle for a livelihood in a great city _ alice challice _ i suppose you be mr leek be not you a woman greet he as he stand vaguely hesitant outside st george 's hall watch the afternoon audience emerge he start back as though the woman with she trace of cockney accent have present a revolver at he head he be very much afraid it may reasonably be ask what he be do up at st george 's hall the answer to this most natural question touch the deepest spring of human conduct there be two man in priam farll one be the shy man who have long ago persuade himself that he actually prefer not to mix with he kind and have make a virtue of he cowardice the other be a doggish devil-may-care fellow who love dash adventure and have a perfect passion for free intercourse with the entire human race no 2 would often lead no 1 unsuspectingly forward to a difficult situation from which no 1 though angry and uncomfortable could not retire thus it be no 2 who with the most casual air have wander up regent street draw by the slender chance of meet a woman with red rose in she hat and it be no 1 who have to pay the penalty nobody could have be more astonished than no 2 at the fulfillment of no 2 's secret yearning for novelty but the innocent sincerity of no 2 's astonishment give no aid to no 1 farll raise he hat and at the same moment perceive the rose he might have deny the name of leek and flee but he do not though he left leg be ready to run he right leg would not stir then he be shake hand with she but how have she identify he i do not really expect you say the lady always with a slight cockney accent but i think how silly it would be for I to miss the vanish trick just because you could not come so in i go by myself why do not you expect I he ask diffidently well she say mr farll be dead i know you would have a lot to do besides be upset like oh yes he say quickly feel that he must be more careful for he have quite forget that mr farll be dead how do you know how do i know she cry well i like that look anywhere it be all over london have be these six hour she point to a ragged man who be wear a orange-coloured placard by way of apron on the placard be print in large black letter : sudden death of priam farll in london special memoir other ragged man also wear apron but of different color similarly proclaim by they attire that priam farll be dead and people crowd out of st george 's hall be continually buy newspaper from these middleman of tiding he blush it be singular that he could have walk even half-an-hour in central london without notice that he own name fly in the summer breeze of every street but so it have be he be that sort of man now he understand how duncan farll have descend upon selwood terrace you do not mean to say you do not _ see _ those poster she demand i do not he say simply that show how you must have be think say she be he a good master yes very good say priam farll with conviction i see you be not in mourn no that be -- i do not hold with mourning myself she proceed they say it be to show respect but it seem to I that if you can not show you respect without a pair of black glove that the dye 's always come off i do not know what you think but i never do hold with mourn it be grumble against providence too not but what i think there be a good deal too much talk about providence i do not know what you think but -- i quite agree with you he say with a warm generous smile which sometimes rush up and transform he face before he be aware of the occurrence and she smile also gaze at he half confidentially she be a little woman stoutish -- indeed stout puffy red cheek a too remarkable white cotton blouse and a crimson skirt that hang unevenly gray cotton glove a green sunshade on the top of all this the black hat with red rose the photograph in leek 's pocket-book must have be take in the past she look quite forty-five whereas the photograph indicate thirty-nine and a fraction he gaze down at she protectively with a good-natured appreciative condescension i suppose you 'll have to be go back again soon to arrange thing like she say it be always she who keep the conversation afloat no he say i have finish there they have dismiss I who have the relative why he shake he head i hope you make they pay you you month say she firmly he be glad to be able to give a satisfactory answer after a pause she resume bravely : so mr farll be one of these artist at least so i see accord to the paper he nod it be a very funny business she say but i suppose there be some of they make quite a nice income out of it _ you _ ought to know about that be in it as it be never in he life have he converse on such term with such a person as mr alice challice she be in every way a novelty for he -- in clothes manners accent deportment outlook on the world and on paint he have hear and read of such being as mr alice challice and now he be in direct contact with one of they the whole affair strike he as excessively odd as a mad escapade on he part wisdom in he deem it ridiculous to prolong the encounter but shy folly could not break loose moreover she possess the charm of she novelty and there be that in she which challenge the male in he well she say i suppose we can not stand here for ever the crowd have fritter itself away and a attendant be close and lock the door of st george 's hall he cough it be a pity it be Saturday and all the shop close but anyhow suppose we walk along oxford street all the same shall we this from she by all means now there be one thing i should like to say she murmur with a calm smile as they move off you have no occasion to be shy with I there be no call for it i be just as you see I shy he exclaim genuinely surprise do i seem shy to you he think he have be magnificently doggish oh well she say that be all right then if you _ be not _ i should take it as a poor compliment be shy with I where do you think we can have a good talk i be free for the evening i do not know about you she eye question he _ no gratuity _ at a late hour they be enter side by side a glittering establishment whose interior seem to be walled chiefly in bevelled glass so that everywhere the curious observer see himself and twisted fraction of himself the glass be relieve at frequent interval by elaborate enamelled sign which repeat ` no gratuity ' it seem that the director of the establishment wish to make perfectly clear to visitor that whatever else they might find they must on no account expect gratuity i have always want to come here say mr alice challice vivaciously glance up at priam farll 's modest middle-aged face then after they have successfully pass through a preliminary pair of bevelled portal a huge man dress like a policeman and achieve a very successful imitation of a policeman stretch out he hand and stop they in line please he say i think it be a restaurant not a theater priam whisper to mr challice so it be a restaurant say he companion but i hear they be oblige to do like this because there be always such a crowd it be very ` andsome be not it he agree that it be he feel that london have get a long way in front of he and that he would have to hurry a great deal before he could catch it up at length another imitation of a policeman open more door and with other sinner they be release from purgatory into a clatter paradise which again offer everything save gratuity they be conduct to a small table full of dirty plate and empty glass in a corner of the vast and lofty saloon a man in evening dress whose eye say now mind no insulting gratuity rush past the table and in one deft amazing gesture sweep off the whole of its contents and be go with they it be a astounding feat and when priam recover from he amazement he fall into another amazement on discover that by some magic mean the man in evening dress have insinuate a gold-charactered menu into he hand this menu be exceedingly long -- it comprise everything except gratuity -- and evidently know from experience that it be not a document to be peruse and exhaust in five minute the man in evening dress take care not to interrupt the study of priam farll and alice challice during a full quarter of a hour then he return like a bolt put they through a examination in the menu and flee and when he be go they see that the table be set with a clean cloth and instrument and empty glass a band thereupon burst into gay strain like the band at a music-hall after something very difficult on the horizontal bar and it play louder and louder and as it play louder so the people talk louder and the crash of cymbal mingle with the crash of plate and the altercation of knife and fork with the shrill accent of chatterer determine to be hear and man in evening dress -lrb- a costume which seem to be forbid to sitter at table -rrb- flit to and fro with inconceivable rapidity austere preoccupy conjurer and from every marble wall bevel mirror and doric column there speak silently but insistently the haunting legend ` no gratuity ' thus priam farll begin he first public meal in modern london he know the hotel he know the restaurant of half-a-dozen country but he have never be so overwhelmed as he be here remember london as a city of wooden chop-house he could scarcely eat for the thought that surge through he brain be not it amusing say mr challice benignantly over a glass of lager i be so glad you bring I here i have always want to come and then a few minute afterwards she be say against the immense din -- you know i have be think for year of get married again and if you really _ be _ thinking of get married what be you to do you may sit in a chair and wait till egg be sixpence a dozen and you 'll be no nearer you must do something and what be there except a matrimonial agency i say -- what be the matter with a matrimonial agency anyhow if you want to get marry you want to get marry and it be no use pretend you do not i do hate pretend i do no shame in want to get marry be there i think a matrimonial agency be a very good useful thing they say you be swindle well those that be deserve to be you can be swindle without a matrimonial agency seem to I not that i have ever be plain common-sense people never be no if you ask I matrimonial agency be the most sensible thing -- after dress-shield -- that be ever be invent and i be sure if anything come of this i shall pay the fee with the greatest pleasure now do not you agree with I the whole mystery stand explain absolutely he say and feel the skin creep in the small of he back \* \* \* \* \* chapter iii _ the photograph _ from the moment of mr challice 's remark in favor of matrimonial agency priam farll 's existence become a torture to he she be what he have always be accustom to think of as a very decent woman but really the sentence be not finish because priam never finish it in he own mind fifty time he conduct the sentence as far as ` really ' and there it dissolve into a uncomfortable cloud i suppose we shall have to be go say she when she ice have be eat and he have melt yes say he and add to himself but where however it would be a relief to get out of the restaurant and he call for the bill while they be wait for the bill the situation grow more strained priam be aware of a desire to fling down sovereign on the table and rush wildly away even mrs challice vaguely feel this have a difficulty in converse you _ be _ like you photograph she remark glance at he face which -- it should be say -- have very much change within half-an-hour he have a face capable of a hundred expression per day he present expression be one of he anxious expression medium in degree it can be figure in the mask of a person who be lock up in a iron strongroom and feeling ill at ease notice that the wall be get red-hot at the corner like my photograph he exclaim astonished that he should resemble leek 's photograph yes she asseverate stoutly i know you at once especially by the nose have you get it here he ask interested to see what portrait of leek have a nose like he own and she pull out of she handbag a photograph not of leek but of priam farll it be a unmounted print of a negative which he and leek have take together for the purpose of a pose in a picture and it have decidedly a distinguished appearance but why should leek dispatch photograph of he master to strange lady introduce through a matrimonial agency priam farll could not imagine -- unless it be from sheer unscrupulous careless bounce she gaze at the portrait with obvious joy now candidly do not _ you _ think it be very very good she demand i suppose it be he agree he would probably have give two hundred pound for the courage to explain to she in a few well-chosen word that there have be a vast mistake a huge impulsive indiscretion but two hundred thousand pound would not have buy that courage i love it she ejaculate fervently -- with heat and yet so nicely and she return the photograph to she little bag she lower she voice you have not tell I whether you be ever marry i have be wait for that he blush she be disconcertingly personal no he say and you have always live like that alone like no home travel about no one to look after you properly there be distress in she voice he nod one get accustomed to it oh yes she say i can understand that no responsibility he add no i can understand all that then she hesitate but i do feel so sorry for you all these year and she eye be moist and she tone be so sincere that priam farll find it quite remarkably affect of course she be talk about henry leek the humble valet and not about leek 's illustrious master but priam see no difference between he lot and that of leek he feel that there be no essential difference and that despite leek 's multiple perfection as a valet he never have be look after -- properly she voice make he feel just as sorry for himself as she be sorry for he it make he feel that she have a kind heart and that a kind heart be the only thing on earth that really matter ah if lady sophium entwistle have speak to he in such accent the bill come it be so small that he be ashamed to pay it the suppression of gratuity enable the monarch of this bevelled palace to offer a complete dinner for about the same price as a thimbleful of tea and ten drachm of cake a few yard away happily the monarch foresee he shame have arrange a peculiar method of payment through a little hole where the receiver could see nothing but he blush hand as for the conjurer in evening dress they apparently never soil themselves by contact with specie outside on the pavement he be at a loss what to do you see he be entirely unfamiliar with mr challice 's code of etiquette would you care to go to the alhambra or somewhere he suggest have a notion that this be the correct thing to say to a lady whose presence near you be directly due to she desire for marriage it be very good of you say she but i be sure you only say it out of kindness -- because you be a gentleman it would not be quite nice for you to go to a music-hall to-night i know i say i be free for the evening but i be not think it be not a hint -- no truly i think i shall go home -- and perhaps some other -- i shall see you home say he quickly impulsive again would you really like to can you in the bluish glare of a electricity that make the street whiter than day she blush yes she blush like a girl she lead he up a side-street where be a kind of railway station unfamiliar to priam farll 's experience tile like a butcher 's shop and as clean as holland under she direction he take ticket for a station whose name he have never hear of and then they pass through steel railing which clack behind they into a sort of safe deposit from which the only emergence be a long dim tunnel paint hand point to the mysterious word ` lift ' wave you onwards down this tunnel hurry up please come a voice out of the spectral gloom mr challice thereupon run now up the tunnel oppose all human progress there blow a steady trade-wind of tremendous force immediately priam begin to run the trade-wind remove he hat which sail buoyantly back towards the street he be after it like a youth of twenty and he recapture it but when he reach the extremity of the tunnel he amaze eye see nothing but a great cage of human animal press tightly together behind bar there be a click and the whole cage sink from he sight into the earth he feel that there be more than he have dream of in the city of miracle in a couple of minute another cage rise into the tunnel at a different point vomit its captive and descend swiftly again with priam and many other and throw he and the rest out into a white mine consist of numberless gallery he run about these interminable gallery underneath london at the bidding of paint hand for a considerable time and occasionally magic train without engine sweep across he vision but he could not find even the spirit of mr alice challice in this nether world _ the nest _ on letter-paper head grand babylon hotel london he be write in a disguise backward hand a note to the following effect : duncan farll esq sir -- if any letter or telegram arrive for I at selwood terrace be good enough to have they forward to I at once to the above address -- yours truly h leek it cost he something to sign the name of the dead man but he instinctively guess that duncan farll might be a sieve which -lrb- owe to its legal-mindedness -rrb- would easily get clog up even by a slight suspicion hence in order to be sure of receive a possible letter or telegram from mrs challice he must openly label himself as henry leek he have lose mr challice there be no address on she letter he only know that she live at or near putney and the sole hope of find she again lay in the fact that she have the selwood terrace address he want to find she again he desire that ardently if merely to explain to she that they separation be due to a sudden caprice of he hat and that he have search for she everywhere in the mine anxiously desperately she would surely not imagine that he have slip away from she on purpose no and yet if incapable of such a enormity why have she not wait for he on one of the platform however he hope for the best the best be a telegram the second-best a letter on receipt of which he would fly to she to explain and besides he want to see she -- simply she answer to he suggestion of a music-hall and the tone of it have impressed he and she remark i do feel so sorry for you all these year have -- well somewhat change he whole outlook on life yes he want to see she in order to satisfy himself that he have she respect a woman impossible socially a woman with strange habit and trick of manner -lrb- no doubt there be million such -rrb- but a woman whose respect one would not forfeit without a struggle he have be push to a extremity force to act with swiftness upon lose she and he have do the thing that come most naturally to a life-long traveller he have drive to the best hotel in the town -lrb- he have see in a flash that the idea of inhabit any private hotel whatever be a silly idea -rrb- and now he be in a large bedroom over-look the thame -- a chamber with a writing-desk a sofa five electric light two easy-chair a telephone electric bell and a massive oak door with a lock and a key in the lock in short he castle a enterprise of some daring to storm the castle : but he have storm it he have register under the name of leek a name sufficiently common not to excite remark and the floor-valet have prove to be a admirable young man he trust to the floor-valet and to the telephone for avoid any rough contact with the world he feel comparatively safe now the entire enormous hotel be a nest for he shyness a conspiracy to keep he in cotton-wool he be a autocratic number absolute ruler over room 331 and with the right to command the almost limitless resource of the grand babylon for he own private end as he seal the envelope he touch a bell the valet enter you have get the evening papers ask priam farll yes sir the valet put a pile of papers respectfully on the desk all of they yes sir thanks well it be not too late to have a messenger be it oh _ no _ sir -lrb- ` too late ' in the grand babylon oh czar say the valet 's shocked tone -rrb- then please get a messenger to take this letter at once in a cab sir yes in a cab i do not know whether there will be a answer he will see then let he call at the cloak-room at south kensington station and get my luggage here be the ticket thank you sir i can rely on you to see that he go at once you can sir say the valet in such accent as carry absolute conviction thank you that will do i think the man retire and the door be close by a expert in close door one who have devote he life to the perfection of detail in valetry _ fame _ he lay on the sofa at the foot of the bed with all illumination extinguish save one crimson-shaded light immediately above he the evening papers -- white green rise cream and yellow -- share he couch he be about to glance at the obituary to glance at they in a careless condescending way just to see the _ sort _ of thing that journalist have write of he he know the value of obituary he have often smile at they he know also the exceed fatuity of art criticism which do not cause he even to smile be simply a bear he recollect further that he be not the first man to read he own obituary the adventure have happen to other and he could recall how on he have hear that owe to a error it have happen to the great so-and-so he in he quality of philosopher have instantly decide what frame of mind the great so-and-so ought to have assume for the perusal of he biography he carefully and deliberately adopt that frame of mind now he think of marcus aurelius on the futility of fame he remember he life-long attitude of gentle tired scorn for the press he reflect with wise modesty that in art nothing count but the work itself and that no quantity of inept chatter could possibly affect for good or evil he value such as it might be to the world then he begin to open the papers the first glimpse of they contents make he jump in fact the physical result of it be quite extraordinary he temperature increase he heart become audible he pulse quicken and there be a tingling as far off as he toe he have feel in a dim unacknowledged way that he must be a pretty great painter of course he price be notorious and he have guess though vaguely that he be the object of widespread curiosity but he have never compare himself with titanic figure on the planet it have always seem to he that _ he _ renown be different from other renown less -- somehow unreal and make-believe he have never imaginatively grasp despite price and public inquisitiveness that he too be one of the titanic figure he grasp it now the aspect of the papers bring it home to he with tremendous force special large type title stretch across two column black border round the page death of england 's greatest painter sudden death of priam farll sad death of a great genius puzzling career prematurely close europe in mourn irreparable loss to the world 's art it be with the most profound regret we reader will be shock the news will come as a personal blow to every lover of great painting so the papers go on outvy each other in enthusiastic grief he cease to be careless and condescending to they the skin creep along he spine there he lay solitary under the crimson glow lock in he castle human with the outward semblance of a man like other man and yet the city of europe be weep for he he hear they weep every lover of great painting be under a sense of personal bereavement the very voice of the world be hush after all it be something to have do you best after all good stuff _ be _ appreciate by the mass of the race the phenomenon present by the evening papers be certainly prodigious and prodigiously affect mankind be unpleasantly stun by the report of he decease he forget that mr challice for instance have perfectly succeed in hide she grief for the irreparable loss and that she question about priam farll have be almost perfunctory he forget that he have witness absolutely no sign of overwhelming sorrow or of any degree of sorrow in the thoroughfare of the teem capital and that the hotel do not resound to sob he know only that all europe be in mourning i suppose i be rather wonderful -- _ be _ i mean -- he say to himself daze and happy yes happy the fact be i have get so use to my own work that perhaps i do not think enough of it he say this as modestly as he could there be no question now of casually glance at the obituary he could not miss a single line a single word he even regret that the detail of he life be so few and unimportant it seem to he that it be the business of the journalist to have know more to have display more enterprise in acquire information still the tone be right the fellow mean well at any rate he eye encounter nothing but praise indeed the press of london have yield itself up to a encomiastic orgy he modesty try to say that this be slightly overdo but he impartiality ask really what _ could _ they say against I as a rule unmitigated praise be nauseous but here they be undoubtedly genuine the fellow they sentence ring true never in he life have he be so satisfied with the scheme of the universe he be nearly console for the dissolution of leek when after continued reading he come across a phrase which discreetly insinuate apropo of the policeman and the penguin that capriciousness in the choice of subject be perhaps a pose with he the accusation hurt pose he inwardly exclaim what a lie the man 's a ass and he resent the follow remark which conclude a ` special memoir ' extremely laudatory in matter and manner by a expert whose book he have always respect : however contemporary judgment be in the large majority of case notoriously wrong and it behoove we to remember this in choose a niche for we idol time alone can settle the ultimate position of priam farll useless for he modesty to whisper to he that contemporary judgment _ be _ notoriously wrong he do not like it it disturb he there be exception to every rule and if the connoisseur mean anything at all he be simply stultify the rest of the article time be d -- d he have come nearly to the last line of the last obituary before he be finally ruffle most of the sheet in excuse the paucity of biographical detail have remark that priam farll be utterly unknown to london society of a retire disposition hate publicity a recluse etc the word recluse grate on he sensitiveness a little but when the least important of the evening papers roundly assert it to be notorious that he be of extremely eccentric habit he grow secretly furious neither he modesty nor he philosophy be influential enough to restore he to complete calm eccentric he what next eccentric indeed now what conceivable justification ------ _ the ruling class _ between a quarter-past and half-past eleven he be seat alone at a small table in the restaurant of the grand babylon he have have no news of mr challice she have not instantly telegraph to selwood terrace as he have wildly hope but in the box of henry leek safely retrieve by the messenger from south kensington station he have discover one of he old dress-suit not too old and this dress-suit he have don the desire to move about unknown in the well-clad world the world of the frequenter of costly hotel the world to which he be accustom have overtake he moreover he feel hungry hence he have descend to the famous restaurant whose wide window be fling open to the illuminate majesty of the thame embankment the pale cream room be nearly full of expensive woman and expend man and silver-chained waiter whose skilled noiseless inhuman attention be remunerate at the rate of about four-penny a minute music the midnight food of love float scarce hear through the tinted atmosphere it be the best imitation of roman luxury that london could offer and after selwood terrace and the rackety palace of no gratuity priam farll enjoy it as one enjoy home after strange clime next to he table be a empty table set for two to which be presently conduct with due state a young man and

will be grateful five-sixth of the remain light go out and the entire company follow they in the foyer there be a prodigious crush of opera cloak silk hat and cigar all jostle together news arrive from the strand that the weather have turn to rain and all the intellect of the grand babylon be centre upon the british climate exactly as if the british climate have be the latest discovery of science as the door swing to and fro the stridency of whistle the throbbing of motor-car and the hoarse cry of inhabitant of box seat mingle strangely with the delicate babble of the interior then lo as by magic the foyer be empty save for the denizen of the hotel who could produce evidence of identity it have be prove to demonstration for the sixth time that week that in the metropolis of the greatest of empire there be not one law for the rich and another for the poor deeply affect by what he have overhear priam farll rise in a lift and seek he bed he perceive clearly that he have be among the govern class of the realm \* \* \* \* \* chapter iv _ a scoop _ within less than twelve hour after that conversation between member of the govern class at the grand babylon hotel priam farll hear the first deep-throated echo of the voice of england on the question of he funeral the voice of england issue on this occasion through the mouth of the _ Sunday news _ a newspaper which belong to lord nase the proprietor of the _ daily record _ there be a column in the _ Sunday news _ partly concern the meeting of priam farll and a celebrated star of the musical comedy stage at ostend there be also a lead article in which it be make perfectly clear that england would stand ashamed among the nation if she do not inter she greatest painter in westminster abbey only the article instead of say westminster abbey say national valhallum it seem to make a point of not mention westminster abbey by name as though westminster abbey have be something not quite mentionable such as a pair of trousers the article end with the word ` basilica ' and by the time you have reach this majestic substantive you feel indeed with the _ Sunday news _ that a national valhallum without the remains of a priam farll inside it would be shocking if not inconceivable priam farll be extremely disturb on Monday morning the _ daily record _ come nobly to the support of the _ Sunday news _ it have evidently spend its Sunday in collect the opinion of a number of famous man -- include three mp 's a banker a colonial premier a kc a cricketer and the president of the royal academy -- as to whether the national valhallum be or be not a suitable place for the repose of the remains of priam farll and the unanimous reply be in the affirmative other newspaper express the same view but there be opponent of the scheme some organ coldly inquire what priam farll have _ do _ for england and particularly for the higher life of england he have not be a moral painter like hogarth or sir noel paton nor a worshipper of classic legend and beauty like the unique leighton he have openly scorn england he have never live in england he have avoid the royal academy honor every country save he own and be he such a great painter after all be he anything but a clever dauber whose work have be force into general admiration by the effort of a small clique of eccentric admirer far be it from they the organ to decry a dead man but the national valhallum be the national valhallum and so on the penny evening papers be pro-farll one of they furiously so you gather that if priam farll be not bury in westminster abbey the penny evening papers would from mere disgust wipe they boot on dover cliff and quit england eternally for some land where art be understand you gather by nightfall that fleet street must be a scene of carnage full of enthusiast cut each other 's throat for the sake of the honor of art however no abnormal phenomenon be superficially observable in fleet street nor be martial law proclaim at the art club in dover street london be impassion by the question of farll 's funeral a few hour would decide if england be to be shame among the nation : and yet the town seem to pursue its jog-trot way exactly as usual the gaiety theater perform its celebrated nightly musical comedy house full and at queen 's hall quite a large audience be collect to listen to a violinist aged twelve who play like a man though a little one and whose service have be buy for seven year by a limited company the next morning the controversy be settle by one of the _ daily record 's _ characteristic ` scoop ' in the nature of the case such controversy if they be not settle quickly settle themselves quickly they can not be prolong but it be the _ daily record _ that settle this one the _ daily record _ come out with a copy of the will of priam farll in which after leave a pound a week for life to he valet henry leek priam farll bequeath the remainder of he fortune to the nation for the building and up-keep of a gallery of great master priam farll 's own collection of great master gradually make by he in that inexpensive manner which be possible only to the finest connoisseur be to form the nucleus of the gallery it comprise say the _ record _ several rembrandt a velasquez six vermeer a giorgione a turner a charle two crome a holbein -lrb- after charle the _ record _ put a note of interrogation itself be uncertain of the name -rrb- the picture be in paris -- have be for many year the leading idea of the gallery be that nothing not absolutely first-class should be admit to it the testator attach two condition to the bequest one be that he own name should be inscribe nowhere in the building and the other be that none of he own picture should be admit to the gallery be not this sublime be not this true british pride be not this magnificently unlike the ordinary benefactor of he country the _ record _ be in a position to assert that priam farll 's estate would amount to about a hundred and forty thousand pound in addition to the value of the picture after that be anybody go to argue that he ought not to be bury in the national valhallum a philanthropist so royal and so proudly meek the opposition give up priam farll grow more and more disturbed in he fortress at the grand babylon hotel he perfectly remember make the will he have make it about seventeen year before after some champagne in venice in a hour of anger against some english criticism of he work yes english criticism it be he vanity that have prompt he to reply in that manner moreover he be quite young then he remember the youthful glee with which he have appoint he next-of-kin whoever they might be executor and trustee of the will he remember he cruel joy in picture they disgust at be compel to carry out the term of such a will often since he have mean to destroy the will but carelessly he have always omit to do so and he collection and he fortune have continue to increase regularly and mightily and now -- well there the thing be duncan farll have find the will and duncan farll would be the executor and trustee of that melodramatic testament he could not help smile serious as the situation be during that day the thing be settle the authority speak the word go forth priam farll be to be bury in westminster abbey on the Thursday the dignity of england among artistic nation have be save partly by the heroic effort of the _ daily record _ and partly by the will which prove that after all priam farll have have the highest interest of he country at heart _ cowardice _ on the night between Tuesday and Wednesday priam farll have not a moment of sleep whether it be the deep-throated voice of england that have speak or merely the voice of the dean 's favorite niece -- so skilled in painting tea-cosy -- the affair be excessively serious for the nation be prepare to inter in the national valhallum the remains of just henry leek priam 's mind have often a sardonic turn he be assuredly capable of strange caprice : but even he could not permit a error so gigantic to continue the matter must be rectify and instantly and he alone could rectify it the strain on he shyness would be awful would be scarcely endurable nevertheless he must act quite apart from other consideration there be the consideration of that hundred and forty thousand pound which be he and which he have not the slightest desire to leave to the british nation and as for give he beloved picture to the race which adore landseer edwin long and leighton -- the idea nauseate he he must go and see duncan farll and explain yes explain that he be not dead then he have a vision of duncan farll 's hard stupid face and impenetrable steel head and of himself be kick out of the house or deliver over to a policeman or in some subtler way unimaginably insult could he confront duncan farll be a hundred and forty thousand pound and the dignity of the british nation worth the bearding of duncan farll no he distaste for duncan farll amount to more than a hundred and forty million of pound and the dignity of whole planet he feel that he could never bring himself to meet duncan farll why duncan might shove he into a lunatic asylum might still he must act then it be that occur to he the brilliant notion of make a clean breast of it to the dean he have not the pleasure of the dean 's personal acquaintance the dean be a abstraction certainly much more abstract than priam farll he think he could meet the dean a terrific enterprise but he must accomplish it after all a dean -- what be it nothing but a man with a funny hat and be not he himself priam farll the authentic priam farll vastly greater than any dean he tell the valet to buy black glove and a silk hat size seven and a quarter and to bring up a copy of _ who be who _ he hope the valet would be dilatory in execute these command but the valet seem to fulfill they by magic time fly so fast that -lrb- in a way of speaking -rrb- you could hardly see the finger as they whirl round the clock and almost before he know where he be two commissionaire be help he into a auto-cab and the terrific enterprise have begin the auto-cab would easily have win the race for the gordon bennett cup it be of about two hundred hp and it arrive in dean 's yard in less time than a fluent speaker would take to say jack robinson the rapidity of the flight be simply incredible i 'll keep you priam farll be go to say as he descend but he think it would be more final to dismiss the machine so he dismiss it he ring the bell with frantic haste lest he should run away ere he have ring it and then he heart go thump and the perspiration damp the lovely lining of he new hat and he leg tremble literally he be in hell on the dean 's doorstep the door be open by a man in livery of prelatical black who eye he inimically er -- stammer priam farll utterly flustered and craven be this mr parker 's now parker be not the dean 's name and priam know that it be not parker be merely the first name that have come into priam 's cowardly head no it be not say the flunkey with censorious lip it be the dean 's oh i beg pardon say priam farll i think it be mr parker 's and he depart between the ringing of the bell and the flunkey 's appearance he have clearly see what he be capable and what he be incapable of do and the correction of england 's error be among he incapacity he could not face the dean he could not face any one he be a poltroon in all these thing a poltroon no use argue he could not do it i think it be mr parker 's good heaven to what depths can a great artist fall that evening he receive a cold letter from duncan farll with a nave-ticket for the funeral duncan farll do not venture to be sure that mr henry leek would think proper to attend he master 's interment but he enclose a ticket he also state that the pound a week would be pay to he in due course lastly he state that several newspaper representative have demand mr henry leek 's address but he have not think fit to gratify this curiosity priam be glad of that well i be dash he reflect handle the ticket for the nave there it be large glossy real as life _ in the valhallum _ in the vast nave there be relatively few people -- that be to say a few hundred who have sufficient room to move easily to and fro under the eye of official priam farll have be admit through the cloister accord to the direction print on the ticket in he nervous fancy he imagine that everybody must be gaze at he suspiciously but the fact be that he occupy the attention of no one at all he be with the unprivileged on the wrong side of the massive screen which separate the nave from the packed choir and transept and the unprivileged be never interested in themselves it be the privileged who interest they the organ be waft a melody of purcell to the furthest limit of the abbey round a roped space a few ecclesiastical uniform keep watch over the ground that would be the tomb the sunlight of noon beat and quiver in long lance through crimson and blue window then the functionary begin to form a aisle among the spectator and emotion grow tenser the organ be silent for a moment and when it recommence its song the song be the supreme expression of human grief the dirge of chopin wrap the whole cathedral in heavy fold of sorrow and as that appeal expire in the pulsating air the fresh voice of little boy sweeter even than grief rise in the distance it be at this point that priam farll descry lady sophium entwistle a tall veil figure in full mourning she have come among the comparatively unprivileged to he funeral doubtless influence such as hers could have obtain she a seat in the transept but she have prefer the secluded humility of the nave she have come from pari for he funeral she be weep for she affianced she stand there actually within ten yard of he she have not catch sight of he but she might do so at any moment and she be slowly approach the spot where he tremble he flee with nothing in he heart but resentment against she she have not propose to he he have propose to she she have not throw he aside he have throw she aside he be not one of she mistake she be one of he mistake not she but he have be capricious impulsive hasty yet he hate she he genuinely think she have sin against he and that she ought to be exterminate he condemn she for all manner of thing as to which she have have no choice : for instance the irregularity of she tooth and the hollow under she chin and the little trick of deportment which be always develop by a spinster as she reach forty he flee in terror of she if she should have a glimpse of he and should recognize he the consequence would be absolutely disastrous -- disastrous in every way and a period of publicity would dawn for he such as he could not possibly contemplate either in cold blood or warm he flee blindly insinuate himself through the crowd until he reach a grille in which be a gate ajar he strange stare must have affright the guardian of the gate for the robed fellow stand away and priam pass within the grille where be wind step which he mount up the step run coil of fire-hose he hear the click of the gate as the attendant shut it and he be thankful for a escape the step lead to the organ-loft perch on the top of the massive screen the organist be seat behind a half-drawn curtain under shaded electric light and on the ample platform whose parapet overlook the choir be two young man who whisper with the organist none of the three even glance at priam priam sit down on a windsor chair fearfully like a intruder he face towards the choir the whisper cease the organist 's finger begin to move over five row of note and over score of stop while he foot grope beneath and priam hear music afar off and close behind he he hear rumbling steamy vibration and as it be sudden escape of gas and comprehend that these be the hoarse response of the 32 and 64 foot pipe lay horizontally along the roof of the screen to the summon finger of the organist it be all uncanny weird supernatural demoniacal if you will -- it be part of the secret and unsuspected mechanism of a vast emotional pageant and spectacle it unnerve priam especially when the organist a handsome youngish man with lustrous eye half turn and wink at one of he companion the thrilling voice of the chorister grow louder and as they grow louder priam farll be conscious of unaccustomed phenomenon in he throat which shut and open of itself convulsively to divert he attention from he throat he partially rise from the windsor chair and peep over the parapet of the screen into the choir whose depths be candlelit and whose altitude be capriciously bath by the intermittent splendor of the sun high high up in front of he at the summit of a precipice of stone a little window out of the sunshine burn sullenly in a gloom of complicated perspective and far below stretch round the pulpit and disappear among the forest of statuary in the transept be a floor consist of the head of the privileged -- famous renowned notorious by heredity talent enterprise or hazard he have read many of they name in the _ daily telegraph _ the voice of the chorister have become pierce in they beauty priam frankly stand up and lean over the parapet every gaze be turn to a point under he which he could not see and then something sway from beneath into the field of he vision it be a tall cross bear by a beadle in the wake of the cross there come to view gorgeous ecclesiastic in pair and then a robed man walk backwards and gesticulate in the manner of some important excited official of the salvation army and after this violet robe arrive the scarlet chorister sing to the beat of he gesture and then swing into view the coffin cover with a heavy purple pall and on the pall a single white cross and the pall-bearer -- great european name that have hurry out of the corner of europe as at a peremptory mandate -- with duncan farll to complete the tale be it the coffin or the richness of its pall or the solitary whiteness of its cross of flower or the August authority of the bearer that affect priam farll like a blow on the heart who know but the fact be that he could look no more the scene be too much for he have he continue to look he would have burst uncontrollably into tear it matter not that the corpse of a common rascally valet lay under that pall it matter not that a grotesque error be be enact it matter not whether the actuate spring of the immense affair be the dean 's water-colouring niece or the solemn deliberation of the chapter it matter not that newspaper have ignobly misuse the name and honor of art for they own advancement -- the instant effect be overwhelmingly impressive all that have be honest and sincere in the heart of england for a thousand year leap mystically up and make it impossible that the effect should be other than overwhelmingly impressive it be a effect beyond argument and reason it be the magic flowering of century in a single moment the silent awful sigh of a nation 's saecular soul it take majesty and loveliness from the wall around it and render they again tenfold it leave nothing common neither the motive nor the littleness of man in priam 's mind it give dignity to lady sophium entwistle and profound tragedy to the death of leek it transform even the gesture of the choir-leader into grave command and all that be for he he have brush pigment on to cloth in a way of he own nothing more and the nation to which he have always deny artistic perception the nation which he have always fiercely accuse of sentimentality be thus solemnize he committal to the earth divine mystery of art the large magnificence of england smite he he have not suspect he own greatness nor england 's the music cease he chance to look up at the little glooming window perch out of reach of mankind and the thought that the window have burn there patiently and unexpectantly for hundred of year like a anchorite above the river and town somehow disturb he so that he could not continue to look at it ineffable sadness of a mere window and he eye fall -- fall on the coffin of henry leek with its white cross and the representative of england 's majesty standing beside it and there be the end of priam farll 's self-control a pang like a pang of parturition itself seize he and a issue sob nearly rip he in two it be a loud sob undisguised unashamed reverberate other sob succeed it priam farll be in torture _ a new hat _ the organist vault over he seat shock by the outrage you really must not make that noise whisper the organist priam farll shake he off the organist be apparently at a loss what to do who be it whisper one of the young man do not know he from adam say the organist with conviction and then to priam farll : who be you you have no right to be here who give you permission to come up here and the rend sob continue to issue from the full-bodied ridiculous man of fifty utterly careless of decorum it be perfectly absurd whisper the youngster who have whisper before there have be a silence in the choir here they be wait for you whisper the other young man excitedly to the organist by -- whisper the alarmed organist not stop to say by what but leap like a acrobat back to he seat he finger and boot be at work instantly and as he play he turn he head and whisper -- better fetch some one one of the young man creep quickly and creakingly down the stair fortunately the organ and chorister be now combine to overcome the sobbing and they succeed presently a powerful arm hide under a black cassock be lay on priam 's shoulder he hysterically try to free himself but he could not the cassock and the two young man thrust he downwards they all descend together partly walk and partly fall and then a door be open and priam discover himself in the unroofed air of the cloister without he hat and breathing in gasp he executioner be also breathe in gasp they glare at he in triumphant menace as though they have do something which indeed they have and as though they mean to do something more but could not quite decide what where 's you ticket of admission demand the cassock priam fumble for it and could not find it i must have lose it he say weakly what be you name anyhow priam farll say priam farll without think off he nut evidently murmur one of the young man contemptuously come on stan do not let 's miss that anthem for this cuss and off they both go then a youthful policeman appear put on he helmet as he quit the fane what be all this ask the policeman in the assure tone of one who have the force of the empire behind he he be be make a disturbance in the horgan loft say the cassock and now he say he name 's priam farll oh say the policeman ho and how do he get into the organ loft do not arsk I answer the cassock he be not get no ticket now then out of it say the policeman take zealously hold of priam i 'll thank you to leave I alone say priam rebel with all the pride of he nature against this clutch of the law oh you will will you say the policeman we 'll see about that we shall just see about that and the policeman drag priam along the cloister to the muffle music of he will swallow up death in victory they have not thus proceed very far when they meet another policeman a older policeman what be all this demand the older policeman drunk and disorderly in the abbey say the younger will you come quietly the older policeman ask priam with a touch of commiseration i be not drunk say priam fiercely he be unversed in london and unaware of the foolishness of reasoning with the watch-dog of justice will you come quietly the older policeman repeat this time without any touch of commiseration yes say priam and he go quietly experience may teach with the rapidity of lightning but where 's my hat he add after a moment instinctively stop now then say the older policeman come _ on _ he walk between they stride just as they emerge into dean 's yard he left hand nervously explore one of he pocket on a sudden encounter a piece of cardboard here 's my ticket he say i think i would lose it i have have nothing at all to drink and you would better let I go the whole affair 's a mistake the procession halted while the older policeman gaze fascinate at the official document henry leek he read decipher the name he be be a-telling every one as he be priam farll grumble the younger policeman look over the other 's shoulder i have do no such thing say priam promptly the elder carefully inspect the prisoner and two little boy arrive and form a crowd which be immediately disperse by a frown he do not look as if he would have ` ardly as much drink as ` ud wash a bus do he murmur the elder critically the younger afraid of he senior say nothing look here mr henry leek the elder proceed do you know what i should do if i be you i should go and buy myself a new hat if i be you and quick too priam hasten away and hear the senior say to the junior he be a toff that be what he be and you be a fool have you forget as you be on point duty and such be the effect of a suggestion give under certain circumstance by a man of authority that priam farll go straight along victorium street and at sowter 's famous one-price hat-shop do in fact buy himself a new hat he then hail a taximeter from the stand opposite the army and navy store and curtly give the address of the grand babylon hotel and when the cab be fairly at speed and not before he abandon himself to a fit of candid unrestrained cursing he curse largely and variously and shamelessly both in english and in french and he do not cease cursing it be a reaction which i do not care to characterize but i will not conceal that it occur the fit spend itself before he reach the hotel for most of parliament street be block for the spectacular purpose of he funeral and he driver have to seek devious way the cursing over he begin to smooth he plume in detail at the hotel out of sheer nervousness he give the cabman half-a-crown which be preposterous another cab drive up nearly at the exact instant of he arrival and as a cap to the day mr alice challice step out of it \* \* \* \* \* chapter v _ alice on hotel _ she be wear the same red rose oh she say very quickly pour out the word generously from the inexhaustible mine of she good heart i be so sorry i miss you Saturday night i can not tell you how sorry i be of course it be all my fault i ought not to have get into the lift without you i ought to

the cabman who be depart and he and mr alice challice stand under the immense glass portico of the grand babylon expose to the rake stare of two commissionaire so you _ be _ stay here she say as if lay hold of a fact which she have hitherto hesitate to touch yes he say will not you come in he take she into the rich gloom of the grand babylon dashingly fight against the demon of shyness and beat it off with great loss they sit down in a corner of the principal foyer where a few electric light draw attention to empty fauteuil and the blossom on the aubusson carpet the world be at lunch and a fine time i have get you address say she of course i write at once to selwood terrace as soon as i get home but i have the wrong number somehow and i keep wait and wait for a answer and the only

swing glass door that lead to the _ salle à manger _ of the grand babylon at each pair of door be a living statue of dignity in cloth of gold she pass these statue without a sign of fear but when she see the room itself steep in a supra-genteel calm full of gown and hat and everything that you read about in the _ lady 's pictorial _ and the pennoned mast of a barge cross the window at the other end she stop suddenly and one of the lord mayor of the grand babylon wear a mayoral chain who have start out to meet they stop also no she say i do not feel as if i could eat here i really could not but why well she say i could not fancy it somehow can not we go somewhere else certainly we can he agree with a eagerness that be more than polite she thank he with another of she comfortable sensible smile -- a smile that take all embarrassment out of the dilemma as balm will take irritation from a wound and gently she remove she hat and gown and she gesture and speech and she comfortableness from those August precinct and they descend to the grill-room which be relatively noisy and where she rose be less conspicuous than the helmet of navarre and she frock find its sister and cousin from far land i be not much for these restaurant she say over grilled kidney no he respond tentatively i be sorry i think the other night -- oh yes she break in i be very glad to go the other night to that

supply of chip potato now do not say they be cold priam laugh and she laugh also shall i tell you one thing that put I against these restaurant she go on it be the feeling you have that you do not know where the food 's _ be _ when you have get you kitchen close to you dining-room and you can keep a eye on the stuff from the moment the cart bring it well then you do know a bit where you be and you can have you dish serve hot it stand to reason she say where be the kitchen here somewhere down below he reply apologetically a cellar kitchen she exclaim why in putney they simply can not let house with cellar kitchen no no restaurant and hotel for I -- not for _ choice _ -- that be regularly still he say with a judicial air hotel be very convenient be they she say meaning prove it for instance here there be a telephone in every room you do not mean in the bedroom yes in every bedroom well she say you would not catch I have a telephone in my bedroom i should never sleep if i know

very well for gentleman that have not be use to what i call _ com_fort in a way of speaking but -- he see that if he persist nothing soon would be leave of that noble pile the grand babylon hotel save a heap of ruin and further she genuinely do cause he to feel that throughout he career he have always miss the very best thing of life through be a uncherished ingenuous easily satisfied man a new sensation for he for if any male in europe believe in he own capacity to make other make he comfortable priam farll be that male i have never be in putney he venture on a new track _ difficulty of truth-telling _ as she inform he with a ungrudging particularity about putney and she life at putney there gradually arise in he brain a vision of a kind of existence such as he have never encounter putney have clearly the advantage of a residential town in a magnificent situation it lay on the slope of a hill whose foot be wash by a glorious stream entitle the thame its breast cover with picturesque barge and ornamental rowing boat a arched bridge span this stream and you go over the bridge in milk-white omnibus to london putney have a street of handsome shop a purely business street no one sleep there now because of the noise of motor at eventide the street glitter in its own splendor there be theater music-hall assembly-room concert hall market brewery library and a afternoon tea shop exactly like regent street -lrb- not that mr challice care for they allege china tea -rrb- also church and chapel and barne common if you walk one way and wimbledon common if you walk another mr challice live in werter road werter road start conveniently at the corner of the high street where the fish-shop be -- a establishment where authentic sole be always obtainable though it be advisable not to buy it on Monday morning of course putney be a place where you live unvexed untroubled you have you little house and you furniture and you ability to look after yourself at all end and you knowledge of the price of everything and you deep knowledge of human nature and you experienced forgivingness towards human frailty you do not keep a servant because servant be so complicated and because they could do nothing whatever as well as you could do it yourself you have a charwoman when you feel idle or when you choose to put the house into the back-yard for a airing with the charwoman a pair of glove for coarser work and gas stove you ` make naught ' of domestic labor you be never worry by ambition or by envy or by the desire to know precisely what the wealthy do and to do likewise you read when you be not more amusingly occupy prefer illustrated papers and magazine you do not traffic with art to any appreciable extent and you never dream of let it keep you awake at night you be rich for the reason that you spend less than you receive you never speculate about the ultimate cause of thing or puzzle yourself concern the possible development of society in the next hundred year when you see a poor old creature in the street you buy a box of match off the poor old creature the social phenomenon which chiefly rouse you to just anger be the spectacle of wealthy people make money and so take the bread out of the mouth of people who need it the only apparent blot on existence at putney be the noise and danger of the high street the dearth of reliable laundry the manners of a middle-aged lady engage at the post office -lrb- mr challice like the other lady in the post office -rrb- and the absence of a suitable man in the house existence at putney seem to priam farll to approach the utopian it seem to breathe of romance -- the romance of common sense and kindliness and simplicity it make he own existence to that day appear a futile and unhappy strive after the impossible art what be it what do it lead to he be sick of art and sick of all the form of activity to which he have hitherto be accustom and which he have mistake for life itself one little home fix and stable render foolish the whole concourse of european hotel i suppose you will not be stay here long demand mr challice oh no he say i shall decide something shall you take another place she inquire another place yes she smile be excessively persuasive and invite i do not know he say diffidently you must have put a good bit by she say still with the same smile or perhaps you have not save 's a matter of chance that be what i always do say it just depend how you begin it be a habit i would never really blame anybody for not save and man -- she seem to wish to indicate that man be specially to be excuse if they do not save she have a large mind : that be sure she understand -- thing and human nature in particular she be not one of those creature that a man meet with sometimes -- creature who be for ever on the watch to pounce and who be incapable of make allowance for any male frailty -- smooth smile creature with thin lip hair a little scanty at the front and a quietly omniscient ` do not - tell - _ I _ ' tone mr alice challice have a mouth as wide as she idea and a full underlip she be a woman who as it be run out to meet you when you start to cross the dangerous roadway which separate the two sex she comprehend because she want to comprehend and when she could not comprehend she would deceive herself that she do : which amount to the equivalent she be a living proof that in she sex social distinction do not effectively count nothing count where she be concern except a distinction far more profound than any social distinction -- the historic distinction between adam and eve she be balm to priam farll she might have be equally balm to king david uriah the hittite socrate rousseau lord byron heine or charlie peace she would have understand they all they would all have be ready to cushion themselves on she comfortableness be she a lady pish she be a woman she temperament draw priam farll like a electrify magnet to wander about freely in that roomy sympathy of hers seem to he to be the supreme reward of experience it seem like the good inn after the bleak high-road the oasis after the sandstorm shade after glare the dress after the wound sleep after insomnia surcease from unspeakable torture he want in a word to tell she everything because she would not demand any difficult explanation she have give he a opening in she mention of savings in reply to she suggestion you must have put a good bit by he could casually answer : yes a hundred and forty thousand pound and that would lead by natural stage to a complete reveal of the fix in which he be in five minute he would have confide to she the principal detail and she would have understand and then he could describe he agonizing and humiliating half-hour in the abbey and she would pour she magic oil on that dreadful abrasion of he sensitiveness and he would be heal of he hurt and they would settle between they what he ought to do he regard she as he refuge as fate 's generous compensation to he for the loss of henry leek -lrb- whose remain now rest in the national valhallum -rrb- only it would be necessary to begin the explanation so that one thing might by natural stage lead to another on reflection it appear rather abrupt to say : yes a hundred and forty thousand pound the sum be too absurdly high -lrb- though correct -rrb- the mischief be that unless the sum do strike she as absurdly high it could not possibly lead by a natural stage to the remainder of the explanation he must contrive another path for instance -- there be be a mistake about the so-called death of priam farll a mistake she would exclaim all ear and eye then he would say -- yes priam farll be not really dead it be he valet that be dead whereupon she would burst out -- but _ you _ be he valet whereupon he would simply shake he head and she would steam forwards -- then who be you whereupon he would say as calmly as he could -- i be priam farll i 'll tell you precisely how it all happen thus the talk might happen thus it would happen immediately he begin but as at the dean 's door in dean 's yard so now he could not begin he could not utter the necessary word aloud speak aloud they would sound ridiculous incredible insane -- and not even mrs challice could reasonably be expect to grasp they import much less believe they _ there be be a mistake about the so-called death of priam farll _ _ yes a hundred and forty thousand pound _ no he could enunciate neither the one sentence nor the other there be some truth so bizarre that they make you feel self-conscious and guilty before you have begin to state they you state they apologetically you blush you stammer you have all the air of one who do not expect belief you look a fool you feel a fool and you bring disaster on yourself he perceive with the most painful clearness that he could never never impart to she the terrific secret the awful truth great as she be the truth be greater and she would never be able to swallow it what time be it she ask suddenly oh you must not think about time he say with hasty concern _ result of rain _ when the lunch be completely finish and the grill-room have so far empty that it be inhabit by no one except themselves and several waiter who be try to force they to depart by means of thought transference and uneasy hover round they table priam farll begin to worry he brain in order to find some sane way of spend the afternoon in she society he want to keep she but he do not know how to keep she he be quite at a loss strange that a man great enough and brilliant enough to get bury in westminster abbey have not sufficient of the small change of cleverness to retain the company of a mr alice challice yet so it be happily he be buoy up by the thought that she understand i must be move off home she say put she glove on slowly and sigh let I see he stammer i think you say werter road putney yes no 29 perhaps you 'll let I call on you he venture oh do she encourage he nothing could have be more correct and nothing more banal than this part of they conversation he certainly would call he would travel down to the idyllic putney to-morrow he could not lose such a friend such a balm such a soft cushion such a comprehend intelligence he would bit by bit become intimate with she and perhaps ultimately he might arrive at the stage of be able to tell she who he be with some chance of be believe anyhow when he do call -- and he insist to himself that it should be extremely soon -- he would try another plan with she he would carefully decide beforehand just what to say and how to say it this decision reconcile he somewhat to a temporary parting from she so he pay the bill under she sagacious protest eye and he manage to conceal from those eye the precise amount of the tip and then at the cloak-room he furtively give sixpence to a fat and wealthy man who have be watch over he hat and stick -lrb- highly curious how those common-sense orb of hers make all such operation seem excessively silly -rrb- and at last they wander in silence through the corridor and antechamber that lead to the courtyard entrance and through the glass portal priam farll have a momentary glimpse of the reflection of light on a cabman 's wet macintosh it be rain it be rain very heavily indeed all be dry under the glass-roofed colonnade of the courtyard but the rain rattle like kettledrum on that glass and the center of the courtyard be a pond in which a few hansom be splash about everything -- the horse ' coat the cabman 's hat and cape and the cabman 's red face shine and stream in the torrential summer rain it be say that geography make history in england and especially in london weather make a good deal of history impossible to brave that rain except under the severest pressure of necessity they be in shelter and in shelter they must remain he be glad absurdly and splendidly glad it can not last long she say look up at the black sky which show a edge towards the east suppose we go in again and have some tea he say now they have barely conclude coffee but she do not seem to mind well she say it be always tea-time for _ I _ he see a clock it be nearly four he say thus justified of the clock in they go and sit down in the same seat which they have occupy at the commencement of the adventure in the main lounge priam discover a bell-push and command china tea and muffin he feel that he now as it be have a opportunity of make a fresh start in life he grow almost gay he could be gay without sin against decorum for mr challice 's singular tact have avoid all reference to death and funeral and in the pause while he be prepare to be gay attractive and in fact he true self she calmly stir china tea shoot a bolt which make he see star it seem to I she observe that we might go farther and fare worse -- both of we he genuinely do not catch the significance of it in the first instant and she see that he do not oh she proceed benevolently and reassuringly i mean it i be not gallivant about i mean that if you want my opinion i fancy we could make a match of it it be at this point that he see star he also see a faint and delicious blush on she face whose complexion be extraordinarily fresh and tender she sip china tea hold each finger wide apart from the other he have forget the origin of they acquaintance forget that each of they be suppose to have a definite aim in view forget that it be with a purpose that they have exchange photograph it have not occur to he that marriage hang over he like a sword he perceive the sword now heavy and sharp and suspend by a thread of appalling fragility he dodge he do not want to lose she never to see she again but he dodge i could not think -- he begin and stop of course it be a very awkward situation for a man she go on toy with muffin i can quite understand how you feel and with most folk you would be right there be very few woman that can judge character and if you start to try and settle something at once they would just set you down as a wrong ` un but i be not like that i do not expect any fiddle-faddle what i like be plain sense and plain deal we both want to get marry so it would be silly to pretend we do not would not it and it would be ridiculous of I to look for court and a proposal and all that sort of thing just as if i would never see a man in he shirt-sleeve the only question be : shall we suit each other i have tell you what i think what do you think she smile honestly kindly but piercingly what could he say what would you have say you be a man it be easy sit there in you chair with no mr alice challice in front of you to invent diplomatic reply but conceive yourself in priam 's place besides he do think she would suit he and most positively he could not bear the prospect of see she pass out of he life he have be through that experience once when he hat blow off in the tube and he do not wish to repeat it of course you have get no _ home _ she say reflectively with such compassion suppose you come down and just have a little peep at mine so that evening a suitably paired couple chance into the fishmonger 's at the corner of werter road and buy a bit of sole at the newspaper shop next door but one placard say : impressive scene at westminster abbey farll funeral stately pageant great painter lay to rest etc \* \* \* \* \* chapter vi _ a putney morning _ except that there be marry and give in marriage it be just as though he have die and go to heaven heaven be the absence of worry and of ambition heaven be where you want nothing you have not get heaven be finality and this be finality on the September morning after the honeymoon and the settle down he arise leisurely long after he wife and put on the puce dressing-gown -lrb- which alice much admire -rrb- he open the window wider and survey that part of the universe which be comprise in werter road and the sky above a sturdy old woman be come down the street with a great basket of assorted flower he take a immense pleasure in the sight of the old woman the sight of the old woman thrill he why well there be no reason except that she be vigorously alive a part of the magnificent earth all life give he joy all life be beautiful to he he have he warm bath the bath-room be not of the latest convenience but alice could have make a four-wheeler convenient as he pass to and fro on the first-floor he hear the calm efficient activity below stair she be busy in the morning she eye would seem to say to he now between my uprising and lunch-time please do not depend on I for intellectual or moral support i be on the spot but i be also at the wheel and must not be disturbed then he descend fresh as a boy although the promontory which prevent a direct vision of he toe show accretion the front-room be a shrine for he breakfast she serve it herself in her-white apron promptly on he arrival egg toast coffee it be nothing that breakfast and yet it be everything no breakfast could have be better he have probably eat about fifteen thousand hotel breakfast before alice teach he what a real breakfast be after serve it she linger for a moment and then hand he the _ daily telegraph _ which have be lie on a chair here be you _ telegraph _ she say cheerfully tacitly disown any property or interest in the _ telegraph _ for she newspaper be man 's toy she never open a paper never want to know what be go on in the world she be always intent upon she own affair politics -- and all that business of the mere machinery of living : she perfectly ignore it she live she do nothing but live she live every hour priam feel truly that he have at last get down to the bed-rock of life there be twenty page of the _ telegraph _ far more matter than a man could read in a day even if he read and read and neither eat nor sleep and all of it so soothing in its rich variety it gently lull you it be the ideal companion for a poached egg upstanding against the coffee-pot it stand for the solidity of england in the sea priam fold it large he read all the article down to the fold then turn the thing over and finish all of they after commune with the _ telegraph _ he commune with he own secret nature and wander about roll a cigarette ah the first cigarette he wanderings lead he to the kitchen or at least as far as the threshold thereof he wife be at work there upon every handle or article that might soil she put soft brown paper and in addition she often wear house-glove so that she hand remain immaculate thus during the earlier hour of the day the house especially in the region of fireplace have the air of be in curl-papers i be go out now alice he say after he have draw on he finely polished boot very well love she reply preoccupy with she work lunch as usual she never demand luxuriousness from he she have get he she be sure of he that satisfied she sometimes like a simple woman who have come into a set of pearl she would as it be take he out of he drawer and look at he and put he back at the gate he hesitate whether to turn to the left towards high street or to the right towards oxford road he choose the right but he would have enjoy himself equally have he choose the leave the street through which he pass be populate by domestic servant and tradesman 's boy he see white-capped girl clean door-knob or window or run along the street like escape nun or stare in soft meditation from bedroom window and the tradesman 's boy be continually leap in and out of cart or off and on tricycle busily distribute food and drink as though putney have be a beleaguered city it be extremely interesting and mysterious -- and what make it the most mysterious be that the oligarchy of superior person for whom these boy and girl so assiduously work remain invisible he pass a newspaper shop and find he customary delight in the placard this morning the _ daily illustrated _ announce nothing but : portrait of a boy aged 12 who weigh 20 stone and the _ record _ whisper in scarlet : what the german say to the king special the _ journal _ cry : surrey 's glorious finish and the _ courier _ shout : the unwritten law in the united state another scandal not for gold would he have go behind these placard to the organ themselves he prefer to gather from the placard alone what wonder of yesterday the excellent staid _ telegraph _ have unaccountably miss but in the _ financial time _ he see : cohoon 's annual meeting stormy scene and he buy the _ financial time _ and put it into he pocket for he wife because she have a interest in cohoon 's brewery and he conceive the possibility of she caring to glance at the report _ the simple joy of life _ after cross the south-western railway he get into the upper richmond road a thoroughfare which always divert and amuse he it be such a street of contrast any one could see that not many year before it have be a sacred street tread only by foot genteel and make up of house each christen with its own name and each standing in its own garden and now energetic person have put church into it vast red thing with gigantic bell and large drapery shop with blouse at six-and-eleven and court photographer and bank and cigar-store and auctioneer ' office and all kind of omnibus run along it and yet somehow it remain meditative and superior in every available space gigantic poster be exhibit they all have to do with food or pleasure there be york ham eight foot high that a regiment could not have eat in a month shaggy and ferocious ox peep out of monstrous teacup in they anxiety to be consume spout bottle of ale whose froth alone would have float the mail steamer picture on a adjoining sheet and forty different decoction for impart strength then after a few score yard of invitation to debauch there come with characteristic admirable english common sense a cure for indigestion so large that it would have give ease to a mastodon who have by inadvertence swallow a elephant and then there be the call to pleasure astonishing the quantity of palace that offer you exactly the same entertainment twice over on the same night astonishing the reliance on number in this matter of amusement authenticate statement that a certain performer have do a certain thing in a certain way a thousand and one time without interruption be stick all over the upper richmond road apparently in the sure hope that you would rush to see the thousand and second performance these performance be invariably style original and novel all the remainder of free wall space be occupy by philanthropist who be ready to give away cigarette at the nominal price of a penny a packet priam farll never tire of the phantasmagoria of upper richmond road the interminable intermittent vision of food dead and alive and of performer perform the same performance from everlasting to everlasting and of million and million of cigarette ascend from the mouth of handsome young man in incense to heaven -- this rare vision of which in all he wanderings he have never see the like have the singular effect of lull he soul into a profound content not once do he arrive at the end of the vision no when he reach barne station he could see the vision still stretch on and on but fill to the brim he would get into a omnibus and return the omnibus awake he to other issue : the omnibus be a antidote in the omnibus cleanliness be nigh to godliness on one pane a soap be extol and on another the exordium for this be a true say and worthy of all acceptation be follow by the statement of a religious dogma while on another pane be a urgent appeal not to do in the omnibus what you would not do in a drawing-room yes priam farll have see the world but he have never see a city so incredibly strange so packed with curious and rare psychological interest as london and he regret that he have not discover london earlier in he life-long search after romance at the corner of the high street he leave the omnibus and stop a moment to chat with he tobacconist he tobacconist be a stout man in a white apron who stand for ever behind a counter and sell tobacco to the most respected resident of putney all he idea be connect either with tobacco or with putney a murder in the strand to that tobacconist be less than the breakdown of a motor bus opposite putney station and a change of government less than a change of program at the putney empire a rather pessimistic tobacconist not incline to believe in a first cause until one day a drunken man smash salmon and gluckstein 's window down the high street whereupon he opinion of providence go up for several day priam enjoy talk to he though the tobacconist be utterly impervious to idea and never give out idea this morning the tobacconist be at he door at the other corner be the sturdy old woman whom priam have observe from he window she sell flower fine old woman that say priam heartily after he and the tobacconist have agree upon the fact that it be a glorious morning she use to be at the opposite corner by the station until last may but one when the police shift she say the tobacconist why do the police shift she asked priam i do not know as i can tell you say the tobacconist but i remember she this twelve year i only notice she this morning say priam i see she from my bedroom window come down the werter road i say to myself ` she be the finest old woman i ever see in my life ' do you now murmur the tobacconist she be rare and dirty i like she to be dirty say priam stoutly she ought to be dirty she would not be the same if she be clean i do not hold with dirt say the tobacconist calmly she would be better if she have a bath of a Saturday night like other folk well say priam i want a ounce of the usual thank _ you _ sir say the tobacconist put down three-halfpence change out of sixpence as priam thank he for the packet nothing whatever in such a dialogue yet priam leave the shop with a distinct feeling that life be good and he plunge into high street lose himself in crowd of perambulator and nice womanly woman who be bustling honestly about in search of food or raiment many of they carry little red book full of long list of thing which they and they admirer and the offspring of mutual affection have eat or would shortly eat in the high street all be luxury : not a necessary in the street even the baker ' shop be a mass of sultana and berlin pancake illuminate calendar gramophone corset picture postcard manilla cigar bridge-scorer chocolate exotic fruit and commodious mansion -- these seem to be the principal object offer for sale in high street priam buy a sixpenny edition of herbert spencer 's _ essay _ for four-pence-halfpenny and pass on to putney bridge whose noble arch divide a first storey of van and omnibus from a ground-floor of barge and race eight and he gaze at the broad river and its hanging garden and dream and be waken by the roar of a electric train shooting across the stream on a red causeway a few yard below he and mile off he could descry the twin tower of the crystal palace more marvellous than mosque astounding he murmur joyously he have not a care in the world and putney be all that alice have paint it in due time when bell have peal to right and to left of he he go home to she _ collapse of the putney system _ now just at the end of lunch over the last stage of which they usually sit a long time alice get up quickly in the midst of she stilton and go to the mantelpiece take a letter therefrom i wish you would look at that henry she say hand he the letter it come this morning but of course i can not be bother with that sort of thing in the morning so i put it aside he accept the letter and unfold it with the professional all-knowing air which even the biggest male fool will quite successfully put on in the presence of a woman if consult about business when he have unfold the thing -- it be type on stiff expensive quarto paper -- he read it in the life of being like priam farll and alice a letter such as that letter be a terrible event unique earth-arresting simple recipient be apt on receive it to imagine that the christian era have come to a end but ten of thousand of similar letter be send out from the city every day and the city think nothing of they the letter be about cohoon 's brewery company limit and it be sign by a firm of solicitor it refer to the verbatim report which it say would be find in the financial papers of the annual meeting of the company hold at the cannon street hotel on the previous day and to the exceedingly unsatisfactory nature of the chairman 's statement it regret the absence of mr alice challice -lrb- she change of condition have not yet reach the heart of cohoon 's -rrb- from the meeting and ask she whether she would be prepare to support the action of a committee which have be form to eject the exist board and which have already a following of 385000 vote it finish by assert that unless the committee be immediately lift to absolute power the company would be quite ruin priam re-read the letter aloud what do it all mean asked alice quietly well say he that be what it mean do it mean -- she begin by jove he exclaim i forget i see something on a placard this morning about cohoon 's and i think it might interest you so i buy it so say he draw from he pocket the _ financial time _ which he have entirely forget there it be : a column and a quarter of the chairman 's speech and nearly two column of stormy scene the chairman be the marquis of drumgaldy but he rank have apparently not shield he from the violence of expletive such as liar humbug and even rogue the marquis have merely state with every formulum of apology that owe to the extraordinary depreciation in licensed property the director have not feel justified in declare any dividend at all on the ordinary share of the company he have make this quite simple assertion and instantly a body of shareholder less reasonable and more avaricious even than shareholder usually be have begin to turn the historic hall of the cannon street hotel into a bear garden one might have imagine that the sole aim of brewery company be to make money and that the patriotism of old-world brewer that patriotism which impel they to supply a honest english beer to the honest english working-man at a purely nominal price be scorn and forget one be indeed force to imagine this in vain the marquis point out that the shareholder have receive a fifteen per cent dividend for year and year past and that really for once in a way they ought to be prepare to sacrifice a temporary advantage for the sake of future prosperity the thought of those regular high dividend give rise to no gratitude in shareholding heart it seem merely to render they the more furious the baser passion have be let loose in the cannon street hotel the director have possibly be expect the baser passion for a posse of policeman be handy at the door and one shareholder to save he from have the blood of marquis on he soul be eject ultimately accord to the picturesque phrase of the _ financial time _ report the meeting break up in confusion how much have you get in cohoon 's priam ask alice after they have look through the report together all i have be in cohoon 's say she except this house father leave

to a paragraph and he read in a low voice the fluctuation of cohoon 's ordinary share during the afternoon they have finish at # 6 5 mr henry leek have lose over # 1000 in about half-a-day they have always bring I in # 150 a year she insist as though she have be say : it be always be christmas day on the 25th of December and of course it will be the same this year it do not look as if they would bring you in anything this time say he oh but henry she protest beer have fail that be the truth of it beer have fail who would have guess that beer could fail in england the wisest the most prudent man in lombard street have put they trust in beer as the last grand bulwark of the nation and even beer have fail the foundation of england 's greatness be if not go go insufficient to argue bad management indiscreet purchase of licence at inflated price in the excellent old day a brewery would stand a indefinite amount of bad management time be change the british workman catch in a wave of temperance could no longer be rely upon to drink it be the crown of he sin against society trade union be nothing to this latest caprice of he which spread desolation in a thousand genteel home alice wonder what she father would have say have he live on the whole she be glad that he do not happen to be alive the shock to he would have be too rude the floor seem to be give way under alice melting into a sort of bog that would swallow up she and she husband for year without any precise information but merely by instinct she have feel that england beneath the surface be not quite the island it have be -- and here be the awful proof she gaze at she husband as a wife ought to gaze at she husband in a crisis he thought be much vaguer than hers he thought about money be always extremely vague suppose you go up to the city and see mr what be - his-name she suggest mean the signatory of the letter _ I _ it be a cry of the soul aghast a cry draw out of he sharply by a most genuine cruel alarm he to go up to the city to interview a solicitor why the poor dear woman must be demented he could not have do it for a million pound the thought of it make he sick raise the whole of he lunch to he throat as by some sinister magic she see and translate the look on he face it be a look of horror and at once she make excuse for he to herself at once she say to herself that it be no use pretend that she henry be like other man he be not he be a dreamer he be at time amazingly peculiar but he be she henry in any other man than she henry a hesitation to take charge of he wife 's financial affair would have be ridiculous it would have be effeminate but henry be henry she be gradually learn that truth he be adorable but he be henry with magnificent strength of mind she collect herself no she say cheerfully as they be my share perhaps i would better go unless we _ both _ go she encounter he eye again and add quietly : no i 'll go alone he sigh he relief he could not help sigh he relief and after meticulously washing-up and straighten she depart and priam remain solitary with he idea about married life and the fiscal question alice be assuredly the very mirror of discretion never since that unanswered query as to savings at the grand babylon have she subject he to any inquisition concern money never have she talk of she own means save in casual phrase now and then to assure he that there be enough she have indeed refuse banknote diffidently offer to she by he tell he to keep they by he till need of they arise never have she discourse of she own past life nor lead he on to discourse of he she be one of those woman for whom neither the past nor the future seem to exist -- they be always so occupy with the important present he and she have both of they rely on they judgment of character as regard each other 's worthiness and trustworthiness and he be the last man in the world to be a chancellor of the exchequer to he money be a quite uninteresting token that have to pass through you hand he have always have enough of it he have always have too much of it even at putney he have have too much of it the better part of henry leek 's two hundred pound remain in he pocket and under he own will he have he pound a week of which he never spend more than a few shilling he distraction be tobacco -lrb- which cost he about twopence a day -rrb- walk about and enjoy color effect and the oddity of the street -lrb- which cost he nearly nought -rrb- and reading : there be three shop of putney where all that be greatest in literature could be buy for fourpence-halfpenny a volume do what he could he could not read away more than ninepence a week he be positively accumulate money you may say that he ought to have compel alice to accept money the idea never occur to he in he scheme of thing money have not be a matter of sufficient urgency to necessitate a argument with one 's wife she be always welcome to all that he have and now suddenly money acquire urgency in he eye it be most disturbing he be not frighten : he be merely disturb if he have ever know the sensation of want money and not be able to obtain it he would probably have be frightened but this sensation be unfamiliar to he not once in he whole career have he hesitate to change gold from fear that the end of gold be at hand all kind of problem crowd round he he go out for a stroll to escape the problem but they accompany he he walk through exactly the same street as have delight he in the morning and they have cease to delight he this surely could not be ideal putney that he be in it must be some other place of the same name the mismanagement of a brewery a hundred and fifty mile from london the failure of the british working-man to drink he customary pint in several scattered score of public-house have most unaccountably knock the bottom out of the putney system of practical philosophy putney poster be now merely disgusting putney trade gross and futile the tobacconist a narrow-minded and stupid bourgeois and so on alice and he meet on they doorstep each in the act of pull out a latchkey oh she say when they be inside it be do for there be no mistake -- it be do for we sha not get a penny this year not one penny and he do not think there 'll be anything next year either and the share 'll go down yet he say i never hear of such a thing in all my life do you he admit sympathetically that he have not after she have be upstairs and come down again she mood suddenly change well she smile whether we get anything or not it be tea-time so we 'll have tea i have no patience with worrying i say i should make pastry after tea and i will too see if i do not the tea be perhaps slightly more elaborate than usual after tea he hear she singing in the kitchen and he be move to go and look at she there she be with she sleeve turn back and a large pinafore apron over she rich bosom knead flour he would have like to approach she and kiss she but he never could accomplish feat of that kind at unusual moment oh she laugh you can look _ i be _ not worry i have no patience with worry later in the afternoon he go out rather like a person who have reason for leave inconspicuously he have make a great a critical resolve he pass furtively down werter road into the high street and then stand a moment outside stawley 's stationery shop which be also a library a emporium of leather-bag and a artist ' - colourman 's he enter stawley 's blush tremble -- he a man of fifty who could not see he own toe -- and ask for certain tube of color a energetic young lady who seem to know all about the graphic art endeavor to sell to he a magnificent and complicated box of paint which open out into a easel and a stool and contain a palette of a shape prefer by the late edwin long ra a selection of color which have be approve by the late lord leighton pra and a patent drying-oil which -lrb- she say -rrb- have be use by whistler priam farll get away from the shop without this apparatus for the confection of masterpiece but he do not get away without a sketching-box which he have have no intention of buy the young lady be too energetic for he he be afraid of be too curt with she lest she should turn on he and tell he that pretence be useless -- she know he be priam farll he feel guilty and he feel that he look guilty as he hurry along the high street towards the river with the paint-box it appear to he that policeman observe he inimically and cock they helmet at he as who should say : see here this will not do you be suppose to be in westminster abbey you 'll be lock up if you be too brazen the tide be out he sneak down to the gravelly shore a little above the steamer pier and hide himself between the pile glance around he in a scared fashion he might have be about to commit a crime then he open the sketch-box and oil the palette and try the elasticity of the brush on he hand and he make a sketch of the scene before he he do it very quickly -- in less than half-an-hour he have make thousand of such color ` note ' in he life and he would never part with any of they he have always hate to part with he note doubtless he cousin duncan have they now if duncan have discover he address in pari as duncan probably have when it be finish he inspect the sketch half shut he eye and hold it about three foot off it be good except for a few pencil scrawl do in sheer absent-mindedness and hastily destroy this be the first sketch he have make since the death of henry leek but it be very good no mistake who be do that he murmur and add : that be the devil of it any expert would twig it in a minute there be only one man that could have do it i shall have to do something worse than that he shut up the box and with a bang as a amative couple come into sight he need not have do so for the couple vanish instantly in deep disgust at be rob of they retreat between the pile alice be near the completion of pastry when he return in the dusk he smell the delicious proof creep quietly upstairs he deposit he brush in a empty attic at the top of the house then he wash he hand with especial care to remove all odour of paint and at dinner he endeavor to put on the mien of innocence she be cheerful but it be the cheerfulness of determine effort they naturally talk of the situation it appear that she have a reserve of money in the bank -- as much as would suffice she for quite six month he tell she with false buoyancy that there need never be the slightest difficulty as to money he have money and he could always earn more if you think i be go to let you go into another situation she say you be mistake that be all and she lip be firm this stagger he he never could remember for more than half-an-hour at a time that he be a retire valet and it be decidedly not she practice to remind he of the fact the notion of himself in a situation as valet be half ridiculous and half tragical he could no more be a valet than he could be a stockbroker or a wire-walker i be not think of that he stammer then what be you thinking of she ask oh i do not know he say vaguely because those thing they advertise -- homework envelope address or sell gramophone on commission -- they be no good you know he shudder the next morning he buy a 36 x 24 canvas and more brush and tube and surreptitiously introduce they into the attic happily it be the charwoman 's day and alice be busy enough to ignore he with a old table and the tray out of a travelling-trunk he arrange a substitute for a easel and begin to try to paint a bad picture from he sketch but in a quarter of a hour he discover that he be exactly as fitted to paint a bad picture as to be a valet he could not sentimentalize the tone nor falsify the value he simply could not the attempt to do so annoyed he all man be capable of stoop beneath they highest self and in several direction priam farll could have stoop but not on canvas he could only produce he best he could only render nature as he see nature and it be instinct rather than conscience that prevent he from stoop in three day during which he keep alice out of the attic partly by lie and partly by lock the door the picture be finish and he have forget all about everything except he profession he have become a different man a very excited man by jove he exclaim survey the picture i can paint artist do occasionally soliloquize in this way the picture be dazzling what atmosphere what poetry and what profound fidelity to nature 's fact it be precisely such a picture as he be in the habit of sell for # 800 or a # 1000 before he burial in westminster abbey indeed the trouble be that it have ` priam farll ' write all over it just as the sketch have \* \* \* \* \* chapter vii _ the confession _ that evening he be very excited and he seem to take no thought to disguise he excitement the fact be he could not have disguise it even if he have try the fever of artistic creation be upon he -- all the old desire and the old exhausting joy he genius have be lie idle like a lion in a thicket and now it have spring forth raven for month he have not handle a brush for month he mind have deliberately avoid the question of painting be content with the observation only of beauty a week ago if he have deliberately ask himself whether he would ever paint again he might have answer perhaps not such be man 's ignorance of he own nature and now the lion of he genius be stand over he its paw on he breast and make a great noise he see that the last few month have be merely a interlude that he would be force to paint -- or go mad and that nothing else matter he see also that he could only paint in one way -- priam farll 's way if it be discover that priam farll be not bury in westminster abbey if there be a scandal and legal unpleasantness -- well so much the worse but he must paint not for money mind you incidentally of course he would earn money but he have already quite forget that life have its financial aspect so in the sitting-room in werter road he walk uneasily to and fro squeeze between the table and the sideboard and then skirt the fireplace where alice sit with a darning apparatus upon she knee and she spectacles on -- she wear spectacles when she have to look fixedly at very dark object the room be ugly in a pleasant putneyish way with a couple of engraving after bw leader ra a too realistic wall-paper hot brown furniture with ribbed leg a carpet with the characteristic of a retired governess who have take to drink and a black cloud on the ceiling over the incandescent burner happily these surroundings do not annoy he they do not annoy he because he never see they when he eye be not rest on beautiful thing they be not in this world of reality at all he sole idea about house-furnishing be a easy-chair harry say he wife do not you think you would better sit down the calm voice of common sense stop he in he circular tour he glance at alice and she remove she spectacles glance at he the seal on he watch-chain dangle free he have to talk to some one and he wife be there -- not only the most convenient but the most proper person to talk to a tremendous impulse seize he to tell she everything she would understand she always do understand and she never allow herself to be startle the most singular occurrence immediately they touch she be somehow transform into credible daily customary event thus the disaster of the brewery she have accept it as though the ruin of brewery be a spectacle to be witness at every street-corner yes he should tell she three minute ago he have no intention of tell she or any one anything he decide in a instant to tell she he secret would lead up naturally to the picture which he have just finish i say alice he say i want to talk to you well she say i wish you would talk to I sit down i do not know what be come over you this last day or two he sit down he do not feel really intimate with she at that moment and they marriage seem to he in a way artificial scarcely a fact he do not know that it take year to accomplish full intimacy between husband and wife you know he say henry leek be not my real name oh be not it she say what do that matter she be not in the least surprised to hear that henry leek be not he real name she be a wise woman and know the strangeness of the world and she have marry he simply because he be himself because he exist in a particular manner -lrb- whose charm for she she could not have describe -rrb- from hour to hour so long as you have not commit a murder or anything she add with she tranquil smile my real name be priam farll he say gruffly the gruffness be cause by timidity i think priam farll be you gentleman 's name to tell you the truth he say nervously there be a mistake that photograph that be send to you be my photograph yes she say i know it be and what of it i mean he blunder on it be my valet that die -- not I you see the doctor when he come think that leek be I and i do not tell he differently because i be afraid of all the bother i just let it slide -- and there be other reason you know how i be i do not know what you be talk about she say can not you understand it be simple enough i be priam farll and i have a valet name henry leek and he die and they think it be I only it be not he see she face change and then compose itself then it be this henry leek that be bury in westminster abbey instead of you she voice be very soft and soothing and the astonishing woman resume she spectacles and she long needle yes of course here he burst into the whole story into the middle of it continue to the end and then go back to the commencement he leave out nothing and nobody except lady sophium entwistle i see she observe and you have never say a word not a word if i be you i should still keep perfectly silent about it she almost whisper persuasively it 'll be just as well if i be you i should not worry myself i can quite understand how it happen and i be glad you have tell I but do not worry you have be exciting yourself these last two or three day i think it be about my money business but i see it be not at least that may have bring it on like now the best thing you can do be to forget it she do not believe he she simply discredit the whole story and tell in werter road like that the story do sound fantastic it do come very near to pass belief she have always notice a certain queerness in she husband he sudden gaiety about a tint in the sky or the gesture of a horse in the street for example be most uncanny and he have peculiar absence of mind that she could never account for she be sure that he must have be a very bad valet however she do not marry he for a valet but for a husband and she be satisfy with she bargain what if he do suffer under a delusion the exposure of that delusion merely crystallize into a definite shape she vague suspicion concern he mentality besides it be a harmless delusion and it explain thing it explain among other thing why he have go to stay at the grand babylon hotel that must have be the inception of the delusion she be glad to know the worst she adore he more than ever there be a silence no she repeat in the most matter-of-fact tone i should say nothing in you place i should forget it you would he drum on the table i should and whatever you do do not worry she accent be the coax accent of a nurse with a child -- or with a lunatic he perceive now with the utmost clearness that she do not believe a word of what he have say and that in she magnificent and calm sagacity she be only try to humor he he have expect to disturb she soul to its profoundest depths he have expect that they would sit up half the night discuss the situation and lo -- i should forget it indulgently and a mild continuance of darning he have to think and think hard _ tear _ henry she call out the next morning as he disappear up the stair what _ be _ you do up there she have behave exactly as if nothing have happen and she be one of those woman whose prudent policy it be to let they man alone even to the furthest limit of patience but she have nerve too and they be be affect for three day henry have really be too mysterious he stop and put he head over the banister and in a queer move voice answer : come and see sooner or later she must see sooner or later the already distended situation must get more and more distended until it burst with a loud report let the moment be sooner he swiftly decide so she go and see half-way up the attic stair she begin to sniff and as he turn the knob of the attic door for she she say what a smell of paint i fancy yesterday -- if she have be clever enough she would have say what a smell of masterpiece but she cleverness lay in other field you surely have not be aspinall that bath-room chair oh this loud exclamation escape from she as she enter the attic and see the back of the picture which priam have lodge on the say bath-room chair -- filch by he from the bath-room on the previous day she step to the vicinity of the window and obtain a good view of the picture it be brilliantly shine in the light of morn it look glorious it be a fit companion of many picture from the same hand distribute among european gallery it have that priceless quality at once noble and radiant which distinguish all priam 's work it transform the attic and thousand of amateur and student from st petersburg to san francisco would have go into that attic with they hat off and a thrill in the spine have they know what be there and have they be invite to enter and worship priam himself be pleased he be delighted he be enthusiastic and he stand near the picture glancing at it and then glance at alice nervously like a mother whose sister-in-law have come to look at the baby as for alice she say nothing she have first of all to take in the fact that she husband have be ungenerous enough to keep she quite in the dark as to the nature of he secret activity then she have to take in the fact of the picture do you do that she say limply yes say he with all the casualness that he could assume how do it strike you and to himself : this 'll make she see i be not a mere lunatic this 'll give she a shake up i be sure it be beautiful she say kindly but without the slightest conviction what be it be that putney bridge yes he say i think it be i think it must be well i never know you could paint it be beautiful -- for a amateur she say this firmly and yet endearingly and meet he eye with she eye it be she tactful method of politely cause he to see that she have not accept last night 's yarn very seriously he eye fall not hers no no no he expostulate with quick vivacity as she step towards the canvas do not come any nearer you be at just the right distance oh if you do not _ want _ I to see it close she humor he what a pity you have not put a omnibus on the bridge there be one say he _ that be _ one he point oh yes yes i see but you know i think it look rather more like a carter paterson van than a omnibus if you could paint some letter on it -- ` union jack ' or ` vanguard ' then people would be sure but it be beautiful i suppose you learn to to paint from you -- she check herself what be that red streak behind that be the railway bridge he mutter oh of course it be how silly of I now if you be to put a train on that the worst of train in picture be that they never seem to be go along i have notice that on the side of furniture van have not you but if you put a signal against it then people would understand that the train have stop i be not sure whether there _ be _ a signal on the bridge though he make no remark and i see that be the elk public-house there on the right you have just manage to get it in i can recognize that quite easily any one would he still make no remark what be you go to do with it she ask gently go to sell it my dear he reply grimly it may surprise you to know that that canvas be worth at the very least # 800 there would be a devil of a row and rumpus in bond street and elsewhere if they know i be painting here instead of rot in westminster abbey i do not propose to sign it -- i seldom do sign my picture -- and we shall see what we shall see i have get fifteen hundred for little thing not so good as that i 'll let it go for what it 'll fetch we shall soon be want money the tear rise to alice 's eye she see that he be more infinitely more mad than she imagine -- with he # 800 and he # 1500 for daub of picture that convey no meaning whatever to the eye why you could purchase real professional picture of lake and mountain exquisitely finish at the frame-maker in high street for three pound apiece and here he be ramble in hundred and thousand she see that that extraordinary notion about be able to paint be a natural consequence of the pathetic delusion to which he have give utterance yesterday and she wonder what would follow next who could have guess that the seed of lunacy be in such a man yes harmless lunacy but lunacy nevertheless she distinctly remember the little shock with which she have learn that he be stay at the grand babylon on he own account as a wealthy visitor she think it bizarre but she certainly have not take it for a sign of lunacy and yet it have be a sign of madness and the worst of harmless lunacy be that it might develop at any moment into harmful lunacy there be one thing to do and only one : keep he quiet shield he from all trouble and alarm it be disturbance of spirit which induce these mental derangement he master 's death have upset he and now he have be upset by she disgraceful brewery company she make a step towards he and then hesitate she have to form a plan of campaign all in a moment she have to keep she wit and to use they how could she give he confidence about he absurd picture she notice that naïve look that sometimes come into he eye a boyish expression that give the he to he greying beard and he generous proportion he laugh until as she come closer he see the tear on she eyelid then he cease laugh she finger the edge of he coat cajolingly it be a beautiful picture she repeat again and again and if you like i will see if i can sell it for you but henry -- well please please do not bother about money we shall have _ heap _ there be no occasion for you to bother and i will not _ have _ you bother what be you cry for he ask in a murmur it be only -- only because i think it be so nice of you try to earn money like that she lie i be not really cry and she run away downstairs really cry it be excessively comic but he have better not follow she lest he might cry too _ a patron of the art _ a lull follow this crisis in the affair of no 29 werter road priam go on painting and there be now no need for secrecy about it but he painting be not make a subject of conversation both of they hesitate to touch it she from tact and he because she view on the art seem to he to be lack in subtlety in every marriage there be a topic -- there be usually several -- which the husband will never broach to the wife out of respect for he respect for she priam scarcely guess that alice imagine he to be on the way to lunacy he think she merely think he queer as artist _ be _ queer to non-artist and he be accustom to that henry leek have always think he queer as for alice 's incredulous attitude towards the revelation of he identity he do not mentally accuse she of treat he as either a liar or a madman on reflection he persuade himself that she regard the story as a bad joke as one of he impulsive capricious essay in the absurd thus the march of evolution be apparently arrest in werter road during three whole day and then a singular event happen and progress be resume priam have be out since early morning on the riverside sketch and have reach barne from which town he return over barne common and so by the upper richmond road to high street he be on the south side of upper richmond road whereas he tobacconist 's shop be on the north side near the corner a unfamiliar peculiarity of the shop cause he to cross the street for he be not in want of tobacco it be the look of the window that draw he he stop on the refuge in the center of the street there be no necessity to go further he picture of putney bridge be in the middle of the window he stare at it fixedly he believe he eye for he eye be the finest part of he and never deceive he but perhaps if he have be a person with ordinary eye he would scarce have be able to believe they the canvas be indubitably there present in the window it have be put in a cheap frame such as be use for chromographic advertisement of ship soup and tobacco he be almost sure that he have see that same frame within the shop round a pictorial announcement of taddy 's snuff the tobacconist have probably remove the eighteenth-century aristocrat with he finger to he nose from the frame and replace he with putney bridge in any event the frame be about half-an-inch too long for the canvas but the gap be scarcely observable on the frame be a large notice ` for sale ' and around it be the cigar of two hemisphere from syak whiff at a penny each to precious muria and cigarette of every allurement and the multitudinous fragment of all advertise tobacco and meerschaum and briar and patent pipe and diagram of they secret machinery and cigarette-and cigar-holder lay on plush and pocket receptacle in aluminium and other precious metal shine there the picture have a most incongruous appearance he blush as he stand on the refuge it seem to he that the mere incongruity of the spectacle must inevitably attract crowd gradually block the street and that when some individual not absolutely a fool in art have perceive the quality of the picture -- well then the trouble of public curiosity and of journalistic inquisitiveness would begin he wonder that he could ever have dream of conceal he identity on a canvas the thing simply shout ` priam farll ' every inch of it in any exhibition of picture in london paris rome milan munich new york or boston it would have be the cynosure the target of ecstatic admiration it be just such another work as he celebrated ` pont d'austerlitz ' which hang in the luxembourg and neither a frame of ` chemical gold ' nor the extremely variegated coloration of the other merchandise on sale could kill it however there be no sign of a crowd people pass to and fro just as though there have not be a masterpiece within ten thousand mile of they once a servant girl a loaf of bread in she red arm stop to glance at the window but in a instant she be go run priam 's first instinctive movement have be to plunge into the shop and demand from he tobacconist a explanation of the phenomenon but of course he check himself of course he know that the presence of he picture in the window could only be due to the enterprise of alice he go slowly home the sound of he latchkey in the keyhole bring she into the hall ere he have open the door oh henry she say -- she be quite excite -- i must tell you i be pass mr aylmer 's this morning just as he be dress he window and the thought strike I that he might put you picture in so i run in and ask he he say he would if he could have it at once so i come and get it he find a frame and write out a ticket and ask after you no one could have be kinder you must go and have a look at it i should not be at all surprised if it get sell like that priam answer nothing for a moment he could not what do aylmer say about it he ask oh say he wife quickly you can not expect mr aylmer to understand these thing it be not in he line but he be glad to oblige we i see he arrange it nicely well say priam discreetly that be all right suppose we have lunch curious -- she relation with mr aylmer it be she who have recommend he to go to mr aylmer 's when on the first morning of he residence in putney he have demand any decent tobacconist in this happy region he suspect that have it not be for aylmer 's beridden and incurable wife alice 's name might have be aylmer he suspect aylmer of a hopeless passion for alice he be glad that alice have not be throw away on aylmer he could not imagine himself now without alice in spite of she idea on the graphic art alice be he air he atmosphere he oxygen and also he umbrella to shield he from the hail of untoward circumstance curious -- the process of love it be the power of love that have put that picture in the tobacconist 's window whatever power have put it there no power seem strong enough to get it out again it lay expose in the window for week and never draw a crowd nor cause a sensation of any kind not a word in the newspaper london the acknowledged art-centre of the world calmly go its way the sole immediate result be that priam change he tobacconist and the direction of he promenade at last another singular event happen alice beamingly put five sovereign into priam 's hand one evening it be be sell for five guinea she say joyous mr aylmer do not want to keep anything for himself but i insist on he have the odd shilling i think it be splendid simply splendid of course i always _ do _ think it be a beautiful picture she add the fact be that this astounding sale for so large a sum as five pound of a picture do in the attic by she henry have enlarged she idea of henry 's skill she could no longer regard he painting as the caprice of a gentle lunatic there be something _ in _ it and now she want to persuade herself that she have know from the first there be something in it the picture have be buy by the eccentric and notorious landlord of the elk hotel down by the river on a Sunday afternoon when he be -- not drunk but more optimistic than the state of english society warrant he like the picture because he public-house be so unmistakably plain in it he order a massive gold frame for it and hang it in he saloon-bar he career as a patron of the art be unfortunately cut short by a order sign by he doctor for he incarceration in a lunatic asylum all putney have be say for year that he would end in the asylum and all putney be right \* \* \* \* \* chapter viii _ a invasion _ one afternoon in December priam and alice be in the sitting-room together and alice be about to prepare tea the drawn-thread cloth be lay diagonally on the table -lrb- because alice have see cloth so lay on model tea-table in model room at waring 's -rrb- the strawberry jam occupy the northern point of the compass and the marmalade be antarctic while brittle cake and spongy cake represent the occident and the orient respectively bread-and-butter stand rightly for the center of the universe silver ornament the spread and alice 's two tea-pot -lrb- for she would never allow even chinese tea to remain on the leaf for more than five minute -rrb- and alice 's water-jug with the patent balanced lid occupy a tray off the cloth at some distance but still on the table a kettle moan over a spirit-lamp alice be cut bread for toast the fire be of the right redness for toast and a toasting-fork lay handy as winter advance alice 's tea have a tendency to become cosier and cosier and also more luxurious more of a ritualistic ceremony and to avoid the trouble and danger of go through a cold passage to the kitchen she arrange matter so that the entire operation could be perform with comfort and decency in the sitting-room itself priam be roll cigarette many of they and place they as he roll they in order on the mantelpiece a happy mild couple and a couple one would judge from the richness of the tea with no immediate need of money over two year however have pass since the catastrophe to cohoon 's and cohoon 's have in no way recover therefrom yet money have be regularly find for the household the manner of its finding be soon to assume importance in the career of priam and alice but ere that moment a astonishing and vivid experience happen to they one might have suppose that in the life of priam farll at least enough of the astonishing and the vivid have already happen nevertheless what have already happen be as customary and unexciting as address envelope compare to the next event the next event begin at the instant when alice be stick the long fork into a round of bread there be a knock at the front door a knock formidable and reverberate the knock of fate perhaps but fate disguise as a coalheaver alice answer it she always answer knock priam never she shield he from every rough or unexpected contact just as he valet use to do the gas in the hall be not light and so she stop to light it darkness have fall then she open the door and saw in the gloom a short thin woman standing on the step a woman of advanced middle-age dress with a kind of shabby neatness it seem impossible that so frail and unimportant a creature could have make such a noise on the door be this mr henry leek 's ask the visitor in a dissatisfied rather weary tone yes say alice which be not quite true ` this ' be assuredly hers rather than she husband 's oh say the woman glance behind she and enter nervously without invitation at the same moment three male figure spring or rush out of the strip of front garden and follow the woman into the hall lunge up against alice and breathing loudly one of the trio be a strong heavy-faced heavy-handed louring man of some thirty year -lrb- it seem probable that he be the knocker -rrb- and the other be curate with the proper physical attribute of curate that be to say they be of ascetic habit and clean-shaven and have ingenuous eye the hall now appear like the antechamber of a may-meeting and as alice have never see it so people before she vent a natural exclamation of surprise yes say one of the curate fiercely you may say ` lord ' but we be determine to get in and in we have get john shut the door mother do not put yourself about john be the heavy-faced and heavy-handed man shut the door where be mr henry leek demand the other curate now priam whose curiosity have be excusably excite by the unusual sound in the hall be peep through a chink of the sitting-room door and the elderly woman catch the glint of he eye she push open the door and after a few seconds ' inspection of he say : there you be henry after thirty year to think of it priam be utterly at a loss i be he wife ma'am the visitor continue sadly to alice i be sorry to have to tell you i be he wife i be the rightful mr henry leek and these be my son come with I to see that i get justice alice recover very quickly from the shock of amazement she be a woman not easily to be startle by the vagary of human nature she have often hear of bigamy and that she husband should prove to be a bigamist do not throw she into a swoon she at once in she own mind begin to make excuse for he she say to herself as she inspect the real mr henry leek that the real mr henry leek have certainly the temperament which manufacture bigamist she understand how a person may slide into bigamy and after thirty year she never think of bigamy as a crime nor do it occur to she to run out and drown herself for shame because she be not properly marry to priam no it have to be say in favor of alice that she invariably take thing as they be i think you would better all come in and sit down quietly she say eh it be very kind of you say the mother of the curate limply the last thing that the curate want to do be to sit down quietly but they have to sit down alice make they sit side by side on the sofa the heavy elder brother who have not speak a word sit on a chair between the sideboard and the door they mother sit on a chair near the table priam fall into he easy-chair between the fireplace and the sideboard as for alice she remain stand she show no nervousness except in she handling of the toasting-fork it be a great situation but unfortunately ordinary people be so unaccustomed to the great situation that when it chance to come they feel themselves incapable of live up to it a person gaze in at the window and unacquainted with the fact might have guess that the affair be simply a tea party at which the guest have arrive a little too soon and where no one be startlingly proficient in the art of small-talk still the curate be apparently bent on do they best now mother one of they urge she the mother as if a spring have be touch in she begin : he marry I just thirty year ago ma'am and four month after my eldest be bear -- that be john there -- -lrb- point to the corner near the door -rrb- -- he just walk out of the house and leave I i be sorry to have to say it yes sorry i be but there it be and never a word have i ever give he and eight month after that my twin be bear that be harry and matthew -- -lrb- point to the sofa -rrb- -- harry i call after he father because i think he be like he and just to show i bear no ill-feeling and hope he would come back and there i be with these little child and not a word of explanation do i ever have i hear of harry five year later -- when johnnie be nearly five -- but he be on the continent and i could not go traipse about with three baby besides if i _ have _ go sorry i be to say it ma'am but many 's the time he be beat I yes with he hand and he fist he be knock I about above a bit and i never give he a word back he be my husband for better for worse and i forgive he and i still do forgive and forget that be what i say we only hear of he through matthew be second curate at st paul 's and in charge of the mission hall it be you milkman that happen to tell matthew that he have a customer same name as himself and you know how one thing lead to another so we be here i never see this lady in my life say priam excitedly and i be absolutely certain i never marry she i never marry any one except of course you alice then how do you explain this sir exclaim matthew the younger twin jump up and take a blue paper from he pocket be so good as to pass this to father he say hand the paper to alice alice inspect the document it be a certificate of the marriage of henry leek valet and sarah featherstone spinster at a registry office in paddington priam also inspect it this be one of leek 's escapade no revelation as to the past of henry leek would have surprise he there be nothing to be do except to give a truthful denial of identity and to persist in that denial useless to say soothingly to the lady visitor that she be the widow of a gentleman who have be lay to rest in westminster abbey i know nothing about it say priam doggedly i suppose you 'll not deny sir that you name be henry leek say henry jump up to stand by matthew i deny everything say priam doggedly how could he explain if he have not be able to convince alice that he be not henry leek could he hope to convince these visitor i suppose madam henry continue address alice in impressive tone as if she be a crowded congregation that at any rate you and my father be -- er -- live here together under the name of mr and mr henry leek alice merely lift she eyebrow it be all a mistake say priam impatiently then he have a brilliant inspiration as if there be only one henry leek in the world do you really recognize my husband alice ask you husband madam matthew protest shocked i would not say that i recognize he as he _ be _ say the real mr henry leek no more than he recognize I after thirty yearslast time i see he he be only twenty-two or twenty-three but he be the same sort of man and he have the same eye and look at henry 's eye besides i hear twenty-five year ago that he would go into service with a mr priam farll a painter or something he that be bury in westminster abbey and everybody in putney know that this gentleman -- gentleman murmur matthew discontented be valet to mr priam farll we have hear that everywhere i suppose you 'll not deny say henry the younger that priam farll would not be likely to have _ two _ valet name henry leek crush by this socratic reasoning priam keep silence nursing he knee and stare into the fire alice go to the sideboard where she keep she best china and take out three extra cup and saucer i think we would all better have some tea she say tranquilly and then she get the tea-caddy and put seven teaspoonful of tea into one of the tea-pot it be very kind of you i be sure whimper the authentic mr henry leek now mother do not give way the curate admonish she do not you remember henry she go on whimper to priam how you say you would not be marry in a church not for anybody and how i give way to you like i always do and do not you remember how you would not let poor little johnnie be baptize well i do hope you opinion have alter eh but it be strange it be strange how two of you son and just they two that you would never set eye on until this day should have make up they mind to go into the church and thanks to johnnie there they have be able to if i be to tell you all the struggle we have have you would not believe I they be clerk and they might have be clerk to this day if it have not be for johnnie but johnnie could always earn money it be that engineering and now matthew 's second curate at st paul 's and get fifty pound a year and henry 'll have a curacy next month at bermondsey -- it be be promise and all thanks to johnnie she weep johnnie in the corner who have so far do nought but knock at the door maintain stiffly he policy of non-interference priam farll angry resentful and quite untouched by the recital shrug he shoulder he be animated by the sole desire to fly from the widow and progeny of he late valet but he could not fly the herculean john be too close to the door so he shrug he shoulder a second time yes sir say matthew you may shrug you shoulder but you can not shrug we out of existence here we be and you can not get over we you be we father and i presume that a kind of respect be due to you yet how can you hope for we respect have you earn it do you earn it when you ill-treated we poor mother do you earn it when you leave she with the most inhuman cruelty to fend for herself in the world do you earn it when you abandon you child bear and unborn you be a bigamist sir a deceiver of woman heaven know -- would you mind just toast this bread alice interrupt he impassioned discourse by put the loaded toasting-fork into he hand while i make the tea it be a novel way of stop a mustang in full career but it succeed while somewhat perfunctorily hold the fork to the fire matthew glare about he to signify he righteous horror and other sentiment please do not burn it say alice gently suppose you be to sit down on this foot-stool and then she pour boiling water on the tea put the lid on the pot and look at the clock to note the exact second at which the process of infusion have begin of course burst out henry the twin of matthew i need not say madam that you have all we sympathy you be in a -- do you mean I alice ask in a undertone priam could be hear obstinately repeat never set eye upon she before never set eye on the woman before i do madam say henry not to be cow nor deflect from he course i speak for all of we you have we sympathy you could not know the character of the man you marry or rather with whom you go through the ceremony of marriage however we have hear by inquiry that you make he acquaintance through the medium of a matrimonial agency and indirectly when one do that sort of thing one take one 's chance you position be a extremely delicate one but it be not too much to say that you bring it on yourself in my work i have encounter many sad instance of the result of lax moral principle but i little thought to encounter the saddest of all in my own family the discovery be just as great a blow to we as it be to you we have suffer my mother have suffer and now i fear it be you turn to suffer you be not this man 's wife nothing can make you he wife you be live in the same house with he -- under circumstance -- er -- without a chaperon i hesitate to characterize you situation in plain word it would scarcely become I or mine to do so but really no lady could possibly find herself in a situation more false than -- i be afraid there be only one word open immorality and -- er -- to put yourself right with society there be one thing and only one leave for you to -- er -- do i -- i speak for the family and i -- sugar alice question the mother of curate yes please one lump or two two please speak for the family -- henry resume will you kindly pass this cup to you mother alice suggest henry be oblige to take the cup excite by the fever of eloquence he unfortunately upset it before it have reach he mother 's hand oh henry murmur the lady mournfully aghast you always be so clumsy and a clean cloth too do not mention it please say alice and then to _ she _ henry : my dear just run into the kitchen and bring I something to wipe this up hang behind the door -- you 'll see priam spring forward with astonishing celerity and the occasion brook no delay the guardian of the portal could not but let he pass in another moment the front door bang priam do not return and alice staunch the flow of tea with a clean stiff serviette take from the sideboard drawer _ a departure _ the family of the late henry leek each with a cup in hand experience a certain difficulty in maintain the interview at the pitch set by matthew and henry mr leek they mother frankly give way to soft tear while eat bread-and-butter jam and zebra-like toast john take everything that alice offer to he in gloomy and awkward silence do he mean to come back matthew demand at length he have rise from the foot-stool who ask alice matthew pause and then say savagely and deliberately : father alice smile i be afraid not i be afraid he be go out you see he be a rather peculiar man it be not the slightest use I try to drive he he can only be lead he have he good point -- i can speak candidly as he be not here and i _ will _ -- he have he good point when mr leek as i suppose she call herself speak about he cruelty to she -- well i understand that far be it from I to say a word against he he be often very good to I but -- another cup mr john john advance to the table without a word hold he cup you do not mean to say ma'am say mr leek that he -- alice nod grievously mrs leek burst into tear when johnnie be barely five week old she say he would twist my arm and he keep I without money and once he lock I up in the cellar and one morning when i be iron he snatch the hot iron out of my hand and -- do not do not alice soothe she i know i know all you can tell I i know because i have be through -- you do not mean to say he threaten _ you _ with the flat-iron if threaten be only all say alice like a martyr then he be not change in all these year weep the mother of curate if he have it be for the worse say alice how be i to tell she face the curate how could i know and yet nobody nobody could be nicer than he be at time that be true that be true respond the authentic mr henry leek he be always so changeable so queer queer alice take up the word that be it queer i do not think he be _ quite _ right in he head not quite right he have the very strangest fancy i never take any notice of they but they be there i seldom get up in the morning without think ` well perhaps to-day he 'll have to be take off ' take off yes to hanwell or wherever it be and you must remember she say gaze firmly at the curate you have get he blood in you vein do not forget that i suppose you want to make he go back to you mr leek as he certainly ought ye-e murmur mr leek feebly well if you can persuade he to go say alice if you can make he see he duty you be welcome but i be sorry for you i think i ought to tell you that this be my house and my furniture he be get nothing at all i expect he never could save many 's the blow he be lay on I in anger but all the same i pity he i pity he and i would not like to leave he in the lurch perhaps these three strong young man 'll be able to do something with he but i be not sure he be very strong and he have a way of leap out so sudden like mr leek shake she head as memory of the past rise up in she mind the fact be say matthew sternly he ought to be prosecute for bigamy that be what ought to be do most decidedly henry concur you be quite right you be quite right say alice that be only justice of course he would deny that he be the same henry leek he would deny it like anything but in the end i dare say you would be able to prove it the worst of these law case be they be so expensive it mean private detective and all sort of thing i believe of course there would be the scandal but do not mind I i be innocent everybody know I in putney and have do this twenty year i do not know how it would suit you mr henry and mr matthew as clergyman to have you own father in prison that be as may be but justice be justice and there be too many man go about deceive simple trust woman i have often hear such tale now i know they be all true it be a mercy my own poor mother have not live to see where i be to-day as for my father old as he be if he would be alive there would have be horsewhip that i do know after some rather pointless and disjointed remark from the curate a sound come from the corner near the door it be john 's cough better clear out of this john ejaculate such be he first and last oral contribution to the scene _ in the bath _ priam farll be wander about the uncharted grove of wimbledon common and utter soliloquy in language that lack delicacy he have rush forth in he haste without a overcoat and the weather be blusterously inclement but he do not feel the cold he only feel the keen wind of circumstance soon after the purchase of he picture by the lunatic landlord of a fully licensed house he have discover that the frame-maker in high street know a man who would not be indispose to buy such picture as he could paint and transaction between he and the frame-maker have develop into a regular trade the usual price pay for canvas be ten pound in cash by this mean he have earn about two hundred a year no question be put on either side the painting be deliver at interval and the money receive and priam know no more for many week he have live in daily expectation of a uproar a scandal in the art-world visit of police and other inconvenience for it be difficult to believe that the picture would never come beneath the eye of a first-class expert but nothing have occur and he have gradually subside into a sense of security he be happy happy in the untrammelled exercise of he gift happy in have all the money that he need and alice 's demand happier than he have be in the errant day of he glory and he wealth alice have be amaze at he power of earning and also she have seem little by little to lose she suspicion as to he perfect sanity and truthfulness in a word the dog of fate have sleep and he have take particular care to let it lie he be in that species of sheltered groove which be absolutely essential to the bliss of a shy and nervous artist however great he may be and now this disastrous irruption this resurrection of the early sin of the real leek he be hurt he be startle he be furious but he be not surprise the wonder be that the early sin of henry leek have not troubled he long ago what could he do he could do nothing that be the tragedy : he could do nothing he could but rely upon alice alice be amazing the more he think of it the more masterly she handling of these preposterous curate seem to he and be he to be rob of this incomparable woman by ridiculous proceedings connect with a charge of bigamy he know that bigamy mean prison in england the injustice be monstrous he see those curate and they mute brother and the aggrieved mother of the three dog he either to prison or to he deathbed and how could he explain to alice impossible to explain to alice still it be conceivable that alice would not desire explanation alice somehow never do desire a explanation she always say i can quite understand and set about prepare a meal she be the comfortablest cushion of a creature that the evolution of the universe have ever produce then the gusty breeze drop and it begin to rain he ignore the rain but December rain have a strange horrid quality of chilly persistence it be capable of conquer the most obstinate and serious mental preoccupation and it conquer priam 's it force he to admit that he tortured soul have a fleshly garment and that the fleshly garment be soak to the marrow and he soul gradually yield before the attack of the rain and he go home he put he latchkey into the door with minute precaution against noise and creep into he house like a thief and very gently shut the door then in the hall he intently listen not a sound that be to say not a sound except the dripping of he hat on the linoleum the sitting-room door be ajar he timidly push it and enter alice be darn stocking henry she exclaim why you be wet through she rise have they clear off he demand and you have be out without a overcoat henry how could you well i must get you into bed at once -- instantly or i shall have you down with pneumonia or something to-morrow have they clear off he repeat yes of course she say when be they come back he ask i do not think they 'll come back she reply i think they have have enough i think i have make they see that it be best to leave well alone do you ever see such toast as that curate make alice i assure you he say later -- he be in a boiling bath -- i assure you it be all a mistake i have never see the woman before of course you have not she say calmingly of course you have not besides even if you have it serve she right every one could see she be a nagging woman and they seem quite prosperous they be hysterical -- that be what be the matter with they all of they -- except the eldest the one that never speak i rather like he but i _ have not _ he reiterate splash he positive statement into the water my dear i know you have not but he guess that she be humor he he guess that she be determine to keep he at all cost and he have a disconcerting glimpse of the depths of utter unscrupulousness that sometimes disclose themselves in the mind of a good and loving woman only i hope there will not be any more of they she add dryly ah that be the point he conceive the possibility of the rascal leek have commit score and score of sin all of which might come up against he he affrighted vision see whole region populate by disconsolate widow of henry leek and they offspring ecclesiastical and otherwise he know what leek have be westminster abbey be a strange goal for leek to have achieve \* \* \* \* \* chapter ix _ a glossy male _ the machine be one of those electric contrivance that do they work noiselessly and efficiently like a garrotter or the guillotine no odour no teeth-disturbing grind of rack-and-pinion no trumpet with that machine it arrive before the gate with such absence of sound that alice though she be dust in the front-room do not hear it she hear nothing till the bell discreetly tinkle justifiably assume that the tinkler be the butcher 's boy she go to the door with she apron on and even with the duster in she hand a handsome smooth man stand on the step and the electric carriage make a background for he he be a dark man with curly black hair and a moustache to match and black eye he silk hat of a incredible smooth newness glitter over he glittering hair and eye he overcoat be line with astrakan and this important fact be casually betray at the lapel and at the sleeve he wear a black silk necktie with a small pearl pin in the mathematical center of the perfect rhomboid of the upper part of a sailor 's knot he glove be of slate color the chief characteristic of he faintly striped trousers be the crease which seem more than mortal he boot be of _ glacé _ kid and as smooth as he cheek the cheek have a fresh boyish color and between they over admirable snowy tooth project the hooked key to this temperament it _ be _ possible that alice from sheer thoughtlessness share the vulgar prejudice against jew but certainly she do not now feel it the man 's personal charm he exceed niceness have always conquer that prejudice whenever encounter moreover he be only about thirty-five in year and no such costly and beautiful male have ever yet stand on alice 's doorstep she at once in she mind contrast he with the curate of the previous week to the disadvantage of the established church she do not know that this man be more dangerous than a thousand curate be this mr leek 's he inquire smilingly and raise he hat yes say alice with a responsive smile be he in well say alice he be busy at he work you see in this weather he can not go out much -- not to work -- and so he -- could i see he in he studio ask the glossy man with the air of say can you grant I this supreme favor it be the first time that alice have hear the attic call a studio she pause it be about picture explain the visitor oh say alice will you come in i have run down specially to see mr leek say the visitor with emphasis alice 's opinion as to the seriousness of she husband 's gift for painting have of course change in two year a man who can make two or three hundred a year by stick color anyhow at any hazard on canvas -- by produce alleged picture that in alice 's secret view bear only a comic resemblance to anything at all -- that man have to be take seriously in he attic as a artisan it be true that alice think the payment he receive miraculously high for the quality of work do but with this agreeable jew in the hall and the _ coupé _ at the curb she suddenly perceive the probability of even greater miracle in the matter of price she see the average price of ten pound rise to fifteen or even twenty pound -- provide she husband be give no opportunity to ruin the affair by he absurd retire shyness will you come this way she suggest briskly and all that elegance follow she up to the attic door : which door she throw open remark simply -- henry here be a gentleman come to see you about picture _ a connoisseur _ priam recover more quickly than might have be expect he first thought be naturally that woman be uncalculated if not incalculable creature and that the best of they will do impossible thing -- thing inconceivable till actually do fancy she introduce a stranger without a word of warn direct into he attic however when he rise he see the visitor 's nose -lrb- whose nostril be delicately expand and contract in the fume of the oil-stove -rrb- and he be at once reassure he know that he would have to face neither rudeness nor bluntness nor lack of imagination nor lack of quick sympathy besides the visitor with practical assurance set the tone of the interview instantly good-morning _ maître _ he begin right off i must apologize for break in upon you but i have come to see if you have any work to sell my name be oxford and i be act for a collector he say this with a very agreeable mingling of sincerity deference and mercantile directness also with a bright admire smile he show no astonishment at the interior of the attic _ maître _ well of course it would be idle to pretend that the greatest artist do not enjoy be address as _ maître _ ` master ' be the same word but entirely different it be a long time since priam farll have be call _ maître _ indeed owe to he retire habit he have very seldom be call _ maître _ at all a just-finished picture stand on a easel near the window it represent one of the most wonderful scene in london : putney high street at night two omnibus horse step strongly and willingly out of a dark side street and under the cold glare of the main road they somehow take on the quality of equestrian sculpture the altercation of light be in the highest degree complex priam understand immediately from the man 's calm glance at the picture and the position which he instinctively take up to see it that he be accustom to look at picture the visitor do not start back nor rush forward nor dissolve into hysteric nor behave as though confront by the ghost of a murder victim he just gaze at the picture keep he nerve and hold he tongue and yet it be not a easy picture to look at it be a picture of a advanced experimentalism and would have appeal to nothing but the sense of humor in a person not a connoisseur sell exclaim priam like all shy man he could hide he shyness in a exaggerated familiarity what price this and he point to the picture there be no other preliminary it be excessively distinguish murmured mr oxford in the accent of expert appreciation excessively distinguish may i ask how much that be what i be ask you say priam fiddle with a paint rag hum observe mr oxford and gaze in silence then : two hundred and fifty priam have virtually promise to deliver that picture to the picture-framer on the next day and he have not expect to receive a penny more than twelve pound for it but artist be strange organism he shake he head although two hundred and fifty pound be as much as he have earn in the previous twelve month he shake he gray head no say mr oxford kindly and respectfully put he hand behind he back by the way he turn with eagerness to priam i presume you have see the portrait of ariosto by titian that they have buy for the national gallery what be you opinion of it _ maître _ he stand expectant glowing with interest except that it be not ariosto and it certainly be not by titian it be a pretty high-class sort of thing say priam mr oxford smile with appreciative content nod he head i hope you would say so he remark and swiftly he pass on to segantinus then to jw morrice and then to bonnard demand the _ maître 's _ view in a few moment they be really discuss picture and it be year since priam have listen to the voice of inform common sense on the subject of painting it be year since he have hear anything but exceed puerility concern picture he have in fact accustomed himself not to listen he have excavate a passage direct from one ear to the other for such remark and now he drink up the conversation of mr oxford and perceive that he have long be thirsty and he speak he mind he grow warmer more enthusiastic more impassioned and mr oxford listen with ecstasy mr oxford have apparently a natural discretion he simply accept priam as he stand for a great painter no reference to the enigma why a great painter should be painting in a attic in werter road putney no inconvenient query about the great painter 's previous history and production just the frank full acceptance of he genius it be odd but it be comfortable so you will not take two hundred and fifty ask mr oxford hop back to business no say priam sturdily the truth be he add i should rather like to keep that picture for myself will you take five hundred _ maître _ yes i suppose i will and priam sigh a genuine sigh for he would really have like to keep the picture he know he have never paint a better and may i carry it away with I ask mr oxford i expect so say priam i wonder if i might venture to ask you to come back to town with I mr oxford go on in gentle deference i have one or two picture i should very much like you to see and i fancy they might give you pleasure and we could talk over future business if possibly you could spare a hour or so if i might request -- a desire rise in priam 's breast and fight against he timidity the tone in which mr oxford have say i fancy they might give you pleasure appear to indicate something very much out of the common and priam could scarcely recollect when last he eye have rest on a picture that be at once unfamiliar and great _ parfitt ' gallery _ i have already indicate that the machine be somewhat out of the ordinary it be as a fact exceedingly out of the ordinary it be much larger than electric carriage usually be it have what the writer of ` motor note ' in papers write by the wealthy for the wealthy love to call a ` limousine body ' and outside and in it be miraculously new and spotless on the ivory handle of its door on its soft yellow leather upholstery on its cedar woodwork on its patent blind apparatus on its silver fitting on its lamp on its footstool on its silken arm-sling -- not the minutest trace of usage mr oxford 's car seem to show that mr oxford never use a car twice purchase a new car every morning like stockbroker they silk hat or the duke of selsea he trousers there be a table in the ` body ' for write and pocket up and down devise to hold document also two arm-chair and a suspend contrivance which show the hour the temperature and the fluctuation of the barometer there be also a speaking-tube one feel that if the machine have be connect by wireless telegraphy with the stock exchange the lead studio and the house of parliament and if a little restaurant have be construct in the rear mr oxford might never have be under the necessity of leave the car that he might have pass all he day in it from morn to latest eve the perfection of the machine and of mr oxford 's attire and complexion cause priam to look rather shabby indeed he be rather shabby shabbiness have slightly overtake he in putney once he have be a dandy but that be in the lament leek 's time and as the car glide without smell and without noise through the encumber avenue of london towards the center now shoot forward like a star now stop with gentle suddenness now swerve in a swift curve round a vehicle earthy and leaden-wheeled priam grow more and more uncomfortable he have sink into a groove at putney he never leave putney save occasionally to refresh himself at the national gallery and thither he invariably go by train and tube because the tube always fill he with wonder and romance and always throw he up out of the earth at the corner of trafalgar square with such a strange exhilaration in he soul so that he have not see the main avenue of london for a long time he have be forget riches and luxury and the oriental cigarette-shop whose proprietor ' name end in ` opoulo ' and the haughtiness of the ruling class and the still sterner haughtiness of they footman he have now abandon alice in putney and a mysterious demon seize he and grip he and seek to pull he back in the direction of the simplicity of putney and struggle with he fiercely and make he writhe and shrink before the brilliant phenomenon of london 's center and indeed almost pitch he out of the car and set he run as hard as leg would carry to putney it be the demon which we call habit he would have give a picture to be in putney instead of swim past hyde park corner to the accompaniment of mr oxford 's amiable and deferential and tactful conversation however he other demon shyness keep he from imperiously stop the car the car stop itself in bond street in front of a building with a wide archway and the symbol of empire float largely over its roof placard say that admission through the archway be a shilling but mr oxford bear priam 's latest picture as though it have cost fifty thousand instead of five hundred pound go straight into the place without pay and priam accept he impressive invitation to follow aged military veteran whose breast carry a row of medal salute mr oxford as he enter and within the penetralium being in silk hat as faultless as mr oxford 's raise those hat to mr oxford who do not raise he in reply merely nod napoleonically he demeanor have greatly change you see here the man of unbending will accustom to use man as pawn in the chess of a complicated career presently they reach a private office where mr oxford with the assistance of a page remove he glove fur and hat and send sharply for a man who at once bring a frame which fit priam 's picture do have a cigar mr oxford urge priam with a quick return to he earlier manner offer a box in which each cigar be separately encase in gold-leaf the cigar be such as cost a crown in a restaurant half-a-crown in a shop and twopence in amsterdam it be a princely cigar with the odour of paradise and a ash as white as snow but priam could not appreciate it no he have see on a beaten copper plate under the archway these word : ` parfitt ' gallery ' he be in the celebrated gallery of he former dealer whom by the way he have never see and he be afraid he be mortally apprehensive and have a sickly sensation in the stomach after they have scrupulously inspect the picture through the cloud of incense mr oxford write out a cheque for five hundred pound and cigar in mouth hand it to priam who try to take it with a casual air and do not succeed it be sign ` parfitt '' i dare say you have hear that i be now the sole proprietor of this place say mr oxford through he cigar really say priam feeling just as nervous as a inexperienced youth then mr oxford lead priam over thick carpet to a saloon where electric light be throw by means of reflector on to a small but incomparable band of picture mr oxford have not exaggerate they do give pleasure to priam they be not the picture one see every day nor once a year there be the finest delacroix of its size that priam have ever meet with also a vermeer that make it unnecessary to visit the ryk museum and on the more distant wall to which mr oxford come last in a place of marked honor be a evening landscape of volterra a hill-town in italy the bolt of priam 's very soul start when he catch sight of that picture on the lower edge of the rich frame be two word in black lettering : ` priam farll ' how well he remember painting it and how masterfully beautiful it be now that say mr oxford be in my humble opinion one of the finest farll in existence what do you think mr leek priam pause i agree with you say he farll say mr oxford be about the only modern painter that can stand the company that that picture have in this room eh priam blush yes he say there be a considerable difference in various matter between putney and volterra but the picture of volterra and the picture of putney high street be obviously strikingly incontestably by the same hand one could not but perceive the same brush-work the same mass the same manner of see and of grasp in a word the same dazzling and austere translation of nature the resemblance jump at one and shake one by the shoulder it could not have escape even a auctioneer yet mr oxford do not refer to it he seem quite blind to it all he say be as they leave the room and priam finish he rather monosyllabic praise -- yes that be the little collection i have just get together and i be very proud to have show it to you now i want you to come and lunch with I at my club please do i should be desolate if you refuse priam do not care a halfpenny about the desolation of mr oxford and he most sincerely object to lunch at mr oxford 's club but he say yes because it be the easiest thing for he shyness to do mr oxford be a determine man priam be afraid to go he be disturbed alarmed affright by the mystery of mr oxford 's silence they arrive at the club in the car _ the club _ priam have never be in a club before the statement may astonish may even meet with incredulity but it be true he have leave the land of club early in life as for the english club in european town he be familiar with they exterior and with the amiable babble of they supporter at _ table d'hôte _ and he desire for further knowledge have not be so hot as to inconvenience he hence he know nothing of club mr oxford 's club alarm and intimidate he it be so big and so black externally it resemble a town-hall of some great industrial town as you stand on the pavement at the bottom of the flight of giant step that lead to the first pair of swing door you head be certainly lower than the foot of a be who examine you sternly from the other side of the glass you head be also far below the sill of the mighty window of the ground-floor there be two storey above the ground-floor and above they a project eave of carven stone that threaten the uplifted eye like a menace the tenth part of a slate the merest chip of a corner fall from the lofty summit of that pile would have slay elephant and all the façade be black black with age of carbonic deposit the notion that the building be a town-hall that have get itself misplace and pervert gradually leave you as you gaze you perceive its falseness you perceive that mr oxford 's club be a monument a relic of the day when there be giant on earth that it have come down unimpaired to a race of pigmy who be make the best of it the sole descendant of the giant be the scout behind the door as mr oxford and priam climb towards it this unique giant with a giant 's force pull open the gigantic door and mr oxford and priam walk imperceptibly in and the door swing to with a large displacement of air priam find himself in a immense interior under a distant carve ceiling far far upward like heaven he watch mr oxford write he name in a gigantic folio under a gigantic clock this accomplished mr oxford lead he past enormous vista to right and leave into a very long chamber both of whose long wall be stud with thousand upon thousand of massive hook -- and here and there upon a hook a silk hat or a overcoat mr oxford choose a couple of hook in the expanse and when they have divest themselves sufficiently he lead priam forwards into another great chamber evidently mean to recall the bath of carcallum in gigantic basin chisel out of solid granite priam scrub he finger-nail with a nail-brush larger than he have previously encounter even in nightmare and a attendant brush he coat with a utensil that resemble a weapon of offence lately the property of anak shall we go straight to the dining-room now ask mr oxford or will you have a gin and angostura first priam decline the gin and angostura and they go up a overwhelming staircase of sombre marble and through other apartment to the dining-room which would have make a excellent riding-school here one have six of the gigantic window in a row each with curtain that fall in huge fold from the unseen into the see the ceiling probably exist on every wall be gigantic painting in thick ornate frame and between the window stand heroic bust of marble set upon column of basalt the chair would have be immovable have they not run on castor of weight-resisting rock yet against the table they have the air of negligible toy at one end of the room be a sideboard that would not have groan under a ox whole and at the other a fire over which a ox might have be roasted in its entirety leap under a mantelpiece upon which goliath could not have put he elbow all be silent and grave the floor be everywhere cover with heavy carpet which hush all echo there be not the faintest sound sound indeed seem to be deprecate priam have already pass the wide entrance to one illimitable room whose wall be clothe with warning in gigantic letter : ` silence ' and he have notice that all chair and couch be thickly pad and upholster in soft leather and that it be impossible to produce in they the slightest creak at a casual glance the place seem unoccupied but on more careful inspection you see midget creep about or seat in easy-chair that have obviously be make to hold two of they these midget be the member of the club dwarf into doll by its tremendous dimension a strange and sinister race they look as though in the final stage of decay and wherever they head might rest be stretch a white cloth so that they head might not touch the spot sanctify by the head of the mighty depart they rarely speak to one another but exchange regard of mutual distrust and scorn and if by chance they do converse it be in tone of weary brusque disillusion they could at best descry each other but indistinctly in the universal pervading gloom -- a gloom upon which electric lamp shine dimly yellow in they vast lustre produce almost no impression the whole establishment be bury in the past dream of its titantic yore when there be doubtless giant who could fill those fauteuil and stick they foot on those mantelpiece it be in such a environment that mr oxford give priam to eat and to drink off little ordinary plate and out of tiny tumbler no hint of the club 's immemorial history in that excessively modern and excellent repast -- save in the stilton cheese which seem to have descend from the fine fruity day of some homeric age a cheese that ulyss might have inaugurate i need hardly say that the total effect on priam 's temperament be disastrous -lrb- yet how could the diplomatic mr oxford have guess that priam have never be in a club before -rrb- it induce in he a speechless anguish and he would have pay a sum as gigantic as the club -- he would have pay the very cheque in he pocket -- never to have meet mr oxford he be a far too sensitive man for a club and he mood be incalculable assuredly mr oxford have miscalculate the result of he club on priam 's humor he soon see he error suppose we take coffee in the smoking-room he say the populous smoking-room be the one part of the club where talk with a natural loudness be not a crime mr oxford find a corner fairly free from midget and they establish themselves in it and liqueur and cigar accompany the coffee you could actually see midget laugh outright in the mist of smoke the chatter narrowly escape be a din and at interval a diminutive boy enter and bawl the name of a midget at the top of he voice priam be suddenly electrify and mr oxford very alert notice the electrification mr oxford drink he coffee somewhat quickly and then he lean forward a little over the table and put he moon-like face nearer to priam 's and arrange he leg in a truly comfortable position beneath the table and expel a large quantity of smoke from he cigar it be clearly the preliminary to a scene of confidence the approach to the crisis to which he have for several hour be lead up priam 's heart tremble what be you opinion _ maître _ he ask of the ultimate value of farll 's picture priam be in misery mr oxford 's manner be deferential amiable and expectant but priam do not know what to say he only know what he would do if he could have find the courage to do it : run away recklessly unceremoniously out of that club i -- i do not know say priam visibly whitening because i have buy a goodish few farll in my time mr oxford continue and i must say i have sell they well i have only get that one leave that i show you this morning and i have be wonder whether i should stick to it and wait for a possible further rise or sell it at once how much can you sell it for priam mumble i do not mind tell you say mr oxford that i fancy i could sell it for a couple of thousand it be rather small but it be one of the finest in existence i should sell it say priam scarcely audible you would well perhaps you be right it be a question in my mind whether some other painter may not turn up one of these day who would do that sort of thing even better than farll do it i could imagine the possibility of a really clever man come along and imitate farll so well that only people like yourself _ maître _ and perhaps I could tell the difference it be just the kind of work that might be brilliantly imitate if the imitator be clever enough do not you think but what do you mean asked priam perspire in he back well say mr oxford vaguely one never know the style might be imitate and the market flood with canvas practically as good as farll 's nobody might find it out for quite a long time and then there might be confusion in the public mind follow by a sharp fall in price and the beauty of it be that the public would not really be any the worse because a imitation that no one can distinguish from the original be naturally as good as the original you take I there be certainly a tremendous chance for a man who could seize it and that be why i be inclined to accept you advice and sell my one remain farll he smile more and more confidentially he gaze be charge with a secret meaning he seem to be suggest unspeakable matter to priam that bright face wear a expression which such face wear on such occasion -- a expression cheerfully insinuate that after all there be no right and no wrong -- or at least that many thing which the ordinary slave of convention would consider to be wrong be really right so priam read the expression the dirty rascal want I to manufacture imitation of myself for he priam think full of sudden hidden anger he be know all along that there be no difference between what i sell he and the picture he be already have he want to suggest that we should come to term he be simply be play a game with I up to now and he say aloud i do not know that i _ advise _ you to do anything i be not a dealer mr oxford he say it in a hostile tone that ought to have silence mr oxford for ever but it do not mr oxford curve away like a skater into a new figure and begin to expatiate minutely upon the merit of the volterra picture he analyze it in so much detail and laud it with as much justice as though the picture be there before they priam be astonish at the man 's exactitude scoundrel he know a thing or two reflect priam grimly you do not think i overpraise it do you _ cher maître _ mr oxford finish still smile a little say priam if only priam could have run away but he could not mr oxford have he well in a corner no chance of freedom besides he be over fifty and stout ah now i be expect you to say that do you mind tell I at what period you paint it mr oxford inquire very blandly though he hand be clasp in a violent tension that force the blood from the region of the knuckle-joint this be the crisis which mr oxford have be lead up to all the time mr oxford 's teethy smile have conceal a knowledge of priam 's identity \* \* \* \* \* chapter x _ the secret _ what do you mean asked priam farll but he put the question weakly and he might just as well have say i know what you mean and i would pay a million pound or so in order to sink through the floor a few minute ago he would only have pay five hundred pound or so in order to run simply away now he want maskelyne miracle to happen to he the universe seem to be cave in about the ear of priam farll mr oxford be still smile smile however as a man hold he breath for a wager you feel that he could not keep it up much longer you _ be _ priam farll be not you say mr oxford in a very low voice what make you think i be priam farll i think you be priam farll because you paint that picture i buy from you this morning and i be sure that no one but priam farll could have paint it then you have be play a game with I all morning please do not put it like that _ cher maître _ mr oxford whisperingly plead i only wish to feel my ground i know that priam farll be suppose to have be bury in westminster abbey but for I the existence of that picture of putney high street obviously just paint be a absolute proof that he be not bury in westminster abbey and that he still live it be a amazing thing that there should have be a mistake at the funeral a utterly amazing thing which involve all sort of consequence but that be not my business of course there must be clear reason for what occur i be not interested in they -- i mean not professionally i merely argue when i see a certain picture with the paint still wet on it : ` that picture be paint by a certain painter i be a expert and i stake my reputation on it ' it be no use tell I that the painter in question die several year ago and be bury with national honor in westminster abbey i say it could not have be so i be a connoisseur and if the fact of he death and burial do not agree with the result of my connoisseurship i say they be not fact i say there be be a -- a misunderstand about -- er -- corpse now _ cher maître _ what do you think of my position mr oxford drum lightly on the table i do not know say priam which be another lie you _ be _ priam farll be not you mr oxford persist well if you will have it say priam savagely i be and now you know mr oxford let he smile go he have hold it for a incredible time he let it go and sigh a gentle and profound relief he have be skate over the thinnest ice and have reach the bank amid terrific cracking and he begin to appreciate the extent of the peril brave he have be perfectly sure of he connoisseurship but when one say one be perfectly sure especially if one say it with immense emphasis one always mean ` imperfectly sure ' so it be with mr oxford and really to argue from the mere existence of a picture that a tremendous deceit have be successfully practice upon the most formidable of nation imply rather more than rashness on the part of the arguer but i do not want it to get about say priam still in a savage whisper and i do not want to talk about it he look at the nearest midget resentfully suspect they of eavesdropping precisely say mr oxford but in a tone that lack conviction it be a matter that only concern I say priam precisely mr oxford repeat at least it _ ought _ to concern only you and i can not assure you too positively that i be the last person in the world to want to pry but -- you must kindly remember say priam interrupt that you buy that picture this morning simply _ as _ a picture on its merit you have no authority to attach my name to it and i must ask you not to do so certainly agree mr oxford i buy it as a masterpiece and i be quite content with my bargain i want no signature i have not sign my picture for twenty year say priam pardon I say mr oxford every square inch of every one be unmistakably sign you could not put a brush on a canvas without sign it it be the privilege of only the greatest painter not to put letter on the corner of they picture in order to keep other painter from take the credit for they afterwards for I all you picture be sign but there be some people who want more proof than connoisseurship can give and that be where the trouble be go to be trouble say priam with a intensification of he misery yes say mr oxford i must tell you so that you can understand the situation he become very solemn show that he have at last reach the real point some time ago a man a little dealer come to I and offer I a picture that i instantly recognize as one of yours i buy it how much do you pay for it priam growl after a pause mr oxford say i do not mind give you the figure i pay fifty pound for it do you exclaim priam perceive that some person or person have make four hundred per cent on he work by the time it have arrive at a big dealer who be the fellow oh a little dealer nobody jew of course mr oxford 's way of say ` jew ' be ineffably ironic priam know that be a jew the dealer could not be he frame-maker who be a pure-bred yorkshireman from ravensthorpe mr oxford continue i sell that picture and guarantee it to be a priam farll the devil you do yes i have sufficient confidence in my judgment who buy it whitney c witt of new york he be a old man now of course i expect you remember he _ cher maître _ mr oxford 's eye twinkle i sell it to he and of course he accept my guarantee soon afterwards i have the offer of other picture obviously by you from the same dealer and i buy they i keep on buy they i dare say i have buy forty altogether do you little dealer guess whose work they be priam demand suspiciously not he if he have do do you suppose he would have part with they for fifty pound apiece mind at first i think i be buy picture paint before you suppose death i think like the rest of the world that you be -- in the abbey then i begin to have doubt and one day when a bit of paint come off on my thumb i can tell you i be startle however i stick to my opinion and i keep on guarantee the picture as farll it never occur to you to make any inquiry yes it do say mr oxford i do my best to find out from the dealer where he get the picture from but he would not tell I well i sort of scented a mystery now i have get no professional use for mystery and i come to the conclusion that i would better just let this one alone so i do well why do not you keep on leave it alone priam ask because circumstance will not let I i sell practically all those picture to whitney c witt it be all right anyhow i think it be all right i put parfitt ' name and reputation on they be yours and then one day i hear from mr witt that on the back of the canvas of one of the picture the name of the canvas-maker and a date have be stamp with a rubber stamp and that the date be after you suppose burial and that he london solicitor have make inquiry from the artist 's - material people here and these people be prepare to prove that the canvas be make after priam farll 's funeral you see the fix priam do my reputation -- parfitt ' -- be at stake if those picture be not by you i be a swindler parfitt ' name be go for ever and there 'll be the greatest scandal that ever be witt be threaten proceedings i offer to take the whole lot back at the price he pay I without any commission but he will not he be a old man a bit of a maniac i expect and he will not he be angry he think he be be swindle and what he say be that he be go to see the thing through i have get to prove to he that the picture be yours i have get to show he what grounds i have for give my guarantee well to cut a long story short i have find you i be glad to say he sigh again look here say priam how much have witt pay you altogether for my picture after a pause mr oxford say i do not mind give you the figure he be pay I seventy-two thousand pound odd he smile as if to excuse himself when priam farll reflect that he have receive about four hundred pound for those picture -- vastly less than one per cent of what the shiny and prosperous dealer have ultimately dispose of they for the traditional fury of the artist against the dealer -- of the producer against the parasitic middleman -- spring into flame in he heart up till then he have never have any serious cause of complaint against he dealer -lrb- extremely successful artist seldom have -rrb- now he see dealer as the ordinary painter see they to be the author of all evil now he understand by what method mr oxford have achieve he splendid car clothes club and minion these thing be earn not by mr oxford but _ for _ mr oxford in dingy studio even in attic by shabby industrious painter mr oxford be nothing but a opulent thief a grinder of the face of genius mr oxford be in a word the spawn of the devil and priam silently but sincerely consign he to he proper place it be excessively unjust of priam nobody have ask priam to die nobody have ask he to give up he identity if he have latterly be receive ten instead of thousand for he picture the fault be he alone mr oxford have only buy and only sell which be he true function but mr oxford 's sin in priam 's eye be the sin of have be right it would have need less insight than mr oxford have at he disposal to see that priam farll be take the news very badly for both we sake _ cher maître _ say mr oxford persuasively i think it will be advisable for you to put I in a position to prove that my guarantee to witt be justified why for both we sake because well i shall be delighted to pay you say thirty-six thousand pound in acknowledgment of -- er -- he stop probably he have instantly perceive that he be commit a disastrous error of tact either he should have offer nothing or he should have offer the whole sum he have receive less a small commission to suggest divide equally with priam be the instinctive impulse the fatal folly of a bear dealer and mr oxford be a bear dealer i will not accept a penny say priam and i can not help you in any way i be afraid i must go now i be late as it be he cold resistless fury drive he forward and without the slightest regard for the amenity of club he leave the table mr oxford become more and more the dealer rise and follow he even direct he to the gigantic cloak-room murmur the while soft persuasion and pacification in priam 's ear there may be a action in the court say mr oxford in the grand entrance hall and you testimony would be indispensable to I i can have nothing to do with it good-day the giant at the door could scarce open the gigantic portal quickly enough for he he flee -- flee surround by nightmare vision of horrible publicity in a law-court unthinkable torture he damned mr oxford to the nethermost place and swear that he would not lift a finger to save mr oxford from penal servitude for life _ money-getting _ he stand on the curb of the monument talk to himself savagely at any rate he be safely outside the monument with its pullulating population of midget creep over its carpet and lounge insignificant on its couch he could not remember clearly what have occur since the moment of he get up from the table he could not remember see anything or anyone on he way out but he could remember the persuasive deferential voice of mr oxford follow he persistently as far as the giant 's door in recollection that club be like a abode of black magic to he it seem so hideously alive in its deadness and its doings be so absurd and mysterious silence silence command the white papers in one vast chamber and in another babel exist and then that terrible mute dining-room with the high unscalable mantelpiece that no midget could ever reach he keep utter the most dreadful judgment on the club and on mr oxford in quite audible tone oblivious of the street he be arouse by a rather scared man salute he it be mr oxford 's chauffeur wait patiently till he master should be ready to re-enter the wheel salon the chauffeur apparently think he either demented or inebriated but he sole duty be to salute and he do nothing else quite forget that this chauffeur be a fellow-creature priam immediately turn upon he heel and hurry down the street at the corner of the street be a large bank and priam acquire the reckless courage of the soldier in battle enter the bank he have never be in a london bank before at first it remind he of the club with the addition of a enormous placard give the day of the month as a mystical number -- 14 -- and other placard display solitary letter of the alphabet then he see that it be a huge menagerie in which highly train young man of assorted size and year be confine in stout cage of wire and mahogany he stamp straight to a cage with a hole in it and throw down the cheque for five hundred pound -- defiantly next desk please say a mouth over a high collar and a green tie behind the grate and a disdainful hand push the cheque back towards priam next desk repeat priam dash but furious this be the a to m desk say the mouth then priam understand the solitary letter and he rush with a new accession of fury to the adjoining cage where another disdainful hand pick up the cheque and turn it over with a air of say fishy this and it be not endorse say another mouth over another high collar and green tie the second disdainful hand push the cheque back again to priam as though it have be a beg circular oh if that be all say priam almost speechless from anger have you get such a thing as a pen he be behave in a extremely unreasonable manner he have no right to visit he spleen on a perfectly innocent bank that pay twenty-five per cent to its shareholder and a thousand a year each to its director and what trifle be leave over to its man in rage but priam be not like you or I he do not invariably act accord to reason he could not be angry with one man at once nor even with one building at once when he be angry he be inclusively and miscellaneously angry and the sun moon and star do not escape after he have endorse the cheque the disdainful hand claw it up once more and direct upon its obverse and upon its reverse a battery of suspicion then a pair of eye glance with critical distrust at so much of priam 's person as be visible then the eye move back the mouth open in a brief word and lo there be four eye and two mouth over the cheque and four for a instant on priam priam expect some one to call for a policeman in spite of himself he feel guilty -- or anyhow dubious it be the grossest insult to he to throw doubt on the cheque and to examine he in that frigid shamelessly disillusioned manner you _ be _ mr leek a mouth move yes -lrb- very slowly -rrb- how would you like this i 'll thank you to give it I in note answer priam haughtily when the disdainful hand have count twice every corner of a pile of note and have drop the note one by one with a peculiar snap sound of paper in front of priam priam crush they together and cram they without any ceremony and without gratitude to the giver into the right pocket of he trousers and he stamp out of the building with curse on he lip still he feel better he feel assuage to cultivate and nourish a grievance when you have five hundred pound in you pocket in cash be the most difficult thing in the world _ a visit to the tailor ' _ he gradually grow calmer by dint of walk -- aimless fast walking with a rapt expression of the eye that on crowded pavement clear the way for he more effectually than a shout footman and then he debouch unexpectedly on to the embankment dusk be already fall on the noble curve of the thame and the mighty panorama stretch before he in a manner mysteriously impressive which have make poet of less poetic man than priam farll grand hotel office of millionaire and of government grand hotel sward and mullioned window of the law grand hotel the terrific arch of terminus cathedral dome house of parliament and grand hotel rise darkly around he on the arc of the river against the dark violet murk of the sky huge tram swim past he like glass house and hansom shoot past the tram and automobile past the hansom and phantom barge swirl down on the full ebb thread hole in bridge as cotton thread a needle it be london and the roar of london majestic imperial super-roman and lo earlier than the earliest municipal light a unseen hand the hand of destiny print a write on the wall of vague gloom that be begin to hide the opposite bank and the writing say that shipton 's tea be the best and then the hand wipe largely out that message and write in another spot that macdonnell 's whisky be the best and so these two doctrine in they intermittent pyrotechnics continue to give the lie to each other under the deepen night quite five minute pass before priam perceive between the altercate doctrine the high scaffold-clad summit of a building which be unfamiliar to he it look serenely and immaterially beautiful in the evening twilight and as he be close to waterloo bridge he curiosity concern beauty take he over to the south bank of the thame after lose himself in the purlieus of waterloo station he at last discover the rear of the building yes it be a beautiful thing its tower climb in several color storey diminish till it expire in a winged figure on the sky and below the building be broad and massive with a frontage of pillar over great arched window two crane stick they arm out from the general mass and the whole enterprise be guard in a hedge of hoarding through the narrow doorway in the hoarding come the flare and the hissing of a well 's light priam farll glance timidly within the interior be immense in a sort of court of honor a group of muscular hairy male silhouette against a illuminate latticework of scaffolding be chip and pare at huge block of stone it be a subject for a rembrandt a fat untidy man meditatively approach the doorway he have a roll of trace papers in he hand and the end of a long thick pencil in he mouth he be the man who interpret the dream of the architect to the dreamy british artisan experience of life have make he somewhat brusque look here he say to priam what the devil do you want what the devil do i want repeat priam who have not yet altogether fall away from he mood of universal defiance i only want to know what the h-ll this building be the fat man be a little startled he take he pencil from he mouth and spit it be the new picture gallery build under the will of that there priam farll i should ha ' think you would ha ' know that priam 's lip tremble on the verge of a exclamation see that the fat man pursue point to a small board on the hoard the board say no hand want the fat man coldly scrutinize priam 's appearance from he greenish hat to he baggy creased boot priam walk away he be dumbfounded then he be furious again he perfectly see the humor of the situation but it be not the kind of humor that induce rollick laughter he be furious and employ the language of fury when it be not overhear absorb by he craft of painting as in the old continental day he have long since cease to read the newspaper and though he have not forget he bequest to the nation he have never think of it as take architectural shape he be not aware of he cousin duncan 's activity for the perpetuation of the family name the thing stagger he the probability of the strange consequence of dead action sweep against he and overwhelm he once year ago and year ago in a resentful mood he have write a few line on a piece of paper and sign they in the presence of witness then nothing -- nothing whatever -- for two decade the paper sleep and now this -- this tremendous concrete result in the heart of london it be incredible it pass the bound even of lawful magic he palace he museum the fruit of a captious hour ah but he be furious like every ageing artist of genuine accomplishment he know -- none better -- that there be no satisfaction save the satisfaction of fatigue after honest endeavor he know -- none better -- that wealth and glory and fine clothes be nought and that strive be all he have never be happier than during the last two year yet the finest soul have they reaction they rebellion against wise reason and priam 's soul be in insurrection then he want wealth and glory and fine clothes once more it seem to he that he be out of the world and that he must return to it the covert insult of mr oxford rankle and sting and the fat foreman have mistake he for a workman cadge for a job he walk rapidly to the bridge and take a cab to conduit street where dwell a firm of tailor with whose paris branch he have have dealings in he dandiacal past a odd impulse perhaps but natural a light clock-tower -- far to he left as the cab roll across the bridge -- show that a legislative providence be watch over israel _ alice on the situation _ i bet the building alone will not cost less than seventy thousand pound he say he be back again with alice in the intimacy of werter road and relate to she in part the adventure of the latter portion of the day he have reach home long after tea-time she with she natural sagacity have not wait tea for he now she have prepare a rather special tea for the adventurer and she be sit opposite to he at the little table with nothing to do but listen and refill he cup well she say mildly and without the least surprise at he figure i do not know what he could have be think of -- you priam farll i call it just silly it be not as if there be not enough picture-gallery already when what there be be so full that you can not get in -- then it will be time enough to think about fresh one i have be to the national gallery twice and upon my word i be almost the only person there and it be free too people do not _ want _ picture-gallery if they do they would go who ever see a public-house empty or peter robinson 's and you have to pay there silly i call it why could not he have leave he money to you or at any rate to the hospital or something of that no it be not silly it be scandalous it ought to be stop now priam have resolve that evening to make a serious gallant attempt to convince he wife of he own identity he be approach the critical point this speech of hers intimidate he rather complicate he difficulty but he determine to proceed bravely have you put sugar in this he ask yes she say but you have forget to stir it i 'll stir it for you a charming wifely attention it enhearten he i say alice he say as she stir you remember when first i tell you i could paint yes she say well at first you think i be daft you think my mind be wander do not you no she say i only think you would get a bee in you bonnet she smile demurely well i have not have i see the money you have make i should just say you have not she handsomely admit where we

into the most celebrated thoroughfare in london its photograph have appear in score of newspaper with a cross mark the abode of priam and alice it be beset and infested by journalist of several nationality from morn till night camera be as common in it as lamp-post and a famous descriptive reporter of the _ Sunday news _ have get lodgings at a high figure exactly opposite no 29 priam and

quarter of a hour they be safely lose in the wilderness of waterloo and the newspaper train bear they off to bournemouth for a few day ' respite _ the nation 's curiosity _ the interest of the unite kingdom in the unique case of witt _ v _ parfitt have already reach apparently the highest possible degree of intensity and there be reason for the kingdom 's passionate curiosity whitney witt the plaintiff have come over to england with he eccentricity he retinue he extreme wealth and he fail eyesight specially to fight parfitt a half-pathetic figure this white-haired man once a connoisseur who from mere habit continue to buy expensive picture when he could no longer see they whitney witt be implacably set against parfitt because he be convince that mr oxford have seek to take advantage of he blindness there he be conduct he action regardless of he blindness there he be conduct he action regardless of expense he apartment and he regal daily existence at the grand babylon alone cost a fabulous sum which may be precisely ascertain by reference to illustrated article in the papers then mr oxford the youngish jew who have acquire parfitt who be parfitt also cut a picturesque figure on the face of london he too be spend money with both hand for parfitt itself be at stake last and most disturbing be the individual loom mysteriously in the background the inexplicable man who live in werter road and whose identity would be decide by the judgment in the case of witt _ v _ parfitt if witt win he action then parfitt might retire from business mr oxford would probably go to prison for have sell goods on false pretence and the name of henry leek valet would be add to the list of adventurous scoundrel who have pretend to be they master but if witt should lose -- then what a complication and what further enigma to be solve if witt should lose the national funeral of priam farll have be a fraudulent farce a common valet lay under the hallowed stone of the abbey and europe have mourn in vain if witt should lose a gigantic and unprecedented swindle have be practice upon the nation then the question would arise why hence it be not surprising that popular interest nourish by a indefatigable and excessively enterprising press should have mount till no one would have believe that it could mount any more but the evasion from werter road on that June morning intensify the interest enormously of course owe to the draw blind it soon become known and the bloodhound of the Sunday papers be sniff along the platform of all the terminus in london priam 's departure greatly prejudice the cause of mr oxford especially when the bloodhound fail and priam persist in he invisibility if a man be a honest man why should he flee the public gaze and in the night there be but a step from the pose of this question to the inevitable inference that mr oxford 's line of defense be really too fantastic for credence certainly organ of vast circulation while repeat that as the action be _ sub judice _ they could say nothing about it have already try the action several time in they impartial column and they now try it again with the entire public as jury and in three day priam have definitely become a criminal in the public eye a criminal fly from justice useless to assert that he be simply a witness subpoena to give evidence at the trial he have transgress the unwritten law of the english constitution that a person prominent in a _ cause célèbre _ belong for the time be not to himself but to the nation at large he have no claim to privacy in surreptitiously obtain seclusion he be merely rob the public and the public 's press of they inalienable right who could deny now the reiterate statement that _ he _ be a bigamist it come to be say that he must be on he way to south america then the public read avidly article by specially retain barrister on the extradition treaty with brazil argentina ecuador chili paraguay and uruguay the curate matthew and henry preach to crowded congregation at putney and bermondsey and be report verbatim in the _ christian voice sermon supplement _ and other messenger of light and gradually the nose of england bent closer and closer to its newspaper of a morning and coffee go cold and bacon fat congeal from the isle of wight to hexham while the latest rumor be be swallow it promise to be stupendous do the case of witt _ v _ parfitt it promise to be one of those case that alone make life worth live that alone compensate for the horror of climate in england and then the day of hearing arrive and the afternoon papers which appear at nine o'clock in the morning announce that henry leek -lrb- or priam farll accord to you wish -rrb- and he wife -lrb- or he female companion and willing victim -rrb- have return to werter road and england hold its breath and even scotland pause expectant and ireland stir in its celtic dream _ mention of two mole _ the theater in which the emotional drama of witt parfitt be to be play lack the usual characteristic of a modern place of entertainment it be far too high for its width and breadth it be badly illuminate it be draughty in winter and stuffy in summer be completely deprive of ventilation have it be under the control of the county council it would have be instantly condemn as dangerous in case of fire for its gangway be always encumber and its exit of a mediaeval complexity it have no stage no footlights and all its seat be of naked wood except one this unique seat be occupy by the principal player who wear a humorous wig and a brilliant and expensive scarlet costume he be a fairly able judge but he have mistake he vocation he rare talent for make third-rate joke would have bring he a fortune in the world of musical comedy he salary be a hundred a week better comedian have earn less on the present occasion he be in the midst of a double row of fashionable hat and beneath the hat be the face of fourteen feminine relative and acquaintance these hat perform the function of ` dress ' the house the principal player endeavor to behave as though under the illusion that he be alone in he glory but he fail there be four other lead actor : mr pennington kc and mr vodrey kc engage by the plaintiff and mr cass kc and mr crepitude kc engage by the defendant these artiste be the star of they profession nominally less glittering but really far more glittering than the player in scarlet they wig be of inferior quality to he and they costume shabby but they do not mind for whereas he get a hundred a week they each get a hundred a day three junior performer receive ten guinea a day apiece : one of they hold a watch brief for the dean and chapter of the abbey who be member of a christian fraternity be pained and horrify by the defendant ' implication that they have give interment to a valet and who be determine to resist exhumation at all hazard the super in the drama whose business it be to whisper to each other and to the player consist of solicitor solicitor ' clerk and expert they combine emolument work out at the rate of a hundred and fifty pound a day twelve excellent man in the jury-box receive between they about as much as would have keep a kc alive for five minute the total expense of production thus amount to something like six or seven hundred pound a day the preliminary expense have run into several thousand the enterprise could have be make remunerative by hire for it convent garden theater and sell stall as for tettrazzinus and caruso but in the absurd auditorium choose cram though it be to the perilous door the loss be necessarily terrific fortunately the affair be subsidize not merely by the state but also by those two wealthy capitalist whitney c witt and mr oxford and therefore the management be in a position to ignore paltry financial consideration and to practice art for art 's sake in open the case mr pennington kc give instant proof of he astounding histrionic power he begin calmly colloquially treat the jury as friend of he boyhood and the judge as a gifted uncle and state in simple language that whitney c witt be claim seventy-two thousand pound from the defendant money pay for worthless picture palm off upon the myopic and venerable plaintiff as masterpiece he recount the life and death of the great painter priam farll and he solemn burial and the tear of the whole world he dwell upon the genius of priam farll and then upon the confide nature of the plaintiff then he inquire who could blame the plaintiff for he confidence in the uprightness of a firm with such a name as parfitt and then he explain by what accident of a dating-stamp on a canvas it have be discover that the picture guarantee to be by priam farll be paint after priam farll 's death he proceed with no variation of tone : the explanation be simplicity itself priam farll be not really dead it be he valet who die quite naturally quite comprehensibly the great genius priam farll wish to pass the remainder of he career as a humble valet he deceive everybody the doctor he cousin mr duncan farll the public authority the dean and chapter of the abbey the nation -- in fact the entire world as henry leek he marry and as henry leek he recommence the art of painting -- in putney he carry on the vocation several year without arouse the suspicion of a single person and then -- by a curious coincidence immediately after my client threaten a action against the defendant -- he display himself in he true identity as priam farll such be the simple explanation say pennington kc and add which you will hear presently from the defendant doubtless it will commend itself to you as experienced man of the world you can not but have perceive that such thing be constantly happen in real life that they be of daily occurrence i be almost ashamed to stand up before you and endeavor to rebut a story so plausible and so essentially convincing i feel that my task be well-nigh hopeless nevertheless i must do my best and so on it be one of he greatest feat in the kind of irony that appeal to a jury and the audience deem that the case be already virtually decide after whitney c witt and he secretary have be call and have fill the court with the echo twang of new york -lrb- the control fury of the aged witt be highly effective -rrb- mr henry leek be invite to the witness-box she be support thither by she two curate who however could not prevent she from weep at the stern voice of the usher she relate she marriage be that you husband demand vodrey kc -lrb- who have now assume the principal _ rôle _ pennington kc be engage in another play in another theater -rrb- point with one of he well-conceived dramatic gesture to priam farll it be sob mr henry leek the unhappy creature believe what she say and the curate though silent make a deep impression on the jury in cross-examination when crepitude kc force she to admit that on first meeting priam in he house in werter road she have not be quite sure of he identity she reply -- it be all come over I since should not a woman recognize the father of she own child she should interpolate the judge there be a difference of opinion as to whether he word be jocular or not mr henry leek be a touching figure but not amusing it be mr duncan farll who quite unintentionally supply the first relief duncan pooh-pooh the possibility of priam be priam he detail all the circumstance that follow the death in selwood terrace and show in fifty way that priam could not have be priam the man now masquerade as priam be not even a gentleman whereas priam be duncan 's cousin duncan be a excellent witness dry precise imperturbable under cross-examination by crepitude he have to describe particularly he boyish meeting with priam mr crepitude be not inquisitive tell we what occur say crepitude well we fight oh you fight what do you two naughty boy fight about -lrb- great laughter -rrb- about a plum-cake i think oh not a seed-cake a plum-cake -lrb- great laughter -rrb- i think a plum-cake and what be the result of this sanguinary encounter -lrb- great laughter -rrb- my cousin loosen one of my tooth -lrb- great laughter in which the court join -rrb- and what do you do to he i be afraid i do not do much i remember tear half he clothes off -lrb- roar of laughter in which every one join except priam and duncan farll -rrb- oh you be sure you remember that you be sure that it be not he who tear _ you _ clothes off -lrb- lot of hysteric laughter -rrb- yes say duncan coldly dream in the past he eye have the ` far away ' look as he add i remember now that my cousin have two little mole on he neck below the collar i seem to remember see they i have just think of it there be of course when it be mention in a theater something exorbitantly funny about even one mole two mole together bring the house down mr crepitude lean over to a solicitor in front of he the solicitor lean aside to a solicitor 's clerk and the solicitor 's clerk whisper to priam farll who nod er -- mr crepitude be begin again but he stop and say to duncan farll thank you you can step down then a witness name justinus a cashier at the hôtel de paris monte carlo swear that priam farll the renowned painter have spend four day in the hôtel de paris one hot may seven year ago and that the person in the court whom the defendant state to be priam farll be not that man no cross-examination could shake mr justinus follow he come the manager of the hôtel belvedere at mont pélerin near vevey switzerland who relate a similar tale and be equally unshaken and after that the picture themselves be bring in and the expert come after they and technical evidence be begin scarcely have it begin when a clock strike and the performance end for the day the principal actor doff they costume and snatch up the evening papers to make sure that the descriptive reporter have be as eulogistic of they as usual the judge who subscribe to a press-cutting agency be glad to find the next morning that none of he joke have be omit by any of the nineteen chief london daily and the strand and piccadilly be quick with witt _ v _ parfitt -- on evening poster and in the strident mouth of newsboy the telegraph wire vibrate to witt _ v _ parfitt in the great bet industrial town of the province wager be lay at scientific price england in a word be content and the principal actor have the right to be content also very astute people in club and saloon bar talk darkly about those two mole and priam 's nod in response to the whisper of the solicitor 's clerk : such detail do not escape the modern sketch writer at a thousand a year to very astute people the two mole appear to promise pretty thing _ priam 's refusal _ leek in the box this legend get itself on to the telegraph wire and the placard within a few minute of priam 's take the oath it send a shiver of anticipation throughout the country three day have pass since the opening of the case -lrb- for actor engage at a hundred a day for the run of the piece do not crack whip behind expert engage at ten or twenty a day the pace have therefore be dignified -rrb- and england want a fillip nobody except alice know what to expect from priam alice know she know that priam be in a extremely peculiar state which might lead to extremely peculiar result and she know also that there be nothing to be do with he she herself have make one little effort to bathe he in the light of reason the effort have not succeed she see the danger of renew it pennington kc by the way insist that she should leave the court during priam 's evidence priam 's attitude towards the whole case be one of bitter resentment a resentment now hot now cold he have the strongest possible objection to the entire affair he hate witt as keenly as he hate oxford all that he demand from the world be peace and quietness and the world would not grant he these inexpensive commodity he have not ask to be bury in westminster abbey he interment have be force upon he and if he choose to call himself by another name why should he not do so if he choose to marry a simple woman and live in a suburb and paint picture at ten pound each why should he not do so why should he be drag out of he tranquillity because two person in whom he feel no interest whatever have quarrel over he picture why should he life have be make unbearable in putney by the extravagant curiosity of a mob of journalist and then why should he be compel by means of a piece of blue paper to go through the frightful ordeal and flame of publicity in a witness-box that be the crowning unmerited torture the unthinkable horror which have break he sleep for many night in the box he certainly have all the appearance of a trap criminal with he nervous movement he restless lowered eye and he faint hard voice that he could scarcely fetch up from he throat nervousness line with resentment form excellent material for the plastic art of a cross-examining counsel and pennington kc itch to be at work crepitude kc oxford 's counsel be in less joyous mood priam be crepitude 's own witness and yet a horrible witness a witness who have consistently and ferociously decline to open he mouth until he be in the box assuredly he have nod in response to the whisper question of the solicitor 's clerk but he have not confirm the nod nor breathe a word of assistance during the three day of the trial he have merely sit there blaze in silence you name be priam farll begin crepitude it be say priam sullenly and with all the external characteristic of a liar at interval he glance surreptitiously at the judge as though the judge have be a bomb with a light fuse the examination start badly and it go from worse to worse the idea that this craven prevaricate figure in the box could be the illustrious the world-renowned priam farll seem absurd crepitude have to exercise all he self-control in order not to bully priam that be all say crepitude after priam have give he preposterous and halting explanation of the strange phenomenon of he life after the death of leek none of these carry conviction he merely say that the woman leek be mistake in identify he as she husband he infer that she be hysterical this inference alienate he from the audience completely he statement that he have no definite reason for pretend to be leek -- that it be a impulse of the moment -- be receive with mute derision he explanation when question as to the evidence of the hotel official that more than once he valet leek have go about impersonate he master seem grotesquely inadequate people wonder why crepitude have make no reference to the mole the fact be crepitude be afraid to refer to the mole in mention the mole to priam he might be stake all to lose all however pennington kc allude to the mole but not until he have conclusively prove to the judge in a cross-questioning of two hour ' duration that priam know nothing of priam 's own youth nor of painting nor of the world of painter he make a sad mess of priam and priam 's voice grow fainter and fainter and he gesture more and more self-incriminating pennington kc achieve one or two brilliant little effect now you say you go with the defendant to he club and that he tell you of the difficulty he be in yes do he make you any offer of money yes ah what do he offer you thirty-six thousand pound -lrb- sensation in court -rrb- so and what be this thirty-six thousand pound to be for i do not know you do not know come now i do not know you accept the offer no i refuse it -lrb- sensation in court -rrb- why do you refuse it because i do not care to accept it then no money pass between you that day yes five hundred pound what for a picture the same kind of picture that you have be sell at ten pound yes so that on the very day that the defendant want you to swear that you be priam farll the price of you picture rise from ten pound to five hundred yes do not that strike you as odd yes you still say -- mind leek you be on you oath -- you still say that you refuse thirty-six thousand pound in order to accept five hundred i sell a picture for five hundred -lrb- on the placard in the strand : severe cross-examination of leek -rrb- now about the encounter with mr duncan farll of course if you be really priam farll you remember all about that yes what age be you i do not know about nine oh you be about nine a suitable age for cake -lrb- great laughter -rrb- now mr duncan farll say you loosen one of he tooth i do and that he tear you clothes i dare say he say he remember the fact because you have two mole yes have you two mole yes -lrb- immense sensation -rrb- pennington pause where be they on my neck just below my collar kindly place you hand at the spot priam do so the excitement be terrific pennington again pause but convince that priam be a impostor he sarcastically proceed -- perhaps if i be not ask too much you will take you collar off and show the two mole to the court no say priam stoutly and for the first time he look pennington in the face you would prefer to do it perhaps in he lordship 's room if he lordship consent i will not do it anywhere say priam but surely -- the judge begin i will not do it anywhere my lord priam repeat loudly all he resentment surge up once more and particularly he resentment against the little army of expert who have pronounce he picture to be clever but worthless imitation of himself if he picture admittedly paint after he suppose death could not prove he identity if he word be to be flout by insulting and bewigged beast of prey then he mole should not prove he identity he resolve upon obstinacy the witness gentleman say pennington kc in triumph to the jury have two mole on he neck exactly as describe by mr duncan farll but he will not display they eleven legal mind bent nobly to the problem whether the law and justice of england could compel a free man to take he collar off if he refuse to take he collar off in the meantime of course the case have to proceed the six or seven hundred pound a day must be earn and there be various other witness the next witness be alice \* \* \* \* \* chapter xii _ alice 's performance _ when alice be call and when she stand up in the box and smile indulgently at the doddering usher kiss the book as if it have be a chubby nephew a change come over the emotional atmosphere of the court which feel a natural need to smile alice be in all she best clothes but it can not be say that she look the wife of a super-eminent painter in answer to a question she state that before marry priam she be the widow of a builder in a small way of business well know in putney and also in wandsworth this be obviously true she could have be nothing but the widow of a builder in a small way of business well know in putney and also in wandsworth she be every inch that how do you first meet you present husband mr leek ask mr crepitude mr farll if you please she cheerfully correct he well mr farll then i must say she remark conversationally it seem queer you should be call I mr leek when they be pay you to prove that i be mrs farll mr -- excuse I i forget you name this nettled crepitude kc it nettle he too merely to see a witness standing in the box just as if she be stand in she kitchen talk to a tradesman at the door he be not accustom to such a spectacle and though alice be he own witness he be angry with she because he be angry with she husband he blush junior behind he could watch the blush creep like a tide round the back of he neck over he exceedingly white collar if you 'll be good enough to reply -- say he i meet my husband outside st george 's hall by appointment say she but before that how do you make he acquaintance through a matrimonial agency say she oh observe crepitude and decide that he would not pursue that avenue the fact be alice have put he into the wrong humor for make the best of she she be moreover in a very difficult position for priam have positively forbid she to have any speech with solicitor ' clerk or with solicitor and thus crepitude know not what pitfall for he she evidence might contain he draw from she a expression of opinion that she husband be the real priam farll but she could give no reason in support -- do not seem to conceive that reason in support be necessary have you husband any mole ask crepitude suddenly any what demand alice lean forward vodrey kc spring up i submit to you lordship that my learn friend be put a lead question say vodrey kc mr crepitude say the judge can you not phrase you question differently have you husband any birthmark -- er -- on he body crepitude try again oh _ mole _ you say you need not be afraid yes he be get two mole close together on he neck here and she point amid silence to the exact spot then notice the silence she add that be all that i _ know _ of crepitude resolve to end he examination upon this impressive note and he sit down and alice have vodrey kc to face you meet you husband through a matrimonial agency he ask yes who first have recourse to the agency i do and what be you object i want to find a husband of course she smile what _ do _ people go to matrimonial agency for you be not here to put question to I say vodrey severely well she say i should have think you would have know what people go to matrimonial agency for still you live and learn she sigh cheerfully do you think a matrimonial agency be quite the nicest way of -- it depend what you mean by ` nice ' say alice womanly yes say alice shortly i do if you be go to stand there and tell I i be unwomanly all i have to say be that you be unmanly you say you first meet you husband outside st george 's hall yes never see he before no how do you recognize he by he photograph oh he would send you he photograph yes with a letter yes in what name be the letter sign henry leek be that before or after the death of the man who be bury in westminster abbey a day or two before -lrb- sensation in court -rrb- so that you present husband be call himself henry leek before the death no he be not that letter be write by the man that die my husband find my reply to it and my photograph in the man 's bag afterwards and happen to be stroll past st george 's hall just at the moment like -- well happen to be stroll past st george 's hall just at the moment like -- -lrb- titter -rrb- i catch sight of he and speak to he you see i think then that he be the man who write the letter what make you think so i have the photograph so that the man who write the letter and die do not send he own photograph he send another photograph -- the photograph of you husband yes do not you know that i should have think you would have know that do you really expect the jury to believe that tale alice turn smile to the jury no she say i be not sure as i do i do not believe it myself for a long time but it be true then at first you do not believe you husband be the real priam farll no you see he do not exactly tell I like he only sort of hint but you do not believe no you think he be lie no i think it be just a kind of a idea he have you know my husband be not like other gentleman i imagine not say vodrey now when do you come to be perfectly sure that you husband be the real priam farll it be the night of that day when mr oxford come down to see he he tell I all about it then oh that day when mr oxford pay he five hundred pound yes immediately mr oxford pay he five hundred pound you be ready to believe that you husband be the real priam farll do not that strike you as excessively curious it be just how it happen say alice blandly now about these mole you point to the right side of you neck be you sure they be not on the left side let I think now say alice frowning when he be shave in a morning -- he get up earlier now than he use to -- i can see he face in the looking-glass and in the looking-glass the mole be on the left side so on _ he _ they must be on the right side yes the right side that be it have you never see they except in a mirror my good woman interpolate the judge for some reason alice flush i suppose you think that be funny she snap slightly toss she head the audience expect the roof to fall but the roof withstand the strain thanks to a sagacious deafness on the part of the judge if indeed he have not be visit by a sudden deafness it be difficult to see how he would have handle the situation have you any idea vodrey inquire why you husband refuse to submit he neck to the inspection of the court i do not know he have refuse but he have well say alice if you have not turn I out of the court while he be be examine perhaps i could have tell you but i can not as it be so it serve you right thus end alice 's performance _ the public captious _ the court rise and another six or seven hundred pound be go into the pocket of the celebrated artiste engage it become at once obvious from the tone of the evening placard and the contents of evening papers and the remark in crowded suburban train that for the public the trial have resolve itself into a affair of mole nothing else now interested the great and intelligent public if priam have those mole on he neck then he be the real priam if he have not then he be a common cheat the public have take the matter into its own hand the sturdy common sense of the public be be apply to the affair on the whole it may be say that the sturdy common sense of the public be against priam for the majority the entire story be fishily preposterous it must surely be clear to the feeblest brain that if priam possess mole he would expose they the minority who talk of psychology and the artistic temperament be regard as the cousin of little englander and the direct descendant of pro-boer still the thing ought to be prove or disprove why do not the judge commit he for contempt of court he would then be send to holloway and be compel to strip -- and there you be or why do not oxford hire some one to pick a quarrel with he in the street and carry the quarrel to blow with a view to raiment-tearing a nice thing english justice -- if it have no machinery to force a man to show he neck to a jury but then english justice _ be _ notoriously comic and whole trainful of people sneer at they country 's institution in a manner which have it be adopt by a foreigner would have plunge europe into war and finally test the blue-water theory undoubtedly the immemorial tradition of english justice come in for very severe handling simply because priam would not take he collar off and he would not the next morning there be consultation in counsel 's room and the common law of the realm be ransack to find a legal method of inspect priam 's mole without success priam arrive safely at the court with he usual high collar and be photograph thirty time between the curb and the entrance hall he be sleep in it cry wag bet yer two ter one it be a clean ` un cry other wag he missus get he linen up it be subject to such indignity that the man who have defy the supreme court of judicature reach he seat in the theater when solicitor and counsel attempt to reason with he he answer with silence the rumor run that in he hip pocket he be carry a revolver wherewith to protect the modesty of he neck the celebrated artiste have perceive the folly of lose six or seven hundred pound a day because priam happen to be a obstinate idiot continue with the case for mr oxford and another army of expert of european reputation be wait to prove that the picture admittedly paint after the burial in the national valhallum be paint by priam farll and could have be paint by no other they demonstrate this by internal evidence in other word they prove by deduction from square of canvas that priam have mole on he neck it be a phenomenon eminently legal and priam in he stiff collar sit and listen the expert however achieve two feat both unintentionally they send the judge soundly to sleep and they weary the public which consider that the trial be fall short of its early promise this _ expertise _ go on to the extent of two whole day and appreciably more than another thousand pound and on the third day priam somewhat harden to renown reappear with he mysterious neck and more determine than ever he have see in a paper which be otherwise chiefly occupy with mole and expert a cautious statement that the police have collect the necessary _ primâ facie _ evidence of bigamy and that he arrest be imminent however something stranger than arrest for bigamy happen to he _ new evidence _ the principal king 's bench corridor in the law court like the other main corridor be a place of strange meeting and interview a man may receive there a bit of news that will change the whole of the rest of he life or he may receive only a invitation to a mediocre lunch in the restaurant underneath he never know beforehand priam assuredly do not receive a invitation to lunch he be traverse the crowded thoroughfare -- for with the exception of match and toothpick seller the corridor have the characteristic of a strand pavement in the forenoon -- when he catch sight of mr oxford talk to a woman now he have exchange no word with mr oxford since the historic scene in the club and he be determine to exchange no word however they have not go through the formality of a open breach the most prudent thing to do therefore be to turn and take another corridor and priam would have flee be capable of astonishing prudence when prudence mean the avoidance of unpleasant encounter but just as he be turn the woman in conversation with mr oxford see he and step towards he with the rapidity of think hold forth she hand she be tall thin and stiffly distinguish in the brusque dutch-doll motion of she limb she coat and skirt be quite presentable but she foot be large -lrb- not she fault of course though one be apt to treat large foot as a crime -rrb- and she feathered hat be even larger she hide she age behind a veil how do you do mr farll she address he firmly in a voice which nevertheless throb it be lady sophium entwistle how do you do he say take she offer hand there be nothing else to do and nothing else to say then mr oxford put out he hand how do you do mr farll and take mr oxford 's hate hand priam say again how do you do it be all just as if there have be no past the past seem to have be swallow up in the ordinariness of the crowded corridor by all the rule for the guidance of human conduct lady sophium ought to have denounce priam with outstretched dramatic finger to the contempt of the world as a philanderer with the heart of trust woman and he ought to have kick mr oxford along the corridor for a scheming hebrew but they merely shake hand and ask each other how they do not even expect a answer this show to what extent the ancient quality of the race have deteriorate then a silence i suppose you know mr farll say lady sophium rather suddenly that i have get to give evidence in this case no he say i do not yes it seem they have scour all over the continent in vain to find people who know you under you proper name and who could identify you with certainty and they could not find one -- doubtless owe to you peculiar habit of travel really say priam he have make love to this woman he have kiss she they have promise to marry each other it be a piece of wild folly on he part but in the eye of a impartial person folly could not excuse he desertion of she he flight from she intellectual charm he gaze pierce she veil no she be not quite so old as alice she be not more plain than alice she certainly know more than alice she could talk about picture without stick a knife into he soul and turn it in the wound she be better dress than alice and she behavior on the present occasion candid kind correct could not have be surpass by alice and yet she demeanor be without question prodigiously splendid in its ignore of all that she have go through and yet even in that moment of complicated misery he have enough strength to hate she because he have be fool enough to make love to she no excuse whatever for he of course i be in indium when i first hear of this case lady sophium continue at first i think it must be a sort of tichborne business over again then know you as i do i think perhaps it be not and as lady sophium happen to be in london now put in mr oxford she be good enough to give she invaluable evidence on my behalf that be scarcely the way to describe it say lady sophium coldly i be only here because you compel I to be here by subpoena it be all due to you acquaintanceship with my aunt quite so quite so mr oxford agree it naturally can not be very agreeable to you to have to go into the witness-box and submit to cross-examination certainly not and i be the more oblige to you for you kindness lady sophium priam comprehend the situation lady sophium after he suppose death have impart to relative the fact of he engagement and the unscrupulous scoundrel mr oxford have get hold of she and be force she to give evidence for he and after the evidence the joke of every man in the street would be to the effect that priam farll rather than marry the skinny spinster have pretend to be dead you see mr oxford add to he the important point about lady sophium 's evidence be that in paris she see both you and you valet -- the valet obviously a servant and you obviously he master there can therefore be no question of she have be deceive by the valet pose as the master it be a most fortunate thing that by a mere accident i get on the track of lady sophium in time in the nick of time only yesterday afternoon no reference by mr oxford to priam 's obstinacy in the matter of collar he appear to regard priam 's collar as a phenomenon of nature such as the weather or a rock in the sea as something to be accept with resignation no sign of annoyance with priam he be the prince of diplomatist be mr oxford can i speak to you a minute say lady sophium to priam mr oxford step away with a bow and lady sophium look steadily at priam he have to admit again that she be stupendous she be he capital mistake but she be stupendous at they last interview he have embrace she she have attend he funeral in westminster abbey and she could suppress all that from she eye she could stand there calm and urbane in she acceptance of the terrific past apparently she forgive say lady sophium simply now mr farll shall i have to give evidence or not you know it depend on you the casualness of she tone be sublime it be heroic it make she foot small he have swear to himself that he would be cut in piece before he would aid the unscrupulous mr oxford by remove he collar in presence of those dramatic artiste he have be grossly insult disturbed maltreat and exploit the entire world have meddle with he private business and he would be cut in piece before he would display those mole which would decide the issue in a instant well she have cut he in piece please do not worry say he in reply i will attend to thing at that moment alice who have follow he by a later train appear good-morning lady sophium he say raise he hat and leave she _ thought on justice _ farll take he collar off witt _ v _ parfitt result these and similar placard fly in the strand breeze never in the history of empire have the removal of a starched linen collar -lrb- size 16-1\/2 -rrb- create one-thousandth part of the sensation cause by the removal of this collar it be a epoch-making act it finish the drama of witt _ v _ parfitt the renowned artiste engage do not of course permit the case to collapse at once no it have to be conclude slowly and majestically with due form and expense new witness -lrb- such as doctor -rrb- have to be call and old one recall duncan farll for instance have to be recall and if the situation be ignominious for priam it be also ignominious for duncan duncan 's sole advantage in he defeat be that the judge do not skin he alive in the sum up nor the jury in they verdict england breathe more freely when the affair be finally over and the renowned artiste engage have withdraw envelop in glory the truth be that england so proud of she system have have a fright she judicial method have very nearly fail to make a man take he collar off in public they have really fail but it have all come right in the end and so england pretend that they have only just miss fail a grave injustice would have be perpetrate have priam choose not to take off he collar people say naturally that imprisonment for bigamy would have include the taking-off of collar but then it be rumor that prosecution for bigamy have not by any means be a certainty as since leave the box mr henry leek have waver in she identification however the justice of england have emerge safely and it be all very astounding and shocking and improper and everybody be exceedingly wise after the event and with one voice the press cry that something painful ought to occur at once to priam farll no matter how great a artist he be the question be : how could priam be trap in the net of the law he have not commit bigamy he have do nothing he have only behave in a negative manner he have not even give false information to the registrar and dr cashmore could throw no light on the episode for he be dead he wife and daughter have at last succeed in kill he the judge have intimate that the ecclesiastical wrath of the dean and chapter might speedily and terribly overtake priam farll but that sound vague and unsatisfactory to the lay ear in short the matter be the most curious that ever be and for the sake of the national peace of mind the national dignity and the national conceit it be allow to drop into forgetfulness after a few day and when the papers announce that by priam 's wish the farll museum be to be carry to completion and formally convey to the nation despite all the nation decide to accept that honorable amend and go off to the seaside for its annual holiday _ the will to live _ alice insist on it and so immediately before they final departure from england they go priam pretend that the visit be undertake solely to please she but the fact be that he own morbid curiosity move in the same direction they travel by a omnibus past the putney empire and the walham green empire as far as walham green and there change into another one which carry they past the chelsea empire the army and navy store and the hotel windsor to the door of westminster abbey and they vanish out of the October sunshine into the beam-shot gloom of valhallum it be alice 's first view of valhallum though of course she have hear of it in old time she have visit madame tussaud 's and the tower but she have not have leisure to get round as far as valhallum it impress she deeply a verger point they to the nave but they dare not demand more minute instruction they have not the courage to ask for _ it _ priam could not speak there be moment with he when he could not speak lest he soul should come out of he mouth and flit irrecoverably away and he could not find the tomb save for the outrageous tomb of mighty newton the nave seem to be as naked as when it come into the world yet he be sure he be bury in the nave -- and only three year ago too astounding be it not what could happen in three year he know that the tomb have not be remove for there have be a article in the _ daily record _ on the previous day ask in the name of a scandalize public whether the dean and chapter do not consider that three month be more than long enough for the correction of a fundamental error in the burial department he be gloomy he have in truth be somewhat gloomy ever since the trial perhaps it be the shadow of the wrath of the dean and chapter on he he have cease to procure joy in the daily manifestation of life in the street of the town and this failure to discover the tomb intensify the calm amiable sadness which distinguish he alice gaze around chiefly with she mouth inquire suddenly -- what be that print there she have detect a legend incise on one of the small stone flag which form the vast floor of the nave they stoop over it priam farll it say simply in fine roman letter and then he date that be all near by on other flag they decipher other name of honor this austere method of mark the repose of the dead commend itself to he cause he to feel proud of himself and of the ridiculous england that somehow keep we great love he gloom fade and do you know what idea rush from he heart to he brain by jove i will paint finer picture than any i have do yet and the impulse to recommence the work of creation surge over he the tear start to he eye i like that murmured alice gaze at the stone i do think that be nice and _ he _ say because he truly feel it because the will to live rage through he again tingle and smart : i be glad i be not there they smile at each other and they instinctive hand fumblingly meet a few day later the dean and chapter sting into action by the majestic rebuke of the _ daily record _ amend the floor of valhallum and cause the mortal residuum of the immortal organism know as henry leek to be nocturnally transport to a different bed _ on board _ a few day later also a north german lloyd steamer quit southampton for algier bear among its passenger priam and alice it be a rough starlit night and from the stern of the vessel the tumbled white water make a pathway straight to recede england priam have come to love the slope of putney with the broad river at the foot but he show what i think be a nice feeling in leave england he sojourn in we land have not crown he with brilliance he be not a be create for society nor for cut a figure nor for exhibit tact and prudence in the crisis of existence he could neither talk well nor read well nor express himself in exactly suitable action he could only express himself at the end of a brush he could only paint extremely beautiful picture that be the major part of he vitality in minor way he may have be upon occasion a fool but he be never a fool on canvas he say everything there and say it to perfection for those who could read for those who can read and for those who will be able to read five hundred year hence why expect more from he why be disappoint in he one do not expect a wire-walker to play fine billiards you yourself mirror of prudence that you be would have certainly avoid all priam 's manifold error in the conduct of he social career but you see he be divine in another way as the steamer speed along the lengthen pathway from england one question keep hop in and out of he mind : _ i wonder what they 'll do with I next time _ do not imagine that he and alice be stare over the stern at the singular isle no there be imperative reason which affect both of they against that it be only in the moment of the comparative calm which always follow insurrection that priam have leisure to wonder and to see he own limitation and joyfully to meditate upon the prospect of age devote to the sole do of that which he could so supremely in a sweet exile
