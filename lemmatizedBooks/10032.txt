weather be as inordinately hot as it have before be intolerably cold and the reverend octavius simpson stand wait in the gorgeous office of the boreal life insurance company new york for the appearance of mr melancthon schenck have be direct by a superb young clerk who part he hair in the middle to just stand out of the passage-way and amuse yourself with one of we schedule for awhile until the great life-agent should come in the gospeler read a few schedulistic page prove that if a person have he life insure at the age of thirty and pay he premium regularly until he be eighty-five the cost to he and profit to the company would probably be much more than the amount he have insure for it must then be evident to he that upon he death at ninety the company would have receive in all sufficient fund from he to pay the full amount of he policy to the lady whom he have always introduce as he wife and still retain enough to declare a handsome dividend for itself such be the sound business-principle upon which the boreal be conduct and the merest child must perceive that only the extremely unlikely coincidence of at least four insurer all die before eighty-five could endanger the solvency of the beneficent institution -- have master this convincing argument and become greatly confuse by its plausibility mr simpson next give some attention to what be go on around he in the office and allow he overwrought mind to relax cheerfully in contemplation thereof one of human nature 's peculiarity be quite amusingly exemplify in the different treatment accord to caller who be safe risk and to those who be not thus the whisper of here come old tubercle again be prevalent amongst the clerk upon the entrance of a very thin narrow-chested old gentleman whom they inform with considerable humor that he be only waste hour which should be spend with a spiritual adviser in he useless attempt to take out a policy in _ that _ office the boreal could not insure man who ought to be upon they die bed instead of cough around insurance office ha ha ha another gentleman florid of countenance and absolutely without neck be quickly check in the act of give he name at one of the desk one clerk desire another clerk to look under the head of a in he book for _ apoplexy _ and let this man see that we can not take such a risk as he be on any term a third caller who really look quite healthy except around the eye be also assure that he need not call again -- because you see explain the clerkly wag it be no go for you to try to play you bright 's disease on _ we _ when however the applicant be a robustious long-necked fresh individual he be almost lift from he foot in the rush of oblige young boreal to show he into the room of the medical examiner and when now and then a agent or a insurance-broker come drag in by the collar some safe risk just capture there be a actual contest to see who should be most polite to the panting but healthy stranger and obtain he private biography for the consideration of the company the reverend octavius study these sprightly little scene with unspeakable interest until the arrival of mr schenck and then follow that popular benefactor into he private office with the air of a man who have gain a heighten admiration for he species so you have come to you sens at last say mr schenck hastily draw he visitor toward a window in the side-room to which they have retire let I look at you tongue sir what do you mean ask the gospeler endeavor to draw back i mean what i say let -- I -- see -- you -- tongue -- or stop say mr schenck seize with a new thought i may as well examine you general organization first and fly at the astounded ritualistic clergyman he have sound he lung cause a sharp pain in he liver and feel he pulse before the latter could phrase a intelligent protest you may die at any moment and probably will conclude mr schenck thoughtfully but still on the score of friendship we 'll give you a policy for a reasonable amount and take the chance of be able to compromise with you mother on a certain per centage after the funeral i do not want any of you plague policy exclaim the irritated gospeler push away the hand strive to feel he pulse again as you have express a desire to resign the guardianship of you ward mr and miss pendragon and i have agree to accept it my purpose in call here be to obtain such statement of you account with those young people as you may be dispose to render ah return the other in sullen disappointment that be all eh allow I to inform you then that i have cancel the boreal policy which have be grant to the murderer and he sister and allow I also to remark that a die clergyman like yourself might employ he last moment better than encourage a southern destroyer of human life i do not can not believe that montgomery pendragon be guilty say mr simpson firmly have he full confidence and thoroughly know he nature i be sure of he innocence let appearance be what they may consequently it be my determination to befriend he and you will not have you life insure i will not sir please stop bother I and you call yourself a clergyman cry mr schenck with intense scorn you pretend to be a ritualistic spiritual guide you champion people who slay the innocent and steal devout man 's umbrella and yet you do not scruple to leave you own high-church mother entirely without provision at you death -- in such a case continue the speaker rise while he manner grow ferocious with determination -- in such a case all other argument have fail my duty be plain yon shall not leave this room sir until you have promise to take out a boreal policy he start as he speak for the door of the private-office intend to lock it and remove the key but the unhappy ritualist fathom he design be there before he and tear open the door for he own speedy egress mr schenck observe the gospeler turn and pause in the doorway you allow you business-energy to violate all the most delicate amenity of private life and will yet drive some madden mortal to such resentful use of pistol knife or poker as you mourning family shall sincerely deplore the article on free trade and protection in the daily papers have hitherto be regard as the climax of all that utterly weary the long-suffering human soul but i tell you as a candid friend that they be but little more depressing and jading to the vital power than you unceasing mention of life-insurance these be strong word sir answer mr schenck incredulously the editorial article to which you refer be consider the very drought of journalism those by mr greeley especially be so dry that they be positively dangerous reading without a tumbler of water yon bring the comparison upon yourself mr schenck good day thus speak the reverend octavius simpson hurry nervously from the boreal temple not fairly satisfied that he have escape a policy until he find himself safely emerge on broadway and turn a corner toward nassau street beach the latter bye-way after a brief interval of sharp walking he enter a building nearly opposite that in which be the office of mr dibble and have ascend numerous flight of twilight stair to the lofty floor immediately over the saddened room occupy by a great american comic paper come into a spidery garret where lurk montgomery pendragon hard at it he ask approach a ricketty table at which sit the persecute southerner read a volume of hoyle 's game my only friend ejaculate the lonely reader hurriedly cover the book with a arm i be as you see study law here all alone with

essay on political economy a edition of the corporation manual the coast survey for 1850 and other inflame statistical work which have be send to he in he exile by thoughtful friend who have no place to keep they cheer up brother exhort the good gospeler i 'll send you some nice theological volume to add to you library which will then be complete be not despondent all will come right yet i reckon it will in time return the youth moodily i suppose you know that my sister be determine to come here and stay with I yes montgomery i have hear of she noble resolution may she conversation prove sustain to you there will be enough of it i reckon to sustain half a dozen people be the despondent answer this be a gloomy place for she mr simpson situate as it be immediately over the office of a comic paper and do you think she would care for cheerful accessory while you be in sorrow ask the gospeler reproachfully but it be so mournful -- that floor below persist the brother doubtfully if there be only something the least bit more lively down there -- say a undertaker 's a sister 's love can lessen the most crush gloom montgomery a silent pressure of the hand reward this encouraging reminder of sanguine friendship and after the depressed law-student have promise the reverend octavius to walk with he as far as the ferry in a few moment the say reverend depart for a hasty call upon the old lawyer across the street benignant mr dibble sit near a front window of he office and receive the visitor with legal serenity and how do we young friend enjoy himself mr simpson in the retreat which i have the honor of commend to you for he the visitor reply that he young friend 's retreat by its very loftiness be calculate to inspire any occupant with a room-attic affection and how and when and where do you leave mr bumstead inquire mr dibble as well as could be expect this morning at bumsteadville say the gospeler with answer as terse and comprehensive as the question -- because add the lawyer quickly there he be now come out of a refreshment saloon immediately under the building in which we young friend take refuge so he be exclaim the surprised mr simpson stare through the window there indeed as indicate be the ritualistic organist apparently eat clove from the palm of he right hand as he emerge from the place of refreshment and wear a linen coat so long and a straw hat of such vast brim that he sex be not obvious at first glance while the two beholder gaze in unspeakable fascination mr bumstead suddenly make a wild dart at a pass elderly man with a dark sun-umbrella ecstatically tear the latter from he grasp and passionately tap he on the head with it then before the astounded elderly man could recover from he amazement or regain the gold spectacles which have be knock from he nose the umbrella after a instant of keen examination be restore to he with a humble almost abjectly apologetic air and mr bumstead hurry back evidently crush into the refreshment saloon he brain must be turn by the loss of he relative murmur the gospeler pitifully he umbrellative you mean say mr dibble when these two gentleman have part and the reverend octavius simpson have be escort to the ferry as promise by montgomery pendragon the latter after a long insane walk about the city with the thermometer at 98 degree return to he attic in time to surprise a stranger climb in through one of the back window who be you exclaim the southern youth much strike by the funereal aspect sexton-like dress and inordinately long countenance of the pallid light-haired intruder pardon

watering place but be must have some recreation so he determine to have a day 's fishing among the celebrated thousand island of the st lawrence he put some luncheon in a basket and set off quite early in the morning finding that some twenty hour be consume in the transit mr p think that consider he hurry he have better perhaps have go to newark for a day 's fishing off the pier but he be at the st lawrence now and it would not do to complain he hire a boat line bait and two navigator and set out bravely he sail among a crowd of island where either the bowsprit or the boom be continually get catch in the shrubbery and rock until he come to island no 18 here be a picnic party for reason which the accompany view may render obvious mr p and he man decline the invitation of the picnicker to stop and join they the boat continue on until it reach the channel between island no 87 and no 88 and there mr p get out he line and commence to fish troll he bait behind as the boat slowly sail

intricacy and have put herself out mr p do not have much luck at first he catch one muskallonge after a period of patient wait which he feel he also must call long and once when he think he be haul in a fine bass he turn very red when the boatman laugh at see he cotch a eel but after a while he get a royal bite he haul in manfully and although owe to the intricacy of the channel he could not see what he have catch he know it be a fine fellow from its weight at last after tremendous tug he get it in over the stem it be one of the thousand island what could be do now the steersman who have slip under a seat when he see the great mass above he and the man who manage the sail be both canadian and after a great deal of excited talk they agree if mr p would make it worth they while they would endeavor to put the island back in its place and make no remark in public which would tend to produce a misunderstanding between the government of great britain and the united state on the ground of undue acquisition of territory by the payment of a sum which it will require a club of thirty subscriber to make good to he mr p conclude the arrangement and they sail back to replace the island but what be the horror of the party when they perceive on the unfortunate bit of british territory a plate which have stick fast by reason of a covering of the juice of plum-pie and a fork which be ram firmly into the earth it need but few collateral evidence to convince mr p and he man that this be the island where they have see the picnic and where be the picnicker if any of mr p 's subscriber in

on greatness also a man may be great and not know it they say that until he have make he grand success at fort fisher you never could persuade butler that he be a great general tupper i be inform would never believe that he be the most remarkable poet ever produce by england also a man may be great and be perfectly aware of it acquaintance of george francis train gen o'neill and count joanne assert that no one know better than these gentleman that they be great man also a man may die calmly in the consciousness that he be a distinguished individual and yet year afterwards some magazine writer may cast historic doubt upon he greatness of course there be several class of great people there be the little great man -lrb- for example nap 3 -rrb- the big great man -lrb- bismarck -rrb- the great little man -lrb- nap 1 -rrb- and the great big man -lrb- the onondaga giant -rrb- but the patient observer must perceive that general rule will cover all these case it be to be hope that no one who shall become great by means of my rule will turn upon I and revile I when he find himself interview incessantly persecute by unearthing of he early sin by persistent beggar by slander of the envious by libel of the press and by the other concomitant of greatness you must take the sour with the sweet even the sweetest orange may have a unpleasant rind rule by which every man can become great 1 always be sure to get what belong to you and make most vigorous grab for everything that belong to everybody else 2 take everything which be offer to you if it be on a par with what you deem the standard of you worth this rule require the exercise of much wisdom in its application if for example you look upon the custom house as the office which be adapt to you do not under any

you inhabit a old white hat and a slouchy old overcoat will insure you a nomination for the office of governor if by follow these rule and heed these observation you can not become a great man you may rest assure that the fault be not in the rule but in you what be already perfect can not be make more perfect if you fail after conscientiously follow the above advice -lrb- though i be not sure that the fact will not be the same if you succeed -rrb- it be because you be already great -- a great fool \* \* \* \* \* the color troops fight nobly so far as the franco-prussian war have go the blackest
