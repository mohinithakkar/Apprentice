produce by juliet sutherland leonard d johnson and pg distribute proofreader verse and prose for beginner in read _ select from english and american literature _ 1893 preface the attentive reader of this little book will be apt to notice very soon that though its title be _ verse and prose for beginner in read _ the verse occupy nine tenth the prose be confine to about two hundred proverb and familiar saying -- some of they indeed in rhyme -- scatter in group throughout the book the reason for this will be apparent as soon as one consider the end in view in the preparation of this compilation the _ riverside primer and reader _ as state in its introduction be design to serve as the sole text-book in reading require by a pupil when he have master it he be ready to make the acquaintance of the world 's literature in the english tongue in that book therefore the pupil be lead by easy exercise to a intelligent reading of piece of literature both verse and prose so that he might become in a slight degree familiar with literature before he part with he sole text-book but the largest space have of necessity to be give to practice work which lead straight to literature indeed though to a small quantity only the verse offer in that book be draw from nursery rhyme and from a few of the great master of poetical form the prose be furnish by a selection of proverb some of the simplest folk story and two passage close the book from the old and new testament the pupil upon lay down he _ primer and reader _ and propose to enter the promised land of literature could find a volume of prose consist of _ fable and folk story _ into the pleasure of which he have already be initiate but until now he could find no volume of poetry especially prepare for he which should fulfill the promise of the verse offer to he in he _ primer and reader _ be it remember that he be not so much to read verse write expressly for he as to overhear the great poet when they sing so simply so directly and yet with so penetrate a note that the burden of they song full it may be to the child 's elder would have a awakening power for the child himself as so often say a child can receive and delight in a poem through the ear long before he be able to attain the same pleasure through the eye and there be many poem in such a book for example as miss agne repplier 's _ a book of famous verse _ wholly delightful for a child to listen to which yet it would be impossible for he to read to himself the agreeable task of the editor therefore be to search english and american literature for those poem which have fall from the lip of poet with so sweet a cadence and in such simple note that they would offer but slight difficulty to a child who have master the rudiment of read it be by no means necessary that such poem should have have a audience of child in mind nor have take childhood for a subject though it be natural that a few of the verse should prove to be suggest by some aspect of child-life the selection must be its own advocate but it may be worth while to point out that the plan of the book suppose a easy approach to the more serious poem by means of the light ditty of the nursery that there be no more reason for deprive a child of honest fun in he verse than there be for condemn the child 's elder to grave poetry exclusively and that it be not necessary or even desirable for a poem to come at once within the reader 's comprehension to take a extreme case tennyson 's line break break break would no doubt be rule out of such a book as this by many in sympathy with child yet the unexplainable power of the poem be not beyond the apprehension of sensitive nature at a early age the contents have be glean from a number of source and the editor be glad to mingle with the name of the secure dweller on parnassus those of some living american and englishman he do not pretend that he have make a exhaustive collection but he hope the book may be regard as the nucleus for a anthology which can not in the nature of thing be very large the prose as already intimate be confine to group of proverb and familiar saying in one aspect these single line of prose present difficulty to the young reader : they be condensed form of expression even though the word may be simple but they offer the convenient small change of intellectual currency which it be well for one to be supply with at a early stage of one 's journey and they afford to the teacher a capital opportunity for conversational and other exercise the order of this book be in a general way from the easy to the more difficult with a attempt also at a agreeable variety the editor have purposely avoid break up the book into lesson portion or give it the air of a text-book there be no reason why child should not read book as older people read they for pleasure and dissociate they from a too persistent notion of task it be entirely possible that some teacher may find it out of the question to lead they class straight through this book but there be nothing to forbid they from judicious skip or what be perhaps more to the point from help pupil over a difficult word or phrase when it be encounter the interest which the child take will carry he over most hard place it would be a capital use of the book also if teacher be to draw upon it for poem which they pupil should in the suggestive phrase learn by heart to this purpose the contents be singularly well adapt for from the single line proverb to a poem by wordsworth there be such a wide range of choice that the teacher need not resort to the questionable device of give child fragment and bit of verse and prose to commit to memory one of the greatest service we can do the young mind be to accustom it to the perception of _ whole _ and whether this whole be a lyric or a narrative poem like evangeline it be almost equally important that the young reader should learn to hold it as such in he mind to treat a poem as a mere quarry out of which a particularly smooth stone can be chip be to misinterpret poetry a poem be a statue not a quarry he boston _ October _ 1893 contents alphabet _ mother goose _ a
