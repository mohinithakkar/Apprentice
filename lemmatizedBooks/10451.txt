that we should go together and visit the hebride -lrb- 9 -rrb- martin 's account of those island have impressed we with a notion that we might there contemplate a system of life almost totally different from what we have be accustom to see and to find simplicity and wildness and all the circumstance of remote time or place so near to we native great island be a object within the reach of reasonable curiosity dr johnson have say in he _ journey _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- ` that he scarcely remember how the wish to visit the hebride be excite ' but he tell I in summer 1763 -lrb- 11 -rrb- that he father put martin 's account into he hand when he be very young and that he be much pleased with it we reckon there would be some inconveniency and hardship and perhaps a little danger but these we be persuade be magnify in the imagination of every body when i be at ferney in 1764 i mention we design to voltaire he look at I as if i have talk of go to the north pole and say ` you do not insist on my accompany you ' -- ` no sir ' -- ` then i be very willing you should go ' i be not afraid that we curious expedition would be prevent by such apprehension but i doubt that it would not be possible to prevail on dr johnson to relinquish for some time the felicity of a london life which to a man who can enjoy it with full intellectual relish be apt to make existence in any narrower sphere seem insipid or irksome i doubt that he would not be willing to come down from he elevated state of philosophical dignity from a superiority of wisdom among the wise and of learning among the learn and from flash he wit upon mind bright enough to reflect it he have disappoint my expectation so long that i begin to despair but in spring 1773 he talk of come to scotland that year with so much firmness that i hope he be at last in earnest i know that if he be once launch from the metropolis he would go forward very well and i get we common friend there to assist in set he afloat to mr thrale in particular whose enchantment over he seldom fail i be much oblige it be ' _ i 'll give thee a wind _ ' - ' _ thou art kind _ -lrb- 12 -rrb- ' -- to _ attract _ he we have invitation from the chief macdonald and macleod and for additional aid i write to lord elibank -lrb- 13 -rrb- dr william robertson and dr beattie to dr robertson so far as my letter concern the present subject i write as follow : ` we friend mr samuel johnson be in great health and spirit and i do think have a serious resolution to visit scotland this year the more attraction however the better and therefore though i know he will be happy to meet you there it will forward the scheme if in you answer to this you express yourself concern it with that power of which you be so happily possess and which may be so direct as to operate strongly upon he ' he answer to that part of my letter be quite as i could have wish it be write with the address and persuasion of the historian of america ` when i see you last you give we some hope that you might prevail with mr johnson to make out that excursion to scotland with the expectation of which we have long flattered ourselves if he could order matter so as to pass some time in edinburgh about the close of the summer session and then visit some of the highland scene i be confident he would be please with the grand feature of nature in many part of this country : he will meet with many person here who respect he and some whom i be persuade he will think not unworthy of he esteem i wish he would make the experiment he sometimes crack he joke upon we but he will find that we can distinguish between the stab of malevolence and _ the rebuke of the righteous which be like excellent oil -lrb- 14 -rrb- and break not the head -lrb- 15 -rrb- _ offer my best compliment to he and assure he that i shall be happy to have the satisfaction of see he under my roof to dr beattie i write ` the chief intention of this letter be to inform you that i now seriously believe mr samuel johnson will visit scotland this year : but i wish that every power of attraction may be employ to secure we have so valuable a acquisition and therefore i hope you will without delay write to I what i know you think that i may read it to the mighty sage with proper emphasis before i leave london which i must do soon he talk of you with the same warmth that he do last year -lrb- 16 -rrb- we be to see as much of scotland as we can in the month of August and September we shall not be long of be at marischal college -lrb- 17 -rrb- he be particularly desirous of see some of the western island ' dr beattie do better : _ ipse venit _ he be however so polite as to wave he privilege of _ nil mihus rescriba -lrb- 18 -rrb- _ and write from edinburgh as follow : -- ` you very kind and agreeable favor of the 20th of April overtake I here yesterday after have go to aberdeen which place i leave about a week ago i be to set out this day for london and hope to have the honor of pay my respects to mr johnson and you about a week or ten day hence i shall then do what i can to enforce the topick you mention but at present i can not enter upon it as i be in a very great hurry for i intend to begin my journey within a hour or two ' he be as good as he word and throw some please motive into the northern scale but indeed mr johnson love all that he hear from one whom he tell we in he _ life of the poet _ gray find ' a poet a philosopher and a good man -lrb- 19 -rrb- ' my lord elibank do not answer my letter to he lordship for some time the reason will appear when we come to the isle of _ sky _ -lrb- 20 -rrb- i shall then insert my letter with letter from he lordship both to myself and mr johnson i beg it may be understand that i insert my own letter as i relate my own saying rather as key to what be valuable belong to other than for they own sake luckily mr justice -lrb- now sir robert -rrb- chamber -lrb- 21 -rrb- who be about to sail for the east-indy be go to take leave of he relation at newcastle and he conduct dr johnson to that town mr scott of university college oxford -lrb- now dr scott -lrb- 22 -rrb- of the common -rrb- accompany he from thence to edinburgh with such propitious convoy do he proceed to my native city but lest metaphor should make it be suppose he actually go by sea i choose to mention that he travel in post-chaise of which the rapid motion be one of he most favorite amusement -lrb- 23 -rrb- dr samuel johnson 's character religious moral political and literary nay he figure and manner be i believe more generally know than those of almost any man yet it may not be superfluous here to attempt a sketch of he let my reader then remember that he be a sincere and zealous christian of high church of england and monarchical principle which he would not tamely suffer to be question steady and inflexible in maintain the obligation of piety and virtue both from a regard to the order of society and from a veneration for the great source of all order correct nay stern in he taste hard to please and easily offend impetuous and irritable in he temper but of a most humane and benevolent heart have a mind store with a vast and various collection of learning and knowledge which he communicate with peculiar perspicuity and force in rich and choice expression he unite a most logical head with a most fertile imagination which give he a extraordinary advantage in argue for he could reason close or wide as he see best for the moment he could when he choose it be the greatest sophist that ever wield a weapon in the school of declamation but he indulge this only in conversation for he own he sometimes talk for victory -lrb- 24 -rrb- he be too conscientious to make error permanent and pernicious by deliberately write it he be conscious of he superiority he love praise when it be bring to he but be too proud to seek for it he be somewhat susceptible of flattery -lrb- 25 -rrb- he mind be so full of imagery that he might have be perpetually a poet it have be often remark that in he poetical piece which it be to be regret be so few because so excellent he style be easier than in he prose there be deception in this : it be not easier but better suit to the dignity of verse as one may dance with grace whose motion in ordinary walking in the common step be awkward he have a constitutional melancholy the cloud of which darken the brightness of he fancy and give a gloomy cast to he whole course of thinking : yet though grave and awful in he deportment when he think it necessary or proper he frequently indulge himself in pleasantry and sportive sally he be prone to superstition but not to credulity though he imagination might incline he to a belief of the marvellous and the mysterious he vigorous reason examine the evidence with jealousy he have a loud voice and a slow deliberate utterance which no doubt give some additional weight to the sterling metal of he conversation -lrb- 26 -rrb- he person be large robust i may say approach to the gigantick and grow unwieldy from corpulency he countenance be naturally of the cast of a ancient statue but somewhat disfigured by the scar of that _ evil _ which it be formerly imagine the _ royal touch _ -lrb- 27 -rrb- could cure he be now in he sixty-fourth year and be become a little dull of hear he sight have always be somewhat weak yet so much do mind govern and even supply the deficiency of organ that he perception be uncommonly quick and accurate -lrb- 28 -rrb- he head and sometimes also he body shake with a kind of motion like the effect of a palsy : he appear to be frequently disturb by cramp or convulsive contraction -lrb- 29 -rrb- of the nature of that distemper call _ st vitus 's dance _ he wear a full suit of plain brown clothes with twisted hair-button -lrb- 30 -rrb- of the same color a large bushy greyish wig a plain shirt black worsted stocking and silver buckle upon this tour when journey he wear boot and a very wide brown cloth great coat with pocket which might have almost hold the two volume of he folio _ dictionary _ and he carry in he hand a large english oak stick let I not be censure for mention such minute particulars every thing relative to so great a man be worth observe i remember dr adam smith in he rhetorical lecture at glasgow -lrb- 31 -rrb- tell we he be glad to know that milton wear latchet in he shoe instead of buckle when i mention the oak stick it be but let _ hercule _ have he club and by-and-by my reader will find this stick will bud and produce a good joke -lrb- 32 -rrb- this imperfect sketch of ` the combination and the _ form _ -lrb- 33 -rrb- ' of that wonderful man whom i venerated and love while in this world and after whom i gaze with humble hope now that it have please almighty god to call he to a better world will serve to introduce to the fancy of my reader the capital object of the follow journal in the course of which i trust they will attain to a considerable degree of acquaintance with he he prejudice against scotland -lrb- 34 -rrb- be announce almost as soon as he begin to appear in the world of letter in he _ london _ a poem be the follow nervous line : -- ` for who would leave unbrib would hibernia 's land or change the rock of scotland for the strand there none be sweep by sudden fate away but all whom hunger spare with age decay ' the truth be like the ancient greek and roman he allow himself to look upon all nation but he own as barbarian -lrb- 35 -rrb- : not only hibernium and scotland but spain italy and france be attack in the same poem if he be particularly prejudice against the scot it be because they be more in he way because he think they success in england rather exceed the due proportion of they real merit and because he could not but see in they that nationality which i believe no liberal-minded scotsman will deny he be indeed if i may be allow the phrase at bottom much of a _ john bull _ -lrb- 36 -rrb- much of a blunt _ true bear englishman _ -lrb- 37 -rrb- there be a stratum of common clay under the rock of marble he be voraciously fond of good eating -lrb- 38 -rrb- and he have a great deal of that quality call _ humor _ which give a oiliness and a gloss to every other quality i be i flatter myself completely a citizen of the world -- in my travels through holland germany switzerland italy corsica france i never feel myself from home and i sincerely love ` every kindred and tongue and people and nation -lrb- 39 -rrb- ' i subscribe to what my late truly learn and philosophical friend mr crosbie -lrb- 40 -rrb- say that the english be better animal than the scot they be nearer the sun they blood be richer and more mellow : but when i humor any of they in a outrageous contempt of scotland i fairly own i treat they as child and thus i have at some moment find myself oblige to treat even dr johnson to scotland however he venture and he return from it in great good humor with he prejudice much lessen and with very grateful feeling of the hospitality with which he be treat as be evident from that admirable work he _ journey to the western island of scotland _ which to my utter astonishment have be misapprehend even to rancor by many of my countryman to have the company of chamber and scott he delay he journey so long that the court of session which rise on the eleventh of August be break up before he get to edinburgh -lrb- 41 -rrb- on Saturday the fourteenth of August 1773 late in the evening i receive a note from he that he be arrive at boyd 's inn -lrb- 42 -rrb- at the head of the canongate i go to he directly he embrace I cordially and i exulted in the thought that i now have he actually in caledonium mr scott 's amiable manners and attachment to we _ socrate _ at once unite I to he he tell I that before i come in the doctor have unluckily have a bad specimen of scottish cleanliness -lrb- 43 -rrb- he then drink no fermented liquor he ask to have he lemonade make sweeter upon which the waiter with he greasy finger lift a lump of sugar and put it into it the doctor in indignation throw it out of the window scott say he be afraid he would have knock the waiter down mr johnson tell I that such another trick be play he at the house of a lady in pari -lrb- 44 -rrb- he be to do I the honor to lodge under my roof i regret sincerely that i have not also a room for mr scott mr johnson and i walk arm-in-arm up the high = street to my house in jame 's court -lrb- 45 -rrb- : it be a dusky night : i could not prevent he be assail by the evening effluvium of edinburgh i hear a late baronet of some distinction in the political world in the beginning of the present reign observe that ` walk the street of edinburgh at night be pretty perilous and a good deal odoriferous ' the peril be much abate by the care which the magistrate have take to enforce the city law against throw foul water from the window -lrb- 46 -rrb- but from the structure of the house in the old town which consist of many story in each of which a different family life and there be no covered sewer the ordor still continue a zealous scotsman would have wish mr johnson to be without one of he five sens upon this occasion as we march slowly along he grumble in my ear ' i smell you in the dark -lrb- 47 -rrb- ' but he acknowledge that the breadth of the street and the loftiness of the building on each side make a noble appearance -lrb- 48 -rrb- my wife have tea ready for he which it be well know he delighted to drink at all hour particularly when sit up late and of which he able defense against mr jona hanway -lrb- 49 -rrb- should have obtain he a magnificent reward from the east-india company he shew much complacency upon find that the mistress of the house be so attentive to he singular habit and as no man could be more polite when he choose to be so he address to she be most courteous and engaging and he conversation soon charm she into a forgetfulness of he external appearance -lrb- 50 -rrb- i do not begin to keep a regular full journal till some day after we have set out from edinburgh but i have luckily preserve a good many fragment of he _ memorabilia _ from he very first evening in scotland we have a little before this have a trial for murder in which the judge have allow the lapse of twenty year since its commission as a plea in bar in conformity with the doctrine of prescription in the _ civil _ law which scotland and several other country in europe have adopt he at first disapprove of this but then he think there be something in it if there have be for twenty year a neglect to prosecute a crime which be _ know _ he would not allow that a murder by not be _ discover _ for twenty year should escape punishment -lrb- 51 -rrb- we talk of the ancient trial by duel he do not think it so absurd as be generally suppose ` for -lrb- say he -rrb- it be only allow when the question be _ in equilibrio _ as when one affirm and another deny and they have a notion that providence would interfere in favor of he who be in the right but as it be find that in a duel he who be in the right have not a better chance than he who be in the wrong therefore society institute the present mode of trial and give the advantage to he who be in the right ' we sit till near two in the morning have chat a good while after my wife leave we she have insist that to shew all respect to the sage she would give up she own bed-chamber to he and take a worse -lrb- 52 -rrb- this i can not but gratefully mention as one of a thousand obligation which i owe she since the great obligation of she be please to accept of I as she husband -lrb- 53 -rrb- Sunday August 15 -lrb- 54 -rrb- mr scott come to breakfast at which i introduce to dr johnson and he my friend sir william forbe now of pitsligo -lrb- 55 -rrb- a man of whom too much good can not be say who with distinguish ability and application in he profession of a banker be at once a good companion and a good christian which i think be say enough yet it be but justice to record that once when he be in a dangerous illness he be watch with the anxious apprehension of a general calamity day and night he house be beset with affectionate enquiry and upon he recovery _ te deum _ be the universal chorus from the _ heart _ of he countryman mr johnson be please with my daughter veronica -lrb- 56 -rrb- then a child of about four month old she have the appearance of listen to he he motion seem to she to be intend for she amusement and when he stop she flutter and make a little infantine noise and a kind of signal for he to begin again she would be hold close to he which be a proof from simple nature that he figure be not horrid she fondness for he endear she still more to I and i declare she should have five hundred pound of additional fortune -lrb- 57 -rrb- we talk of the practice of the law sir william forbe say he think a honest lawyer should never undertake a cause which he be satisfy be not a just one ` sir -lrb- say mr johnson -rrb- a lawyer have no business with the justice or injustice of the cause which he undertake unless he client ask he opinion and then he be bind to give it honestly the justice or injustice of the cause be to be decide by the judge consider sir what be the purpose of court of justice it be that every man may have he cause fairly try by man appoint to try cause a lawyer be not to tell what he know to be a lie : he be not to produce what he know to be a false deed but he be not to usurp the province of the jury and of the judge and determine what shall be the effect of evidence -- what shall be the result of legal argument as it rarely happen that a man be fit to plead he own cause lawyer be a class of the community who by study and experience have acquire the art and power of arrange evidence and of apply to the point at issue what the law have settle a lawyer be to do for he client all that he client might fairly do for himself if he could if by a superiority of attention of knowledge of skill and a better method of communication he have the advantage of he adversary it be a advantage to which he be entitle there must always be some advantage on one side or other and it be better that advantage should be have by talent than by chance lawyer be to undertake no cause till they be sure they be just a man might be precluded altogether from a trial of he claim though be it judicially examine it might be find a very just claim -lrb- 58 -rrb- ' this be sound practical doctrine and rationally repress a too refined scrupulosity -lrb- 59 -rrb- of conscience emigration be at this time a common topick of discourse -lrb- 60 -rrb- dr johnson regret it as hurtful to human happiness : ` for -lrb- say he -rrb- it spread mankind which weaken the defense of a nation and lessen the comfort of live man thinly scatter make a shift but a bad shift without many thing a smith be ten mile off : they 'll do without a nail or a staple a taylor be far from they : they 'll botch they own clothes it be be concentrate which produce high convenience -lrb- 61 -rrb- ' sir william forbe mr scott and i accompany mr johnson to the

earth be glad -lrb- 63 -rrb- ' i be sorry to think mr johnson do not attend to the sermon mr carre 's low voice not be strong enough to reach he hear a selection of mr carre 's sermon have since he death be publish by sir william forbe -lrb- 64 -rrb- and the world have acknowledge they uncommon merit i be well assure lord mansfield have pronounce they to be excellent here i obtain a promise from lord chief baron orde -lrb- 65 -rrb- that he would dine at my house next day i present mr johnson to he lordship who politely say to he i have not the honor of know you but i hope for it and to see you at my house i be to wait on you to-morrow ' this respectable english judge will be long remembered in scotland where he build a elegant house and live in it magnificently he own ample fortune with the addition of he salary enable he to be splendidly hospitable it may be fortunate for a individual amongst ourselves to be lord chief baron and a most worthy man now have the office but in my opinion it be better for scotland in general that some of we publick employment should be fill by gentleman of distinction from the south side of the tweed as we have the benefit of promotion in england such a interchange would make a beneficial mixture of manners and render we union more complete lord chief baron orde be on good term with we all in a narrow country fill with jarring interest and keen party and though i well know he opinion to be the same with my own he keep himself aloof at a very critical period indeed when the _ dougla cause _ shake the sacred security of _ birthright _ in scotland to its foundation a cause which have it happen before the union when there be no appeal to a british house of lord would have leave the great fortress of honor and of property in ruin -lrb- 66 -rrb- when we get home dr johnson desire to see my book he take down ogden 's _ sermon on prayer _ -lrb- 67 -rrb- on which i set a very high value have be much edify by they and he retire with they to he room he do not stay long but soon join we in the draw room i present to he mr robert arbuthnot a relation of the celebrated dr arbuthnot -lrb- 68 -rrb- and a man of literature and taste to he we be oblige for a previous recommendation which secure we a very agreeable reception at st andrew and which dr johnson in he _ journey _ ascribe to ` some invisible friend -lrb- 69 -rrb- ' of dr beattie mr johnson say ` sir he have write like a man conscious of the truth and feel he own strength -lrb- 70 -rrb- treat you adversary with respect be give he a advantage to which he be not entitle -lrb- 71 -rrb- the greatest part of man can not judge of reasoning and be impress by character so that if you allow you adversary a respectable character they will think that though you differ from he you may be in the wrong sir treat you adversary with respect be striking soft in a battle and as to hume -- a man who have so much conceit as to tell all mankind that they have be bubble -lrb- 72 -rrb- for age and he be the wise man who see better than they -- a man who have so little scrupulosity as to venture to oppose those principle which have be think necessary to human happiness -- be he to be surprize if another man come and laugh at he if he be the great man he think himself all this can not hurt he : it be like throw pea against a rock ' he add ' _ something much too rough _ ' both as to mr hume 's head and heart which i suppress violence be in my opinion not suitable to the christian cause besides i always live on good term with mr hume though i have frankly tell he i be not clear that it be right in I to keep company with he ` but -lrb- say i -rrb- how much better be you than you book ' he be cheerful obliging and instructive he be charitable to the poor and many a agreeable hour have i pass with he -lrb- 73 -rrb- : i have preserve some entertaining and interesting memoirs of he particularly when he know himself to be die which i may some time or other communicate to the world -lrb- 74 -rrb- i shall not however extol he so very highly as dr adam smith do who say in a letter to mr strahan the printer -lrb- not a confidential letter to he friend but a letter which be publish -lrb- 75 -rrb- with all formality : -rrb- ` upon the whole i have always consider he both in he life time and since he death as approach as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit ' let dr smith consider : be not mr hume blest with good health good spirit good friend a competent and increase fortune and have he not also a perpetual feast of fame -lrb- 76 -rrb- but as a learn friend have observe to I ` what trial do he undergo to prove the perfection of he virtue do he ever experience any great instance of adversity ' -- when i read this sentence deliver by my old _ professor of moral philosophy _ i could not help exclaim with the _ psalmist _ ` surely i have now more understanding than my teacher -lrb- 77 -rrb- ' while we be talk there come a note to I from dr william robertson ` dear sir ' i have be expect every day to hear from you of dr johnson 's arrival pray what do you know about he motion i long to take he by the hand i write this from the college where i have only this scrap of paper ever yours ' w r ' ` Sunday ' it pleased I to find dr robertson thus eager to meet dr johnson i be glad i could answer that he be come : and i begged dr robertson might be with we as soon as he could sir william forbe mr scott mr arbuthnot and another gentleman dine with we ` come dr johnson -lrb- say i -rrb- it be commonly think that we veal in scotland be not good but here be some which i believe you will like ' there be no catch he johnson ` why sir what be commonly think i should take to be true _ you _ veal may be good but that will only be a exception to the general opinion not a proof against it ' dr robertson accord to the custom of edinburgh at that time dine in the interval between the forenoon and afternoon service which be then later than now so we have not the pleasure of he company till dinner be over when he come and drink wine with we and then begin some animated dialogue -lrb- 78 -rrb- of which here follow a pretty full note we talk of mr burke dr johnson say he have great variety of knowledge store of imagery copiousness of language robertson ` he have wit too ' johnson ` no sir he never succeed there ` tis low ` tis conceit i use to say burke never once make a good joke -lrb- 79 -rrb- what i most envy burke for be he be constantly the same he be never what we call hum-drum never unwilling to begin to talk nor in haste to leave off ' boswell ` yet he can listen ' johnson ` no : i can not say he be good at that -lrb- 80 -rrb- so desirous be he to talk that if one be speak at this end of the table he 'll speak to somebody at the other end burke sir be such a man that if you meet he for the first time in the street where you be stop by a drive of ox and you and he step aside to take shelter but for five minute he would talk to you in such a manner that when you part you would say this be a extraordinary man -lrb- 81 -rrb- now you may be long enough with I without find any thing extraordinary ' he say he believe burke be intend for the law but either have not money enough to follow it or have not diligence enough -lrb- 82 -rrb- he say he could not understand how a man could apply to one thing and not to another robertson say one man have more judgment another more imagination johnson ` no sir it be only one man have more mind than another he may direct it differently he may by accident see the success of one kind of study and take a desire to excel in it i be persuade that have sir isaac newton apply to poetry he would have make a very fine epick poem i could as easily apply to law as to tragick poetry ' boswell ` yet sir you do apply to tragick poetry not to law ' johnson ` because sir i have not money to study law sir the man who have vigor may walk to the east just as well as to the west if he happen to turn he head that way -lrb- 83 -rrb- ' boswell ` but sir ` tis like walk up and down a hill one man will naturally do the one better than the other a hare will run up a hill best from she fore-leg be short a dog down ' johnson ` nay sir that be from mechanical power if you make mind mechanical you may argue in that manner one mind be a vice and hold fast there be a good memory another be a file and he be a disputant a controversialist another be a razor and he be sarcastical ' we talk of whitefield he say he be at the same college with he -lrb- 84 -rrb- and know he _ before he begin to be better than other people _ -lrb- smile -rrb- that he believe he sincerely mean well but have a mixture of politick and ostentation : whereas wesley thought of religion only -lrb- 85 -rrb- robertson say whitefield have strong natural eloquence which if cultivate would have do great thing johnson ` why sir i take it he be at the height of what he ability could do and be sensible of it he have the ordinary advantage of education but he choose to pursue that oratory which be for the mob -lrb- 86 -rrb- ' boswell ` he have great effect on the passion ' johnson ` why sir i do not think so he could not represent a succession of pathetic image he vociferate and make a impression _ there _ again be a mind like a hammer ' dr johnson now say a certain eminent political friend of we 's -lrb- 87 -rrb- be wrong in he maxim of stick to a certain set of _ man _ on all occasion ' i can see that a man may do right to stick to a _ party _ -lrb- say he -rrb- that be to say he be a _ whig _ or he be a _ tory _ and he think one of those party upon the whole the best and that to make it prevail it must be generally support though in particulars it may be wrong he take its faggot of principle in which there be fewer rotten stick than in the other though some rotten stick to be sure and they can not well be separate but to bind one 's self to one man or one set of man -lrb- who may be right to-day and wrong to-morrow -rrb- without any general preference of system i must disapprove -lrb- 88 -rrb- ' he tell we of cooke who translate hesiod and live twenty year on a translation of plautus for which he be always take subscription and that he present foote to a club in the follow singular manner : ` this be the nephew of the gentleman who be lately hang in chain for murder he brother -lrb- 89 -rrb- ' in the evening i introduce to mr johnson -lrb- 90 -rrb- two good friend of mine mr william nairne advocate and mr hamilton of sundrum my neighbor in the country both of whom sup with we i have preserve nothing of what pass except that dr johnson display another of he heterodox opinion -- a contempt of tragick acting -lrb- 91 -rrb- he say ` the action of all player in tragedy be bad it should be a man 's study to repress those sign of emotion and passion as they be call ' he be of a directly contrary opinion to that of fielding in he _ tom jone _ who make partridge say of garrick ` why i could act as well as he myself i be sure if i have see a ghost i should have look in the very same manner and do just as he do -lrb- 92 -rrb- ' for when i ask he ` would you not sir start as mr garrick do if you see a ghost ' he answer ' i hope not if i do i should frighten the ghost ' Monday August 16 dr william robertson come to breakfast we talk of _ ogden on prayer _ dr johnson say ` the same argument which be use against god 's hearing prayer will serve against he rewarding good and punish evil he have resolve he have declare in the former case as in the latter ' he have last night look into lord haile 's _ remark on the history of scotland _ dr robertson and i say it be a pity lord haile do not write greater thing he lordship have not then publish he _ annals of scotland _ -lrb- 93 -rrb- johnson ' i remember i be once on a visit at the house of a lady for whom i have a high respect there be a good deal of company in the room when they be go i say to this lady what foolish talking have we have yes -lrb- say she -rrb- but while they talk you say nothing i be strike with the reproof how much better be the man who do anything that be innocent than he who do nothing besides i love anecdote -lrb- 94 -rrb- i fancy mankind may come in time to write all aphoristically except in narrative grow weary of preparation and connection and illustration and all those art by which a big book be make if a man be to wait till he weave anecdote into a system we may be long in get they and get but few in comparison of what we might get dr robertson say the notion of _ eupham macallan _ a fanatick woman of whom lord haile give a sketch be still prevalent among some of the presbyterian and therefore it be right in lord haile a man of known piety to undeceive they -lrb- 95 -rrb- we walk out -lrb- 96 -rrb- that dr johnson might see some of the thing which we have to shew at edinburgh we go to the parliament-house -lrb- 97 -rrb- where the parliament of scotland sit and where the _ ordinary lord _ of session hold they court and to the new session-house adjoining to it where we court of fifteen -lrb- the fourteen _ ordinary _ with the lord president at they head -rrb- sit as a court of review we go to the _ advocate library _ -lrb- 98 -rrb- of which dr johnson take a cursory view and then to what be call the _ laigh _ -lrb- 99 -rrb- -lrb- or under -rrb- parliament-house where the record of scotland which have a universal security by register be deposit till the great register office be finish i be please to behold dr samuel johnson roll about in this old magazine of antiquity there be by this time a pretty numerous circle of we attend upon he somebody talk of happy moment for composition and how a man can write at one time and not at another ` nay -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- a man may write at any time if he will set himself _ doggedly _ -lrb- 100 -rrb- to it ' i here begin to indulge _ old scottish _ -lrb- 101 -rrb- sentiment and to express a warm regret that by we union with _ england _ we be no more -- we independent kingdom be lose -lrb- 102 -rrb- johnson ` sir never talk of you independency who could let you queen remain twenty year in captivity and then be put to death without even a pretence of justice without you ever attempt to rescue she and such a queen too as every man of any gallantry of spirit would have sacrifice he life for -lrb- 103 -rrb- ' worthy mr jame kerr keeper of the record ` half we nation be bribe by english money ' johnson ` sir that be no defense : that make you worse ' good mr brown keeper of the advocate ' library ` we have better say nothing about it ' boswell ` you would have be glad however to have have we last war sir to fight you battle ' johnson ` we should have have you for the same price though there have be no union as we might have have swiss or other troops no no i shall agree to a separation you have only to _ go home _ ' just as he have say this i to divert the subject shew he the sign assurance of the three successive king of the hanover family to maintain the presbyterian establishment in scotland ` we 'll give you that -lrb- say he -rrb- into the bargain ' we next go to the great church of st gile which have lose its original magnificence in the inside by be divide into four place of presbyterian worship -lrb- 104 -rrb- ` come -lrb- say dr johnson jocularly to principal robertson -lrb- 105 -rrb- -rrb- let I see what be once a church ' we enter that division which be formerly call the _ new church _ and of late the _ high church _ so well know by the eloquence of dr hugh blair it be now very elegantly fit up but it be then shamefully dirty -lrb- 106 -rrb- dr johnson say nothing at the time but when we come to the great door of the royal infirmary where upon a board be this inscription ' _ clean you foot _ ' he turn about slyly and say ` there be no occasion for put this at the door of you church ' we then conduct he down the post-house stair parliament-close and make he look up from the cow-gate to the highest building in edinburgh -lrb- from which he have just descend -rrb- be thirteen floor or story from the ground upon the back elevation the front wall be build upon the edge of the hill and the back wall rise from the bottom of the hill several story before it come to a level with the front wall we proceed to the college with the principal at we head dr adam fergusson whose _ essay on the history of civil society -lrb- 107 -rrb- _ give he a respectable place in the rank of literature be with we as the college building -lrb- 108 -rrb- be indeed very mean the principal say to dr johnson that he must give they the same epithet that a jesuit do when shew a poor college abroad : ' _ hae miseriae nostrae _ ' dr johnson be however much pleased with the library and with the conversation of dr jame robertson professor of oriental language the librarian we talk of kennicot 's edition of the hebrew bible -lrb- 109 -rrb- and hope it would be quite faithful johnson ` sir i know not any crime so great that a man could contrive to commit as poisoning the source of eternal truth ' i point out to he where there formerly stand a old wall enclose part of the college which i remember bulge out in a threatening manner and of which there be a common tradition similar to that concern _ bacon 's _ study at oxford that it would fall upon some very learn man -lrb- 110 -rrb- it have some time before this be take down that the street might be widen and a more convenient wall build dr johnson glad of a opportunity to have a pleasant hit at scottish learning say ` they have be afraid it never would fall ' we shew he the royal infirmary for which and for every other exertion of generous publick spirit in he power that noble-minded citizen of edinburgh george drummond will be ever hold in honorable remembrance and we be too proud not to carry he to the abbey of holyrood-house that beautiful piece of architecture but alas that desert mansion of royalty which hamilton of bangor in one of he elegant poem call ' a virtuous palace where no monarch dwell -lrb- 111 -rrb- ' i be much entertain while principal robertson fluently harangue to dr johnson upon the spot concern scene of he celebrated _ history of scotland _ we survey that part of the palace appropriate to the duke of hamilton as keeper in which we beautiful queen mary live and in which david rizzio be murder and also the state room dr johnson be a great reciter of all sort of thing serious or comical i overhear he repeat here in a kind of mutter tone a line of the old ballad _ johnny armstrong 's last good night _ : ` and run he through the fair body

114 -rrb- advocate before dinner he tell we of a curious conversation between the famous george faulkner -lrb- 115 -rrb- and he george say that england have drain ireland of fifty thousand pound in specie annually for fifty year ` how so sir -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- you must have a very great trade ' ` no trade ' ` very rich mine ' ` no mine ' ` from whence then do all this money come ' ` come why out of the blood and bowels of the poor people of ireland ' he seem to I to have a unaccountable prejudice against swift -lrb- 116 -rrb- for i once take the liberty to ask he if swift have personally offend he and he tell I he have not he say to-day ` swift be clear but he be shallow in coarse humor he be inferior to arbuthnot -lrb- 117 -rrb- in delicate humor he be inferior to addison so he be inferior to he contemporary without put he against the whole world i doubt if the _ tale of a tub _ be he -lrb- 118 -rrb- : it have so much more think more knowledge more power more color

then we deputy commander in chief who be not only a excellent officer but one of the most universal scholar i ever know have learn the erse language and express he belief in the authenticity of ossian 's poetry -lrb- 120 -rrb- dr johnson take the opposite side of that perplexed question and i be afraid the dispute would have run high between they but sir adolphus who have a very sweet temper change the discourse grow playful laugh at lord monboddo 's -lrb- 121 -rrb- notion of man have tail and call he a judge _ à posteriorus _ which amuse dr johnson and thus hostility be prevent at supper -lrb-

spirit counteract the deity and raise storm for instance to destroy he creature johnson ` why sir if moral evil be consistent with the government of the deity why may not physical evil be also consistent with it it be not more strange that there should be evil spirit than evil man : evil unembodied spirit than evil embody spirit and as to storm we know there be such thing and it be no worse that evil spirit raise they than that they rise ' crosbie ` but it be not credible that witch should have effect what they be say in story to have do ' johnson ` sir i be not defend they credibility i be only say that you argument be not good and will not overturn the belief of witchcraft -- -lrb- dr fergusson say to I aside ` he be right ' -rrb- -- and then sir you have all mankind rude and civilized agree in the belief of the agency of preternatural power you must take evidence : you must consider that wise and great man have condemn witch to die -lrb- 124 -rrb- ' crosbie ` but a act of parliament put a end to witchcraft -lrb- 125 -rrb- ' johnson ` no sir witchcraft have cease and therefore a act of parliament be pass to prevent persecution for what be not witchcraft why it cease we can not tell as we can not tell the reason of many other thing ' -- dr cullen to keep up the gratification of mysterious disquisition with the grave address for which he be remarkable in he

monboddo 's thinking that he might be teach to speak dr johnson treat this with ridicule mr crosbie say that lord monboddo believe the existence of every thing possible in short that all which be in _ posse _ might be find in _ esse _ johnson ` but sir it be as possible that the _ ouran-outang _ do not speak as that he speak however i shall not contest the point i should have think it not possible to find a monboddo yet _ he _ exist ' i again mention the stage johnson ` the appearance of a player with whom i have drunk tea counteract the imagination that he be the character he represent nay you

you ' blacklock seem to be much surprize when dr johnson say ` it be easier to he to write poetry than to compose he _ dictionary _ -lrb- 128 -rrb- he mind be less on the stretch in do the one than the other besides compose a _ dictionary _ require book and a desk : you can make a poem walk in the field or lie in bed dr blacklock speak of scepticism in moral and religion with apparent uneasiness as if he wish for more certainty -lrb- 129 -rrb- dr johnson who have think it all over and whose vigorous understanding be fortify by much experience thus encourage the blind bard to apply to higher speculation what we all willingly submit to in common life : in short he give he more familiarly the able and fair reasoning of butler 's _ analogy _ : ` why sir the greatest concern we have in this world the choice of we profession must be determine without demonstrative reasoning human life be not yet so well know as that we can have it and take the case of a man who be ill i call two physician

the supposition of a eternal necessity without design without a govern mind johnson ` if it be so why have it cease why do not we see man thus produce around we now why at least do it not keep pace in

deceased person without a regular title which formerly be understand to subject the intermeddler to payment of all the defunct 's debt the principle have of late be relax dr johnson 's argument be for a renewal of its strictness the paper be print with addition by I and give into the court of session lord haile know dr johnson 's part not to be mine and point out exactly where it begin and where it end dr johnson say ` it be much now that he lordship can distinguish so ' in dr johnson 's _ vanity of human wish _ there be the following passage : -- ` the teem mother anxious for she race beg for each birth the fortune of a face : yet _ vane _ could tell what ill from beauty spring and _ sedley _ cur have the charm which plea have a king -lrb- 137 -rrb- ' lord haile tell he he be mistake in the instance he have give of unfortunate fair one for neither _ vane _ nor _ sedley _ have a title to that description he lordship have since be so oblige as to send I a note of this for the communication of which i be sure my reader will thank I ` the line in the tenth satire of juvenal accord to my alteration should have run thus : -- ` yet _ shore _ -lrb- 138 -rrb- could tell ----- and _ valiere _ -lrb- 139 -rrb- cur would ------_VB ' ` the first be a penitent by compulsion the second by sentiment though the truth be mademoiselle de la valiere throw herself -lrb- but still from

-lrb- 141 -rrb- ' mr maclaurin 's learning and talent enable he to do he part very well in dr johnson 's company he produce two epitaph upon he father the celebrated mathematician -lrb- 142 -rrb- one be in english of which dr johnson do not change one word in the other which be in latin he make several alteration in place of the very word of _ virgil _ ' _ ubus luctus et pavor et plurima mortis imago _ -lrb- 143 -rrb- ' he write ' _ ubus luctus regnant et pavor _ ' he introduce the word _ prorsus _ into the line ' _ mortalibus prorsus non absit solatium _ ' and after ' _ hujus enim scripta evolve _ ' he add ' _ mentemque tantarum rerum capacem corporus caduco superstitem crede _ ' which be quite applicable to dr johnson himself -lrb- 144 -rrb- mr murray advocate who marry a niece of lord mansfield 's and be now one of the judge of scotland by the title of lord _ henderland _ sit with we a part of the evening but do not venture to say any thing that i remember though he be certainly possess of talent which would have enable he to have shewn himself to advantage if too great anxiety have not prevent he at supper we have dr alexander webster who though not learn have such a knowledge of mankind such a fund of information and entertainment so clear a head and such accommodate manners that dr johnson find he a very agreeable companion when dr johnson and i be leave by ourselves i read to he my note of the opinion of we judge upon the question of literary property -lrb- 145 -rrb- he do not like they and say ` they make I think of you judge not with that respect which i should wish to do ' to the argument of one of they that there can be no property in blasphemy or nonsense he answer ` then you rotten sheep be mine by that rule when a man 's house fall into decay he must lose it ' i mention a argument of mine that literary performance be not tax as _ churchill _ say ` no statesman yet have think it worth he pain to tax we labor or excise we brain -lrb- 146 -rrb- ' and therefore they be not property ` yet -lrb- say he -rrb- we hang a man for steal a horse and horse be not tax ' mr pitt have since put a end to that argument -lrb- 147 -rrb- Wednesday August 18 on this day we set out from edinburgh we should gladly have have mr scott to go with we but he be oblige to return to england -- i have give a sketch of dr johnson : my reader may wish to know a little of he fellow traveller -lrb- 148 -rrb- think then of a gentleman of ancient blood the pride of which be he predominant passion he be then in he thirty-third year and have be about four year happily marry he inclination be to be a soldier -lrb- 149 -rrb- but he father a respectable -lrb- 150 -rrb- judge have press he into the profession of the law he have travel a good deal and see many variety of human life he have think more than any body suppose and have a pretty good stock of general learning and knowledge -lrb- 151 -rrb- he have all dr johnson 's principle with some degree of relaxation he have rather too little than too much prudence and he imagination be lively he often say thing of which the effect be very different from the intention -lrb- 152 -rrb- he resemble sometimes ` the best good man with the worst natur would muse -lrb- 153 -rrb- ' he can not deny himself the vanity of finish with the encomium of dr johnson whose friendly partiality to the companion of he tour represent he as one ` whose acuteness would help my enquiry and whose gaiety of conversation and civility of manners be sufficient to counteract the inconvenience of travel in country less hospitable than we have pass -lrb- 154 -rrb- ' dr johnson think it unnecessary to put himself to the additional expence of bring with he franci barber he faithful black servant so we be attend only by my man joseph ritter a bohemian a fine stately fellow above six foot high who have be over a great part of europe and speak many language he be the best servant i ever see let not my reader disdain he introduction for dr johnson give he this character : ` sir he be a civil man and a wise man -lrb- 155 -rrb- ' from a erroneous apprehension of violence dr johnson have provide a pair of pistol some gunpowder and a quantity of bullet : but upon be assure we should run no risk of meet any robber he leave he arm and ammunition in a open drawer of which he give my wife the charge he also leave in that drawer one volume of a pretty full and curious diary of he life of which i have a few fragment but the book have be destroy i wish female curiosity have be strong enough to have have it all transcribe which might easily have be do and i should think the theft be _ pro bono publico _ might have be forgive but i may be wrong my wife tell I she never once look into it -lrb- 156 -rrb- -- she do not seem quite easy when we leave she : but away we go mr nairne advocate be to go with we as far as st andrew it give I pleasure that by mention he _ name _ i connect he title to the just and handsome compliment pay he by dr johnson in he book : ' a gentleman who could stay with we only long enough to make we know how much we lose by he leave we -lrb- 157 -rrb- ` when we come to leith i talk with perhaps too boast a air how pretty the frith of forth look as indeed after the prospect from constantinople of which i have be tell and that from naple which i have see i believe the view of that frith and its environs from the castle-hill of edinburgh be the finest prospect in europe ` ay -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- that be the state of the world water be the same every where una est injusti caerula forma maris -lrb- 158 -rrb- ' i tell he the port here be the mouth of the river or water of _ leith _ ` not _ lethe _ say mr nairne ` why sir -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- when a scotchman set out from this port for england he forget he native country ' nairne ' i hope sir you will forget england here ' johnson ` then ` twill still be more _ lethe _ ' he observe of the pier or quay ` you have no occasion for so large a one : you trade do not require it : but you be like a shopkeeper who take a shop not only for what he have to put in it but that it may be believe he have a great deal to put into it ' it be very true that there be now comparatively little trade upon the eastern coast of scotland the riches of glasgow shew how much there be in the west and perhaps we shall find trade travel westward on a great scale as well as a small we talk of a man 's drown himself johnson ' i should never think it time to make away with myself ' i put the case of eustace budgell -lrb- 159 -rrb- who be accuse of forge a will and sink himself in the thame before the trial of its authenticity come on ` suppose sir -lrb- say i -rrb- that a man be absolutely sure that if he live a few day longer he shall be detect in a fraud the consequence of which will be utter disgrace and expulsion from society ' johnson ` then sir let he go abroad to a distant country let he go to some place where he be _ not _ know do not let he go to the devil where he _ be _ know ' he then say ' i see a number of people bare-footed here : i suppose you all go so before the union boswell you ancestor go so when they have as much land as you family have now yet _ auchinleck _ be the _ field of stone _ : there would be bad go bare-footed there the _ laird _ however do it ' i buy some _ spelding _ fish -lrb- generally whiting -rrb- salt and dry in a particular manner be dip in the sea and dry in the sun and eat by the scot by way of a relish he have never see they though they be sell in london i insist on _ scottify _ -lrb- 160 -rrb- he palate but he be very reluctant with difficulty i prevail with he to let a bit of one of they lie in he mouth he do not like it in cross the frith dr johnson determine that we should land upon inch keith -lrb- 161 -rrb- on approach it we first observe a high rocky shore we coast about and put into a little bay on the north-west we clamber up a very steep ascent on which be very good grass but rather a profusion of thistle there be sixteen head of black cattle grazing upon the island lord haile observe to I that brantome call it _ l'isle des chevaux _ and that it be probably ' a _ safer _ stable ' than many other in he time the fort -lrb- 162 -rrb- with a inscription on it _ marium re _ 1564 be strongly build dr johnson examine it with much attention he stalk like a giant among the luxuriant thistle and nettle there be three well in the island but we could not find one in the fort there must probably have be one though now fill up as a garrison could not subsist without it but i have dwell too long on this little spot dr johnson afterwards bid I try to write a description of we discover inch keith in the usual style of traveller describe fully every particular state the grounds on which we conclude that it must have once be inhabit and introduce many sage reflection and we should see how a thing might be cover in word so as to induce people to come and survey it all that be tell might be true and yet in reality there might be nothing to see he say ` i would have this island i would build a house make a good landing-place have a garden and vine and all sort of tree a rich man of a hospitable turn here would have many visitor from edinburgh ' when we get into we boat again he call to I ` come now pay a classical compliment to the island on quit it ' i happen luckily in allusion to the beautiful queen mary whose name be upon the fort to think of what virgil make aenea say on have leave the country of he charming dido ` invitus regina tuo de littore cessus -lrb- 163 -rrb- ' ` very well hit off ' say he we dine at kinghorn and then get into a post-chaise -lrb- 164 -rrb- mr nairne and he servant and joseph ride by we we stop at cupar and drink tea we talk of parliament and i say i suppose very few of the member know much of what be go on as indeed very few gentleman know much of they own private affair johnson ` why sir if a man be not of a sluggish mind he may be he own steward if he will look into he affair he will soon learn -lrb- 165 -rrb- so it be as to publick affair there must always be a certain number of man of business in parliament ' boswell ` but consider sir what be the house of common be not a great part of it choose by peer do you think sir they ought to have such a influence ' johnson ` yes sir influence must ever be in proportion to property and it be right it should -lrb- 166 -rrb- ' boswell ` but be there not reason to fear that the common people may be oppress ' johnson ` no sir we great fear be from want of power in government such a storm of vulgar force have break in ' boswell ` it have only roar ' johnson ` sir it have roar till the judge in westminster-hall have be afraid to pronounce sentence in opposition to the popular cry -lrb- 167 -rrb- you be frighten by what be no longer dangerous like presbyterian by popery ' he then repeat a passage i think in _ butler 's remain _ which end ` and would cry fire fire in noah 's flood -lrb- 168 -rrb- ' we have a dreary drive in a dusky night to st andrew where we arrive late we find a good supper at glass 's inn and dr johnson revive agreeably he say ` the collection call _ the muse ' welcome to king jame _ -lrb- first of england and sixth of scotland -rrb- on he return to he native kingdom shew that there be then abundance of learn in scotland and that the conceit in that collection with which people find fault be mere mode ' he add ` we could not now entertain a sovereign so that buchanan have spread the spirit of learn amongst we but we have lose it during the civil war -lrb- 169 -rrb- ' he do not allow the latin poetry of pitcairne so much merit as have be usually attribute to it though he own that one of he piece which he mention but which i be sorry be not specify in my note be ` very well ' it be not improbable that it be the poem which prior have so elegantly translate -lrb- 170 -rrb- after supper we make a _ procession _ to _ saint leonard 's college _ the landlord walk before we with a candle and the waiter with a lantern that college have some time before be dissolve and dr watson a professor here -lrb- the historian of philip ii -rrb- have purchase the ground and what building remain when we enter this court it seem quite academical and we find in he house very comfortable and genteel accommodation -lrb- 171 -rrb- Thursday August 19 we rise much refresh i have with I a map of scotland a bible which be give I by lord mountstuart when we be together in italy -lrb- 172 -rrb- and ogden 's _ sermon on prayer _ mr nairne introduce we to dr watson whom we find a well-informed man of very amiable manners dr johnson after they be acquaint say ' i take great delight in he ' he daughter a very please young lady make breakfast dr watson observe that glasgow university have fewer home-student since trade increase as learning be rather incompatible with it johnson ` why sir as trade be now carry on by subordinate hand man in trade have as much leisure as other and now learn itself be a trade a man go to a bookseller and get what he can we have do with patronage -lrb- 173 -rrb- in the infancy of learn we find some great man praise for it this diffuse it among other when it become general a author leave the great and apply to the multitude ' boswell ` it be a shame that author be not now better patronize ' johnson ` no sir if learning can not support a man if he must sit with he hand across till somebody feed he it be as to he a bad thing and it be better as it be with patronage what flattery what falsehood while a man be in equilibrio he throw truth among the multitude and let they take it as they please : in patronage he must say what please he patron and it be a equal chance whether that be truth or falsehood ' watson ` but be not the case now that instead of flattering one person we flatter the age ' johnson ` no sir the world always let a man tell what he think he own way i wonder however that so many people have write who might have let it alone that people should endeavor to excel in conversation i do not wonder because in conversation praise be instantly reverberate -lrb- 174 -rrb- ' we talk of change of manners dr johnson observe that we drinking less than we ancestor be owe to the change from ale to wine ' i remember -lrb- say he -rrb- when all the _ decent _ people in lichfield get drunk every night and be not the worse thought of -lrb- 175 -rrb- ale be cheap so you press strongly when a man must bring a bottle of wine he be not in such haste smoking have go out to be sure it be a shocking thing blow smoke out of we mouth into other people 's mouth eye and nose and have the same thing do to we yet i can not account why a thing which require so little exertion and yet preserve the mind from total vacuity should have go out -lrb- 176 -rrb- every man have something by which he calm himself : beat with he foot or so -lrb- 177 -rrb- i remember when people in england change a shirt only once a week -lrb- 178 -rrb- : a pandour when he get a shirt grease it to make it last formerly good tradesman have no fire but in the kitchen never in the parlor except on Sunday my father who be a magistrate of lichfield live thus they never begin to have a fire in the parlor but on leave off business or some great revolution of they life ' dr watson say the hall be as a kitchen in old squire ' house johnson ` no sir the hall be for great occasion and never be use for domestick refection -lrb- 179 -rrb- ' we talk of the union and what money it have bring into scotland dr watson observe that a little money formerly go as far as a great deal now johnson ` in speculation it seem that a smaller quantity of money equal in value to a larger quantity if equally divide should produce the same effect but it be not so in reality many more convenience and elegancy be enjoy where money be plentiful than where it be scarce perhaps a great familiarity with it which arise from plenty make we more easily part with it ' after what dr johnson have say of st andrew which he have long wish to see as we oldest university and the seat of we primate in the day of episcopacy i can say little since the publication of dr johnson 's book i find that he have be censure for not see here the ancient chapel of _ st rule _ a curious piece of sacred architecture -lrb- 180 -rrb- but this be neither he fault nor mine we be both of we abundantly desirous of survey such sort of antiquity : but neither of we know of this i be afraid the censure must fall on those who do not tell we of it in every place where there be any thing worthy of observation there should be a short print directory for stranger such as we find in all the town of italy and in some of the town in england i be tell that there be a manuscript account of st andrew by martin secretary to archbishop sharp -lrb- 181 -rrb- and that one dougla have publish a small account of it i inquire at a bookseller 's but could not get it dr johnson 's veneration for the hierarchy be well know -lrb- 182 -rrb- there be no wonder then that he be affect with a strong indignation while he behold the ruin of religious magnificence i happen to ask where john knox be bury dr johnson burst out ' i hope in the high-way -lrb- 183 -rrb- i have be look at he reformation ' -lrb- 184 -rrb- it be a very fine day dr johnson seem quite wrapt up in the contemplation of the scene which be now present to he he keep he hat off while he be upon any part of the ground where the cathedral have stand he say well that ` knox have set on a mob without know where it would end and that differ from a man in doctrine be no reason why you should pull he house about he ear ' as we walk in the cloister there be a solemn echo while he talk loudly of a proper retirement from the world mr nairne say he have a inclination to retire i call dr johnson 's attention to this that i might hear he opinion if it be right johnson ` yes when he have do he duty to society -lrb- 185 -rrb- in general as every man be oblige not only to love god but he neighbor as himself he must bear he part in active life yet there be exception those who be exceedingly scrupulous -lrb- which i do not approve for i be no friend to scruple -lrb- 186 -rrb- -rrb- and find they scrupulosity -lrb- 187 -rrb- invincible so that they be quite in the dark and know not what they shall do -- or those who can not resist temptation and find they make themselves worse by be in the world without make it better may retire -lrb- 188 -rrb- i never read of a hermit but in imagination i kiss he foot never of a monastery but i could fall on my knee and kiss the pavement but i think put young people there who know nothing of life nothing of retirement be dangerous and wicked -lrb- 189 -rrb- it be a say as old as hesiod erga neon boulaite meson enchaite geronton -lrb- 190 -rrb- that be a very noble line : not that young man should not pray or old man not give counsel but that every season of life have its proper duty i have think of retire and have talk of it to a friend but i find my vocation be rather to active life ' i say some young monk might be allow to shew that it be not age alone that can retire to pious solitude but he think this would only shew that they could not resist temptation he want to mount the steeple but it could not be do there be no good inscription here bad roman character he naturally mistake for half gothick half roman one of the steeple which he be tell be in danger he wish not to be take down ` for say he it may fall on some of the posterity of john knox and no great matter ' -- dinner be mention johnson ` ay ay amidst all these sorrowful scene i have no objection to dinner -lrb- 191 -rrb- ' we go and look at the castle where cardinal beaton be murder -lrb- 192 -rrb- and then visit principal murison at he college where be a good library-room but the principal be abundantly vain of it for he seriously say to dr johnson ` you have not such a one in england ' -lrb- 193 -rrb- the professor entertain we with a very good dinner present : murison shaw cook hill haddo watson flint brown i observe that i wonder to see he eat so well after view so many sorrowful scene of ruin religious magnificence ` why say he i be not sorry after see these gentleman for they be not sorry ' murison say all sorrow be bad as it be murmur against the dispensation of providence johnson ` sir sorrow be inherent in humanity as you can not judge two and two to be either five or three but certainly four so when compare a worse present state with a better which be past you can not but feel sorrow -lrb- 194 -rrb- it be not cure by reason but by the incursion of present object which wear out the past you need not murmur though you be sorry ' murison ` but st paul say i have learn in whatever state i be therewith to be content ' johnson ` sir that relate to riches and poverty for we see st paul when he have a thorn in the flesh pray earnestly to have it remove and then he could not be content ' murison thus refute try to be smart and drink to dr johnson ` long may you lecture ' dr johnson afterwards speak of he not drink wine say ` the doctor speak of _ lecture _ -lrb- look to he -rrb- i give all these lecture on water ' he defend require subscription in those admit to university thus : ` as all who come into the country must obey the king so all who come into a university must be of the church -lrb- 195 -rrb- ' and here i must do dr johnson the justice to contradict a very absurd and ill-natured story as to what pass at st andrew it have be circulate that after grace be say in english in the usual manner he with the greatest mark of contempt as if he have hold it to be no grace in a university would not sit down till he have say grace aloud in latin this would have be a insult indeed to the gentleman who be entertaining we but the truth be precisely thus in the course of conversation at dinner dr johnson in very good humor say ' i should have expect to have hear a latin grace among so many learn man : we have always a latin grace at oxford i believe i can repeat it ' -lrb- 196 -rrb- which he do as give the learn man in one place a specimen of what be do by the learn man in another place we go and see the church in which be archbishop sharp 's monument -lrb- 197 -rrb- i be strike with the same kind of feeling with which the church of italy impressed I i be much pleased to see dr johnson actually in st andrew of which we have talk so long professor haddo be with we this afternoon along with dr watson we look at st salvador 's college the room for student seem very commodious and dr johnson say the chapel be the neatest place of worship he have see the key of the library could not be find for it seem professor hill who be out of town have take it with he dr johnson tell a joke he have hear of a monastery abroad where the key of the library could never be find it be somewhat dispiriting to see this ancient archiepiscopal city now sadly desert -lrb- 198 -rrb- we see in one of its street a remarkable proof of liberal toleration a nonjuring clergyman strut about in he canonical with a jolly countenance and a round belly like a well-fed monk we observe two occupation unite in the same person who have hang out two sign-post upon one be ` jame hood white iron smith ' -lrb- _ ie _ tin-plate worker -rrb- upon another ` the art of fencing teach by jame hood ' -- upon this last be paint some tree and two man fence one of whom have hit the other in the eye to shew he great dexterity so that the art be well teach johnson ` be i study here i should go and take a lesson i remember _ hope _ in he book on this art -lrb- 199 -rrb- say the scotch be very good fencer ' we return to the inn where we have be entertain at dinner and drink tea in company with some of the professor of whose civility i beg leave to add my humble and very grateful acknowledgement to the honorable testimony of dr johnson in he _ journey _ -lrb- 200 -rrb- we talk of composition which be a favorite topick of dr watson 's who first distinguish himself by lecture on rhetorick johnson ' i advise chamber and would advise every young man begin to compose to do it as fast as he can to get a habit of have he mind to start promptly it be so much more difficult to improve in speed than in accuracy -lrb- 201 -rrb- ' watson ' i own i be for much attention to accuracy in compose lest one should get bad habit of do it in a slovenly manner ' johnson ` why sir you be confound _ do _ inaccurately with the _ necessity _ of do inaccurately a man know when he composition be inaccurate and when he think fit he 'll correct it but if a man be accustom to compose slowly and with difficulty upon all occasion there be danger that he may not compose at all as we do not like to do that which be not do easily and at any rate more time be consume in a small matter than ought to be ' watson ` dr hugh blair have take a week to compose a sermon ' johnson ` then sir that be for want of the habit of compose quickly which i be insist one should acquire ' watson ` blair be not compose all the week but only such hour as he find himself disposed for composition ' johnson ` nay sir unless you tell I the time he take you tell I nothing if i say i take a week to walk a mile and have have the gout five day and be ill otherwise another day i have take but one day i myself have compose about forty sermon -lrb- 202 -rrb- i have begin a sermon after dinner and send it off by the post that night i write forty-eight of the print octavo page of the _ life of savage _ at a sit but then i sit up all night i have also write six sheet in a day of translation from the french -lrb- 203 -rrb- ' boswell ` we have all observe how one man dress himself slowly and another fast ' johnson ` yes sir : it be wonderful how much time some people will consume in dress take up a thing and look at it and lay it down and take it up again every one should get the habit of do it quickly i would say to a young divine here be you text let I see how soon you can make a sermon then i would say let I see how much better you can make it thus i should see both he power and he judgement ' we all go to dr watson 's to supper miss sharp great grandchild of archbishop sharp be there as be mr craig the ingenious architect of the new town of edinburgh -lrb- 204 -rrb- and nephew of thomson to whom dr johnson have since do so much justice in he _ life of the poet _ we talk of memory and its various mode johnson ` memory will play strange trick one sometimes lose a single word i once lose _ fugace _ in the ode _ posthume posthume _ -lrb- 205 -rrb- ' i mention to he that a worthy gentleman of my acquaintance actually forget he own name johnson ` sir that be a morbid oblivion ' Friday August 20 dr shaw the professor of divinity breakfast with we i take out my _ ogden on prayer _ and read some of it to the company dr johnson praise he ` abernethy -lrb- 206 -rrb- -lrb- say he -rrb- allow only of a physical effect of prayer upon the mind which may be produce many way as well as by prayer for instance by meditation ogden go farther in truth we have the consent of all nation for the efficacy of prayer whether offer up by individual or by assembly and revelation have tell we it will be effectual ' i say ` leechman seem to incline to abernethy 's doctrine ' dr watson observe that leechman mean to shew that even admit no effect to be produce by prayer respect the deity it be useful to we own mind -lrb- 207 -rrb- he have give only a part of he system dr johnson think he should have give the whole dr johnson enforce the strict observance of Sunday -lrb- 208 -rrb- ` it should be different -lrb- he observe -rrb- from another day people may walk but not throw stone at bird there may be relaxation but there should be no levity -lrb- 209 -rrb- ' we go and see colonel nairne 's garden and grotto here be a fine old plane tree unluckily the colonel say there be but this and another large tree in the county this assertion be a excellent cue for dr johnson who laugh enormously call to I to hear it he have expatiate to I on the nakedness of that part of scotland which he have see he _ journey _ have be violently abuse for what he have say upon this subject but let it be consider that when dr johnson talk of tree he mean tree of good size such as he be accustom to see in england and of these there be certainly very few upon the _ eastern coast _ of scotland besides he say that he mean to give only a map of the road and let any traveller observe how many tree which deserve the name he can see from the road from berwick to aberdeen -lrb- 210 -rrb- have dr johnson say ` there be _ no _ tree ' upon this line he would have say what be colloquially true because by no tree in common speech we mean few when he be particular in count he may be attack i know not how colonel nairne come to say there be but _ two _ large tree in the county of fife i do not perceive that he smile there be certainly not a great many but i could have shewn he more than two at _ balmuto _ from whence my ancestor come and which now belong to a branch of my family -lrb- 211 -rrb- the grotto be ingeniously construct in the front of it be petrified stock of fir plane and some other tree dr johnson say ` scotland have no right to boast of this grotto it be owe to personal merit i never deny personal merit to many of you ' professor shaw say to I as we walk ` this be a wonderful man he be master of every subject he handle ' dr watson allow he a very strong understanding but wonder at he total inattention to establish manners as he come from london i have not preserve in my journal any of the conversation which pass between dr johnson and professor shaw but i recollect dr johnson say to I afterwards ' i take much to shaw ' we leave st andrew about noon and some mile from it observe at _ leuchar _ a church with a old tower we stop to look at it the _ manse _ as the parsonage-house be call in scotland be close by i wait on the minister mention we name and beg he would tell we what he know about it he be a very civil old man but could only inform we that it be suppose to have stand eight hundred year he tell we there be a colony of dane in he parish -lrb- 212 -rrb- that they have land at a remote period of time and still remain a distinct people dr johnson shrewdly inquire whether they have bring woman with they we be not satisfy as to this colony we see this day dundee and aberbrothick the last of which dr johnson have celebrate in he _ journey _ -lrb- 213 -rrb- upon the road we talk of the roman catholick faith he mention -lrb- i think -rrb- tillotson 's argument against transubstantiation : ` that we be as sure we see bread and wine only as that we read in the bible the text on which that false doctrine be found we have only the evidence of we sens for both -lrb- 214 -rrb- ' ` if -lrb- he add -rrb- god have never speak figuratively we might hold that he speak literally when he say this be my body -lrb- 215 -rrb- ' boswell ` but what do you say sir to the ancient and continue tradition of the church upon this point ' johnson ` tradition sir have no place where the scripture be plain and tradition can not persuade a man into a belief of transubstantiation able man indeed have _ say _ they believe it ' this be a awful subject i do not then press dr johnson upon it : nor shall i now enter upon a disquisition concern the import of those word utter by we savior -lrb- 216 -rrb- which have such a effect upon many of he disciple that they ` go back and walk no more with he ' the catechism and solemn office for communion in the church of england maintain a mysterious belief in more than a mere commemoration of the death of christ by partaking of the element of bread and wine dr johnson put I in mind that at st andrew i have defend my profession very well when the question have again be start whether a lawyer might honestly engage with the first side that offer he a fee ` sir -lrb- say i -rrb- it be with you argument against sir william forbe -lrb- 217 -rrb- : but it be much that i could wield the arm of goliah ' he say we judge have not go deep in the question concern literary property i mention lord monboddo 's opinion that if a man could get a work by heart he might print it as by such a act the mind be exercise johnson ` no sir a man 's repeat it no more make it he property than a man may sell a cow which he drive home ' i say print a abridgement of a work be allow which be only cut the horn and tail off the cow johnson ` no sir ` tis make the cow have a calf -lrb- 218 -rrb- ' about eleven at night we arrive at montrose we find but a sorry inn where i myself see another waiter put a lump of sugar with he finger into dr johnson 's lemonade for which he call he ` rascal ' it put I in great glee that we landlord be a englishman i rally the doctor upon this and he grow quiet -lrb- 219 -rrb- both sir john hawkin 's and dr burney 's _ history of musick _ have then be advertise i ask if this be not unlucky : would not they hurt one another johnson ` no sir they will do good to one another some will buy the one some the other and compare they and so a talk be make about a thing and the book be sell ' he be angry at I for propose to carry lemon with we to sky that he might be sure to have he lemonade ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- i do not wish to be think that feeble man who can not do without any thing sir it be very bad manners to carry provision to any man 's house as if he could not entertain you to a inferior it be oppressive to a superior it be insolent ' have take the liberty this evening to remark to dr johnson that he very often sit quite silent for a long time even when in company with only a single friend which i myself have sometimes sadly experience he smile and say ` it be true sir -lrb- 220 -rrb- tom tyer -lrb- for so he familiarly call we ingenious friend who since he death have pay a biographical tribute to he memory -lrb- 221 -rrb- -rrb- tom tyer describe I the best he once say to I sir you be like a ghost : you never speak till you be speak to -lrb- 222 -rrb- ' Saturday August 31 neither the rev mr nisbet the established minister nor the rev mr spooner the episcopal minister be in town before breakfast we go and see the town-hall where be a good dancing-room and other room for tea-drink the appearance of the town from it be very well but many of the house be build with they end to the street which look awkward when we come down from it i meet mr gleg a merchant here he go with we to see the english chapel it be situate on a pretty dry spot and there be a fine walk to it it be really a elegant building both within and without the organ be adorn with green and gold dr johnson give a shill extraordinary to the clerk say ` he belong to a honest church -lrb- 223 -rrb- ' i put he in mind that episcopal be but _ dissenter _ here they be only _ tolerate _ ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- we be here as christian in turkey ' he afterwards go into a apothecary 's shop and order some medicine for himself and write the prescription in technical character the boy take he for a physician -lrb- 224 -rrb- i doubt much which road to take whether to go by the coast or by laurence kirk and monboddo i know lord monboddo and dr johnson do not love each other -lrb- 225 -rrb- yet i be unwilling not to visit he lordship and be also curious to see they together -lrb- 226 -rrb- i mention my doubt to dr johnson who say he would go two mile out of he way to see lord monboddo -lrb- 227 -rrb- i therefore send joseph forward with the follow note : -- ` montrose August 21 ` my dear lord ` thus far i be come with mr samuel johnson we must be at aberdeen to-night i know you do not admire he so much as i do but i can not be in this country without make you a bow at you old place as i do not know if i may again have a opportunity of see monboddo besides mr johnson say he would go two mile out of he way to see lord monboddo i have send forward my servant that we may know if you lordship be at home ' i be ever my dear lord ` most sincerely yours ` jame boswell ' as we travel onward from montrose we have the grampion hill in we view and some good land around we but void of tree and hedge dr johnson have say ludicrously in he _ journey _ that the _ hedge _ be of _ stone _ -lrb- 228 -rrb- for instead of the verdant _ thorn _ to refresh the eye we find the bare _ wall _ or _ dike _ intersect the prospect he observe that it be wonderful to see a country so divest so denuded of tree we stop at laurence kirk -lrb- 229 -rrb- where we great grammarian ruddiman -lrb- 230 -rrb- be once schoolmaster we respectfully remember that excellent man and eminent scholar by whose labor a

i hope will be well execute -lrb- 232 -rrb- i know my father give five guinea towards it lord gardenston be the proprietor of laurence kirk and have encourage the building of a manufacturing village of which he be exceedingly fond and have write a pamphlet upon it -lrb- 233 -rrb- as if he have found thebe in which however there be many useful precept strongly express the village seem to be irregularly build some of the house be of clay some of brick and some of brick and stone dr johnson observe they thatch well here i be a little acquaint with mr forbe the minister of the parish i send to inform he that a gentleman desire to see he he return for answer ` that he would not come to a stranger ' i then give my name and he come i remonstrate to he for not come to a stranger and by present he to dr johnson prove to he what a stranger might sometimes be he bible inculcate ` be not forgetful to entertain stranger ' and mention the same motive -lrb- 234 -rrb- he defend himself by say ` he have once come to a stranger who send for he and he find he _ a little worth person _ ' dr johnson insist on stop at the inn as i tell he that lord gardenston have furnish it with a collection of book that traveller might have entertainment for the mind as well as the body he praise the design but wish there have be more book and those better choose about a mile from monboddo where you turn off the road joseph be wait to tell we my lord expect we to dinner we drive over a wild moor it rain and the scene be somewhat dreary dr johnson repeat with solemn emphasis macbeth 's speech on meet the witch as we travel on he tell I ` sir you get into we club by do what a man can do -lrb- 235 -rrb- several of the member wish to keep you out burke tell I he doubt if you be fit for it : but now you be in none of they be sorry burke say that you have so much good humor naturally it be scarce a virtue -lrb- 236 -rrb- ' boswell ` they be afraid of you sir as it be you who propose I ' johnson ` sir they know that if they refuse you they would probably never have get in another i would have keep they all out beauclerk be very earnest for you ' boswell beauclerk have a keenness of mind which be very uncommon johnson ` yes sir and everything come from he so easily it appear to I that i labor when i say a good thing ' boswell ` you be loud sir but it be not a effort of mind -lrb- 237 -rrb- ' monboddo be a wretched place wild and naked with a poor old house though if i recollect right there be two turret which mark a old baron 's residence lord monboddo receive we at he gate most courteously point to the dougla arm upon he house and tell we that he great-grandmother be of that family ` in such house -lrb- say he -rrb- we ancestor live who be better man than we ' ` no no my lord -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- we be as strong as they and a great deal wiser -lrb- 238 -rrb- ' this be a assault upon one of lord monboddo 's capital dogma and i be afraid there would have be a violent altercation in the very close before we get into the house but he lordship be distinguish not only for ` ancient metaphysick ' but for ancient _ politesse _ ' _ la vieille cour _ ' and he make no reply -lrb- 239 -rrb- he lordship be dress in a rustick suit and wear a little round hat he tell we we now see he as _ farmer burnet _ -lrb- 240 -rrb- and we should have he family dinner a farmer 's dinner he say ' i should not have forgive mr boswell have he not bring you here dr johnson ' he produce a very long stalk of corn as a specimen of he crop and say ` you see here the _ loeta segete _ -lrb- 241 -rrb- ' he add that _ virgil _ seem to be as enthusiastick a farmer as he -lrb- 242 -rrb- and be certainly a practical one johnson ` it do not always follow my lord that a man who have write a good poem on a art have practice it philip miller tell I that in philip 's _ cyder _ a poem all the precept be just and indeed better than in book write for the purpose of instruct yet philip have never make cyder -lrb- 243 -rrb- ' i start the subject of emigration -lrb- 244 -rrb- johnson ` to a man of mere animal life you can urge no argument against go to america but that it will be some time before he will get the earth to produce but a man of any intellectual enjoyment will not easily go and immerse himself and he posterity for age in barbarism ' he and my lord speak highly of homer johnson ` he have all the learning of he age the shield of achille shew a nation in war a nation in peace harvest sport nay stealing -lrb- 245 -rrb- ' monboddo ` ay and what we -lrb- look to I -rrb- would call a parliament-house scene -lrb- 246 -rrb- a cause plead ' johnson ` that be part of the life of a nation in peace and there be in homer such character of hero and combination of quality of hero that the unite power of mankind ever since have not produce any but what be to be find there ' monboddo ` yet no character be describe ' johnson ` no they all develope themselves agamemnon be always a gentleman-like character he have always -lrb- greek : basilikon ti -rrb- that the ancient hold so be plain from this that euripide in he _ hecuba _ make he the person to interpose -lrb- 247 -rrb- ' monboddo ` the history of manners be the most valuable i never set a high value on any other history ' johnson ` nor i and therefore i esteem biography as give we what come near to ourselves what we can turn to use -lrb- 248 -rrb- ' boswell ` but in the course of general history we find manners in war we see the disposition of people they degree of humanity and other particulars ' johnson ` yes but then you must take all the fact to get this and it be but a little you get ' monboddo ` and it be that little which make history valuable ' bravo think i they agree like two brother monboddo ' i be sorry dr johnson you be not longer at edinburgh to receive the homage of we man of learn ' johnson ` my lord i receive great respect and great kindness ' boswell ` he go back to edinburgh after we tour ' we talk of the decrease of learn in scotland and of the _ muse ' welcome _ -lrb- 249 -rrb- johnson ` learning be much decrease in england in my remembrance -lrb- 250 -rrb- ' monboddo ` you sir have live to see its decrease in england i its extinction in scotland ' however i bring he to confess that the high school of edinburgh do well johnson ` learning have decrease in england because learning will not do so much for a man as formerly there be other way of get preferment few bishop be now make for they learn to be a bishop a man must be learn in a learn age -- factious in a factious age but always of eminence -lrb- 251 -rrb- warburton be a exception though he learning alone do not raise he he be first a antagonist to pope and help theobald to publish he _ shakspeare _ but see pope the rise man when crousaz attack he _ essay on man _ for some fault which it have and some which it have not warburton defend it in the review of that time -lrb- 252 -rrb- this bring he acquaint with pope and he gain he friendship pope introduce he to allen allen married he to he niece : so by allen 's interest and he own he be make a bishop -lrb- 253 -rrb- but then he learning be the _ sine qua non _ : he know how to make the most of it but i do not find by any dishonest means ' monboddo ` he be a great man ' johnson ` yes he have great knowledge -- great power of mind hardly any man bring greater variety of learn to bear upon he point -lrb- 254 -rrb- ' monboddo ` he be one of the greatest light of you church ' johnson ` why we be not so sure of he be very friendly to we -lrb- 255 -rrb- he blaze if you will but that be not always the steadiest light lowth be another bishop who have rise by he learn ' dr johnson examine young arthur lord monboddo 's son in latin he answer very well upon which he say with complacency ` get you go when king jame come back -lrb- 256 -rrb- you shall be in the _ muse welcome _ ' my lord and dr johnson dispute a little whether the savage or the london shopkeeper have the best existence he lordship as usual prefer the savage my lord be extremely hospitable and i see both dr johnson and he like each other better every hour dr johnson have retire for a short time he lordship speak of he conversation as i could have wish dr johnson have say ' i have do greater feat with my knife than this ' though he have eat a very hearty dinner my lord who affect or believe he follow a abstemious system seem strike with dr johnson 's manner of live i have a particular satisfaction in be under the roof of monboddo my lord be my father 's old friend and have be always very good to I we be cordial together he ask dr johnson and I to stay all night when i say we _ must _ be at aberdeen he reply ` well i be like the roman : i shall say to you happy to come -- happy to depart ' he thank dr johnson for he visit johnson ' i little thought when i have the honor to meet you lordship in london that i should see you at monboddo ' after dinner as the lady -lrb- 257 -rrb- be go away dr johnson would stand up he insist that politeness be of great consequence in society ` it be -lrb- say he -rrb- fictitious benevolence -lrb- 258 -rrb- it supply the place of it amongst those who see each other only in publick or but little depend upon it the want of it never fail to produce something disagreeable to one or other i have always apply to good breeding what addison in he _ cato _ -lrb- 259 -rrb- say of honor : -- honor 's a sacred tie the law of king the noble mind 's distinguish perfection that aid and strengthen virtue where it meet she and imitate she action where she be not ' when he take up he large oak stick he say ` my lord that be _ homerick _ -lrb- 260 -rrb- ' thus pleasantly allude to he lordship 's favorite writer gory my lord 's black servant be send as we guide to conduct we to the high road the circumstance of each of they have a black servant be another point of similarity between johnson and monboddo i observe how curious it be to see a african in the north of scotland with little or no difference of manners from those of the native dr johnson laugh to see gory and joseph ride together most cordially ` those two fellow -lrb- say he -rrb- one from africa the other from bohemia seem quite at home ' he be much pleased with lord monboddo to-day he say he would have pardon he for a few paradox when he find he have so much that be good : but that from he appearance in london he think he all paradox which would not do he observe that he lordship have talk no paradox to-day ` and as to the savage and the london shopkeeper -lrb- say he -rrb- i do not know but i might have take the side of the savage equally have any body else take the side of the shopkeeper -lrb- 261 -rrb- ' he have say to my lord in opposition to the value of the savage 's courage that it be owe to he limited power of think and repeat pope 's verse in which ` macedonium 's madman ' be introduce and the conclusion be ` yet ne'er look forward farther than he nose -lrb- 262 -rrb- ' i object to the last phrase as be low johnson ` sir it be intend to be low : it be satire the expression be debase to debase the character ' when gory be about to part from we dr johnson call to he ` mr gory give I leave to ask you a question be you baptise ' gory tell he he be and confirm by the bishop of durham he then give he a shilling we have tedious drive this afternoon and be somewhat drowsy last night i be afraid dr johnson be begin to faint in he resolution for he say ` if we must ride much we shall not go and there be a end o not ' to-day when he talk of _ sky _ with spirit i say ` why sir you seem to I to despond yesterday you be a delicate londoner -- you be a maccaronus -lrb- 263 -rrb- you can not ride ' johnson ` sir i shall ride better than you i be only afraid i should not find a horse able to carry I ' i hope then there would be no fear of get through we wild tour we come to aberdeen at half a hour past eleven the new inn we be tell be full this be comfortless the waiter however ask if one of we name be boswell and bring I a letter leave at the inn : it be from mr thrale enclose one to dr johnson -lrb- 264 -rrb- finding who i be we be tell they would contrive to lodge we by put we for a night into a room with two bed the waiter say to I in the broad strong aberdeenshire dialect ' i think i know you by you likeness to you father ' my father put up at the new inn when on he circuit little be say to-night i be to sleep in a little press-bed in dr johnson 's room i have it wheel out into the dining-room and there i lay very well Sunday August 22 i send a message to professor thoma gordon who come and breakfast with we he have secure seat for we at the english chapel we find a respectable congregation and a admirable organ well play by mr tait we walk down to the shore : dr johnson laugh to hear that cromwell 's soldier teach the aberdeen people to make shoe and stocking and to plant cabbage -lrb- 265 -rrb- he ask if weave the plaid -lrb- 266 -rrb- be ever a domestick art in the highland like spin or knit they could not inform he here but he conjecture probably that where people live so remote from each other it be likely to be a domestick art as we see it be among the ancient from penelope i be sensible to-day to a extraordinary degree of dr johnson 's excellent english pronunciation i can not account for its striking I more now than any other day : but it be as if new to I and i listen to every sentence which he speak as to a musical composition professor gordon give he a account of the plan of education in he college dr johnson say it be similar to that at oxford waller the poet 's great-grandson be study here dr johnson wonder that a man should send he son so far off when there be so many good school in england -lrb- 267 -rrb- he say ` at a great school there be all the splendor and illumination of many mind the radiance of all be concentrate in each or at least reflect upon each but we must own that neither a dull boy nor a idle boy will do so well at a great school as at a private one for at a great school there be always boy enough to do well easily who be sufficient to keep up the credit of the school and after whipping be try to no purpose the dull or idle boy be leave at the end of a class have the appearance of go through the course but learn nothing at all -lrb- 268 -rrb- such boy may do good at a private school where constant attention be pay to they and they be watch so that the question of publick or private education be not properly a general one but whether one or the other be best for _ my son _ ' we be tell the present mr waller be a plain country gentleman and he son would be such another i observe a family could not expect a poet but in a hundred generation ` nay -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- not one family in a hundred can expect a poet in a hundred generation ' he then repeat dryden 's celebrated line ` three poet in three distant age bear ' & c and a part of a latin translation of it do at oxford -lrb- 269 -rrb- : he do not then say by whom he receive a card from sir alexander gordon who have be he acquaintance twenty year ago in london and who ` if forgive for not answer a line from he ' would come in the afternoon dr johnson rejoice to hear of he and beg he would come and dine with we i be much pleased to see the kindness with which dr johnson receive he old friend sir alexander -lrb- 270 -rrb- a gentleman of good family _ lismore _ but who have not the estate the king 's college here make he professor of medicine which afford he a decent subsistence he tell we that the value of the stocking export from aberdeen be in peace a hundred thousand pound and amount in time of war to one hundred and seventy thousand pound dr johnson ask what make the difference here we have a proof of the comparative sagacity of the two professor sir alexander answer ` because there be more occasion for they in war ' professor thoma gordon answer ` because the german who be we great rival in the manufacture of stocking be otherwise employ in time of war ' johnson ` sir you have give a very good solution ' at dinner dr johnson eat several plate-full of scotch broth with barley and pea in it and seem very fond of the dish i say ` you never eat it before ' johnson ` no sir but i do not care how soon i eat it again -lrb- 271 -rrb- ' my cousin miss dalla formerly of inverness be marry to mr riddoch one of the minister of the english chapel here he be ill and confine to he room but she send we a kind invitation to tea which we all accept she be the same lively sensible cheerful woman as ever dr johnson here throw out some joke against scotland he say ` you go first to aberdeen then to _ enbru _ -lrb- the scottish pronunciation of edinburgh -rrb- then to newcastle to be polish by the collier then to york then to london ' and he lay hold of a little girl stuart dalla niece to mr riddoch and represent himself as a giant say he would take she with he tell she in a hollow voice that he live in a cave and have a bed in the rock and she should have a little bed cut opposite to it he thus treat the point as to prescription of murder in scotland -lrb- 272 -rrb- ' a jury in england would make allowance for deficiency of evidence on account of lapse of time but a general rule that a crime should not be punish or try for the purpose of punishment after twenty year be bad it be cant to talk of the king 's advocate delay a prosecution from malice how unlikely be it the king 's advocate should have malice against person who commit murder or should even know they at all if the son of the murder man should kill the murderer who get off merely by prescription i would help he to make he escape though be i upon he jury i would not acquit he i would not advise he to commit such a act on the contrary i would bid he submit to the determination of society because a man be bind to submit to the inconvenience of it as he enjoy the good : but the young man though politically wrong would not be morally wrong he would have to say ` here i be amongst barbarian who not only refuse to do justice but encourage the greatest of all crime i be therefore in a state of nature : for so far as there be no law it be a state of nature : and consequently upon the eternal and immutable law of justice which require that he who shed man 's blood should have he blood shed -lrb- 273 -rrb- i will stab the murderer of my father ' we go to we inn and sit quietly dr johnson borrow at mr riddoch 's a volume of _ massillon 's discourse on the psalm _ : but i find he read little in it ogden too he sometimes take up and glance at but throw it down again i then enter upon religious conversation never do i see he in a better frame : calm gentle wise holy i say ` would not the same objection hold against the trinity as against transubstantiation ' ` yes -lrb- say he -rrb- if you take three and one in the same sense if you do so to be sure you can not believe it : but the three person in the godhead be three in one sense and one in another we can not tell how and that be the mystery ' i speak of the satisfaction of christ he say he notion be that it do not atone for the sin of the world but by satisfy divine justice by shew that no less than the son of god suffer for sin it shew to man and innumerable create being the heinousness of it and therefore render it unnecessary for divine vengeance to be exercise against sinner as it otherwise must have be that in this way it might operate even in favor of those who have never hear of it : as to those who do hear of it the effect it should produce would be repentance and piety by impress upon the mind a just notion of sin : that original sin be the propensity to evil which no doubt be occasion by the fall he present this solemn subject in a new light to I -lrb- 274 -rrb- and render much more rational and clear the doctrine of what we savior have do for we -- as it remove the notion of imputed righteousness in co-operating whereas by this view christ have do all already that he have to do or be ever to do for mankind by make he great satisfaction the consequence of which will affect each individual accord to the particular conduct of each i would illustrate this by say that christ 's satisfaction resemble a sun place to shew light to man so that it depend upon themselves whether they will walk the right way or not which they could not have do without that sun ' _ the sun of righteousness _ -lrb- 275 -rrb- ' there be however more in it than merely give light -- _ a light to lighten the gentile _ -lrb- 276 -rrb- : for we be tell there _ be healing under he wing _ -lrb- 277 -rrb- dr johnson say to I ` richard baxter commend a treatise by grotius _ de satisfactione christi _ i have never read it : but i intend to read it and you may read it ' i remark upon the principle now lay down we might explain the difficult and seemingly hard text ` they that believe shall be save and they that believe not shall be damned -lrb- 278 -rrb- : ' they that believe shall have such a impression make upon they mind as will make they act so that they may be accept by god we talk of one of we friend -lrb- 279 -rrb- take ill for a length of time a hasty expression of dr johnson 's to he on he attempt to prosecute a subject that have a reference to religion beyond the bound within which the doctor think such topick should be confine in a mixed company johnson ` what be to become of society if a friendship of twenty year be to be break off for such a cause ' as bacon say ` who then to frail mortality shall trust but limn the water or but write in dust -lrb- 280 -rrb- ' i say he should write expressly in support of christianity for that although a reverence for it shine through he work in several place that be not enough ` you know -lrb- say i -rrb- what grotius have do and what addison have do -lrb- 281 -rrb- -- you should do also ' he reply ' i hope i shall ' Monday August 23 principal campbell sir alexander gordon professor gordon and professor ross visit we in the morning as do dr gerard who have come six mile from the country on purpose we go and see the marischal college -lrb- 282 -rrb- and at one o'clock we wait on the magistrate in the town hall as they have invite we in order to present dr johnson with the freedom of the town which provost jopp do with a very good grace dr johnson be much pleased with this mark of attention and receive it very politely there be a pretty numerous company assemble it be strike to hear all of they drink ` dr johnson dr johnson ' in the town-hall of aberdeen and then to see he with he burgess-ticket or diploma -lrb- 283 -rrb- in he hat which he wear as he walk along the street accord to the usual custom it give I great satisfaction to observe the regard and indeed fondness too which every body here have for my father while sir alexander gordon conduct dr johnson to old aberdeen professor gordon and i call on mr riddoch whom i find to be a grave worthy clergyman he observe that whatever might be say of dr johnson while he be alive he would after he be dead be look upon by the world with regard and astonishment on account of he _ dictionary _ professor gordon and i walk over to the old college which dr johnson have see by this time i step into the chapel and look at the tomb of the founder archbishop elphinston -lrb- 284 -rrb- of whom i shall have occasion to write in my _ history of jame iv of scotland _ the patron of my family -lrb- 285 -rrb- we dine at sir alexander gordon 's the provost professor ross professor dunbar professor thoma gordon be there after dinner come in dr gerard professor leslie -lrb- 286 -rrb-

very intimate with warburton johnson ` why sir he have print some of he work and perhaps buy the property of some of they the intimacy be such as one of the professor here may have with one of the carpenter who be repair the college ' ` but -lrb- say gerard -rrb- i see a letter from he to this printer in which he say that the one half of the clergy of the church of scotland be fanatick and the other half infidel ' johnson ` warburton have accustom himself to write letter just as he speak without think any more of what he throw out -lrb- 289 -rrb- when i read warburton first and observe he force and he contempt of mankind i think he have drive the world before he but i soon find that be not the case for warburton by extend he abuse render it ineffectual -lrb- 290 -rrb- ' he tell I when we be by ourselves that he think it very wrong in the printer to shew warburton 's letter as it be raise a body of enemy against he he think it foolish in warburton to write so to the printer and add ` sir the worst way of be intimate be by scribble ' he call warburton 's _ doctrine of grace _ -lrb- 291 -rrb- a poor performance and so he say be wesley 's answer -lrb- 292 -rrb- ` warburton he observe have lay himself very open in particular he be weak enough to say that in some disorder of the imagination people have speak with tongue have speak language which they never know before a thing as absurd as to say that in some disorder of the imagination people have be know to fly ' i talk of the difference of genius to try if i could engage gerard in a disquisition with dr johnson but i do not succeed i mention as a curious fact that locke have write verse johnson ' i know of none sir but a kind of exercise prefix to dr sydenham 's work -lrb- 293 -rrb- in which he have some conceit about the dropsy in which water and burning be unite and how dr sydenham remove fire by draw off water contrary to the usual practice which be to extinguish fire by bring water upon it i be not sure that there be a word of all this but it be such kind of talk -lrb- 294 -rrb- ' we speak of _ fingal _ -lrb- 295 -rrb- dr johnson say calmly ` if the poem be really translate they be certainly first write down let mr macpherson deposite the manuscript in one of the college at aberdeen where there be people who can judge and if the professor certify the authenticity then there will be a end of the controversy if he do not take this obvious and easy method he give the best reason to doubt consider too how much be against it _ à priori ' _ we saunter after dinner in sir alexander 's garden and see he little grotto which be hang with piece of poetry write in a fair hand it be agreeable to observe the contentment and kindness of this quiet benevolent man professor macleod be brother to macleod of talisker and brother-in-law to the laird of col he give I a letter to young col i be weary of this day and begin to think wishfully of be again in motion i be uneasy to think myself too fastidious whilst i fancied dr johnson quite satisfied but he own to I that he be fatigue and tease by sir alexander 's do too much to entertain he i say it be all kindness johnson ` true sir but sensation be sensation ' boswell ` it be so : we feel pain equally from the surgeon 's probe as from the sword of the foe ' we visit two bookseller ' shop and could not find arthur johnston 's poem ' -lrb- 296 -rrb- we go and sit near a hour at mr riddoch 's he could not tell distinctly how much education at the college here cost -lrb- 297 -rrb- which disgust dr johnson i have pledge myself that we should go to the inn and not stay supper they press we but he be resolute i see mr riddoch do not please he he say to I afterwards ` sir he have no vigor in he talk ' but my friend should have consider that he himself be not in good humor so that it be not easy to talk to he satisfaction we sit contentedly at we inn he then become merry and observe how little we have either hear or say at aberdeen : that the aberdonian have not start a single _ mawkin _ -lrb- the scottish word for hare -rrb- for we to pursue -lrb- 298 -rrb- Tuesday August 24 we set out about eight in the morning and breakfast at ellon the landlady say to I ` be not this the great doctor that be go about through the country ' i say ` yes ' ` ay -lrb- say she -rrb- we hear of he i make a errand into the room on purpose to see he there be something great in he appearance : it be a pleasure to have such a man in one 's house a man who do so much good if i have think of it i would have shewn he a child of mine who have have a lump on he throat for some time ' ` but -lrb- say i -rrb- he be not a doctor of physick ' ` be he a oculist ' say the landlord ` no -lrb- say i -rrb- he be only a very learn man ' landlord ` they say he be the greatest man in england except lord mansfield -lrb- 299 -rrb- ' dr johnson be highly entertain with this and i do think he be pleased too he say ' i like the exception : to have call I the greatest man in england would have be a unmeaning compliment : but the exception mark that the praise be in earnest : and in _ scotland _ the exception must be _ lord mansfield _ or -- _ sir john pringle _ -lrb- 300 -rrb- ' he tell I a good story of dr goldsmith graham who write _ telemachus a masque _ -lrb- 301 -rrb- be sit one night with he and dr johnson and be half drunk he rattle away to dr johnson : ` you be a clever fellow to be sure but you can not write a essay like addison or verse like the rape of the lock ' at last he say -lrb- 302 -rrb- ' _ doctor _ i should be happy to see you at eaton -lrb- 303 -rrb- ' ' i shall be glad to wait on you ' answer goldsmith ` no -lrb- say graham -rrb- ` tis not you i mean dr _ minor _ ` tis doctor _ major _ there ' goldsmith

lord be go to dine in the neighborhood at a entertainment give by mr irvine of drum lady errol receive we politely and be very attentive to we during the time of dinner there be nobody at table but she ladyship mr boyd and some of the child they governor and governess mr boyd put dr johnson in mind of have dine with he at cum the quaker 's -lrb- 305 -rrb- along with a mr hall and miss william -lrb- 306 -rrb- : this be a bond of connection between they for I mr boyd 's acquaintance with my father be enough after dinner lady errol favor we with a sight of she young family whom she make stand up in a row there be six daughter and two son it be a very please sight dr johnson propose we set out mr boyd say he hope we would stay all night he brother would be at home in the evening and would be very sorry if he miss we mr boyd be call out of the room i be very desirous to stay in so comfortable a house and i wish to see lord errol dr johnson however be right in resolve to go if we be not ask again as it be best to err on the safe side in such case and to be sure that one be quite welcome to my great joy when mr boyd return he tell dr johnson that it be lady errol who have call he out and say that she would never let dr johnson into the house again if he go away that night and that she have order the coach to carry we to view a great curiosity on the coast after which we should see the house we cheerfully agree mr boyd be engage in 1745-6 on the same side with many unfortunate mistaken nobleman and gentleman he escape and lay conceal for a year in the island of arran the ancient territory of the boyd he then go to france and be about twenty year on the continent he marry a french lady and now live very comfortably at aberdeen and be much at slain castle he entertain we with great civility he have a pompousness or formal plenitude in he conversation which i do not dislike dr johnson say ` there be too much elaboration in he talk ' it give I pleasure to see he a steady branch of the family setting forth all its advantage with much zeal he tell we that lady errol be one of the most pious and sensible woman in the island have a good head and as good a heart he say she do not use force or fear in educate she child johnson ` sir she be wrong -lrb- 307 -rrb- i would rather have the rod to be the general terror to all to make they learn than tell a child if you do thus or thus you will be more esteemed than you brother or sister the rod produce a effect which terminate in itself a child be afraid of be whip and get he task and there be a end o not whereas by exciting emulation and comparison of superiority you lay the foundation of lasting mischief you make brother and sister hate each other ' during mr boyd 's stay in arran he have find a chest of medical book leave by a surgeon there and have read they till he acquire some skill in physick in consequence of which he be often consult by the poor there be several here wait for he as patient we walk round the house till stop by a cut make by the influx of the sea the house be build quite upon the shore the window look upon the main ocean and the king of denmark be lord errol 's nearest neighbor on the north-east -lrb- 308 -rrb- we get immediately into the coach and drive to _ dunbui _ a rock near the shore quite cover with sea-fowl then to a circular bason of large extent surround with tremendous rock on the quarter next the sea there be a high arch in the rock which the force of the tempest have drive out this place be call _ buchan 's buller _ or the _ buller of buchan _ and the country people call it the _ pot _ mr boyd say it be so call from the french _ bouloir _ it may be more simply trace from _ boiler _ in we own language we walk round this monstrous cauldron in some place the rock be very narrow and on each side there be a sea deep enough for a man of war to ride in so that it be somewhat horrid to move along however there be earth and grass upon the rock and a kind of road mark out by the print of foot so that one make it out pretty safely : yet it alarm I to see dr johnson stride irregularly along he insist on take a boat and sailing into the pot we do so he be stout and wonderfully alert the buchan-men all shew they tooth and speak with that strange sharp accent which distinguish they be to I a matter of curiosity he be not sensible of the difference of pronunciation in the south and north of scotland which i wonder at as the entry into the _ buller _ be so narrow that oar can not be use as you go in the method take be to row very hard when you come near it and give the boat such a rapidity of motion that it glide in dr johnson observe what a effect this scene would have have be we enter into a unknown place there be cave of considerable depth i think one on each side the boatman have never enter either of they far enough to know the size mr boyd tell we that it be customary for the company at peterhead well to make party and come and dine in one of the cave here he tell we that as slain be at a considerable distance from aberdeen lord errol who have a very large family resolve to have a surgeon of he own with this view he educate one of he tenant 's son who be now settle in a very neat house and farm just by which we see from the road by the salary which the earl allow he and the practice which he have have he be in very easy circumstance he have keep a exact account of all that have be lay out on he education and he come to he lordship one day and tell he that he have arrive at a much higher situation than ever he expect that he be now able to repay what he lordship have advance and beg he would accept of it the earl be please with the generous gratitude and genteel offer of the man but refuse it mr boyd also tell we cum the quaker first begin to distinguish himself by write against dr leechman on prayer -lrb- 309 -rrb- to prove it unnecessary as god know best what should be and will order it without we asking : -- the old hackneyed objection when we return to the house we find coffee and tea in the drawing-room lady errol be not there be as i suppose engage with she young family there be a bow-window front the sea dr johnson repeat the ode _ jam sati terri _ -lrb- 310 -rrb- while mr boyd be with he patient he speak well in favor of entail -lrb- 311 -rrb- to preserve line of man whom mankind be accustom to reverence he opinion be that so much land should be entail as that family should never fall into contempt and as much left free as to give they all the advantage of property in case of any emergency ` if -lrb- say he -rrb- the nobility be suffer to sink into indigence -lrb- 312 -rrb- they of course become corrupt they be ready to do whatever the king choose therefore it be fit they should be keep from become poor unless it be fix that when they fall below a certain standard of wealth they shall lose they peerage -lrb- 313 -rrb- we know the house of peer have make noble stand when the house of common dare not the two last year of parliament they dare not contradict the populace -lrb- 314 -rrb- ' this room be ornament with a number of fine print and with a whole length picture of lord errol by sir joshua reynold this lead dr johnson and I to talk of we amiable and elegant friend whose panegyrick he conclude by say ` sir joshua reynolds sir be the most invulnerable man i know the man with whom if you should quarrel you would find the most difficulty how to abuse -lrb- 315 -rrb- ' dr johnson observe the situation here be the noblest he have ever see -- better than mount edgecumbe reckon the first in england because at mount edgecumbe -lrb- 316 -rrb- the sea be bound by land on the other side and though there be there the grandeur of a fleet there be also the impression of there be a dock-yard the circumstance of which be not agreeable at slain be a excellent old house the noble owner have build of brick along the square in the inside a gallery both on the first and second story the house be no higher so that he have always a dry walk and the room to which formerly there be no approach but through each other have now all separate entry from the gallery which be hang with hogarth 's work and other print we go and sit a while in the library there be a valuable numerous collection it be chiefly make by mr falconer husband to the late countess of errol in she own right this earl have add a good many modern book about nine the earl come home captain gordon of park be with he he lordship put dr johnson in mind of they have dine together in london along with mr beauclerk i be exceedingly please with lord errol he dignified person and agreeable countenance with the most unaffected affability give I high satisfaction from perhaps a weakness or as i rather hope more fancy and warmth of feeling than be quite reasonable my mind be ever impress with admiration for person of high birth and i could with the most perfect honesty expatiate on lord errol 's good quality but he stand in no need of my praise he agreeable manners and softness of address prevent that constraint which the idea of he be lord high constable of scotland -lrb- 317 -rrb- might otherwise have occasion he talk very easily and sensibly with he learn guest i observe that dr johnson though he shew that respect to he lordship which from principle he always do to high rank yet when they come to argument maintain that manliness which become the force and vigor of he understand to shew external deference to we superior be proper : to seem to yield to they in opinion be meanness -lrb- 318 -rrb- the earl say grace both before and after supper with much decency he tell we a story of a man who be execute at perth some year ago for murder a woman who be with child by he and a former child he have by she he hand be cut off : he be then pull up but the rope break and he be force to lie a hour on the ground till another rope be bring from perth the execution be in a wood at some distance -- at the place where the murder be commit _ ` there _ -lrb- say my lord -rrb- _ i see the hand of providence _ ' i be really happy here i saw in this nobleman the best disposition and best principle and i see he _ in my mind 's eye _ -lrb- 319 -rrb- to be the representative of the ancient boyd of kilmarnock i be afraid he might have urge drinking as i believe he use formerly to do but he drink port and water out of a large glass himself and let we do as we pleased -lrb- 320 -rrb- he go with we to we room at night say he take the visit very kindly and tell I my father and he be very old acquaintance -- that i now know the way to slain and he hope to see I there again i have a most elegant room but there be a fire in it which blaze and the sea to which my window look roar and the pillow be make of the feather of some sea-fowl which have to I a disagreeable smell so that by all these cause i be keep awake a good while i saw in imagination lord errol 's father lord kilmarnock -lrb- 321 -rrb- -lrb- who be behead on tower-hill in 1746 -rrb- and i be somewhat dreary but the thought do not last long and i fall asleep Wednesday August 25 we get up between seven and eight and find mr boyd in the dining-room with tea and coffee before he to give we breakfast we be in a admirable humor lady errol have give each of we a copy of a ode by beattie on the birth of she son lord hay mr boyd ask dr johnson how he like it dr johnson who do not admire it get off very well by take it out and read the second and third stanza of it with much melody this without he say a word pleased mr boyd he observe however to dr johnson that the expression as to the family of errol ' a thousand year have see it shine ' compare with what go before be a anticlimax and that it would have be better ` age have see ' & c dr johnson say ` so great a number as a thousand be better _ dolus latet in universalibus _ age might be only two age ' he talk of the advantage of keep up the connection of relationship which produce much kindness ` every man -lrb- say he -rrb- who come into the world have need of friend if he have to get they for himself half he life be spend before he merit be known relation be a man 's ready friend who support he when a man be in real distress he fly into the arm of he relation a old lawyer who have much experience in make will tell I that after people have deliberate long and thought of many for they executor they settle at last by fix on they relation this shew the universality of the principle ' i regret the decay of respect for man of family and that a nabob now would carry a election from they johnson ` why sir the nabob will carry it by means of he wealth in a country where money be highly value as it must be where nothing can be have without money but if it come to personal preference the man of family will always carry it -lrb- 322 -rrb- there be generally a _ scoundrelism _ about a low man -lrb- 323 -rrb- ' mr boyd say that be a good _ ism _ i say i believe mankind be happier in the ancient feudal state -lrb- 324 -rrb- of subordination than they be in the modern state of independency johnson ` to be sure the _ chief _ be : but we must think of the number of individual that _ they _ be less happy seem plain for that state from which all escape as soon as they can and to which none return after they have leave it must be less happy and this be the case with the state of dependance on a chief or great man ' i mention the happiness of the french in they subordination by the reciprocal benevolence and attachment between the great and those in lower rank -lrb- 325 -rrb- mr boyd give we a instance of they gentlemanly spirit a old chevalier de malthe of ancient _ noblesse _ but in low circumstance be in a coffee-house at paris where be julien the great manufacturer at the gobelin of the fine tapestry so much distinguish both for the figure and the _ color _ the chevalier 's carriage be very old say julien with a plebeian insolence ' i think sir you have better have you carriage new paint ' the chevalier look at he with indignant contempt and answer ` well sir you may take it home and _ dye _ it ' all the coffee-house rejoice at julien 's confusion we set out about nine dr johnson be curious to see one of those structure which northern antiquarian call a druid 's temple i have a recollection of one at strichen which i have see fifteen year ago so we go four mile out of we road after pass old deer and go thither mr fraser the proprietor be at home and shew it to we but i have augment it in my mind for all that remain be two stone set up on end with a long one lay upon they as be usual and one stone at a little distance from they that stone be the capital one of the circle which surround what now remain mr fraser be very hospitable -lrb- 326 -rrb- there be a fair at strichen and he have several of he neighbor from it at dinner one of they dr fraser who have be in the army remember to have see dr johnson at a lecture on experimental philosophy at lichfield the doctor recollect be at the lecture and he be surprise to find here somebody who know he mr fraser send a servant to conduct we by a short passage into the high-road i observe to dr johnson that i have a most disagreeable notion of the life of country gentleman that i leave mr fraser just now as one leave a prisoner in a jail dr johnson say that i be right in think they unhappy for that they have not enough to keep they mind in motion -lrb- 327 -rrb- i start a think this afternoon which amuse we a great part of the way ` if -lrb- say i -rrb- we club should come and set up in st andrew as a college to teach all that each of we can in the several department of learning and taste we should rebuild the city : we should draw a wonderful concourse of student ' dr johnson enter fully into the spirit of this project we immediately fall to distribute the office i be to teach civil and scotch law -lrb- 328 -rrb- burke politick and eloquence garrick the art of publick speaking langton be to be we grecian -lrb- 329 -rrb- colman we latin professor -lrb- 330 -rrb- nugent to teach physick -lrb- 331 -rrb- lord charlemont modern history -lrb- 332 -rrb- beauclerk natural philosophy -lrb- 333 -rrb- vesey irish antiquity or celtick learning -lrb- 334 -rrb- jone oriental learning -lrb- 335 -rrb- goldsmith poetry and ancient history chamier commercial politick -lrb- 336 -rrb- reynold painting and the art which have beauty for they object chamber the law of england -lrb- 337 -rrb- dr johnson at first say ` i 'll trust theology to nobody but myself ' but upon due consideration that percy be a clergyman it be agree that percy should teach practical divinity and british antiquity dr johnson himself logick metaphysick -lrb- 338 -rrb- and scholastick divinity in this manner do we amuse ourselves -- each suggest and each vary or add till the whole be adjust dr johnson say we only want a mathematician since dyer -lrb- 339 -rrb- die who be a very good one but as to every thing else we should have a very capital university -lrb- 340 -rrb- we get at night to banff i send joseph on to duff-house but earl fife be not at home which i regret much as we should have have a very elegant reception from he lordship we find here but a indifferent inn -lrb- 341 -rrb- dr johnson write a long letter to mr thrale i wonder to see he write so much so easily he verify he own doctrine that ' a man may always write when he will set himself _ doggedly _ to it -lrb- 342 -rrb- ' Thursday August 26 we get a fresh chaise here a very good one and very good horse we breakfast at cullen they set down dry haddock broil along with we tea i eat one but dr johnson be disgust by the sight of they so they be remove -lrb- 343 -rrb- cullen have a comfortable appearance though but a very small town and the house mostly poor building i call on mr robertson who have the charge of lord findlater 's affair and be formerly lord monboddo 's clerk be three time in france with he and translate condamine 's _ account of the savage girl _ to which he lordship write a preface contain several remark of he own robertson say he do not believe so much as he lordship do that it be plain to he the girl confound what she imagine with what she remember : that besides she perceive condamine and lord monboddo form theory and she adapt she story to they dr johnson say ` it be a pity to see lord monboddo publish such notion as he have do a man of sense and of so much elegant learning there would be little in a fool do it we should only laugh but when a wise man do it we be sorry other people have strange notion but they conceal they if they have tail they hide they but monboddo be as jealous of he tail as a squirrel ' i shall here put down some more remark of dr johnson 's on lord monboddo which be not make exactly at this time but come in well from connection he say he do not approve of a judge 's call himself _ farmer _ burnett -lrb- 344 -rrb- and go about with a little round hat -lrb- 345 -rrb- he laugh heartily at he lordship 's say he be a _ enthusiastical _ farmer ` for -lrb- say he -rrb- what can he do in farming by he _ enthusiasm _ ' here however i think dr johnson mistaken he who wish to be successful or happy ought to be enthusiastical that be to say very keen in all the occupation or diversion of life a ordinary gentleman-farmer will be satisfy with look at he field once or twice a day : a enthusiastical farmer will be constantly employ on they will have he mind earnestly engage will talk perpetually of they but dr johnson have much of the _ nil admirarus _ -lrb- 346 -rrb- in smaller concern that survey of life which give birth to he _ vanity of human wish _ early sober he mind besides so great a mind as he can not be move by inferior object : a elephant do not run and skip like lesser animal mr robertson send a servant with we to shew we through lord findlater 's wood by which we way be shorten and we see some part of he domain which be indeed admirably lay out dr johnson do not choose to walk through it he always say that he be not come to scotland to see fine place of which there be enough in england but wild object -- mountain -- waterfall -- peculiar manners in short thing which he have not see before i have a notion that he at no time have have much taste for rural beauty i have myself very little -lrb- 347 -rrb- dr johnson say there be nothing more contemptible than a country gentleman live beyond he income and every year grow poorer and poorer -lrb- 348 -rrb- he speak strongly of the influence which a man have by be rich ' a man -lrb- say he -rrb- who keep he money have in reality more use from it than he can have by spend it ' i observe that this look very like a paradox but he explain it thus : ` if it be certain that a man would keep he money lock up for ever to be sure he would have no influence but as so many want money and he have the power of give it and they know not but by gain he favor they may obtain it the rich man will always have the greatest influence he again who lavish he money be laugh at as foolish and in a great degree with justice consider how much be spend from vanity even those who partake of a man 's hospitality have but a transient kindness for he if he have not the command of money people know he can not help they if he would whereas the rich man always can if he will and for the chance of that will have much weight ' boswell ` but philosopher and satirist have all treat a miser as contemptible ' johnson ` he be so philosophically but not in the practice of life -lrb- 349 -rrb- ' boswell ` let I see now : -- i do not know the instance of miser in england so as to examine into they influence ' johnson ` we have have few miser in england ' boswell ` there be lowther -lrb- 350 -rrb- ' johnson ` why sir lowther by keep he money have the command of the county which the family have now lose by spend it -lrb- 351 -rrb- i take it he lend a great deal and that be the way to have influence and yet preserve one 's wealth a man may lend he money upon very good security and yet have he debtor much under he power ' boswell ` no doubt sir he can always distress he for the money as no man borrow who be able to pay on demand quite conveniently ' we dine at elgin and see the noble ruin of the cathedral though it rain much dr johnson examine they with a most patient attention he could not here feel any abhorrence at the scottish reformer -lrb- 352 -rrb- for he have be tell by lord haile that it be destroy before the reformation by the lord of badenoch -lrb- 353 -rrb- who have a quarrel with the bishop the bishop 's house and those of the other clergy which be still pretty entire do not seem to have be proportion to the magnificence of the cathedral which have be of great extent and have very fine carve work the ground within the wall of the cathedral be employ as a burying-place the family of gordon have they vault here but it have nothing grand we pass gordon castle -lrb- 354 -rrb- this forenoon which have a princely appearance fochaber the neighbouring village be a poor place many of the house be ruinous but it be remarkable they have in general orchard well store with apple-tree -lrb- 355 -rrb- elgin have what in england be call piazza that run in many place on each side of the street it must have be a much better place formerly probably it have piazza all along the town as i have see at bologna i approve much of such structure in a town on account of they conveniency in wet weather dr johnson disapprove of they ` because -lrb- say he -rrb- it make the under story of a house very dark which greatly over-balance the conveniency when it be consider how small a part of the year it rain how few be usually in the street at such time that many who be might as well be at home and the little that people suffer suppose they to be as much wet as they commonly be in walk a street ' we fare but ill at we inn here and dr johnson say this be the first time he have see a dinner in scotland that he could not eat -lrb- 356 -rrb- in the afternoon we drive over the very heath where macbeth meet the witch accord to tradition -lrb- 357 -rrb- dr johnson again -lrb- 358 -rrb- solemnly repeat -- ` how far be ' t call to fore what be these so wither would and so wild in they attire that look not like the inhabitant o ' the earth and yet be o not ' he repeat a good deal more of macbeth he recitation -lrb- 359 -rrb- be grand and affect and as sir joshua reynold have observe to I have no more tone than it should have : it be the better for it he then parody the _ all-hail _ of the witch to macbeth address himself to I i have purchase some land call _ dalblair _ and as in scotland it be customary to distinguish land man by the name of they estate i have thus two title _ dalblair _ and young _ auchinleck _ so my friend in imitation of ` all hail macbeth hail to thee thane of cawdor ' condescend to amuse himself with utter ` all hail dalblair hail to thee laird of auchinleck -lrb- 360 -rrb- ' we get to fore -lrb- 361 -rrb- at night and find a admirable inn in which dr johnson be please to meet with a landlord who style himself ` wine-cooper from london ' Friday August 27 it be dark when we come to fore last night so we do not see what be call king duncan 's monument -lrb- 362 -rrb- i shall now mark some gleanings of dr johnson 's conversation i speak of _ leonida _ -lrb- 363 -rrb- and say there be some good passage in it johnson ` why you must _ seek _ for they ' he say paul whitehead 's _ manners _ -lrb- 364 -rrb- be a poor performance speaking of derrick he tell I ` he have a kindness for he and have often say that if he letter have be write by one of a more established name they would have be think very pretty letter -lrb- 365 -rrb- ' this morning i introduce the subject of the origin of evil -lrb- 366 -rrb- johnson ` moral evil be occasion by free will which imply choice between good and evil with all the evil that there be there be no man but would rather be a free agent than a mere machine without the evil and what be best for each individual must be best for the whole if a man would rather be the machine i can not argue with he he be a different be from I ' boswell ' a man as a machine may have agreeable sensation for instance he may have pleasure in musick ' johnson ` no sir he can not have pleasure in musick at least no power of produce musick for he who can produce musick may let it alone : he who can play upon a fiddle may break it : such a man be not a machine ' this reasoning satisfy I it be certain there can not be a free agent unless there be the power of be evil as well as good we must take the inherent possibility of thing into consideration in we reasoning or conjecture concern the work of god we come to nairn to breakfast though a county town and a royal burgh it be a miserable place over the room where we sit a girl be spin wool with a great wheel and singing a erse song -lrb- 367 -rrb- : ` i 'll warrant you -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- one of the song of ossian ' he then repeat these line : -- ` verse sweeten toil however rude the sound all at she work the village maiden sing nor while she turn the giddy wheel around revolve the sad vicissitude of thing -lrb- 368 -rrb- ' i think i have hear these line before johnson ' i fancy not sir for they be in a detach poem the name of which i do not remember write by one giffard a parson ' i expect mr kenneth m ` aulay -lrb- 369 -rrb- the minister of calder who publish the history of st kilda -lrb- 370 -rrb- a book which dr johnson like would have meet we here as i have write to he from aberdeen but i receive a letter from he tell I that he could not leave home as he be to administer the sacrament the follow Sunday and earnestly request to see we at he manse ` we 'll go ' say dr johnson which we accordingly do mrs m ` aulay receive we and tell we she husband be in the church distribute token -lrb- 371 -rrb- we arrive between twelve and one o'clock and it be near three before he come to we dr johnson thank he for he book and say ` it be a very pretty piece of topography ' m ` aulay do not seem much to mind the compliment from he conversation dr johnson be persuade that he have not write the book which go under he name i myself always suspect so and i have be tell it be write by the learn dr john m ` pherson of sky -lrb- 372 -rrb- from the material collect by m ` aulay dr johnson say privately to I ` there be a combination in it of which m ` aulay be not capable -lrb- 373 -rrb- ' however he be exceedingly hospitable and as he obligingly promise we a route for we tour through the western isle we agree to stay with he all night after dinner we walk to the old castle of calder -lrb- pronounced cawder -rrb- the thane of cawdor 's seat i be sorry that my friend this ` prosperous gentleman -lrb- 374 -rrb- ' be not there the old tower must be of great antiquity -lrb- 375 -rrb- there be a draw-bridge -- what have be a moat -- and a ancient court there be a hawthorn-tree which rise like a wooden pillar through the room of the castle for by a strange conceit the wall have be build round it the thickness of the wall the small slaunting window and a great iron door at the entrance on the second story as you ascend the stair all indicate the rude time in which this castle be erect there be here some large venerable tree i be afraid of a quarrel between dr johnson and mr m ` aulay who talk slightingly of the lower english clergy the doctor give he a frown look and say ` this be a day of novelty i have see old tree in scotland and i have hear the english clergy treat with disrespect -lrb- 376 -rrb- ' i dread that a whole evening at calder manse would be heavy however mr grant a intelligent and well-bred minister in the neighborhood be there and assist we by he conversation dr johnson talking of hereditary occupation in the highland say ` there be no harm in such a custom as this but it be wrong to enforce it and oblige a man to be a taylor or a smith because he father have be one ' this custom however be not peculiar to we highland it be well know that in indium a similar practice prevail mr m ` aulay begin a rhapsody against creed and confession dr johnson shew that ` what he call _ imposition _ be only a voluntary declaration of agreement in certain article of faith which a church have a right to require just as any other society can insist on certain rule be observe by its member nobody be compel to be of the church as nobody be compel to enter into a society ' this be a very clear and just view of the subject : but m ` aulay could not be drive out of he track dr johnson say ` sir you be a _ bigot to laxness _ ' mr m ` aulay and i lay the map of scotland before we and he point out a route for we from inverness by fort augustus to glenelg sky mull icolmkill lorn and inverary which i write down as my father be to begin the northern circuit about the 18th of September it be necessary for we either to make we tour with great expedition so as to get to auchinleck before he set out or to protract it so as not to be there till he return which would be about the 10th of October by m ` aulay 's calculation we be not to land in lorn till the 2oth of September i think that the interruption by bad day or by occasional excursion might make it ten day later and i think too that we might perhaps go to benbeculum and visit clanranald which would take a week of itself dr johnson go up with mr grant to the library which consist of a tolerable collection but the doctor think it rather a lady 's library with some latin book in it by chance than the library of a clergyman it have only two of the latin father and one of the greek father in latin i doubt whether dr johnson would be present at a presbyterian prayer i tell mr m ` aulay so and say that the doctor might sit in the library while we be at family worship mr m ` aulay say he would omit it rather than give dr johnson offence : but i would by no means agree that a excess of politeness even to so great a man should prevent what i esteem as one of the best pious regulation i know nothing more beneficial more comfortable more agreeable than that the little society of each family should regularly assemble and unite in praise and prayer to we heavenly father from whom we daily receive so much good and may hope for more in a higher state of existence i mention to dr johnson the over-delicate scrupulosity of we host he say he have no objection to hear the prayer this be a please surprise to I for he refuse to go and hear principal robertson -lrb- 377 -rrb- preach ' i will hear he -lrb- say he -rrb- if he will get up into a tree and preach but i will not give a sanction by my presence to a presbyterian assembly -lrb- 378 -rrb- ' mr grant have pray dr johnson say he prayer be a very good one but object to he not have introduce the lord 's prayer -lrb- 379 -rrb- he tell we that a italian of some note in london say once to he ` we have in we service a prayer call the _ pater noster _ which be a very fine composition i wonder who be the author of it ' a singular instance of ignorance in a man of some literature and general inquiry -lrb- 380 -rrb- Saturday August 28 dr johnson have bring a _ sallust _ with he in he pocket from edinburgh he give it last night to mr m ` aulay 's son a smart young lad about eleven year old dr johnson have give a account of the education at oxford in all its gradation the advantage of be a servitor to a youth of little fortune strike mr m ` aulay much -lrb- 381 -rrb- i observe it aloud dr johnson very handsomely and kindly say that if they would send they boy to he when he be ready for the university he would get he make a servitor and perhaps would do more for he he could not promise to do more but would undertake for the servitorship -lrb- 382 -rrb- i should have mention that mr white a welshman who have be many year factor -lrb- ie steward -rrb- on the estate of calder drink tea with we last night and upon get a note from mr m ` aulay ask we to he house we have not time to accept of he invitation he give we a letter of introduction to mr ferne master of store at fort george he shew it to I it recommend ` two celebrated gentleman no less than dr johnson _ author of he dictionary _ -- and mr boswell know at edinburgh by the name of paolus ' he say he hope i have no objection to what he have write if i have he would alter it i think it be a pity to check he effusion and acquiesce take care however to seal the letter that it might not appear that i have read it a conversation take place about say grace at breakfast -lrb- as we do in scotland -rrb- as well as at dinner and supper in which dr johnson say ` it be enough if we have state season of prayer no matter when -lrb- 383 -rrb- a man may as well pray when he mount he horse or a woman when she milk she cow -lrb- which mr grant tell we be do in the highland -rrb- as at meal and custom be to be follow -lrb- 384 -rrb- ' we proceed to fort george when we come into the square i send a soldier with the letter to mr ferne he come to we immediately and along with he come major _ brewse _ of the engineer pronounce _ bruce _ he say he believe it be originally the same norman name with bruce that he have dine at a house in london where be three bruce one of the irish line one of the scottish line and himself of the english line he say he be shewn it in the herald 's office spell fourteen different way -lrb- 385 -rrb- i tell he the different spelling of my name -lrb- 386 -rrb- dr johnson observe that there have be great dispute about the spelling of shakspear 's name at last it be think it would be settle by look at the original copy of he will but upon examine it he be find to have write it himself no less than three different way mr ferne and major brewse first carry we to wait on sir eyre coote -lrb- 387 -rrb- whose regiment the 37th be lie here and who then command the fort he ask we to dine with he which we agree to do before dinner we examine the fort the major explain the fortification to we and mr ferne give we a account of the store dr johnson talk of the proportion of charcoal and salt-petre in make gunpowder of granulate it and of give it a gloss -lrb- 388 -rrb- he make a very good figure upon these topick he say to I afterwards that ` he have talk _ ostentatiously _ -lrb- 389 -rrb- ' we repose ourselves a little in mr ferne 's house he have every thing in neat order as in england and a tolerable collection of book i look into pennant 's _ tour in scotland _ he say little of this fort but that ` the barracks & c form several street -lrb- 390 -rrb- ' this be aggrandising mr ferne observe if he have say they form a square with a row of building before it he would have give a juster description dr johnson remark ` how seldom description correspond with reality and the reason be that people do not write they till some time after and then they imagination have add circumstance ' we talk of sir adolphus oughton -lrb- 391 -rrb- the major say he know a great deal for a military man johnson ` sir you will find few man of any profession who know more sir adolphus be a very extraordinary man a man of boundless curiosity and unwearied diligence ' i know not how the major contrived to introduce the contest between warburton and lowth johnson ` warburton keep he temper all along while lowth be in a passion lowth publish some of warburton 's letter warburton draw _ he _ on to write some very abusive letter and then ask he leave to publish they which he know lowth could not refuse after what _ he _ have do so that warburton contrived that he should publish apparently with lowth 's consent what could not but shew lowth in a disadvantageous light -lrb- 392 -rrb- ' at three the drum beat for dinner i for a little while fancied myself a military man and it please I we go to sir eyre coote 's at the governor 's house and find he a most gentleman-like man he lady be a very agreeable woman with a uncommonly mild and sweet tone of voice there be a pretty large company : mr ferne major brewse and several officer sir eyre have come from the east-indy by land through the desart of arabium he tell we the arab could live five day without victuals and subsist for three week on nothing else but the blood of they camel who could lose so much of it as would suffice for that time without be exhaust he highly praise the virtue of the arab they fidelity if they undertake to conduct any person and say they would sacrifice they life rather than let he be rob dr johnson who be always for maintain the superiority of civilized over uncivilized man -lrb- 393 -rrb- say ` why sir i can see no superior virtue in this a serjeant and twelve man who be my guard will die rather than that i shall be rob ' colonel pennington of the 37th regiment take up the argument with a good deal of spirit and ingenuity pennington ` but the soldier be compel to this by fear of punishment ` johnson ` well sir the arab be compel by the fear of infamy ' pennington ` the soldier have the same fear of infamy and the fear of punishment besides so have less virtue because they act less voluntarily ' lady coote observe very well that it ought to be know if there be not among the arab some punishment for not be faithful on such occasion we talk of the stage i observe that we have not now such a company of actor as in the last age wilk -lrb- 394 -rrb- booth -lrb- 395 -rrb- & c & c johnson ` you think so because there be one who excel all the rest so much : you compare they with garrick and see the deficiency garrick 's great distinction be he universality -lrb- 396 -rrb- he can represent all mode of life but that of a easy fine breed gentleman -lrb- 397 -rrb- ' pennington ` he should give over play young part ' johnson ` he do not take they now but he do not leave off those which he have be use to play because he do they better than any one else can do they if you have generation of actor if they swarm like bee the young one might drive off the old mr cibber -lrb- 398 -rrb- i think get more reputation than she deserve as she have a great sameness though she expression be undoubtedly very fine mr clive -lrb- 399 -rrb- be the best player i ever see mr prichard -lrb- 400 -rrb- be a very good one but she have something affect in she manner : i imagine she have some player of the former age in she eye which occasion it ' colonel pennington say garrick sometimes fail in emphasis -lrb- 401 -rrb- as for instance in _ hamlet _ ' i will speak _ dagger _ to she but use _ none _ -lrb- 402 -rrb- ' instead of ' i will _ speak _ dagger to she but _ use _ none ' we have a dinner of two complete course variety of wine and the regimental band of musick playing in the square before the window after it i enjoy this day much we be quite easy and cheerful dr johnson say ' i shall always remember this fort with gratitude ' i could not help be strike with some admiration at find upon this barren sandy point such building -- such a dinner -- such company : it be like enchantment dr johnson on the other hand say to I more rationally that ` it do not strike _ he _ as any thing extraordinary because he know here be a large sum of money expend in build a fort here be a regiment if there have be less than what we find it would have surprise he ' _ he _ look coolly and deliberately through all the gradation : my warm imagination jump from the barren sand to the splendid dinner and brilliant company to borrow the expression of a absurd poet ` without and or if i leap from off the sand upon the cliff ' the whole scene give I a strong impression of the power and excellence of human art we leave the fort between six and seven o'clock : sir eyre coote colonel pennington and several more accompany we down stair and see we into we chaise there could not be greater attention pay to any visitor sir eyre speak of the hardship which dr johnson have before he boswell ` consider what he have say of we we must make he feel something rough in scotland ' sir eyre say to he ` you must change you name sir ' boswell ` ay to dr m ` gregor -lrb- 403 -rrb- ' we get safely to inverness and put up at mackenzie 's inn mr keith the collector of excise here my old acquaintance at ayr who have see we at the fort visit we in the evening and engage we to dine with he next day promise to breakfast with we and take we to the english chapel so that we be at once commodiously arrange not find a letter here that i expect i feel a momentary impatience to be at home transient cloud darken my imagination and in those cloud i see event from which i shrink but a sentence or two of the _ rambler 's _ conversation give I firmness and i consider that i be upon a expedition for which i have wish for year and the recollection of which would be a treasure to I for life Sunday August 29 mr keith breakfast with we dr johnson expatiate rather too strongly upon the benefit derive to scotland from the union -lrb- 404 -rrb- and the bad state of we people before it i be entertain with he copious exaggeration upon that subject but i be uneasy when people be by who do not know he as well as i do and may be apt to think he narrow-minded -lrb- 405 -rrb- i therefore divert the subject the english chapel to which we go this morning be but mean the altar be a bare fir table with a coarse stool for kneel on cover with a piece of thick sail-cloth double by way of cushion the congregation be small mr tait the clergyman read prayer very well though with much of the scotch accent he preach on ' _ love you enemy _ -lrb- 406 -rrb- ' it be remarkable that when talk of the connection amongst man he say that some connected themselves with man of distinguished talent and since they could not equal they try to deck themselves with they merit by be they companion the sentence be to this purpose it have a odd coincidence with what might be say of my connect myself with dr johnson -lrb- 407 -rrb- after church we walk down to the quay we then go to macbeth 's castle -lrb- 408 -rrb- i have a romantick satisfaction in see dr johnson actually in it it perfectly correspond with shakspear 's description which sir joshua reynold have so happily illustrate in one of he note on we immortal poet -lrb- 409 -rrb- : ` this castle have a pleasant seat : the air nimbly and sweetly recommend itself unto we gentle sense ' & c -lrb- 410 -rrb- just as we come out of it a raven perch on one of the chimney-top and croak then i repeat ' -- the raven himself be hoarse that croak the fatal entrance of duncan under my battlements -lrb- 411 -rrb- ' we dine at mr keith 's mr keith be rather too attentive to dr johnson ask he many question about he drinking only water he repress that observation by say to I ` you may remember that lady errol take no notice of this ' dr johnson have the happy art -lrb- for which i have hear my father praise the old earl of aberdeen -rrb- of instruct himself by make every man he meet tell he something of what he know best he lead keith to talk to he of the excise in scotland and in the course of conversation mention that he friend mr thrale the great brewer pay twenty thousand pound a year to the revenue and that he have four cask each of which hold sixteen hundred barrel -- above a thousand hogshead after this there be little conversation that deserve to be remembered i shall therefore here again glean what i have omit on former day dr gerrard at aberdeen tell we that when he be in wale he be shew a valley inhabit by dane who still retain they own language and be quite a distinct people dr johnson think it could not be true or all the kingdom must have hear of it he say to I as we travel ` these people sir that gerrard talk of may have somewhat of a _ peregrinity _ in they dialect which relation have augment to a different language ' i ask he if _ peregrinity _ be a english word : he laugh and say ` no ' i tell he this be the second time that i have hear he coin a word -lrb- 412 -rrb- when foote break he leg i observe that it would make he fitter for take off george faulkner as peter paragraph -lrb- 413 -rrb- poor george have a wooden leg dr johnson at that time say ` george will rejoice at the _ depeditation _ of foote ' and when i challenge that word laugh and own he have make it and add that he have not make above three or four in he _ dictionary _ -lrb- 414 -rrb- have conduct dr johnson to we inn i begged permission to leave he for a little that i might run about and pay some short visit to several good people of inverness he say to I ` you have all the old-fashioned principle good and bad ' i acknowledge i have that of attention to relation in the remotest degree or to worthy person in every state whom i have once know i inherit from my father it give I much satisfaction to hear every body at inverness speak of he with uncommon regard mr keith and mr grant whom we have see at mr m ` aulay 's sup with we at the inn we have roasted kid which dr johnson have never taste before he relish it much Monday August 30 this day we be to begin we _ equitation _ as i say for _ i _ would need make a word too it be remarkable that my noble and to I most constant friend the earl of pembroke -lrb- 415 -rrb- -lrb- who if there be too much ease on my part will please to pardon what he benevolent gay social intercourse and lively correspondence have insensibly produce -rrb- have since hit upon the very same word the title of the first edition of he lordship 's very useful book be in simple term _ a method of break horse and teaching soldier to ride _ the title of the second edition be ` military equitation -lrb- 416 -rrb- ' we might have take a chaise to fort augustus but have we not hire horse at inverness we should not have find they afterwards : so we resolve to begin here to ride we have three horse for dr johnson myself and joseph and one which carry we portmanteau and two highlander who walk along with we john hay and lauchland vass whom dr johnson have remember with credit in he journey -lrb- 417 -rrb- though he have omit they name dr johnson ride very well about three mile beyond inverness we see just by the road a very complete specimen of what be call a druid 's temple there be a double circle one of very large the other of smaller stone dr johnson justly observe that ` to go and see one druidical temple be only to see that it be nothing for there be neither art nor power in it and see one be quite enough ' it be a delightful day lochness and the road upon the side of it shaded with birch tree and the hill above it please we much the scene be as sequestered and agreeably wild as could be desire and for a time engross all we attention -lrb- 418 -rrb- to see dr johnson in any new situation be always a interesting object to I and as i see he now for the first time on horseback jaunt about at he ease in quest of pleasure and novelty the very different occupation of he former laborious life he admirable production he _ london _ he _ rambler _ & c & c immediately present themselves to my mind and the contrast make a strong impression on my imagination when we have advance a good way by the side of lochness i perceive a little hut with a old-looking woman at the door of it i think here might be a scene that would amuse dr johnson so i mention it to he ` let 's go in ' say he we dismount and we and we guide enter the hut it be a wretched little hovel of earth only i think and for a window have only a small hole which be stop with a piece of turf that be take out occasionally to let in light in the middle of the room or space which we enter be a fire of peat the smoke go out at a hole in the roof she have a pot upon it with goat 's flesh boil there be at one end under the same roof but divide by a kind of partition make of wattle a pen or fold in which we see a good many kid dr johnson be curious to know where she sleep i ask one of the guide who question she in erse she answer with a tone of emotion say -lrb- as he tell we -rrb- she be afraid we want to go to bed to she this _ coquetry _ or whatever it may be call of so wretched a being be truly ludicrous dr johnson and i afterwards be merry upon it i say it be he who alarm the poor woman 's virtue ` no sir -lrb- say he -rrb- she 'll say there come a wicked young fellow a wild dog who i believe would have ravish I have there not be with he a grave old gentleman who repress he : but when he get out of the sight of he tutor i 'll warrant you he 'll spare no woman he meet young or old ' ` no sir -lrb- i reply -rrb- she 'll say there be a terrible ruffian who would have force I have it not be for a civil decent young man who i take it be a angel send from heaven to protect I ' dr johnson would not hurt she delicacy by insist on ` see she bed-chamber ' like _ archer _ in the _ beau stratagem _ -lrb- 419 -rrb- but my curiosity be more ardent i light a piece of paper and go into the place where the bed be there be a little partition of wicker rather more neatly do than that for the fold and close by the wall be a kind of bedstead of wood with heath upon it by way of bed at the foot of which i see some sort of blanket or cover roll up in a heap the woman 's name be fraser so be she husband 's he be a man of eighty mr fraser of balnain allow he to live in this hut and keep sixty goat for take care of he wood where he then be they have five child the eldest only thirteen two be go to inverness to buy meal -lrb- 420 -rrb- the rest be look after the goat this contented family have four stack of barley twenty-four sheaf in each they have a few fowl we be inform that they live all the spring without meal upon milk and curd and whey alone what they get for they goat kid and fowl maintain they during the rest of the year she ask we to sit down and take a dram i see one chair she say she be as happy as any woman in scotland she could hardly speak any english except a few detach word dr johnson be please at see for the first time such a state of human life she ask for snuff it be she luxury and she use a great deal we have none but give she sixpence a piece she then bring out she whiskey bottle i taste it as do joseph and we guide so i give she sixpence more she send we away with many prayer in erse we dine at a publick house call the general 's hut -lrb- 421 -rrb- from general wade who be lodge there when he command in the north near it be the meanest parish _ kirk _ i ever see it be a shame it should be on a high road after dinner we pass through a good deal of mountainous country i have know mr trapaud the deputy governor of fort augustus twelve year ago at a circuit at inverness where my father be judge i send forward one of we guide and joseph with a card to he that he might know dr johnson and i be come up leave it to he to invite we or not -lrb- 422 -rrb- it be dark when we arrive the inn be wretched government ought to build one or give the resident governor a additional salary as in the present state of thing he must necessarily be put to a great expence in entertaining traveller joseph announce to we when we alight that the governor wait for we at the gate of the fort we walk to it he meet we and with much civility conduct we to he house it be comfortable to find ourselves in a well-built little square and a neatly furnished house in good company and with a good supper before we in short with all the convenience of civilised life in the midst of rude mountain mr trapaud and the governor 's daughter and she husband captain newmarsh be all most obliging and polite the governor have excellent animal spirit the conversation of a soldier and somewhat of a frenchman to which he extraction entitle he he be brother to general cyrus trapaud we pass a very agreeable evening -lrb- 423 -rrb- Tuesday August 31 the governor have a very good garden we look at it and at the rest of the fort which be but small and may be command from a variety of hill around we also look at the galley or sloop belong to the fort which sail upon the loch and bring what be want for the garrison captain urie and darippe of the 15th regiment of foot breakfast with we they have serve in america and entertain dr johnson much with a account of the indian -lrb- 424 -rrb- he say he could make a very pretty book out of they be he to stay there governor trapaud be much strike with dr johnson ' i like to hear he -lrb- say he -rrb- it be so majestick i should be glad to hear he speak in you court ' he press we to stay dinner but i consider that we have a rude road before we which we could more easily encounter in the morning and that it be hard to say when we might get up be we to sit down to good entertainment in good company : i therefore beg the governor would excuse we here too i have another very please proof how much my father be regard the governor express the highest respect for he and bid I tell he that if he would come that way on the northern circuit he would do he all the honor of the garrison between twelve and one we set out and travel eleven mile through a wild country till we come to a house in glenmorison call _ anoch _ keep by a mcqueen -lrb- 425 -rrb- we landlord be a sensible fellow he have learn he grammar -lrb- 426 -rrb- and dr johnson justly observe that ' a man be the better for that as long as he live ' there be some book here : _ a treatise against drunkenness _ translate from the french a volume of _ the spectator _ a volume of _ prideaux 's connection _ and _ cyrus 's travels _ -lrb- 427 -rrb- mcqueen say he have more volume and he pride seem to be much pique that we be surprise at he have book near to this place we have pass a party of soldier under a serjeant 's command at work upon the road we give they two shilling to drink they come to we inn and make merry in the barn we go and pay they a visit dr johnson say ` come let 's go and give 'em another shill a-piece ' we do so and he be salute ` my lord ' by all of they he be really generous love influence and have the way of gain it he say ' i be quite feudal sir ' here i agree with he i say i regret i be not the head of a clan however though not possess of such a hereditary advantage i would always endeavor to make my tenant follow I i could not be a _ patriarchal _ chief but i would be a _ feudal _ chief the poor soldier get too much liquor some of they fight and leave blood upon the spot and cursed whiskey next morning the house here be build of thick turf and thatched with thinner turf and heath it have three room in length and a little room which project where we sit the side-wall be _ wainscot _ as dr johnson say with wicker very neatly plait we landlord have make the whole with he own hand after dinner mcqueen sit by we a while and talk with we he say all the laird of glenmorison 's people would bleed for he if they be well use but that seventy man have go out of the glen to america that he himself intend to go next year for that the rent of he farm which twenty year ago be only five pound be now raise to twenty pound that he could pay ten pound and live but no more -lrb- 428 -rrb- dr johnson say he wish m ` queen laird of glenmorison and the laird to go to america m ` queen very generously answer he should be sorry for it for the laird could not shift for himself in america as he could do i talk of the officer whom we have leave to-day how much service they have see and how little they get for it even of fame johnson ` sir a soldier get as little as any man can get ' boswell ` goldsmith have acquire more fame than all the officer last war who be not general ' -lrb- 429 -rrb- johnson ` why sir you will find ten thousand fit to do what they do before you find one who do what goldsmith have do you must consider that a thing be value accord to its rarity a pebble that pave the street be in itself more useful than the diamond upon a lady 's finger ' i wish we friend goldsmith have hear this -lrb- 430 -rrb- i yesterday express my wonder that john hay one of we guide who have be press aboard a man of war do not choose to continue in it longer than nine month after which time he get off johnson ` why

observe he might serve a campaign johnson ' i could do all that can be do by patience : whether i should have strength enough i know not ' he be in excellent humor to see the rambler as i see he to-night be really a amusement i yesterday tell he i be think of write a poetical letter to he _ on he return from scotland _ in the style of swift 's humorous epistle in the character of mary gulliver to she husband captain lemuel gulliver on he return to england from the country of the houyhnhum : -- ` at early morn i to the market haste studious in ev'ry thing to please thy taste a curious _ fowl _ and _ sparagrass _ i choose -lrb- for i remember you be fond of those : -rrb- three shilling cost the first the last sev 'n groat sullen you turn from both and call for oats -lrb- 434 -rrb- : ' he laugh and ask in whose name i would write it i say in mr thrale 's he be angry ` sir if you have any sense of decency or delicacy you will not do that ' boswell ` then let it be in cole 's the landlord of the _ mitre tavern _ where we have so often sit together ' johnson ` ay that may do ' after we have offer up we private devotions and have chat a little from we bed dr johnson say ` god bless we both for jesus christ 's sake good night ' i pronounced ` aman ' he fall asleep immediately i be not so fortunate for a long time i fancied myself bit by innumerable vermin under the clothes and that a spider be travel from the _ wainscot _ towards my mouth at last i fall into insensibility Wednesday September 1 i awaked very early i begin to imagine that the landlord be about to emigrate might murder we to get we money and lay it upon the soldier in the barn such groundless fear will arise in the mind before it have resume its vigor after sleep dr johnson have have the same kind of idea for he tell I afterwards that he consider so many soldier have see we would be witness should any harm be do and that circumstance i suppose he consider as a security -lrb- 435 -rrb- when i get up i find he sound asleep in he miserable _ stye _ as i may call it with a color handkerchief tie round he head with difficulty could i awaken he it remind I of henry the fourth 's fine soliloquy on sleep for there be here as _ uneasy a pallet _ -lrb- 436 -rrb- as the poet 's imagination could possibly conceive a _ red coat _ of the 15th regiment whether officer or only serjeant i could not be sure come to the house in he way to the mountain to shoot deer which it seem the laird of glenmorison do not hinder any body to do few indeed can do they harm we have he to breakfast with we we get away about eight m ` queen walk some mile to give we a convoy he have in 1745 join the highland army at fort augustus and continue in it till after the battle of culloden as he narrate the particulars of that ill-advised but brave attempt i could not refrain from tear there be a certain association of idea in my mind upon that subject by which i be strongly affect the very highland name or the sound of a bagpipe will stir my blood and fill I with a mixture of melancholy and respect for courage with pity for a unfortunate and superstitious regard for antiquity and thoughtless inclination for war in short with a crowd of sensation with which sober rationality have nothing to do we pass through glensheal with prodigious mountain on each side we see where the battle be fight in the year 1719 -lrb- 437 -rrb- dr johnson own he be now in a scene of as wild nature as he could see but he correct I sometimes in my inaccurate observation ` there -lrb- say i -rrb- be a mountain like a cone ' johnson ` no sir it would be call so in a book and when a man come to look at it he see it be not so it be indeed point at the top but one side of it be larger than the other -lrb- 438 -rrb- ' another mountain i call immense johnson ` no it be no more than a considerable protuberance ' we come to a rich green valley comparatively speak and stop a while to let we horse rest and eat grass -lrb- 439 -rrb- we soon afterwards come to auchnasheal a kind of rural village a number of cottage be build together as we see all along in the highland we pass many mile this day without see a house but only little summer-huts call _ shieling _ evan campbell servant to mr murchison factor to the laird of macleod in glenelg run along with we to-day he be a very obliging fellow at auchnasheal we sit down on a green turf seat at the end of a house they bring we out two wooden dish of milk which we taste one of they be froth like a syllabub i see a woman prepare it with such a stick as be use for chocolate and in the same manner we have a considerable circle about we man woman and child all m ` craas lord seaforth 's people not one of they could speak english i observe to dr johnson it be much the same as be with a tribe of indian johnson ` yes sir but not so terrifying -lrb- 440 -rrb- ' i give all who choose it snuff and tobacco governor trapaud have make we buy a quantity at fort augustus and put they up in small parcel i also give each person a bit of wheat bread which they have never taste before i then give a penny apiece to each child i tell dr johnson of this upon which he call to joseph and we guide for change for a shilling and declare that he would distribute among the child upon this be announce in erse there be a great stir not only do some child come run down from neighbour hut but i observe one black-haired man who have be with we all along have go off and return bring a very young child my fellow traveller then order the child to be draw up in a row and he deal about he copper and make they and they parent all happy the poor m ` craas whatever may be they present state be of considerable estimation in the year 1715 when there be a line in a song ` and aw the brave m ` craa be come -lrb- 441 -rrb- ' there be great diversity in the face of the circle around we : some be as black and wild in they appearance as any american savage whatever one woman be as comely almost as the figure of sappho as we see it paint we ask the old woman the mistress of the house where we have the milk -lrb- which by the bye dr johnson tell I for i do not observe it myself be build not of turf but of stone -rrb- what we should pay she say what we please one of we guide ask she in erse if a shilling be enough she say ` yes ' but some of the man bid she ask more -lrb- 442 -rrb- this vex I because it shew a desire to impose upon stranger as they know that even a shilling be high payment the woman however honestly persist in she first price so i give she half a crown thus we have one good scene of life uncommon to we the people be very much pleased give we many blessing and say they have not have such a day since the old laird of macleod 's time dr johnson be much refresh by this repast he be please when i tell he he would make a good chief he say ` be i a chief i would dress my servant better than myself and knock a fellow down if he look saucy to a macdonald in rag : but i would not treat man as brute i would let they know why all of my clan be to have attention pay to they i would tell my upper servant why and make they tell the other ' we ride on well -lrb- 443 -rrb- till we come to the high mountain call the rattakin by which time both dr johnson and the horse be a good deal fatigue it be a terrible steep to climb notwithstanding the road be form slant along it however we make it out on the top of it we meet captain m ` leod of balmenoch -lrb- a dutch officer who have come from sky -rrb- ride with he sword sling across he he ask ` be this mr boswell ' which be a proof that we be expect go down the hill on the other side be no easy task as dr johnson be a great weight the two guide agree that he should ride the horse alternately hay 's be the two best and the doctor would not ride but upon one or other of they a black or a brown but as hay complain much after ascend the _ rattakin _ the doctor be prevail with to mount one of vass 's grey as he ride upon it down hill it do not go well and he grumble i walk on a little before but be excessively entertain with the method take to keep he in good humor hay lead the horse 's head talk to dr johnson as much as he could and -lrb- have hear he in the forenoon express a pastoral pleasure on see the goat browz -rrb- just when the doctor be utter he displeasure the fellow cry with a very highland accent ` see such pretty goat ' then he whistle _ whu _ and make they jump little do he conceive what dr johnson be here now be a common ignorant highland clown imagine that he could divert as one do a child -- _ dr samuel johnson _ the ludicrousness absurdity and extraordinary contrast between what the fellow fancied and the reality be truly comick it grow dusky and we have a very tedious ride for what be call five mile but i be sure would measure ten we have no conversation i be ride forward to the inn at glenelg on the shore opposite to sky that i might take proper measure before dr johnson who be now advance in dreary silence hay lead he horse should arrive vass also walk by the side of he horse and joseph follow behind : as therefore he be thus attend and seem to be in deep meditation i think there could be no harm in leave he for a little while he call I back with a tremendous shout and be really in a passion with I for leave he i tell he my intention but he be not satisfied and say ` do you know i should as soon have think of pick a pocket as do so ' boswell ' i be divert with you sir ' johnson ` sir i could never be divert with incivility do such a thing make one lose confidence in he who have do it as one can not tell what he may do next ' he extraordinary warmth confound I so much that i justified myself but lamely to he yet my intention be not improper i wish to get on to see how we be to be lodge and how we be to get a boat all which i think i could best settle myself without he have any trouble to apply he great mind to minute particulars be wrong : it be like take a immense balance such as be keep on quay for weigh cargo of ship -- to weigh a guinea i know i have neat little scale which would do better and that he attention to every thing which fall in he way and he uncommon desire to be always in the right would make he weigh if he know of the particulars : it be right therefore for I to weigh they and let he have they only in effect i however continue to ride by he find he wish i should do so as we pass the barracks at bernéra i look at they wishfully as soldier have always every thing in the best order : but there be only a serjeant and a few man there we come on to the inn at glenelg there be no provender for we horse so they be send to grass with a man to watch they a maid shew we up stair into a room damp and dirty with bare wall a variety of bad smell a coarse black greasy fir table and form of the same kind and out of a wretched bed start a fellow from he sleep like edgar in _ king lear _ -lrb- 444 -rrb- ' _ poor tom 's a cold _ -lrb- 445 -rrb- ' this inn be furnish with not a single article that we could either eat or drink -lrb- 446 -rrb- but mr murchison factor to the laird of macleod in glenelg send we a bottle of rum and some sugar with a polite message to acquaint we that he be very sorry that he do not hear of we till we have pass he house otherwise he should have insist on we sleep there that night and that if he be not oblige to set out for inverness early next morning he would have wait upon we such extraordinary attention from this gentleman to entire stranger deserve the most honorable commemoration we bad accommodation here make I uneasy and almost fretful dr johnson be calm i say he be so from vanity johnson ` no sir it be from philosophy ' it pleased I to see that the _ rambler _ could practice so well he own lesson i resume the subject of my leave he on the road and endeavor to defend it better he be still violent upon that head and say ` sir have you go on i be think that i should have return with you to edinburgh and then have part from you and never speak to you more ' i send for fresh hay with which we make bed for ourselves each in a room equally miserable like wolfe we have a ` choice of difficulty -lrb- 447 -rrb- ' dr johnson make thing easier by comparison at m ` queen 's last night he observe that few be so well lodge in a ship to-night he say we be better than if we have be upon the hill he lay down button up in he great coat i have my sheet spread on the hay and my clothes and great coat lay over I by way of blanket Thursday September 2 i have sleep ill dr johnson 's anger have affect I much i consider that without any bad intention i might suddenly forfeit he friendship and be impatient to see he this morning i tell he how uneasy he have make I by what he have say and remind he of he own remark at aberdeen upon old friendship be hastily break off he own he have speak to I in passion that he would not have do what he threaten and that if he have he should have be ten time worse than i that form intimacy would indeed be ` limn the water -lrb- 448 -rrb- ' be they liable to such sudden dissolution and he add ` let 's think no more o not ' boswell ` well then sir i shall be easy remember i be to have fair warning in case of any quarrel you be never to spring a mine upon I it be absurd in I to believe you ' johnson ` you deserve about as much as to believe I from night to morning ' after breakfast we get into a boat for sky it rain much when we set off but clear up as we advance one of the boatman who speak english say that a mile at land be two mile at sea i then observe that from glenelg to armidale in sky which be we present course and be call twelve be only six mile : but this he could not understand ` well -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- never talk to I of the native good sense of the highlander here be a fellow who call one mile two and yet can not comprehend that twelve such imaginary mile make in truth but six ' we reach the shore of armidale before one o'clock sir alexander m ` donald come down to receive we he and he lady -lrb- formerly miss bosville of yorkshire -lrb- 449 -rrb-

verdure than i expect to see in this climate and the scene be enliven by a number of little clear brook sir alexander macdonald have be a eton scholar -lrb- 452 -rrb- and be a gentleman of talent dr johnson have be very well pleased with he in london -lrb- 453 -rrb- but my fellow-traveller and i be now full of the old highland spirit and be dissatisfy at hearing of rack rent and emigration and find a chief not surround by he clan dr johnson say ` sir the highland chief should not be allow to go farther south than aberdeen a strong-minded man like sir jame macdonald -lrb- 454 -rrb- may be improve by a english education but in general they will be tame into insignificance ' we find here mr jane of aberdeenshire a naturalist jane say he have be at dr johnson 's in london with ferguson the astronomer -lrb- 455 -rrb- johnson ` it be strange that in such distant place i should meet with any one who know I i should have think i might hide myself in sky ' Friday September 3 this day prove wet we should have pass we time very uncomfortably have we not find in the house two chest of book which we eagerly ransack after dinner when i alone be leave at table with the few highland gentleman who be of the company have talk with very high respect of sir jame macdonald they be all so much affect as to shed tear one of they be mr donald macdonald who have be lieutenant of grenadier in the highland regiment raise by colonel montgomery now earl of eglintoune in the war before last one of those regiment which the late lord chatham pride himself in have bring from ` the mountain of the north -lrb- 456 -rrb- : ' by do which he contribute to extinguish in the highland the remains of disaffection to the present royal family from this gentleman 's conversation i first learn how very popular he colonel be among the highlander of which i have such continue proof during the whole course of my tour that on my return i could not help tell the noble earl himself that i do not before know how great a man he be we be advise by some person here to visit rasay in we way to dunvegan the seat of the laird of macleod be inform that the rev mr donald m ` queen be the most intelligent man

that he could get no distinct information about any thing from those with whom he converse -lrb- 457 -rrb- Saturday September 4 my endeavor to rouse the english-bred chieftain -lrb- 458 -rrb- in whose house we be to the feudal and patriarchal feeling prove ineffectual dr johnson this morning try to bring he to we way of think johnson ` be i in you place sir in seven year i would make this a independant island i would roast ox whole and hang out a flag as a signal to the macdonald to come and get beef and whiskey ' sir alexander be still start difficulty johnson ` nay sir if you be bear to object i have do with you sir i would have a magazine of arm ' sir alexander ` they would rust ' johnson ` let there be man to keep they clean you ancestor do not use to let they arm rust -lrb- 459 -rrb- ' we attempt in vain to communicate to he a portion of we enthusiasm he bear with so polite a good nature we warm and what some might call gothick expostulation on this subject that i should not forgive myself be i to record all that dr johnson 's ardor lead he to say -- this day be little better than a blank Sunday September 5 i walk to the parish church of slate which be a very poor one there be no church bell in the island i be tell there be once some what have become of they i could not learn the minister not be at home there be no service i go into the church and see the monument of sir jame macdonald which be elegantly execute at rome and have the follow inscription write by he friend george lord lyttelton : -- to the memory of sir jame macdonald bart who in the flower of youth have attain to so eminent a degree of knowledge in mathematics philosophy language and in every other branch of useful and polite learning as few have acquire in a long life wholly devoted to

where notwithstanding the difference of religion such extraordinary honor be pay to he memory as have never grace that of any other british subject since the death of sir philip sidney the fame he leave behind he be the best consolation to he afflict family and to he countryman in this isle for whose benefit he have plan many useful improvement which he fruitful genius suggest and he active

1768 -lrb- 461 -rrb- ' dr johnson say the inscription should have be in latin as every thing intend to be universal and permanent should be -lrb- 462 -rrb- this be a beautiful day my spirit be cheer by the mere effect of climate i have feel a return of spleen during my stay at armidale and have it not be that i have dr johnson to contemplate i should have sink into dejection but he firmness support I i look at he as a man whose head be turn giddy at sea look at a rock or any fixed object i wonder at he tranquillity he say ` sir when a man retire into a island he be to turn he thought entirely to another world he have do with this ' boswell ` it appear to I sir to be very difficult to unite a due attention to this world and that which be to come for if we engage eagerly in the affair of life we be apt to be totally forgetful of a future state and on the other hand a steady contemplation of the awful concern of eternity render all object here so insignificant as to make we indifferent and negligent about they ' johnson ` sir dr cheyne have lay down a rule to himself on this subject which should be imprint on every mind : -- _ to neglect nothing to secure my eternal peace more than if i have be certify i should die within the day : nor to mind any thing that my secular obligation and duty demand of I less than if i have be ensure to live fifty year more -lrb- 463 -rrb- _ ' i must here observe that though dr johnson appear now to be philosophically calm yet he genius do not shine forth as in company where i have listen to he with admiration the vigor of he mind be however sufficiently manifest by he discover no symptom of feeble relaxation in the dull ` weary flat and unprofitable -lrb- 464 -rrb- ' state in which we now be place i be incline to think that it be on this day he compose the follow ode upon the _ isle of sky _ which a few day afterwards he shew I at rasay : -- oda ponti profundis clausa recessibus strepens procellis rupibus obsita quam grata defesso virentem skia sinum nebulosa pandis he cura credo sedibus exulat he blanda certe pax habitat loci : non ira non moeror quieti insidia meditatur hori at non cavata rupe latescere menti nec

fallax exaestuantis pectoris impetum rex summe solus tu regis arbiter mentisque te tollente surgunt te recidunt moderante fluctus -lrb- 465 -rrb- after supper dr johnson tell we that isaac hawkin browne drink freely for thirty year and that he write he poem _ de animi immortalitate _ in some of the last of these year -lrb- 466 -rrb- i listen to this with the eagerness of one who conscious of be himself fond of wine be glad to hear that a man of so much genius and good thinking as browne have the same propensity -lrb- 467 -rrb- Monday September 6 we set out accompany by mr donald m ` leod

comfort of a table plentifully furnish -lrb- 470 -rrb- the satisfaction of which be heighten by a numerous and cheerful company and we for the first time have a specimen of the joyous social manners of the inhabitant of the highland they talk in they own ancient language with fluent vivacity and sing many erse song with such spirit that though dr johnson be treat with the greatest respect and attention there be moment in which he seem to be forget for myself though but a _ lowlander _ have pick up a few word of the language i presume to mingle in they mirth and join in the chorus with as much glee as any of the company dr johnson be fatigue with he journey retire early to he chamber where he compose the follow ode address to mr thrale -lrb- 471 -rrb- : -- oda permeo terras ubi nuda

we be therefore oblige to remain here it be impossible to cross the sea to rasay i employ a part of the forenoon in write this journal the rest of it be somewhat dreary from the gloominess of the weather and the uncertain state which we be in as we could not tell but it might clear up every hour nothing be more painful to the mind than a state of suspence especially when it depend upon the weather concern which there can be so little calculation as dr johnson say of we weariness on the Monday at aberdeen ` sensation be sensation -lrb- 476 -rrb- : ' corrichatachin which be last night a hospitable house be in my mind change to-day into a prison after dinner i read some of dr macpherson 's _ dissertation on the ancient caledonian _ -lrb- 477 -rrb- i be disgust by the unsatisfactory

chorus and all go well at length malcolm himself take a oar and row vigorously we sail along the coast of scalpa a rugged island about four mile in length dr johnson propose that he and i should buy it and find a good school and a episcopal church -lrb- malcolm -lrb- 487 -rrb- say he would come to it -rrb- and have a printing-press where he would print all the erse that could be find here i be strongly strike with we long project scheme of visit the hebride be realize -lrb- 488 -rrb- i call to he ` we be contend with sea ' which i think be the word of one of he letter to I -lrb- 489 -rrb- ` not much ' say he and though the wind make the sea lash considerably upon we he be not discompose after we be out of the shelter of scalpa and in the sound between it and rasay which extend about a league the wind make the sea very rough -lrb- 490 -rrb- i do not like it johnson ` this now be the atlantick if i should tell at a tea table in london that i have cross the atlantick in a open boat how they would shudder and what a fool they would think I to expose myself to such danger ' he then repeat horace 's ode -- ` otium divos rogat in patentus prensus aegaeo -- -lrb- 491 -rrb- ' in the confusion and hurry of this boisterous sail dr johnson 's spur of which joseph have charge be carry over-board into the sea and lose -lrb- 492 -rrb- this be the first misfortune that have befall we dr johnson be a little angry at first observe that ` there be something wild in let a pair of spur be carry into the sea out of a boat ' but then he remark ` that as jane the naturalist have say upon lose he pocket-book it be rather a inconvenience than a loss ' he tell we he now recollect that he dream the night before that he put he staff into a river and chance to let it go and it be carry down the stream and lose ` so now you see -lrb- say he -rrb- that i have lose my spur and this story be better than many of those which we have concern second sight and dream ' mr m ` queen say he do not believe the second sight that he never meet with any well attested instance and if he should he should impute they to chance because all who pretend to that quality often fail in they prediction though they take a great scope and sometimes interpret literally sometimes figuratively so as to suit the event he tell we that since he come to be minister of the parish where he now be the belief of witchcraft or charm be very common insomuch that he have many prosecution before he _ session _ -lrb- the parochial ecclesiastical court -rrb- against woman for have by these means carry off the milk from people 's cow he disregard they and there be not now the least vestige of that superstition he preach against it and in order to give a strong proof to the people that there be nothing in it he say from the pulpit that every woman in the parish be welcome to take the milk from he cow provide she do not touch they -lrb- 493 -rrb- dr johnson ask he as to _ fingal _ he say he could repeat some passage in the original that he hear he grandfather have a copy of it but that he could not affirm that ossian compose all that poem as it be now publish this come pretty much to what dr johnson have maintain -lrb- 494 -rrb- though he go farther and contend that it be no better than such a epick poem as he could make from the song of robin hood -lrb- 495 -rrb- that be to say that except a few passage there be nothing truly ancient but the name and some vague tradition mr m ` queen allege that homer be make up of detach fragment dr johnson deny this observe that it have be one work originally and that you could not put a book of the _ iliad _ out of its place and he believe the same might be say of the _ odyssey _ the approach to rasay be very please we see before we a beautiful bay well defend by a rocky coast a good family mansion a fine verdure about it -- with a considerable number of tree -- and beyond it hill and mountain in gradation of wildness we boatman sing with great spirit dr johnson observe that naval musick be very ancient as we come near the shore the singing of we rower be succeed by that of reaper who be busy at work and who seem to shout as much as to sing while they work with a bound activity -lrb- 496 -rrb- just as we land i observe a cross or rather the ruin of one upon a rock which have to I a please vestige of religion i perceive a large company come out from the house we meet they as we walk up there be rasay himself he brother dr macleod he nephew the laird of m ` kinnon the laird of macleod colonel macleod of talisker a officer in the dutch service a very genteel man and a faithful branch of the family mr macleod of muiravenside best know by the name of sandie macleod who be long in exile on account of the part which he take in 1745 and several other person we be welcome upon the green and conduct into the house where we be introduce to lady rasay who be surround by a numerous family consist of three son and ten daughter the laird of rasay be a sensible polite and most hospitable gentleman i be tell that he island of rasay and that of rona -lrb- from which the eldest son of the family have he title -rrb- and a considerable extent of land which he have in sky do not altogether yield he a very large revenue -lrb- 497 -rrb- : and yet he live in great splendor and so far be he from distressing he people that in the present rage for emigration not a man have leave he estate it be past six o'clock when we arrive some excellent brandy be serve round immediately accord to the custom of the highland where a dram be generally take every day they call it a _ scalch _ -lrb- 498 -rrb- on a side-board be place for we who have come off the sea a substantial dinner and a variety of wine then we have coffee and tea i observe in the room several elegantly bind book and other mark of improve life soon afterwards a fidler appear and a little ball begin rasay himself dance with as much spirit as any man and malcolm bound like a roe sandie macleod who have at time a excessive flow of spirit and have it now be in he day of abscond know by the name of _ m ` cruslick _ -lrb- 499 -rrb- which it seem be the designation of a kind of wild man in the highland something between proteus and don quixote and so he be call here he make much jovial noise dr johnson be so delighted with this scene that he say ' i know not how we shall get away ' it entertain I to observe he sit by while we dance sometimes in deep meditation -- sometimes smile complacently -- sometimes look upon hooke 's _ roman history _ -- and sometimes talk a little amidst the noise of the ball to mr donald m ` queen who anxiously gather knowledge from he he be please with m ` queen and say to I ` this be a critical man sir there must be great vigor of mind to make he cultivate learn so much in the isle of sky where he might do without it it be wonderful how many of the new publication he have there must be a snatch of every opportunity ' mr m ` queen tell I that he brother -lrb- who be the fourth generation of the family follow each other as minister of the parish of snizort -rrb- and he join together and buy from time to time such book as have reputation soon after we come in a black cock and gray hen which have be shoot be shewn with they feather on to dr johnson who have never see that species of bird before we have a company of thirty at supper and all be good humor and gaiety without intemperance Thursday September 9 at breakfast this morning among a profusion of other thing there be oat-cake make of what be call _ graddan _ meal that be meal make of grain separate from the husk and toast by fire instead of be thresh and kiln-dried this seem to be bad management as so much fodder be consume by it mr m ` queen however defend it by say that it be do the thing much quicker as one operation effect what be otherwise do by two he chief reason however be that the servant in sky be accord to he a faithless pack and steal what they can so that much be save by the corn passing but once through they hand as at each time they pilfer some it appear to I that the gradaning be a strong proof of the laziness of the highlander who will rather make fire act for they at the expence of fodder than labor themselves there be also what i can not help dislike at breakfast cheese : it be the custom over all the highland to have it and it often smell very strong and poison to a certain degree the elegance of a indian repast -lrb- 500 -rrb- the day be showery however rasay and i take a walk and have some cordial conversation i conceive a more than ordinary regard for this worthy gentleman he family have possess this island above four hundred year -lrb- 501 -rrb- it be the remains of the estate of macleod of lewi whom he represent when we return dr johnson walk with we to see the old chapel he be in fine spirit he say ' this be truly the patriarchal life : this be what we come to find ' after dinner m ` cruslick malcolm and i go out with gun to try if we could find any black-cock but we have no sport owe to a heavy rain i saw here what be call a danish fort we evening be pass as last night be one of we company i be tell have hurt himself by too much study particularly of infidel metaphysician of which he give a proof on second sight be mention he immediately retail some of the fallacious argument of voltaire and hume against miracle in general infidelity in a highland gentleman appear to I peculiarly offensive i be sorry for he as he have otherwise a good character i tell dr johnson that he have study himself into infidelity johnson ` then he must study himself out of it again that be the way drinking largely will sober he again ' Friday September 10 have resolve to explore the island of rasay which could be do only on foot i last night obtain my fellow-traveller 's permission to leave he for a day he be unable to take so hardy a walk old mr malcolm m ` cleod who have obligingly promise to accompany I be at my bed-side between five and six i spring up immediately and he and i attend by two other gentleman traverse the country during the whole of this day though we have pass over not less than four-and-twenty mile of very rugged ground and have a highland dance on the top of _ dun can _ the highest mountain in the island we return in the evening not at all fatigue and pique ourselves at not be outdo at the nightly ball by we less active friend who have remain at home my survey of rasay do not furnish much which can interest my reader i shall therefore put into as short a compass as i can the observation upon it which i find register in my journal it be about fifteen english mile long and four broad on the south side be the laird 's family seat situate on a please low spot the old tower of three story mention by martin be take down soon after 1746 and a modern house supply its place there be very good grass-field and corn-land about it well-dressed i observe however hardly any inclosure except a good garden plentifully stock with vegetable and strawberry raspberry currant & c on one of the rock just where we land which be not high there be rudely carve a square with a crucifix in the middle here it be say the laird of rasay in old time use to offer up they devotions i could not approach the spot without a grateful recollection of the event commemorate by this symbol a little from the shore westward be a kind of subterraneous house there have be a natural fissure or separation of the rock run towards the sea which have be roof over with long stone and above they turf have be lay in that place the inhabitant use to keep they oar there be a number of tree near the house which grow well some of they of a pretty good size they be mostly plane and ash a little to the west of the house be a old ruinous chapel unroofed which never have be very curious we here see some human bone of a uncommon size there be a heel-bone in particular which dr macleod say be such that if the foot be in proportion it must have be twenty-seven inch long dr johnson would not look at the bone he start back from they with a striking appearance of horror -lrb- 502 -rrb- mr m ` queen tell we it be formerly much the custom in these isle to have human bone lie above ground especially in the window of church on the south of the chapel be the family burying-place above the door on the east end of it be a small bust or image of the virgin mary carve upon a stone which make part of the wall there be no church upon the island it be annex to one of the parish of sky and the minister come and preach either in rasay 's house or some other house on certain sunday i could not but value the family seat more for have even the ruin of a chapel close to it there be something comfortable in the thought of be so near a piece of consecrated ground -lrb- 503 -rrb- dr johnson say ' i look with reverence upon every place that have be set apart for religion ' and he keep off he hat while he be within the wall of the chapel -lrb- 504 -rrb- the eight cross which martin mention as pyramid for deceased lady stand in a semicircular line which contain within it the chapel they mark out the boundary of the sacred territory within which a asylum be to be have one of they which we observe upon we landing make the first point of the semicircle there be few of they now remain a good way farther north there be a row of building about four foot high they run from the shore on the east along the top of a pretty high eminence and so down to the shore on the west in much the same direction with the cross rasay take they to be the mark for the asylum but malcolm think they to be false sentinel a common deception of which instance occur in martin to make invader imagine a island better guard mr donald m ` queen justly in my opinion suppose the cross which form the inner circle to be the church 's land-mark the south end of the island be much cover with large stone or rocky stratum the laird have enclose and plant part of it with fir and he shew I a considerable space mark out for additional plantation _ dun can _ be a mountain three computed mile from the laird 's house the ascent to it be by consecutive rising if that expression may be use when vally intervene so that there be but a short rise at once but it be certainly very high above the sea the palm of altitude be dispute for by the people of rasay and those of sky the former contend for dun can the latter for the mountain in sky over against it we go up the east side of dun can pretty easily it be mostly rock all around the point of which hem the summit of it sailor to whom it be a good object as they pass along call it rasay 's cap before we reach this mountain we pass by two lake of the first malcolm tell I a strange fabulous tradition he say there be a wild beast in it a sea horse which come and devour a man 's daughter upon which the man light a great fire and have a sow roasted at it the smell of which attract the monster in the fire be put a spit the man lay conceal behind a low wall of loose stone and he have a avenue form for the monster with two row of large flat stone which extend from the fire over the summit of the hill till it reach the side of the loch the monster come and the man with the red-hot spit destroy it malcolm shew I the little hiding-place and the row of stone he do not laugh when he tell this story i recollect have see in the _ scot magazine _ several year ago a poem upon a similar tale perhaps the same translate from the erse or irish call _ albin and the daughter of mey _ there be a large tract of land possess as a common in rasay they have no regulation as to the number of cattle every man put upon it as many as he choose from dun can northward till you reach the other end of the island there be much good natural pasture unincumbered by stone we pass over a spot which be appropriate for the exercise ground in 1745 a hundred fight man be review here as malcolm tell I who be one of the officer that lead they to the field -lrb- 505 -rrb- they return home all but about fourteen what a princely thing be it to be able to furnish such a band rasay have the true spirit of a chief he be without exaggeration a father to he people there be plenty of lime-stone in the island a great quarry of free-stone and some natural wood but none of any age as they cut the tree for common country use the lake of which there be many be well stock with trout malcolm catch one of four-and-twenty pound weight in the loch next to dun can which by the way be certainly a danish name as most name of place in these island be the old castle in which the family of rasay formerly reside be situate upon a rock very near the sea the rock be not one mass of stone but a concretion of pebble and earth so firm that it do not appear to have moulder in this remnant of antiquity i find nothing worthy of be notice except a certain accommodation rarely to be find at the modern house of scotland and which dr johnson and i seek for in vain at the laird of rasay 's new build mansion where nothing else be want i take the liberty to tell the laird it be a shame there should be such a deficiency in civilized time he acknowledge the justice of the remark but perhaps some generation may pass before the want be supply dr johnson observe to I how quietly people will endure a evil which they might at any time very easily remedy and mention as a instance that the present family of rasay have possess the island for more than four hundred year and never make a commodious landing place though a few man with pickax might have cut a ascent of stair out of any part of the rock in a week 's time -lrb- 506 -rrb- the north end of rasay be as rocky as the south end from it i see the little isle of fladda belong to rasay all fine green ground -- and rona which be of so rocky a soil that it appear to be a pavement i be tell however that it have a great deal of grass in the interstice the laird have it all in he own hand at this end of the island of rasay be a cave in a striking situation it be in a recess of a great cleft a good way up from the sea before it the ocean roar be dash against monstrous broken rock grand and aweful _ propugnaculum _ on the right hand of it be a longitudinal cave very low at the entrance but higher as you advance the sea have scoop it out it seem strange and unaccountable that the interior part where the water must have operate with less force should be loftier than that which be more immediately expose to its violence the roof of it be all cover with a kind of petrification form by drop which perpetually distil from it the first cave have be a place of much safety i find a great difficulty in describe visible object -lrb- 507 -rrb- i must own too that the old castle and cave like many other thing of which one hear much do not answer my expectation people be every where apt to magnify the curiosity of they country this island have abundance of black cattle sheep and goat -- a good many horse which be use for plough carry out dung and other work of husbandry i believe the people never ride there be indeed no road through the island unless a few detach beaten track deserve that name most of the house be upon the shore so that all the people have little boat and catch fish there be great plenty of potato here there be black-cock in extraordinary abundance moorfowl plover and wild pigeon which seem to I to be the same as we have in pigeon-house in they state of nature rasay have no pigeon-house there be no hare nor rabbit in the island nor be there ever know to be a fox -lrb- 508 -rrb- till last year when one be land on it by some malicious person without whose aid he could not have get thither as that animal be know to be a very bad swimmer he have do much mischief there be a great deal of fish catch in the sea round rasay it be a place where one may live in plenty and even in luxury there be no deer but rasay tell we he would get some they reckon it rain nine month in the year in this island owe to its be directly opposite to the western -lrb- 509 -rrb- coast of sky where the watery cloud be break by high mountain the hill here and indeed all the heathy grounds in general abound with the sweet-smelling plant which the highlander call _ gaul _ and -lrb- i think -rrb- with dwarf juniper in many place there be enough of turf which be they fuel and it be think there be a mine of coal -- such be the observation which i make upon the island of rasay upon compare it with the description give by martin whose book we have with we there have be a ancient league between the family of macdonald and rasay whenever the head of either family die he sword be give to the head of the other the present rasay have the late sir jame macdonald 's sword old rasay join the highland army in 1745 but prudently guard against a forfeiture by previously convey he estate to the present gentleman he eldest son -lrb- 510 -rrb- on that occasion sir alexander father of the late sir jame macdonald be very friendly to he neighbor ` do not be afraid rasay ' say he ` i 'll use all my interest to keep you safe and if you estate should be take i 'll buy it for the family ' -- and he would have do it let I now gather some gold dust -- some more fragment of dr johnson 's conversation without regard to order of time he say ` he think very highly of bentley that no man now go so far in the kind of learn that he cultivate -lrb- 511 -rrb- that the many attack on he be owe to envy and to a desire of be know by be in competition with such a man that it be safe to attack he because he never answer he opponent but let they die away -lrb- 512 -rrb- it be attack a man who would not beat they because he beat they would make they live the longer and he be right not to answer for in he hazardous method of write he could not but be often enough wrong so it be better to leave thing to they general appearance than own himself to have err in particulars ' he say ` mallet be the prettiest drest puppet about town and always keep good company -lrb- 513 -rrb- that from he way of talk he see and always say that he have not write any part of the _ life of the duke of marlborough _ though perhaps he intend to do it at some time in which case he be not culpable in take the pension -lrb- 514 -rrb- that he imagine the duchess furnish the material for she _ apology _ which hooke write and hooke furnish the word and the order and all that in which the art of write consist that the duchess have not superior part but be a bold frontless woman who know how to make the most of she opportunity in life that hooke get a _ large _ sum of money for write she _ apology _ -lrb- 515 -rrb- that he wonder hooke should have be weak enough to insert so profligate a maxim as that to tell another 's secret to one 's friend be no breach of confidence -lrb- 516 -rrb- though perhaps hooke who be a virtuous man -lrb- 517 -rrb- as he _ history _ shew and do not wish she well though he write she _ apology _ might see its ill tendency and yet insert it at she desire he be act only ministerially ' i apprehended however that hooke be bind to give he best advice i speak as a lawyer though i have have client whose cause i could not as a private man approve yet if i undertake they i would not do any thing that might be prejudicial to they even at they desire without warn they of they danger Saturday September 11 it be a storm of wind and rain so we could not set out i write some of this _ journal _ and talk a while with dr johnson in he room and pass the day i can not well say how but very pleasantly i be here amuse to find mr cumberland 's comedy of the _ fashionable lover _ -lrb- 518 -rrb- in which he have very well draw a highland character colin m ` cleod of the same name with the family under whose roof we now be dr johnson be much pleased with the laird of macleod who be indeed a most promising youth and with a noble spirit struggle with difficulty and endeavor to preserve he people he have be leave with a incumbrance of forty thousand pound debt and annuity to the amount of thirteen hundred pound a year dr johnson say ` if he get the better of all this he 'll be a hero and i hope he will -lrb- 519 -rrb- i have not meet with a young man who have more desire to learn or who have learn more i have see nobody that i wish more to do a kindness to than macleod ' such be the honorable elogium on this young chieftain pronounce by a accurate observer whose praise be never lightly bestow there be neither justice of peace nor constable in rasay sky have mr m ` cleod of ulinish who be the sheriff substitute and no other justice of peace the want of the execution of justice be much feel among the islander macleod very sensibly observe that take away the heritable jurisdiction -lrb- 520 -rrb- have not be of such service in the island as be imagine they have not authority enough in lieu of they what could formerly have be settle at once must now either take much time and trouble or be neglect dr johnson say ' a country be in a bad state which be govern only by law because a thousand thing occur for which law can not provide and where authority ought to interpose now destroy the authority of the chief set the people loose it do not pretend to bring any positive good but only to cure some evil and i be not well enough acquaint with the country to know what degree of evil the heritable jurisdiction occasion -lrb- 521 -rrb- ' i maintain hardly any because the chief generally act right for they own sake dr johnson be now wish to move there be not enough of intellectual entertainment for he after he have satisfy he curiosity which he do by ask question till he have exhaust the island and where there be so numerous a company mostly young people there be such a flow of familiar talk so much noise and so much singing and dancing that little opportunity be leave for he energetick conversation -lrb- 522 -rrb- he seem sensible of this for when i tell he how happy they be at have he there he say ` yet we have not be able to entertain they much ' i be fret from irritability of nerve by m ` cruslick 's too obstreperous mirth i complain of it to my friend observe we should be better if he be go ` no sir -lrb- say he -rrb- he put something into we society and take nothing out of it ' dr johnson however have several opportunity of instruct the company but i be sorry to say that i do not pay sufficient attention to what pass as he discourse now turn chiefly on mechanick agriculture and such subject rather than on science and wit last night lady rasay shew he the operation of _ wawk _ cloth that be thicken it in the same manner as be do by a mill here it be perform by woman who kneel upon the ground and rub it with both they hand sing a erse song all the time he be ask question while they be perform this operation and amidst they loud and wild howl he voice be hear even in the room above -lrb- 523 -rrb- they dance here every night the queen of we ball be the eldest miss macleod of rasay a elegant well-bred woman and celebrate for she beauty over all those region by the name of miss flora rasay -lrb- 524 -rrb- there seem to be no jealousy no discontent among they and the gaiety of the scene be such that i for a moment doubt whether unhappiness have any place in rasay but my delusion be soon dispel by recollect the follow line of my fellow-traveller : -- ` yet hope not life from pain or danger free or think the doom of man revers would for thee -lrb- 525 -rrb- ' Sunday September 12 it be a beautiful day and although we do not approve of travel on Sunday we resolve to set out as we be in a island from whence one must take occasion as it serve macleod and talisker sail in a boat of rasay 's for sconser to take the shortest way to dunvegan m ` cruslick go with they to sconser from whence he be to go to slate and so to the main land we be resolve to pay a visit at kingsburgh and see the celebrated miss flora macdonald who be marry to the present mr macdonald of kingsburgh so take that road though not so near all the family but lady rasay walk down to the shore to see we depart rasay himself go with we in a large boat with eight oar build in he island -lrb- 526 -rrb- as do mr malcolm m ` cleod mr donald m ` queen dr macleod and some other we have a most pleasant sail between rasay and sky and pass by a cave where martin say fowl be catch by light fire in the mouth of it malcolm remember this but it be not now practice as few fowl come into it we speak of death dr johnson on this subject observe that the boasting of some man as to die easily be idle talk -lrb- 527 -rrb- proceed from partial view i mention hawthornden 's _ cypress-grove _ where it be say that the world be a mere show and that it be unreasonable for a man to wish to continue in the show-room after he have see it let he go cheerfully out and give place to other spectator -lrb- 528 -rrb- johnson ` yes sir if he be sure he be to be well after he go out of it but if he be to grow blind after he go out of the show-room and never to see any thing again or if he do not know whither he be to go next a man will not go cheerfully out of a show-room no wise man will be contented to die if he think he be to go into a state of punishment nay no wise man will be contented to die if he think he be to fall into annihilation : for however unhappy any man 's existence may be he yet would rather have it than not exist at all -lrb- 529 -rrb- no there be no rational principle by which a man can die contented but a trust in the mercy of god through the merit of jesus christ ' this short sermon deliver with a earnest tone in a boat upon the sea which be perfectly calm on a day appropriate to religious worship while every one listen with a air of satisfaction have a most please effect upon my mind pursue the same train of serious reflection he add that it seem certain that happiness could not be find in this life because so many have try to find it in such a variety of way and have not find it we reach the harbor of portree in sky which be a large and good one there be lie in it a vessel to carry off the emigrant call the _ nestor _ it make a short settlement of the difference between a chief and he clan : -- ' ----- _ nestor _ componere lite inter peleiden festinat & inter atriden ' -lrb- 530 -rrb- we approach she and she hoist she color dr johnson and mr mcqueen remain in the boat : rasay and i and the rest go on board of she she be a very pretty vessel and as we be tell the largest in clyde mr harrison the captain shew she to we the cabin be commodious and even elegant there be a little library finely bind _ portree _ have its name from king jame the fifth have land there in he tour through the western isle _ ree _ in erse be king as _ re _ be in italian so it be _ port royal _ there be here a tolerable inn on we landing i have the pleasure of find a letter from home and there be also letter to dr johnson and I from lord elibank -lrb- 531 -rrb- which have be send after we from edinburgh he lordship 's letter to I be as follow : -- ` dear boswell ' i fly to edinburgh the moment i hear of mr johnson 's arrival but so defective be my intelligence that i come too late ` it be but justice to believe that i could never forgive myself nor deserve to be forgive by other if i be to fail in any mark of respect to that very great genius -- i hold he in the highest veneration for that very reason i be resolve to take no share in the merit perhaps guilt of intice he to honor this country with a visit -- i could not persuade myself there be any thing in scotland worthy to have a summer of samuel johnson bestow on it but since he have do we that compliment for heaven 's sake inform I of you motion i will attend they most religiously and though i should regret to let mr johnson go a mile out of he way on my account old as i be -lrb- 532 -rrb- i shall be glad to go five hundred mile to enjoy a day of he company have the charity to send a council-post -lrb- 533 -rrb- with intelligence the post do not suit we in the country -- at any rate write to I i will attend you in the north when i shall know where to find you i be my dear boswell you sincerely obedient humble servant ` elibank ' ` August 21st 1773 ' the letter to dr johnson be in these word : -- ` dear sir ' i be to have kiss you hand at edinburgh the moment i hear of you but you be go ' i hope my friend boswell will inform I of you motion it will be cruel to deprive I a instant of the honor of attend you as i value you more than any king in christendom i will perform that duty with infinitely greater alacrity than any courtier i can contribute but little to you entertainment but my sincere esteem for you give I some title to the opportunity of express it ' i dare say you be by this time sensible that thing be pretty much the same as when buchanan complain of be bear _ solo et seculo inerudito _ let I hear of you and be persuade that none of you admirer be more sincerely devote to you than dear sir you most obedient and most humble servant ` elibank ' dr johnson on the follow Tuesday answer for both of we thus : -- ` my lord ` on the rugged shore of skie i have the honor of you lordship 's letter and can with great truth declare that no place be so gloomy but that it would be cheer by such a testimony of regard from a mind so well qualify to estimate character and to deal out approbation in its due proportion if i have more than my share it be you lordship 's fault for i have always reverence you

johnson listen to she with placid attention and say ` all this should be write down ' from what she tell we and from what i be tell by other personally concerned and from a paper of information which rasay be so good as to send I at my desire i have compile the follow abstract which as it contain some curious anecdote will i imagine not be uninteresting to my reader and even perhaps be of some use to future historian \* \* \* \* \* prince charle edward after the battle of culloden be convey to what be call the _ long island _ where he lay for some time conceal but intelligence have be obtain where he be and a number of troops have come in quest of he it become absolutely necessary for he to quit that country without delay miss flora macdonald then a young lady animated by what she think the sacred principle of loyalty offer with the magnanimity of a heroine to accompany he in a open boat to sky though the coast they be to quit be guard by ship he dress himself in woman 's clothes and

settle that prince charle should be conduct to old rasay who be himself conceal with some select friend the plan be instantly communicate to kingsburgh who be dispatch to the hill to inform the wanderer and carry he refreshment when kingsburgh approach he start up and advance hold a large knotted stick and in appearance ready to knock he down till he say ' i be macdonald of kingsburgh come to serve you highness ' the wanderer answer ` it be well ' and be satisfy with the plan flora macdonald dine with lady margaret at whose table there sit a officer of the army station here with a party of soldier to watch for prince charle in case of he fly to the isle of sky she afterwards often laugh in good-humour with this gentleman on she have so well deceive he after dinner flora macdonald on horseback and she suppose maid and kingsburgh with a servant carry some linen all on foot proceed towards that gentleman 's house upon the road be a small rivulet which they be oblige to cross the

the future he be as good as he word for the next brook they cross he do not hold up he clothes at all but let they float upon the water he be very awkward in he female dress he size be so large and he stride so great that some woman whom they meet report that they have see a very big woman who look like a man in woman 's clothes and that perhaps it be -lrb- as they express themselves -rrb- the _ prince _ after whom so much search be make at kingsburgh he meet with a most cordial reception seem gay at supper and after it indulge himself in a cheerful glass with he worthy host as he have not have he clothes off for a long time the comfort of a good bed be highly relish by he and he sleep soundly till next day at one o'clock the mistress of corrichatachin tell I that in the forenoon she go into she father 's room who be also in bed and suggest to he she apprehension that a party of the military might come up and that he guest and he have better not remain here too long she father say ` let the poor man repose himself after he fatigue and as for I i care not though they take off this old gray head ten or eleven year sooner than i should die in the course of nature ' he then wrap himself in the bed-clothes and again fall fast asleep on the afternoon of that day the wanderer still in the same dress set out for portree with flora macdonald and a man servant he shoe be very bad kingsburgh provide he with a new pair and take up the old one say ' i will faithfully keep they till you be safely settle at st jame 's i will then introduce myself by shake they at you to put you in

give twenty guinea for they old mr macdonald after she guest have leave the house take the sheet in which he have lie fold they carefully and charge she daughter that they should be keep unwashed and that when she die she body should be wrap in they as a wind sheet she will be religiously observe upon the road to portree prince charle change he dress and put on man 's clothes again a tartan short coat and waistcoat with philibeg and short hose a plaid and a wig and bonnet mr donald m ` donald call donald roy have be send express to the present rasay then the young laird who be at that time at he sister 's house about three mile from portree attend he brother dr macleod who be recover of a wound he have receive at the battle of culloden mr m ` donald communicate to young rasay the plan of convey the wanderer to where old rasay be but be tell that old rasay have flee to knoidart a part of glengary 's estate there be then a dilemma what should be do donald roy propose that he should conduct the wanderer to the main land but young rasay think it too dangerous at that time and say it would be better to conceal he in the island of rasay till old rasay could be inform where he be and give he advice what be best but the difficulty be how to get he to rasay they could not trust a portree crew and all the rasay boat have be destroy or carry off by the military except two belong to malcolm m ` leod which he have conceal somewhere dr macleod be inform of this difficulty say he would risk he life once more for prince charle and it have occur that there be a little boat upon a fresh-water lake in the neighborhood young rasay and dr macleod with the help of some woman bring it to the sea by extraordinary exertion across a highland mile of land one half of which be bog and the other a steep precipice these gallant brother with the assistance of one little boy row the small boat to rasay where they be to endeavor to find captain m ` leod as malcolm be then call and get one of he good boat with which they might return to portree and receive the wanderer or in case of not find he they be to make the small boat serve though the danger be considerable fortunately on they first landing they find they cousin malcolm who with the utmost alacrity get ready one of he boat with two strong man john m ` kenzie and donald m ` friar malcolm be the oldest man and most cautious say that as young rasay have not hitherto appear in the unfortunate business he ought not to run any risk but that dr macleod and himself who be already publickly engage should go on this expedition young rasay answer with a oath that he would go at the risk of he life and fortune ` in god 's name then -lrb- say malcolm -rrb- let we proceed ' the two boatman however now stop short till they should be inform of they destination and m ` kenzie declare he would not move a oar till he know where they be go upon which they be both swear to secrecy and the business be impart to they they be eager to put off to sea without loss of time the boat soon land about half a mile from the inn at portree all this be negotiate before the wanderer get forward to portree malcolm m ` leod and m ` friar be dispatch to look for he in a short time he appear and go into the publick house here donald roy whom he have see at mugstot receive he and inform he of what have be concerted he want silver for a guinea but the landlord have only thirteen shilling he be go to accept of this for he guinea but donald roy very judiciously observe that it would discover he to be some great man so he desist he slip out of the house leave he fair protectress whom he never again see and malcolm macleod be present to he by donald roy as a captain in he army young rasay and dr macleod have wait in impatient anxiety in the boat when he come they name be announce to he he would not permit the usual ceremony of respect but salute they as he equal donald roy staid in sky to be in readiness to get intelligence and give a alarm in case the troops should discover the retreat to rasay and prince charle be then convey in a boat to that island in the night he sleep a little upon the passage and they land about day-break there be some difficulty in accommodate he with a lodging as almost all the house in the island have be burn by the soldiery they repair to a little hut which some shepherd have lately build and have prepare it as well as they could and make a bed of heath for the stranger they kindle a fire and partook of some provision which have be send with he from kingsburgh it be observe that he would not taste wheat-bread or brandy while oat-bread and whisky last ` for these say he be my own country bread and drink ' -- this be very engaging to the highlander young rasay be the only person of the company that dare appear with safety he go in quest of something fresh for they to eat : but though he be amidst he own cow sheep and goat he could not venture to take any of they for fear of a discovery but be oblige to supply himself by stealth he therefore catch a kid and bring it to the hut in he plaid and it be kill and drest and furnish they a meal which they relish much the distressed wanderer whose health be now a good deal impair by hunger fatigue and watch sleep a long time but seem to be frequently disturbed malcolm tell I he would start from broken slumber and speak to himself in different language french italian and english i must however acknowledge that it be highly probable that my worthy friend malcolm do not know precisely the difference between french and italian one of he expression in english be ' o god poor scotland ' while they be in the hut m ` kenzie and m ` friar the two boatman be place as sentinel upon different eminence and one day a incident happen which must not be omit there be a man wander about the island selling tobacco nobody know he and he be suspect to be a spy m ` kenzie come run to the hut and tell that this suspect person be approach upon which the three gentleman young rasay dr macleod and malcolm hold a council of war upon he and be unanimously of opinion that he should instantly be put to death prince charle at once assume a grave and even severe countenance say ` god forbid that we should take away a man 's life who may be innocent while we can preserve we own ' the gentleman however persist in they resolution while he as strenuously continue to take the merciful side john m ` kenzie who sit watch at the door of the hut and overhear the debate say in erse ` well well he must be shoot you be the king but we be the parliament and will do what we choose ' prince charle see the gentleman smile ask what the man have say and be tell it in english he observe that he be a clever fellow and notwithstanding the perilous situation in which he be laugh loud and heartily luckily the unknown person do not perceive that there be people in the hut at least do not come to it but walk on past it unknowing of he risk it be afterwards find out that he be one of the highland army who be himself in danger have he come to they they be resolve to dispatch he for as malcolm say to I ` we could not keep he with we and we dare not let he go in such a situation i would have shoot my brother if i have not be sure of he ' john m ` kenzie be at rasay 's house when we be there -lrb- 551 -rrb- about eighteen year before he hurt one of he leg when dancing and be oblige to have it cut off he now be go about with a wooden leg the story of he be a _ member of parliament _ be not yet forget i take he out a little way from the house give he a shilling to drink rasay 's health and lead he into a detail of the particulars which i have just relate with less foundation some writer have trace the idea of a parliament and of the british constitution in rude and early time i be curious to know if he have really hear or understand any thing of that subject which have he be a greater man would probably have be eagerly maintain ` why john -lrb- say i -rrb- do you think the king should be controul by a parliament ' he answer ' i think sir there be many voice against one ' the conversation then turn on the time the wanderer say that to be sure the life he have lead of late be a very hard one but he would rather live in the way he now do for ten year than fall into the hand of he enemy the gentleman ask he what he think he enemy would do with he should he have the misfortune to fall into they hand he say he do not believe they would dare to take he life publickly but he dread be privately destroy by poison or assassination he be very particular in he inquiry about the wound which dr macleod have receive at the battle of culloden from a ball which enter at one shoulder and go cross to the other the doctor happen still to have on the coat which he wear on that occasion he mention that he himself have he horse shot under he at culloden that the ball hit the horse about two inch from he knee and make he so unruly that he be oblige to change he for another he throw out some reflection on the conduct of the disastrous affair at culloden say however that perhaps it be rash in he to do so i be now convince that he suspicion be groundless for i have have a good deal of conversation upon the subject with my very worthy and ingenious friend mr andrew lumisden who be under secretary to prince charle and afterwards principal secretary to he father at rome who he assure I be perfectly satisfied both of the ability and honor of the general who command the highland army on that occasion mr lumisden have write a account of the three battle in 1745-6 at once accurate and classical -lrb- 552 -rrb- talking of the different highland corps the gentleman who be present wish to have he opinion which be the best soldier he say he do not like comparison among those corps : they be all best he tell he conductor he do not think it advisable to remain long in any one place and that he expect a french ship to come for he to lochbroom among the mackenzy it then be propose to carry he in one of malcolm 's boat to lochbroom though the distance be fifteen league coastwise but he think this would be too dangerous and desire that at any rate they might first endeavor to obtain intelligence upon which young rasay write to he friend mr m ` kenzie of applecross but receive a answer that there be no appearance of any french ship it be therefore resolve that they should return to sky which they do and land in strath where they repose in a cow-house belong to mr niccolson of scorbreck the sea be very rough and the boat take in a good deal of water the wanderer ask if there be danger as he be not use to such a vessel upon be tell there be not he sing a erse song with much vivacity he have by this time acquire a good deal of the erse language young rasay be now dispatch to where donald roy be that they might get all the intelligence they could and the wanderer with much earnestness charge dr macleod to have a boat ready at a certain place about seven mile off as he say he intend it should carry he upon a matter of great consequence and give the doctor a case contain a silver spoon knife and fork say ` keep you that till i see you ' which the doctor understand to be two day from that time but all these order be only blind for he have another plan in he head but wisely think it safest to trust he secret to no more person than be absolutely necessary have then desire malcolm to walk with he a little way from the house he soon open he mind say ' i deliver myself to you conduct I to the laird of m ` kinnon 's country ' malcolm object that it be very dangerous as so many party of soldier be in motion he answer ` there be nothing now to be do without danger ' he then say that malcolm must be the master and he the servant so he take the bag in which he linen be put up and carry it on he shoulder and observe that he waistcoat which be of scarlet tartan with a gold twist button be finer than malcolm 's which be of a plain ordinary tartan he put on malcolm 's waistcoat and give he he remark at the same time that it do not look well that the servant should be better dress than the master malcolm though a excellent walker find himself excel by prince charle who tell he he should not much mind the party that be look for he be he once but a musket shot from they but that he be somewhat afraid of the highlander who be against he he be well use to walk in italy in pursuit of game and he be even now so keen a sportsman that have observe some partridge he be go to take a shot : but malcolm caution he against it observe that the firing might be hear by the tender -lrb- 553 -rrb- who be hover upon the coast as they proceed through the mountain take many a circuit to avoid any house malcolm to try he resolution ask he what they should do should they fall in with a party of soldier : he answer ` fight to be sure ' have ask malcolm if he should be know in he present dress and malcolm have reply he would he say ` then i 'll blacken my face with powder ' ` that say malcolm would discover you at once ' ` then say he i must be put in the greatest dishabille possible ' so he pull off he wig tie a handkerchief round he head and put he night-cap over it tear the ruffle from he shirt take the buckle out of he shoe and make malcolm fasten they with string but still malcolm think he would be know ' i have so odd a face -lrb- say he -rrb- that no man ever see I but he would know I again -lrb- 554 -rrb- ' he seem unwilling to give credit to the horrid narrative of man be massacre in cold blood after victory have declare for the army command by the duke of cumberland he could not allow himself to think that a general could be so barbarous -lrb- 555 -rrb- when they come within two mile of m ` kinnon 's house malcolm ask if he choose to see the laird ` no -lrb- say he -rrb- by no means i know m ` kinnon to be as good and as honest a man as any in the world but he be not fit for my purpose at present you must conduct I to some other house but let it be a gentleman 's house ' malcolm then determine that they should go to the house of he brother-in-law mr john m ` kinnon and from thence be convey to the main land of scotland and claim the assistance of macdonald of scothouse the wanderer at first object to this because scothouse be cousin to a person of whom he have suspicion but he acquiesce in malcolm 's opinion when they be near mr john m ` kinnon 's house they meet a man of the name of ross who have be a private soldier in the highland army he fix he eye steadily on the wanderer in he disguise and have at once recognize he he clap he hand and exclaim ` alas be this the case ' finding that there be now a discovery malcolm ask ` what be to be do ' ` swear he to secrecy ' answer prince charle upon which malcolm draw he dirk and on the naked blade make he take a solemn oath that he would say nothing of he have see the wanderer till he escape should be make publick malcolm 's sister whose house they reach pretty early in the morning ask he who the person be that be along with he he say it be one lewi caw from crieff who be a fugitive like himself for the same reason he have engage he as he servant but that he have fall sick ` poor man -lrb- say she -rrb- i pity he at the same time my heart warm to a man of he appearance ' she husband be go a little way from home but be expect every minute to return she set down to she brother a plentiful highland breakfast prince charle act the servant very well sit at a respectful distance with he bonnet off malcolm then say to he ` mr caw you have as much need of this as i have there be enough for we both : you have better draw nearer and share with I ' upon which he rise make a profound bow sit down at table with he supposed master and eat very heartily after this there come in a old woman who after the mode of ancient hospitality bring warm water and wash malcolm 's foot he desire she to wash the foot of the poor man who attend he she at first seem averse to this from pride as think he beneath she and in the periphrastick language of the highlander and the irish say warmly ` though i wash you father 's son 's foot why should i wash he father 's son 's foot ' she be however persuade to do it they then go to bed and sleep for some time and when malcolm awake he be tell that mr john m ` kinnon he brother-in-law be in sight he spring out to talk to he before he should see prince charle after salute he malcolm point to the sea say ` what john if the prince should be prisoner on board one of those tender ' ` god forbid ' reply john ` what if we have he here ' say malcolm ' i wish we have ' answer john ` we should take care of he ' ` well john ' say malcolm ` he be in you house ' john in a transport of joy want to run directly in and pay he obeisance but malcolm stop he say ` now be you time to behave well and do nothing that can discover he ' john compose himself and have send away all he servant upon different errand he be introduce into the presence of he guest and be then desire to go and get ready a boat lie near he house which though but a small leaky one they resolve to take rather than go to the laird of m ` kinnon john m ` kinnon however think otherwise and upon he return tell they that he chief and lady m ` kinnon be come in the laird 's boat prince charle say to he trusty malcolm ' i be sorry for this but must make the best of it ' m ` kinnon then walk up from the shore and do homage to the wanderer he lady wait in a cave to which they all repair and be entertain with cold meat and wine mr malcolm m ` leod be now supersede by the laird of m ` kinnon desire leave to return which be grant he and prince charle write a short note which he subscribe _ jame thompson _ inform he friend that he have get away from sky and thank they for they kindness and he desire this might be speedily convey to young rasay and dr macleod that they might not wait longer in expectation of see he again he bid a cordial adieu to malcolm and insist on he accept of a silver stock-buckle and ten guinea from he purse though as malcolm tell I it do not appear to contain above forty malcolm at first beg to be excuse say that he have a few guinea at he service but prince charle answer ` you will have need of money i shall get enough when i come upon the main land ' the laird of m ` kinnon then convey he to the opposite coast of knoidart old rasay to whom intelligence have be send be cross at the same time to sky but as they do not know of each other and each have apprehension the two boat keep aloof these be the particulars which i have collect concern the extraordinary concealment and escape of prince charle in the hebride he be often in imminent danger -lrb- 556 -rrb- the troops trace he from the long island across sky to portree but there lose he here i stop -- have receive no farther authentick information of he fatigue and peril before he escape to france king and subject may both take a lesson of moderation from the melancholy fate of the house of stuart that king may not suffer degradation and exile and subject may not be harass by the evil of a dispute succession let I close the scene on that unfortunate house with the elegant and pathetick reflection of _ voltaire _ in he _ histoire générale _ : -- ` que les hommes privés -lrb- say that brilliant writer speaking of prince charle -rrb- qui se croyent malheureux jettent les yeux sur ce prince et ses ancêtres ' -lrb- 557 -rrb- in another place he thus sum up the sad story of the family in general : -- ` il n ' y a aucun exemple dan l'histoire d'une maison si longtems infortunée le premier des rois d'écosse -lrb- se aïeux -rrb- quus eut le nom de _ jacque _ après avoir été dix-huit an prisonnier en angleterre mourut assassiné avec sa femme par la main de ses sujet _ jacque _ ii son fil fut tué à vingt-neuf an en

maison de _ stuart _ pendant plus de trois cent années ' -lrb- 559 -rrb- the gallant malcolm be apprehend in about ten day after they separate put aboard a ship and carry prisoner to london he say the prisoner in general be very ill treat in they passage but there be soldier on board who live well and sometimes invite he to share with they : that he have the good fortune not to be throw into jail but be confine in the house of a messenger of the name of dick to he astonishment only one witness could be find against he though he have be so openly engage and therefore for want of sufficient evidence he be set at liberty he add that he think himself in such danger that he would gladly have compound for banishment -lrb- 560 -rrb- yet he say ` he should never be so ready for death as he then be -lrb- 561 -rrb- ' there be philosophical truth in this a man will meet death much more firmly at one time than another the enthusiasm even of a mistaken principle warm the mind and set it above the fear of death which in we cooler moment if we really think of it can not but be terrible or at least very awful miss flora macdonald be then also in london under the protection of lady primrose -lrb- 562 -rrb- that lady provide a post-chaise to convey she to scotland and desire she might choose any friend she please to accompany she she choose malcolm ` so -lrb- say he with a triumphant air -rrb- i go to london to be hang and return in a post-chaise with miss flora macdonald ' mr macleod of muiravenside whom we see at rasay assure we that prince charle be in london in 1759 -lrb- 563 -rrb- and that there be then a plan in agitation for restore he family dr johnson could scarcely credit this story and say there could be no probable plan at that time such a attempt could not have succeed unless the king of prussium have stop the army in germany for both the army and the fleet would even without order have fight for the king to whom they have engage themselves have relate so many particulars concern the grandson of the unfortunate king jame the second have give due praise to fidelity and generous attachment which however erroneous the judgment may be be honorable for the heart i must do the highlander the justice to attest that i find every where amongst they a high opinion of the virtue of the king now upon the throne and a honest disposition to be faithful subject to he majesty whose family have possess the sovereignty of this country so long that a change even for the abdicate family would now hurt the best feeling of all he subject the _ abstract _ point of _ right _ would involve we in a discussion of remote and perplexed question and after all we should have no clear principle of decision that establishment which from political necessity take place in 1688 by a breach in the succession of we king and which whatever benefit may have accrue from it certainly give a shock to we monarchy -lrb- 564 -rrb- -- the able and constitutional blackstone wisely rest on the solid footing of authority ` we ancestor have most indisputably a competent jurisdiction to decide this great and important question and have in fact decide it it be now become we duty at this distance of time to acquiesce in they determination -lrb- 565 -rrb- ' mr paley the present archdeacon of carlisle in he _ principle of moral and political philosophy _ have with much clearness of argument shewn the duty of submission to civil government to be found neither on a indefeasible _ jus divinum _ nor on _ compact _ but on _ expediency _ lay down this rational position : -- ` irregularity in the first foundation of a state or subsequent violence fraud or injustice in get possession of the supreme power be not sufficient reason for resistance after the government be once peaceably settle no subject of the _ british _ empire conceive himself engage to vindicate the justice of the _ norman _ claim or conquest or apprehend that he duty in any manner depend upon that controversy so likewise if the house of _ lancaster _ or even the posterity of _ cromwell _ have be at this day seat upon the throne of _ england _ we should have be as little concerned to enquire how the founder of the family come there -lrb- 566 -rrb- ' in conformity with this doctrine i myself though fully persuade that the house of _ stuart _ have originally no right to the crown of _ scotland _ for that _ baliol _ and not _ bruce _ be the lawful heir should yet have think it very culpable to have rebel on that account against charle the first or even a prince of that house much nearer the time in order to assert the claim of the posterity of baliol however convinced i be of the justice of that principle which hold allegiance and protection to be reciprocal i do however acknowledge that i be not satisfy with the cold sentiment which would confine the exertion of the subject within the strict line of duty i would have every breast animated with the _ fervor _ of loyalty -lrb- 567 -rrb- with that generous attachment which delight in do somewhat more than be require and make ` service perfect freedom -lrb- 568 -rrb- ' and therefore as we most gracious sovereign on he accession to the throne glory in be _ bear a briton _ -lrb- 569 -rrb- so in my more private sphere _ ego I nunc _ denique natum _ gratulor _ -lrb- 570 -rrb- i be happy that a dispute succession no longer distract we mind and that a monarchy establish by law be now so sanction by time that we can fully indulge those feeling of loyalty which i be ambitious to excite they be feeling which have ever actuate the inhabitant of the highland and the hebride the plant of loyalty be there in full vigor and the brunswick graft now flourish like a native shoot to that spirited race of people i may with propriety apply the elegant line of a modern poet on the ` facile temper of the beauteous sex -lrb- 571 -rrb- : ' -- ` like bird new-caught who flutter for a time and struggle with captivity in vain but by-and-by they rest they smooth they plume and to _ new master _ sing they former note -lrb- 572 -rrb- ' surely such note be much better than

the coast of sky -- to a mile beyond a place call _ grishinish _ we horse have be send round by land to meet we by this sail we save eight mile of bad ride dr johnson say ` when we take into computation what we have save and what we have gain by this agreeable sail it be a great deal ' he observe ` it be very disagreeable ride in sky the way be so narrow one only at a time can travel so it be quite unsocial and you can not indulge in meditation by yourself because you must be always attend to the step which you horse take ' this be a just and clear description of its inconvenience the topick of emigration be again introduce -lrb- 573 -rrb- dr johnson say that ' a rapacious chief would make a wilderness of he estate ' mr donald m ` queen tell we that the oppression which then make so much noise be owe to landlord listen to bad advice in the let of they land that interested and design -lrb- 574 -rrb- people flatter they with golden dream of much higher rent than could reasonably be pay : and that some of the gentleman _ tacksmen _ -lrb- 575 -rrb- or upper tenant be themselves in part the occasion of the mischief by over-rate the farm of other that many of the _ tacksman _ rather than comply with exorbitant demand have go off to america and impoverish the country by drain it of its wealth and that they place be fill by a number of poor people who have live under they properly speak as servant pay by a certain proportion of the produce of the land though call sub-tenant i observe that if the man of substance be once banish from a highland estate it might probably be greatly reduce in its value for one bad year might ruin a set of poor tenant and man of any property would not settle in such a country unless from the temptation of get land extremely cheap for a inhabitant of any good county in britain have better go to america than to the highland or the hebride here therefore be a consideration that ought to induce a chief to act a more liberal part from a mere motive of interest independent of the lofty and honorable principle of keep a clan together to be in readiness to serve he king i add that i could not help think a little arbitrary power in the sovereign to control the bad policy and greediness of the chief might sometimes be of service in france a chief would not be permit to force a number of the king 's subject out of the country dr johnson concur with I observe that ` be a oppressive chieftain a subject of the french king he would probably be admonish by a _ letter _ -lrb- 576 -rrb- ' during we sail dr johnson ask about the use of the dirk with which he imagine the highlander cut they meat he be tell they have a knife and fork besides to eat with he ask how do the woman do and be answer some of they have a knife and fork too but in general the man when they have cut they meat hand they knife and fork to the woman and they themselves eat with they finger the old tutor of macdonald always eat fish with he finger alledge that a knife and fork give it a bad taste i take the liberty to observe to dr johnson that he do so ` yes say he but it be because i be short-sighted and afraid of bone for which reason i be not fond of eat many kind of fish because i must use my finger ' dr m ` pherson 's _ dissertation on scottish antiquity _ which he have look at when at corrichatachin -lrb- 577 -rrb- be mention he remark that ` you might read half a hour and ask yourself what you have be read : there be so many word to so little matter that there be no get through the book ' as soon as we reach the shore we take leave of kingsburgh and mount we horse we pass through a wild moor in many place so soft that we be oblige to walk which be very fatiguing to dr johnson once he have advance on horseback to a very bad step there be a steep declivity on he left to which he be so near that there be not room for he to dismount in the usual way he try to alight on the other side as if he have be a _ young buck _ indeed but in the attempt he fall at he length upon the ground from which however he get up immediately without be hurt during this dreary ride we be sometimes relieve by a view of branch of the sea

by observe certain mark know only to the inhabitant we arrive at dunvegan late in the afternoon the great size of the castle which be partly old and partly new and be build upon a rock close to the sea while the land around it present nothing but wild moorish hilly and craggy appearance give a rude magnificence to the scene have dismount we ascend a flight of step which be make by the late macleod for the accommodation of person come to he by land there formerly be for security no other access to the castle but from the sea so that visitor who come by the land be under the necessity of get into a boat and sail round to the only place where it could be approach we be introduce into a stately dining-room and receive by lady macleod mother of the laird who with he friend talisker have be detain on the road do not arrive till some time after we we find the lady of the house a very polite and sensible woman who have live for some time in london and have there be in dr johnson 's

attach to the crime by universal opinion as soon as it be know i would not be the man who would discover it if i alone know it for a woman may reform nor would i commend a parson who divulge a woman 's first offence but be once divulge it ought to be infamous consider of what importance to society the chastity of woman be upon that all the property in the world depend -lrb- 582 -rrb- we hang a

prostitute be know she can not deceive : she can not bring a strumpet into the arm of a honest man without he knowledge boswell ` there be however a great difference between the licentiousness of a single woman and that of a married woman ' johnson ` yes sir there be a great difference between steal a shilling and steal a thousand pound between simply take a man 's purse and murder he first and then take it but when one begin to be vicious it be easy to go on where single woman be licentious you rarely find faithful married woman ' boswell ` and yet we be tell that in some nation in indium the distinction be strictly observe ' johnson ` nay do not give we india that put I in mind of montesquieu who be really a fellow of genius too in many respects whenever he want to support a strange opinion he quote you the practice of japan or of some other distant country of which he know nothing to support polygamy he tell you of the island of formosa where there be ten woman bear for one man

only dr cheyne 's book tell in a new way and there should come out such a book every thirty year dress in the mode of the time it be foolish in maintain that the gout be not hereditary and that one fit of it when go be like a fever when go ' lady macleod object that the author do not practice what he teach -lrb- 586 -rrb- johnson ' i can not help that madam that do not make he book the worse people be influence more by what a man say if he practice be suitable to it -- because they be blockhead the more intellectual people be the readier will they attend to what a man tell they if it be just they will follow it be he practice what it will no man practise so well as he write i have all my life long be lie till noon -lrb- 587 -rrb- yet i tell all young man and tell they with great sincerity that nobody who do not rise early will ever do any good only consider you read a book you be convince by it you do not know the author suppose you afterwards know he and find that he do not practice what he teach be you to give up you former conviction at this rate you would be keep in a state of equilibrium when read every book till you know how the author practice -lrb- 588 -rrb- ' ` but ' say lady m ` leod ` you would think better of dr cadogan if he act accord to he principle ' johnson ` why madam to be sure a man who act in the face of light be worse than a man who do not know so much yet i think no man should be the worse thought of for publish good principle there be something noble in publish truth though it condemn one 's self -lrb- 589 -rrb- ' i express some surprize at cadogan 's recommend good humor as if it be quite in we own power to attain it johnson ` why sir a man grow better humor as he grow older he improve by experience when young he think himself of great consequence and every thing of importance as he advance in life he learn to think himself of no consequence and little thing of little importance and so he become more patient and better pleased all good-humour and complaisance be acquire naturally a child seize directly what it see and think of please itself only by degree it be teach to please other and to prefer other and that this will ultimately produce the greatest happiness if a man be not convince of that he never will practice it common language speak the truth as to this : we say a person be well _ breed _ as it be say that

harangue i be vex that i can not take down he full strain of eloquence Wednesday September 15 the gentleman of the clan go away early in the morning to the harbor of lochbradale to take leave of some

difficult to be understand the word be _ ` penis illum glorium pene hunc palma _ -lrb- 595 -rrb- ' in a short _ account of the kirk of scotland _ which i publish some year ago i apply these word to the two contend party and explain they thus : ` the popular party have most eloquence dr robertson 's party most influence ' i be very desirous to hear dr johnson 's explication johnson ' i see no difficulty gilmor be admire for he part nisbet carry he cause by he skill in law _ palma _ be victory ' i observe that the character of nicholson in this book resemble that of burke : for it be say in

he joking say ` no sir he be not the hawk there he be the beetle in the mire -lrb- 599 -rrb- ' i still adhere to my metaphor -- ` but he _ soar _ as the hawk ' johnson ` yes sir but he catch nothing ' m ` leod ask what be the particular excellence of burke 's eloquence johnson ` copiousness and fertility of allusion a power of diversify he matter by place it in various relation burke have great information and great command of language though in my opinion it have not in every respect the highest elegance ' boswell ` do you think sir that burke have read cicero much ' johnson ' i do not believe it sir burke have great knowledge great fluency of word and great promptness of idea so that he can speak with great illustration on any subject that come before he he be neither like cicero nor like demosthene -lrb- 600 -rrb- nor like any one else but speak as well as he can ' in the 65th page of the first volume of sir george mackenzie dr johnson point out a paragraph beginning with _ aristotle _ and tell I there be a error in the text which he bid I try to discover i be lucky enough to hit it at once as the passage be print it be say that the devil answer _ even _ in _ engine _ i correct it to -- _ ever _ in _ oenigma _ ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- you be a good critick this would have be a great thing to do in the text of a ancient author ' Thursday September 16 last night much care be take of dr johnson who be still distressed by he cold he have hitherto most strangely sleep without a night-cap miss m ` leod make he a large flannel one and he be prevail with to drink a little brandy when he be go to bed he have great virtue in not drink wine or any fermented liquor because as he acknowledge to we he could not do it in moderation -lrb- 601 -rrb- lady m ` leod would hardly believe he and say ' i be sure sir you would not carry it too far ' johnson ` nay madam it carry I i take the opportunity of a long illness to leave it off it be then prescribe to I not to drink wine and have break off the habit i have never return to it -lrb- 602 -rrb- ' in the argument on Tuesday night about natural goodness dr johnson deny that any child be better than another but by difference of instruction though in consequence of greater attention be pay to instruction by one child than another and of a variety of imperceptible cause such as instruction be counteract by

any fear of other take it from he ` in london reynold beauclerk and all of they be contend who shall enjoy dr johnson 's conversation we be feast upon it undisturbed at dunvegan ' it be still a storm

somewhat depress by he anxious concern about m ` leod 's affair and by find some gentleman of the clan by no means dispose to act a generous or affectionate part to they chief in he distress but bargaining with he as with a stranger however he be agreeable and polite and dr johnson say he be a very please man my fellow-traveller and i talk of go to sweden -lrb- 605 -rrb- and while we be settle we plan i express a pleasure in the prospect of see the king johnson ' i doubt sir if he would speak to we ' colonel m ` leod say ' i be sure mr boswell would speak to _ he _ ' but see I a little disconcerted by he remark he politely add ` and with great propriety ' here let I offer a short defense of that propensity in my disposition to which this gentleman allude it have procure I much happiness i hope it do not deserve so hard a name as either forwardness or impudence if i know myself it be nothing more than a eagerness to share the society of man distinguish either by they rank or they talent and a diligence to attain what i desire -lrb- 606 -rrb- if a man be praise for seek knowledge though mountain and sea be in he way may he not be pardon whose ardor in the pursuit of the same object lead he to encounter difficulty as great though of a different kind after the lady be go from table we talk of the highlander not have sheet and this lead we to consider the advantage of wear linen johnson ` all animal substance be less cleanly than vegetable wool of which flannel be make be a animal substance flannel therefore be not so cleanly as linen i remember i use to think tar dirty but when i know it to be only a preparation of the juice of the pine i think so no longer it be not disagreeable to have the gum that ooze from a plum-tree upon you finger because it be vegetable but if you have any candle-grease any tallow upon you finger you be uneasy till you rub it off i have often think that if i keep a seraglio the lady should all wear linen gown -- or cotton i mean stuff make of vegetable substance i would have no silk you can not tell when it be clean : it will be very nasty before it be perceive to be so linen detect its own dirtiness ' to hear the grave dr samuel johnson ` that majestick teacher of moral and religious wisdom ' while sit solemn in a armchair in the isle of sky talk _ ex cathedra _ of he keep a seraglio -lrb- 607 -rrb- and acknowledge that the supposition have _ often _ be in he thought strike I so forcibly with ludicrous contrast that i could not but laugh immoderately he be too proud to submit even for a moment to be the object of ridicule and instantly retaliate with such keen sarcastick wit and such a variety of degrading image of every one of which i be the object that though i can bear such attack as well as most man i yet find myself so much the sport of all the company that i would gladly expunge from my mind every trace of this severe retort talking of we friend langton 's house in lincolnshire he say ` the old house of the family be burn a temporary building be erect in its room and to this day they have be always add as the family increase it be like a shirt make for a man when he be a child and enlarged always as he grow older ' we talk to-night of luther 's allow the landgrave of hesse two wife and that it be with the consent of the wife to whom he be first married johnson ` there be no harm in this so far as she be only concerned because _ volentus non fit injurium _ but it be a offence against the general order of society and against the law of the gospel by which one man and one woman be to be unite no man can have two wife but by prevent somebody else from have one ' Friday September 17 after dinner yesterday we have a conversation upon cunning m ` leod say that he be not afraid of cunning people but would let they play they trick about he like monkey ` but -lrb- say i -rrb- they 'll scratch ' and mr m ` queen add ` they 'll invent new trick as soon as you find out what they do ' johnson ` cunning have effect from the credulity of other rather than from the ability of those who be cunning it require no extraordinary talent to lie and deceive -lrb- 608 -rrb- ' this lead we to consider whether it do not require great ability to be very wicked johnson ` it require great ability to have the _ power _ of be very wicked but not to _ be _ very wicked a man who have the power which great ability procure he may use it well or ill and it require more ability to use it well than to use it ill wickedness be always easier than virtue for it take the short cut to every thing it be much easier to steal a hundred pound than to get it by labor or any other way consider only what act of wickedness require great ability to commit it when once the person who be to do it have the power for _ there _ be the distinction it require great ability to conquer a army but none to massacre it after it be conquer ' the weather this day be rather better than any that we have since we come to dunvegan mr m ` queen have often mention a curious piece of antiquity near this which he call a temple of the goddess anaitis have often talk of go to see it he and i set out after breakfast attend by he servant a fellow quite like a savage i must observe here that in sky there seem to be much idleness for man and boy follow you as colt follow passenger upon a road the usual figure of a sky-boy be a _ lown _ with bare leg and foot a dirty _ kilt _ ragged coat and waistcoat a bare head and a stick in he hand which i suppose be partly to help the lazy rogue to walk partly to serve as a kind of a defensive weapon we walk what be call two mile but be probably four from the castle till we come to the sacred place the country around be a black dreary moor on all side except to the sea-coast towards which there be a view through a valley and the farm of _ bay _ shew some good land the place itself be green ground be well drain by means of a deep glen on each side in both of which there run a rivulet with a good quantity of water form several cascade which make a considerable appearance and sound the first thing we come to be a earthen mound or dyke extend from the one precipice to the other a little farther on be a strong stone-wall not high but very thick extend in the same manner on the outside of it be the ruin of two house one on each side of the entry or gate to it the wall be build all along of uncemented stone but of so large a size as to make a very firm and durable rampart it have be build all about the consecrate ground except where the precipice be steep enough to form a inclosure of itself the sacred spot contain more than two acre there be within it the ruin of many house none of they large -- a _ cairn _ -- and many grave mark by cluster of stone mr m ` queen insist that the ruin of a small building standing east and west be actually the temple of the goddess anaitis where she statue be keep and from whence procession be make to wash it in one of the brook there be it must be own a hollow road visible for a good way from the entrance but mr m ` queen with the keen eye of a antiquary trace it much farther than i could perceive it there be not above a foot and a half in height of the wall now remain and the whole extent of the building be never i imagine greater than a ordinary highland house mr m ` queen have collect a great deal of learn on the subject of the temple of anaitis and i have endeavor in my _ journal _ to state such particulars as might give some idea of it and of the surround scenery but from the great difficulty of describe visible object -lrb- 609 -rrb- i find my account so unsatisfactory that my reader would probably have exclaim ` and write about it _ goddess _ and about it -lrb- 610 -rrb- ' and therefore i have omit it when we get home and be again at table with dr johnson we first talk of portrait he agree in think they valuable in family i wish to know which he prefer fine portrait or those of which the merit be resemblance johnson ` sir they chief excellence be be like ' boswell ` be you of that opinion as to the portrait of ancestor whom one have never see ' johnson ` it then become of more consequence that they should be like and i would have they in the dress of the time which make a piece of history one should like to see how _ rorie more _ look truth sir be of the greatest value in these thing -lrb- 611 -rrb- ' mr m ` queen observe that if you think it of no consequence whether portrait be like if they be but well paint you may be indifferent whether a piece of history be true or not if well tell dr johnson say at breakfast to-day ` that it be but of late that historian bestow pain and attention in consulting record to attain to accuracy -lrb- 1 -rrb- bacon in write he history of henry vii do not seem to have consult any but to have just take what he find in other history and blended it with what he learn by tradition ' he agree with I that there should be a chronicle keep in every considerable family to preserve the character and transaction of successive generation after dinner i start the subject of the temple of anaitis mr m ` queen have lay stress on the name give to the place by the country people -- _ ainnit _ and add ' i know not what to make of this piece of antiquity till i meet with the _ anaitidi delubrum _ in lydium mention by pausania and the elder pliny ' dr johnson with he usual acuteness examine mr m ` queen as to the meaning of the word _ ainnit _ in erse and it prove to be a _ water-place _ or a place near water ` which ' say mr m ` queen ` agree with all the description of the temple of that goddess which be situate near river that there might be water to wash the statue ' johnson ` nay sir the argument from the name be go the name be exhaust by what we see we have no occasion to go to a distance for what we can pick up under we foot have it be a accidental name the similarity between it and anaitis might have have something in it but it turn out to be a mere physiological name ' macleod say mr m ` queen 's knowledge of etymology have destroy he conjecture johnson ` yes sir mr m ` queen

for you and all possibility against you it be possible it may be the temple of anaitis but it be also possible that it may be a fortification or it may be a place of christian worship as the first christian often choose remote and wild place to make a impression on the mind or if it be a heathen temple it may have be build near a river for the purpose of lustration and there be such a multitude of divinity to whom it may have be dedicate that the chance of its be a temple of _ anaitis _ be hardly any thing it be like throw a grain of sand upon the sea-shore to-day and think you may find it to-morrow no sir this temple like many a ill-built edifice tumble down before it be roof in ' in he triumph over the reverend antiquarian he indulge himself in a _ conceit _ for some vestige of the _ altar _ of the goddess be much insist on in support of the hypothesis he say ` mr m ` queen be fight _ pro _ aris _ et focis ' _ it be wonderful how well time pass in a remote castle and in dreary weather after supper we talk of pennant it be object that he be superficial dr johnson defend he warmly -lrb- 613 -rrb- he say ` pennant have greater variety of enquiry than almost any man and have tell we more than perhaps one in ten thousand could have do in the time that he take he have not say what he be to tell so you can not find fault with he for what he have not tell if a man come to look for fish you can not blame he if he do not attend to fowl ' ` but ' say colonel m ` leod ` he mention the unreasonable rise of rent in the highland and say the gentleman be for empty the bag without fill it -lrb- 614 -rrb- for that be the phrase he use why do he not tell how to fill it ' johnson ` sir there be no end of negative criticism he tell what he observe and as much as he choose if he tell what be not true you may find fault with he but though he tell that the land be not well cultivate he be not oblige to tell how it may be well cultivate if i tell that many of the highlander go bare-footed i be not oblige to tell how they may get shoe pennant tell a fact he need go no farther except he please he exhaust nothing and no subject whatever have yet be exhaust but pennant have surely tell a great deal here be a man six foot high and you be angry because he be not seven ' notwithstanding this eloquent _ oratio pro pennantio _ which they who have read this gentleman 's _ tour _ and recollect the _ savage _ and the _ shopkeeper _ at _ monboddo _ -lrb- 615 -rrb- will probably impute to the spirit of contradiction i still think that he have better have give more attention to fewer thing than have throw together such a number of imperfect account Saturday September 18 before breakfast dr johnson come up to my room to forbid I to mention that this be he birthday but i tell he i have do it already at which he be displeased -lrb- 616 -rrb- i suppose from wish to have nothing particular do on he account lady m ` leod and i get into a warm dispute she want to build a house upon a farm which she have take about five mile from the castle and to make garden and other ornament there all of which i approve of but insist that the seat of the family should always be upon the rock of dunvegan johnson ` ay in time we 'll build all round this rock you may make a very good house at the farm but it must not be such as to tempt the laird of m ` leod to go thither to reside most of the great family in england have a secondary residence which be call a jointure-house : let the new house be of that kind ' the lady insist that the rock be very inconvenient that there be no place near it where a good garden could be make that it must always be a rude place that it be a _ herculean _ labor to make a dinner here i be vex to find the alloy of modern refinement in a lady who have so much old family spirit ` madam -lrb- say i -rrb- if once you quit this rock there be no know where you may settle you move five mile first -- then to st andrew as the late laird do -- then to edinburgh -- and so on till you end at hampstead or in france no no keep to the rock : it be the very jewel of the estate it look as if it have be let down from heaven by the four corner to be the residence of a chief have all the comfort and convenience of life upon it but never leave rorie more 's cascade ' ` but -lrb- say she -rrb- be it not enough if we keep it must we never have more convenience than rorie more have he have he beef bring to dinner in one basket and he bread in another why not as well be rorie more all over as live upon he rock and should not we tire in look perpetually on this rock it be very well for you who have a fine place and every thing easy to talk thus and think of chain honest folk to a rock you would not live upon it yourself ' ` yes madam -lrb- say i -rrb- i would live upon it be i laird of m ` leod and should be unhappy if i be not upon it ' johnson -lrb- with a strong voice and most determine manner -rrb- ` madam rather than quit the old rock boswell would live in the pit he would make he bed in the dungeon ' i feel a degree of elation at find my resolute feudal enthusiasm thus confirm by such a sanction the lady be puzzle a little she still return to she pretty farm -- rich ground -- fine garden ` madam -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- be they in asia i would not leave the rock ' my opinion on this subject be still the same a ancient family residence ought to be a primary object and though the situation of dunvegan be such that little can be do here in gardening or pleasure-ground yet in addition to the veneration require by the lapse of time it have many circumstance of natural grandeur suit to the seat of a highland chief : it have the sea -- island -- rock -- hill -- a noble cascade and when the family be again in opulence something may be do by art mr donald m ` queen go away to-day in order to preach at bracadale next day we be so comfortably situate at dunvegan that dr johnson could hardly be move from it i propose to he that we should leave it on Monday ` no sir -lrb- say he -rrb- i will not go before Wednesday i will have some more of this good -lrb- 617 -rrb- ' however as the weather be at this season so bad and so very uncertain and we have a great deal to do yet mr m ` queen and i prevail with he to agree to set out on Monday if the day should be good mr m ` queen though it be inconvenient for he to be absent from he harvest engage to wait on Monday at ulinish for we when he be go away dr johnson say ' i shall ever retain a great regard for you -lrb- 618 -rrb- ' then ask he if he have _ the rambler _ mr m ` queen say ` no but my brother have it ' johnson ` have you _ the idler _ m ` queen ` no sir ' johnson ` then i will order one for you at edinburgh which you will keep in remembrance of I ' mr m ` queen be much pleased with this he express to I in the strongest term he admiration of dr johnson 's wonderful knowledge and every other quality for which he be distinguish i ask mr m ` queen if he be satisfy with be a minister in sky he say he be but he own that he forefather have be so long there and he have be bear there make a chief ingredient in form he contentment i should have mention that on we left hand between portree and dr macleod 's house mr m ` queen tell I there have be a college of the knight templar that tradition say so and that there be a ruin remain of they church which have be burn : but i confess dr johnson have weaken my belief in remote tradition in the dispute about _ anaitis _ mr m ` queen say asia minor be people by scythian and as they be the ancestor of the celt the same religion might be in asia minor and sky johnson ` alas sir what can a nation that have not letter tell of its original i have always difficulty to be patient when i hear author gravely quote as give account of savage nation which account they have from the savage themselves what can the _ m ` craas _ -lrb- 619 -rrb- tell about themselves a thousand year ago there be no trace the connection of ancient nation but by language and therefore i be always sorry when any language be lose because language be the pedigree of nation -lrb- 620 -rrb- if you find the same language in distant country you may be sure that the inhabitant of each have be the same people that be to say if you find the language a good deal the same for a word here and there be the same will not do thus butler in he _ hudibra _ remember that _ penguin _ in the strait of magellan signify a bird with a white head and that the same word have in wale the signification of a

conversation he tell I that he be serious in what he have say he come to my room this morning before breakfast to read my journal which he have do all along he often before say ' i take great delight in read it ' to-day he say ` you improve : it grow better and better ' i observe there be a danger of my get a habit of write in a slovenly manner ` sir ' say he ` it be not write in a slovenly manner

take up much time yet on reflection it appear strange to I that although i will run from one end of london to another to pass a hour with he i should omit to seize any spare time to be in he company when i be settle in the same house with he but my journal be really a task of much time and labor and he forbid I to contract it i omit to mention in its place that dr johnson tell mr m ` queen that he have find the belief of the second sight universal in sky except among the clergy who seem determine against it i take the liberty to observe to mr m ` queen that the clergy be actuate by a kind of vanity ` the world -lrb- say they -rrb- take we to be credulous man in a remote corner we 'll shew they that we be more enlighten than they think ' the worthy man say that he disbelief of it be from he not find sufficient evidence but i could perceive that he be prejudice against it -lrb- 627 -rrb- after dinner to-day we talk of the extraordinary fact of lady grange 's be send to st kilda and confine there for several year without any means of relief -lrb- 628 -rrb- dr johnson say if m ` leod would let it be know that he have such a place for naughty lady he might make it a very profitable island we have in the course of we tour hear of st kilda poetry dr johnson observe ` it must be very poor because they have very few image ' boswell ` there may be a poetical genius shewn in combine these and in make poetry of they ' johnson ` sir a man can not make fire but in proportion as he have fuel he can not coin guinea but in proportion as he have gold ' at tea he talk of he intend to go to italy in 1775 m ` leod say he would like paris better johnson ` no sir there be none of the french literati now alive to visit whom i would cross a sea i can find in buffon 's book all that he can say -lrb- 629 -rrb- ' after supper he say ' i be sorry that prize-fighting be go out -lrb- 630 -rrb- every art should be preserve and the art of defense be surely important it be absurd that we soldier should have sword and not be teach the use of they prize-fighting make people accustom not to be alarm at see they own blood or feel a little pain from a wound i think the heavy _ glaymore _ be a ill-contrived weapon a man could only strike once with it it employ both he hand and he must of course be soon fatigue with wield it so that if he antagonist could only keep play a while he be sure of he i would fight with a dirk against rorie more 's sword i could ward off a blow with a dirk and then run in upon my enemy when within that heavy sword i have he he be quite helpless and i could stab he at my leisure like a calf it be think by sensible military man that the english do not enough avail themselves of they superior strength of body against the french for that must always have a great advantage in push with bayonet i have hear a officer say that if woman could be make to stand they would do as well as man in a mere interchange of bullet from a distance : but if a body of man should come close up to they then to be sure they must be overcome now -lrb- say he -rrb- in the same manner the weaker-bodied french must be overcome by we strong soldier ' the subject of duelling be introduce -lrb- 631 -rrb- johnson ` there be no case in england where one or other of the combatant _ must _ die : if you have overcome you adversary by disarm he that be sufficient though you should not kill he you honor or the honor of you family be restore as much as it can be by a duel it be cowardly to force you antagonist to renew the combat when you know that you have the advantage of he by superior skill you might just as well go and cut he throat while he be asleep in he bed when a duel begin it be suppose there may be a equality because it be not always skill that prevail it depend much on presence of mind nay on accident the wind may be in a man 's face he may fall many such thing may decide the superiority a man be sufficiently punish by be call out and subject to the risk that be in a duel ' but on my suggest that the injure person be equally subject to risk he fairly own he could not explain the rationality of duel Monday September 20 when i awake the storm be higher still it abate about nine and the sun shone but it rain again very soon and it be not a day for travel at breakfast dr johnson tell we ` there be once a pretty good tavern in catherine-street in the strand where very good company meet in a evening and each man call for he own half-pint of wine or gill if he please they be frugal man and nobody pay but for what he himself drink the house furnish no supper but a woman attend with mutton-pie which any body might purchase i be introduce to this company by cum the quaker -lrb- 632 -rrb- and use to go there sometimes when i drink wine in the last age when my mother live in london there be two set of people those who give the wall and those who take it the peaceable and the quarrelsome when i return to lichfield after have be in london my mother ask I whether i be one of those who give the wall or those who take it now it be fix that every man keep to the right or if one be take the wall another yield it and it be never a dispute -lrb- 633 -rrb- ' he be very severe on a lady whose name be mention he say he would have send she to st kilda that she be as bad as negative badness could be and stand in the way of what be good : that insipid beauty would not go a great way and that such a woman might be cut out of a cabbage if there be a skilful artificer m ` leod be too late in come to breakfast dr johnson say laziness be worse than the tooth-ach boswell ' i can not agree with you sir a bason of cold water or a horse whip will cure laziness ' johnson ` no sir it will only put off the fit it will not cure the disease i have be try to cure my laziness all my life and could not do it ' boswell ` but if a man do in a shorter time what might be the labor of a life there be nothing to be say against he ' johnson -lrb- perceive at once that i allude to he and he _ dictionary _ -rrb- ` suppose that flattery to be true the consequence would be that the world would have no right to censure a man but that will not justify he to himself -lrb- 634 -rrb- ' after breakfast he say to I ' a highland chief should now endeavor to do every thing to raise he rent by means of the industry of he people formerly it be right for he to have he house full of idle fellow they be he defender he servant he dependant he friend now they may be better employ the system of thing be now so much alter that the family can not have influence but by riches because it have no longer the power of ancient feudal time a individual of a family may have it but it can not now belong to a family unless you could have a perpetuity of man with the same view m ` leod have four time the land that the duke of bedford have i think with he spirit he may in time make himself the greatest man in the king 's dominion for land may always be improve to a certain degree i would never have any man sell land to throw money into the fund as be often do or to try any other species of trade depend upon it this rage of trade will destroy itself you and i shall not see it but the time will come when there will be a end of it trade be like gaming if a whole company be gamester play must cease for there be nothing to be win when all nation be trader there be nothing to be gain by trade -lrb- 635 -rrb- and it will stop first where it be bring to the greatest perfection then the proprietor of land only will be the great man ' i observe it be hard that m ` leod should find ingratitude in so many of he people johnson ` sir gratitude be a fruit of great cultivation you do not find it among gross people ' i doubt of this nature seem to have implant gratitude in all live creature -lrb- 636 -rrb- the lion mention by aulus gellius have it -lrb- 637 -rrb- it appear to I that culture which bring luxury and selfishness with it have a tendency rather to weaken than promote this affection dr johnson say this morning when talk of we set out that he be in the state in which lord bacon represent king he desire the end but do not like the means -lrb- 638 -rrb- he wish much to get home but be unwilling to travel in sky ` you be like king too in this sir -lrb- say i -rrb- that you must act under the direction of other ' Tuesday September 21 the uncertainty of we present situation have prevent I from receive any letter from home for some time i could not help be uneasy dr johnson have a advantage over I in this respect he have no wife or child to occasion anxious apprehension in he mind -lrb- 639 -rrb- it be a good morning so we resolve to set out but before quit this castle where we have be so well entertain let I give a short description of it along the edge of the rock there be the remains of a wall which be now cover with ivy a square court be form by building of different age particularly some tower say to be of great antiquity and at one place there be a row of false cannon of stone -lrb- 640 -rrb- there be a very large unfinished pile four story high which we be tell be here when _ leod _ the first of this family come from the isle of man marry the heiress of the m ` crail the ancient possessor of dunvegan and afterwards acquire by conquest as much land as he have get by marriage he surpass the house of austrium for he be _ felix _ both _ bellum gerere _ et _ nubere _ -lrb- 641 -rrb- john _ breck _ m ` leod the grandfather of the late laird begin to repair the castle or rather to complete it : but he do not live to finish he undertaking -lrb- 642 -rrb- not doubt however that he should do it he like those who have have they epitaph write before they die order the follow inscription compose by the minister of the parish to be cut upon a broad stone above one of the lower window where it still remain to celebrate what be not do and to serve as a memento of the uncertainty of life and the presumption of man : -- ` joanne macleod beganodunus dominus genti sua philarchus -lrb- 643 -rrb- durinesiae haraiae vaternesiae & c : baro d florae macdonald matrimoniali vinculo conjugatus turrem

inclose but a pretty murmur brook run along one side of it in it be a pyramid erect to the memory of thoma lord lovat by he son lord simon who suffer on tower-hill -lrb- 644 -rrb- it be of free-stone and i suppose about thirty foot high there be a inscription on a piece of white marble insert in it which i suspect to have be the composition of lord lovat himself be much in he pompous style : -- ` this pyramid be erect by simon lord fraser of lovat in honor of lord thoma he father a peer of scotland and chief of the great and ancient clan of the fraser be attack for he birthright by the family of atholl then in power and favor with king william yet by the valor and fidelity of he clan and the assistance of the campbell the old friend and ally of he family he defend he birthright with such greatness and fermety of soul and such valor and activity that he be a honor to he name and a good pattern to all brave chief of clan he die in the month of may 1699 in the 63rd year of he age in dunvegan the house of the laird of mac leod whose sister he have marry : by whom he have the above simon lord fraser and several other child and for the great love he bear to the family of mac leod he desire to be bury near he wife 's relation in the place where two of she uncle lay and he son lord simon to shew to posterity he great affection for he mother 's kindred the brave mac leod choose rather to leave he father 's bone with they than carry they to he own burial-place near lovat ' i have preserve this inscription -lrb- 645 -rrb- though of no great value think it characteristical of a man who have make some noise in the world dr johnson say it be poor stuff such as lord lovat 's butler might have write i observe in this church-yard a parcel of people assemble at a funeral before the grave be dig the coffin with the corpse in it be place on the ground while the people alternately assist in make a grave one man at a little distance be busy cut a long turf for it with the crooked spade which be use in sky a very aukward instrument the iron part of it be like a plough-coulter it have a rude tree for a handle in which a wooden pin be place for the foot to press upon a traveller might without further enquiry have set this down as the mode of bury in sky i be tell however that the usual way be to have a grave previously dig i observe to-day that the common way of carry home they grain here be in load on horseback they have also a few sled or _ car _ as we call they in ayrshire clumsily make and rarely use -lrb- 646 -rrb- we get to ulinish about six o'clock and find a very good farm-house of two story mr m ` leod of ulinish the sheriff-substitute of the island be a plain honest gentleman a good deal like a english justice of peace not much give to talk but sufficiently sagacious and somewhat droll he daughter though she be never out of sky be a very well-bred woman we reverend friend mr donald m ` queen keep he appointment and meet we here talk of phipp 's voyage to the north pole dr johnson observe that it ` be conjecture that we former navigator have keep too near land and so have find the sea frozen far north because the land hinder the free motion of the tide but in the wide ocean where the wave tumble at they full convenience it be imagine that the frost do not take effect ' -lrb- 647 -rrb- Wednesday September 22 in the morning i walk out and see a ship the margaret of clyde pass by with a number of emigrant on board it be a melancholy sight after breakfast we go to see what be call a subterraneous house about a mile off it be upon the side of a rise ground it be discover by a fox 's have take up he abode in it and in chase he they dig into it it be very narrow and low and seem about forty foot in length near it we find the foundation of several small hut build of stone mr m ` queen who be always for make every thing as ancient as possible boast that it be the dwelling of some of the first inhabitant of the island and observe what a curiosity it be to find here a specimen of the house of the _ aborigine _ which he believe could be find no where else and it be plain that they live without fire dr johnson remark that they who make this be not in the rudest state for that it be more difficult to make _ it _ than to build a house therefore certainly those who make it be in possession of house and have this only as a hiding-place it appear to I that the vestige of house just by it confirm dr johnson 's opinion from a old tower near this place be a extensive view of loch-braccadil and at a distance of the isle of barra and south uist and on the land-side the _ cuillin _ a prodigious range of mountain cap with rocky pinnacle in a strange variety of shape they resemble the mountain near corté in corsica of which there be a very good print they make part of a great range for deer which though entirely devoid of tree be in these country call a _ forest _ in the afternoon ulinish carry we in he boat to a island possess by he where we see a immense cave much more deserving the title of _ antrum immane _ -lrb- 648 -rrb- than that of the sybil describe by virgil which i likewise have visit it be one hundred and eighty foot long about thirty foot broad and at least thirty foot high this cave we be tell have a remarkable echo but we find none -lrb- 649 -rrb- they say it be owe to the great rain have make it damp such be the excuse by which the exaggeration of highland narrative be palliate there be a plentiful garden at ulinish -lrb- a great rarity in sky -rrb- and several tree and near the house be a hill which have a erse name signify _ ` the hill of strife ' _ where mr m ` queen inform we justice be of old administer it be like the _ mon placiti _ of scone or those hill which be call _ law _ -lrb- 650 -rrb- such as kelly _ law _ north berwick _ law _ and several other it be singular that this spot should happen now to be the sheriff 's residence we have a very cheerful evening and dr johnson talk a good deal on the subject of literature speaking of the noble family of boyle he say that all the lord orrery till the present have be writer the first write several play -lrb- 651 -rrb- the second -lrb- 652 -rrb- be bentley 's antagonist the third -lrb- 653 -rrb- write the _ life of swift _ and several other thing he son hamilton write some papers in the _ adventurer _ and _ world _ he tell we he be well acquaint with swift 's lord orrery he say he be a feebleminded man that on the publication of dr delany 's _ remark _ on he book he be so much alarm that he be afraid to read they dr johnson comfort he by tell he they be both in the right that delany have see most of the good side of swift -- lord orrery most of the bad m ` leod ask if it be not wrong in orrery to expose the defect of a man with whom he live in intimacy johnson ` why no sir after the man be dead for then it be do historically -lrb- 654 -rrb- ' he add ` if lord orrery have be rich he would have be a very liberal patron he conversation be like he writings neat and elegant but without strength he grasp at more than he ability could reach try to pass for a better talker a better writer and a better thinker than he be -lrb- 655 -rrb- there be a quarrel between he and he father in which he father be to blame because it arise from the son 's not allow he wife to keep company with he father 's mistress the old lord shew he resentment in he will -lrb- 656 -rrb- -- leave he library from he son and assign as he reason that he could not make use of it ' i mention the affectation of orrery in end all he letter on the _ life of swift _ in study variety of phrase -lrb- 657 -rrb- and never in the common mode of _ ' i be ' _ & c a observation which i remember to have be make several year ago by old mr sheridan this species of affectation in write as a foreign lady of distinguished talent once remark to I be almost peculiar to the english i take up a volume of dryden contain the conquest of granada and several other play of which all the dedication have such study conclusion dr johnson say such conclusion be more elegant and in address person of high rank -lrb- as when dryden dedicate to the duke of york -lrb- 658 -rrb- -rrb- they be likewise more respectful i agree that _ there _ it be much better : it be make he escape from the royal presence with a genteel sudden timidity in place of have the resolution to stand still and make a formal bow lord orrery 's unkind treatment of he son in he will lead we to talk of the disposition a man should have when die i say i do not see why a man should act differently with respect to those of whom he think ill when in health merely because he be die johnson ' i should not scruple to speak against a party when die but should not do it against a individual it be tell of sixtus quintus that on he death-bed in the interval of he last pang he sign death-warrant -lrb- 659 -rrb- ' mr m ` queen say he should not do so he would have more tenderness of heart johnson ' i believe i should not either but mr m ` queen and i be coward -lrb- 660 -rrb- it would not be from tenderness of heart for the heart be as tender when a man be in health as when he be sick though he resolution may be stronger -lrb- 661 -rrb- sixtus quintus be a sovereign as well as a priest and if the criminal deserve death he be do he duty to the last you would not think a judge die ill who should be carry off by a apoplectick fit while pronounce sentence of death consider a class of man whose business it be to distribute death : -- soldier who die scatter bullet nobody think they die ill on that account ' talking of biography he say he do not think that the life of any literary man in england have be well write -lrb- 662 -rrb- beside the common incident of life it should tell we he study he mode of live the means by which he attain to excellence and he opinion of he own work he tell we he have send derrick to dryden 's relation to gather material for he life -lrb- 663 -rrb- and he believe derrick -lrb- 664 -rrb- have get all that he himself should have get but it be nothing he add he have a kindness for derrick and be sorry he be dead he notion as to the poem publish by mr m ` pherson as the work of ossian be not shake here mr m ` queen always evade the point of authenticity say only that mr m ` pherson 's piece fall far short of those he know in erse which be say to be ossian 's johnson ' i hope they do i be not dispute that you may have poetry of great merit but that m ` pherson 's be not a translation from ancient poetry you do not believe it i say before you you do not believe it though you be very willing that the world should believe it ' mr m ` queen make no answer to this -lrb- 665 -rrb- dr johnson proceed ' i look upon m ` pherson 's _ fingal _ to be as gross a imposition as ever the world be trouble with have it be really a ancient work a true specimen how man think at that time it would have be a curiosity of the first rate as a modern production it be nothing ' he say he could never get the meaning of a _ erse _ song explain to he -lrb- 666 -rrb- they tell he the chorus be generally unmean ' i take it -lrb- say he -rrb- erse song be like a song which i remember : it be compose in queen elizabeth 's time on the earl of essex : and the burthen be radaratoo radarate radara tadara tandore ' ` but surely ' say mr m ` queen ` there be word to it which have meaning ' johnson ` why yes sir i recollect a stanza and you shall have it : -- o then bespeak the prentice all living in london both proper and tall for essex 's sake they would fight all radaratoo radarate radara tadara tandore -lrb- 667 -rrb- ' when mr m ` queen begin again to expatiate on the beauty of ossian 's poetry dr johnson enter into no farther controversy but with a pleasant smile only cry ` ay ay _ radaratoo radarate ' _ Thursday September 23 i take _ fingal _ down to the parlor in the morning and try a test propose by mr roderick m ` leod son to ulinish mr m ` queen have say he have some of the poem in the original i desire he to mention any passage in the print book of which he could repeat the original he point out one in page 50 of the quarto edition and read the erse while mr roderick m ` leod and i look on the english -- and mr m ` leod say that it be pretty like what mr m ` queen have recite but when mr m ` queen read a description of cuchullin 's sword in erse together with a translation of it in english verse by sir jame foulis mr m ` leod say that be much more like than mr m ` pherson 's translation of the former passage mr m ` queen then repeat in erse a description of one of the horse in cuchillin 's car mr m ` leod say mr m ` pherson 's english be nothing like it when dr johnson come down i tell he that i have now obtain some evidence concern _ fingal _ for that mr m ` queen have repeat a passage in the original erse which mr m ` pherson 's translation be pretty like and remind he that he himself have once say he do not require mr m ` pherson 's _ ossian _ to be more like the original than pope 's _ homer _ johnson ` well sir this be just what i always maintain he have find name and story and phrase nay passage in old song and with they have blended he own composition and so make what he give to the world as the translation of a ancient poem ' if this be the case i observe it be wrong to publish it as a poem in six book johnson ` yes sir and to ascribe it to a time too when the highlander know nothing of _ book _ and nothing of _ six _ -- or perhaps be get the length of count six we have be tell by condamine of a nation that could count no more than four -lrb- 668 -rrb- this should be tell to monboddo it would help he there be as much charity in help a man down-hill as in help he up-hill ' boswell ' i do not think there be as much charity ' johnson ` yes sir if he _ tendency _ be downward till he be at the bottom he flounder get he once there and he be quiet swift tell that stellum have a trick which she learn from addison of encourage a man in absurdity instead of endeavor to extricate he -lrb- 669 -rrb- ' mr m ` queen 's answer to the inquiry concern _ ossian _ be so unsatisfactory that i could not help observe that be he examine in a court of justice he would find himself under a necessity of be more explicit johnson ` sir he have tell blair a little too much which be publish -lrb- 670 -rrb- and he stick to it he be so much at the head of thing here that he have never be accustom to be closely examine and so he go on quite smoothly ' boswell ` he have never have any body to work -lrb- 671 -rrb- he ' johnson ` no sir and a man be seldom dispose to work himself though he ought to work himself to be sure ' mr m ` queen make no reply -lrb- 672 -rrb- have talk of the strictness with which witness be examine in court of justice dr johnson tell we that garrick though accustom to face multitude when produce as a witness in westminster-hall be so disconcerted by a new mode of public appearance that he could not understand what be ask -lrb- 673 -rrb- it be a cause where a actor claim a _ free benefit _ that be to say a benefit without pay the expence of the house but the meaning of the term be dispute garrick be ask ` sir have you a free benefit ' ` yes ' ` upon what term have you it ' ` upon-the terms-of-a free benefit ' he be dismiss as one from whom no information could be obtain dr johnson be often too hard on we friend mr garrick when i ask he why he do not mention he in the preface to he _ shakspeare _ -lrb- 674 -rrb- he say ` garrick have be liberally pay for any thing he have do for shakspeare if i should praise he i should much more praise the nation who pay he he have not make shakspeare better know -lrb- 675 -rrb- he can not illustrate shakspeare so i have reason enough against mention he be reason necessary there should be reason _ for _ it ' i speak of mr montague 's very high praise of garrick -lrb- 676 -rrb- johnson ` sir it be fit she should say so much and i should say nothing reynold be fond of she book and i wonder at it for neither i nor beauclerk nor mrs thrale could get through it -lrb- 677 -rrb- ' last night dr johnson give we a account of the whole process of tanning and of the nature of milk and the various operation upon it as make whey & c he variety of information be surprize -lrb- 678 -rrb- and it give one much satisfaction to find such a man bestow he attention on the useful art of life ulinish be much strike with he knowledge and say ` he be a great orator sir it be musick to hear this man speak ' a strange thought strike I to try if he know any thing of a art or whatever it should be call which be no doubt very useful in life but which lie far out of the way of a philosopher and a poet i mean the trade of a butcher i entice he into the subject by connect it with the various research into the manners and custom of uncivilized nation that have be make by we late navigator into the south sea i begin with observe that mr -lrb- now sir joseph -rrb- bank tell we that the art of slaughter animal be not know in otaheité for instead of bleed to death they dog -lrb- a common food with they -rrb- they strangle they this he tell I himself and i suppose that they hog be kill in the same way dr johnson say ` this must be owe to they not have knife -- though they have sharp stone with which they can cut a carcase in piece tolerably ' by degree he shew that he know something even of butchery ` different animal -lrb- say he -rrb- be kill differently a ox be knock down and a calf stunned but a sheep have its throat cut without any thing be do to stupify it the butcher have no view to the ease of the animal but only to make they quiet for they own safety and convenience a sheep can give they little trouble hale -lrb- 679 -rrb- be of opinion that every animal should be blood without have any blow give to it because it bleed better ' boswell ` that would be cruel ' johnson ` no sir there be not much pain if the jugular vein be properly cut ' pursue the subject he say the kennel of southwark run with blood two or three day in the week that he be afraid there be slaughter-house in more street in london than one suppose -lrb- speak with a kind of horror of butcher -rrb- and yet he add ` any of we would kill a cow rather than not have beef ' i say we _ could _ not ` yes -lrb- say he -rrb- any one may the business of a butcher be a trade indeed that be to say there be a apprenticeship serve to it but it may be learn in a month -lrb- 680 -rrb- ' i mention a club in london at the boar 's head in eastcheap the very tavern -lrb- 681 -rrb- where falstaff and he joyous companion meet the member of which all assume shakspeare 's character one be falstaff another prince henry another bardolph and so on johnson ` do not be of it sir now that you have a name you must be careful to avoid many thing not bad in themselves but which will lessen you character -lrb- 682 -rrb- this every man who have a name must observe a man who be not publickly know may live in london as he please without any notice be take of he but it be wonderful how a person of any consequence be watch there be a member of parliament who want to prepare himself to speak on a question that be to come on in the house and he and i be to talk it over together he do not wish it should be know that he talk with I so he would not let I come to he house but come to mine some time after he have make he speech in the house mr cholmondeley -lrb- 683 -rrb- a very airy -lrb- 684 -rrb- lady tell I ` well you could make nothing of he ' name the gentleman which be a proof that he be watch i have once some business to do for government and i go to lord north 's precaution be take that it should not be know it be dark before i go yet a few day after i be tell ` well you have be with lord north ' that the door of the prime minister should be watch be not strange but that a member of parliament should be watch or that my door should be watch be wonderful ' we set out this morning on we way to talisker in ulinish 's boat have take leave of he and he family mr donald m ` queen still favor we with he company for which we be much oblige to he as we sail along dr johnson get into one of he fit of railing at the scot he own that they have be a very learn nation for a hundred year from about 1550 to about 1650 but that they afford the only instance of a people among whom the art of civil life do not advance in proportion with learn that they have hardly any trade any money or any elegance before the union that it be strange that with all the advantage possess by other nation they have not any of those conveniency and embellishment which be the fruit of industry till they come in contact with a civilized people ` we have teach you -lrb- say he -rrb- and we 'll do the same in time to all barbarous nation -- to the cherokee -- and at last to the ouran-outang ' laughing with as much glee as if monboddo have be present boswell ` we have wine before the union ' johnson ` no sir you have some weak stuff the refuse of france which would not make you drunk ' boswell ' i assure you sir there be a great deal of drunkenness ' johnson ` no sir there be people who die of dropsy which they contract in try to get drunk -lrb- 685 -rrb- ' i must here glean some of he conversation at ulinish which i have omit he repeat he remark that a man in a ship be worse than a man in a jail -lrb- 686 -rrb- ` the man in a jail -lrb- say he -rrb- have more room better food and commonly better company and be in safety ' ` ay but -lrb- say mr m ` queen -rrb- the man in the ship have the please hope of get to shore ' johnson ` sir i be not talk of a man 's get to shore but of a man while he be in a ship : and then i say he be worse than a man while he be in a jail a man in a jail _ may _ have the _ please hope _ of get out a man confine for only a limited time actually _ have _ it ' m ` leod mention he scheme for carry on fishery with spirit and that he would wish to understand the construction of boat i suggest that he might go to a dock-yard and work as peter the great do johnson ` nay sir he need not work peter the great have not the sense to see that the mere mechanical work may be do by any body and that there be the same art in construct a vessel whether the board be well or ill work sir christopher wren might as well have serve he time to a bricklayer and first indeed to a brick-maker ' there be a beautiful little island in the loch of dunvegan call _ isa _ m ` leod say he would give it to dr johnson on condition of he reside on it three month in the year nay one month dr johnson be highly amuse with the fancy i have see he please himself with little thing even with mere idea like the present he talk a great deal of this island -- how he would build a house there -- how he would fortify it -- how he would have cannon -- how he would plant -- how he would sally out and _ take _ the isle of muck -- and then he laugh with uncommon glee and could hardly leave off i have see he do so at a small matter that strike he and be a sport to no one else -lrb- 687 -rrb- mr langton tell I that one night he do so while the company be all grave about he : -- only garrick in he significant smart manner dart he eye around exclaim ' _ very _ jocose to be sure ' m ` leod encourage the fancy of doctor johnson 's become owner of a island tell he that it be the practice in this country to name every man by he land and begged leave to drink to he in that mode : ' _ island isa _ you health ' ulinish talisker mr m ` queen and i all join in we different manners while dr johnson bow to each with much good humor we have good weather and a fine sail this day the shore be vary with hill and rock and corn-field and bush which be here dignified with the name of natural _ wood _ we land near the house of ferneley a farm possess by another gentleman of the name of m ` leod who expect we arrival be wait on the shore with a horse for dr johnson the rest of we walk at dinner i express to m ` leod the joy which i have in see he on such cordial term with he clan ` government -lrb- say he -rrb- have deprive we of we ancient power but it can not deprive we of we domestick satisfaction i would rather drink punch in one of they house -lrb- mean the house of he people -rrb- than be enable by they hardship to have claret in my own -lrb- 688 -rrb- ' this should be the sentiment of every chieftain all that he can get by raise he rent be more luxury in he own house be it not better to share the profit of he estate to a certain degree with he kinsman and thus have both social intercourse and patriarchal influence we have a very good ride for about three mile to talisker where colonel m ` leod introduce we to he lady we find here mr donald m ` lean the young laird of _ col _ -lrb- nephew to talisker -rrb- to whom i deliver the letter with which i have be favor by he uncle professor m ` leod at aberdeen -lrb- 689 -rrb- he be a little lively young man we find he have be a good deal in england study farming and be resolve to improve the value of he father 's land without oppress he tenant or lose the ancient highland fashion talisker be a better place than one commonly find in sky it be situate in a rich bottom before it be a wide expanse of sea on each hand of which be immense rock and at some distance in the sea there be three columnal rock rise to sharp point the billow break with prodigious force and noise on the coast of talisker -lrb- 690 -rrb- there be here a good many well-grown tree talisker be a extensive farm the possessor of it have for several generation be the next heir to m ` leod as there have be but one son always in that family the court before the house be most injudiciously pave with the round blueish-grey pebble which be find upon the sea-shore so that you walk as if upon cannon-ball drive into the ground after supper i talk of the assiduity of the scottish clergy in visit and privately instruct they parishioner and observe how much in this they excel the english clergy dr johnson would not let this pass he try to turn it off by say ` there be different way of instruct we clergy pray and preach ' m ` leod and i press the subject upon which he grow warm and break forth : ' i do not believe you people be better instruct if they be it be the blind lead the blind for you clergy be not instruct themselves ' think he have go a little too far he check himself and add ` when i talk of the ignorance of you clergy i talk of they as a body : i do not mean that there be not individual who be learn -lrb- look at mr m ` queen -lrb- 691 -rrb- -rrb- i suppose there be such among the clergy in muscovy the clergy of england have produce the most valuable book in support of religion both in theory and practice what have you clergy do since you sink into presbyterianism can you name one book of any value on a religious subject write by they -lrb- 692 -rrb- ' we be silent ` i 'll help you forbe write very well but i believe he write before episcopacy be quite extinguish ' and then pause a little he say ` yes you have wishart against repentance -lrb- 693 -rrb- ' boswell ` but sir we be not contend for the superior learning of we clergy but for they superior assiduity ' he bear we down again with thunder against they ignorance and say to I ' i see you have not be well teach for you have not charity ' he have be in some measure force into this warmth by the exult air which i assume for when he begin he say ` since you _ will _ drive the nail ' he again think of good mr m ` queen and take he by the hand say ` sir i do not mean any disrespect to you -lrb- 694 -rrb- ' here i must observe that he conquer by desert he ground and not meet the argument as i have put it the assiduity of the scottish clergy be certainly greater than that of the english he take up the topick of they not have so much learning be though ingenious yet a fallacy in logick it be as if there should be a dispute whether a man 's hair be well dress and dr johnson should say ` sir he hair can not be well dress for he have a dirty shirt no man who have not clean linen have he hair well dress ' when some day afterwards he read this passage he say ` no sir i do not say that a man 's hair could not be well dress because he have not clean linen but because he be bald ' he use one argument against the scottish clergy be learn which i doubt be not good ` as we believe a man dead till we know that he be alive so we believe man ignorant till we know that they be learn ' now we maxim in law be to presume a man alive till we know he be dead however indeed it may be answer that we must first know he have live and that we have never know the learning of the scottish clergy mr m ` queen though he be of opinion that dr johnson have desert the point really in dispute be much pleased with what he say and own to I he think it very just and mr m ` leod be so much captivate by he eloquence that she tell I ' i be a good advocate for a bad cause ' Friday September 24 this be a good day dr johnson tell we at breakfast that he ride harder at a fox chace than any body -lrb- 695 -rrb- ` the english -lrb- say he -rrb- be the only nation who ride hard a-hunting a frenchman go out upon a manage -lrb- 696 -rrb- horse and caper in the field and no more think of leap a hedge than of mount a breach lord powerscourt lay a wager in france that he would ride a great many mile in a certain short time the french academician set to work and calculate that from the resistance of the air it be impossible he lordship however perform it ' we money be nearly exhaust we send a bill for thirty pound draw on sir william forbe and co -lrb- 697 -rrb- to lochbraccadale but we messenger find it very difficult to procure cash for it at length however he get we value from the master of a vessel which be to carry away some emigrant there be a great scarcity of specie in sky -lrb- 698 -rrb- mr m ` queen say he have the utmost difficulty to pay he servant ' wages or to pay for any little thing which he have to buy the rent be pay in bill -lrb- 699 -rrb- which the drover give the people consume a vast deal of snuff and tobacco for which they must pay ready money and pedlar who come about sell goods as there be not a shop in the island carry away the cash if there be encouragement give to fishery and manufacture there might be a circulation of money introduce i get one-and-twenty shilling in silver at portree which be think a wonderful store talisker mr m ` queen and i walk out and look at no less than fifteen different waterfall near the house in the space of about a quarter of a mile -lrb- 700 -rrb- we also see cuchillin 's well say to have be the favorite spring of that ancient hero i drink of it the water be admirable on the shore be many stone full of crystallization in the heart though we oblige friend mr m ` lean be but the young laird he have the title of _ col _ constantly give he after dinner he and i walk to the top of prieshwell a very high rocky hill from whence there be a view of barra -- the long island -- bernera -- the loch of dunvegan -- part of rum -- part of rasay and a vast deal of the isle of sky col though he have come into sky with a intention to be at dunvegan and pass a considerable time in the island most politely resolve first to conduct we to mull and then to return to sky this be a very fortunate circumstance for he plan a expedition for we of more variety than merely go to mull he propose we should see the island of _ egg muck col _ and _ tyr-yi _ in all these island he could shew we every thing worth see and in mull he say he should be as if at home he father have land there and he a farm dr johnson do not talk much to-day but seem intent in listen to the scheme of future excursion plan by col dr birch -lrb- 701 -rrb- however be mention he say he have more anecdote than any man i say percy have a great many that he flow with they like one of the brook here johnson ` if percy be like one of the brook here birch be like the river thame birch excel percy in that as much as percy excel goldsmith ' i mention lord haile as a man of anecdote he be not please with he for publish only such memorial and letter as be unfavourable for the stuart family -lrb- 702 -rrb- ` if -lrb- say he -rrb- a man fairly warn you i be to give all the ill do you find the good he may : but if the object which he profess be to give a view of a reign let he tell all the truth i would tell truth of the two george or of that scoundrel king william -lrb- 703 -rrb- granger 's _ biographical history _ -lrb- 704 -rrb- be full of curious anecdote but might have be better do the dog be a whig i do not like much to see a whig in any dress but i hate to see a whig in a parson 's gown -lrb- 705 -rrb- ' Saturday September 25 it be resolve that we should set out in order to return to slate to be in readiness to take boat whenever there should be a fair wind dr johnson remain in he chamber write a letter and it be long before we could get he into motion he do not come to breakfast but have it send to he when he have finish he letter it be twelve o'clock and we should have set out at ten when i go up to he he say to I ` do you remember a song which begin every island be a prison -lrb- 706 -rrb- strongly guard by the sea king and prince for that reason prisoner be as well as we ' i suppose he have be think of we confine situation -lrb- 707 -rrb- he would fain have go in a boat from hence instead of ride back to slate a scheme for it be propose he say ` we 'll not be drive tamely from it : ' - but it prove impracticable we take leave of m ` leod and talisker from whom we part with regret talisker have be breed to physick have a tincture of scholarship in he conversation which pleased dr johnson and he have some very good book and be a colonel in the dutch service he and he lady in consequence of have live abroad have introduce the ease and politeness of the continent into this rude region young col be now we leader mr m ` queen be to accompany we half a day more we stop at a little hut where we see a old woman grind with the _ quern _ the ancient highland instrument which it be say be use by the roman but which be very slow in its operation be almost entirely go into disuse the wall of the cottage in sky instead of be one compacted mass of stone be often form by two exterior surface of stone fill up with earth in the middle which make they very warm the roof be generally bad they be thatched sometimes with straw sometimes with heath sometimes with fern the thatch be secure by rope of straw or of heath and to fix the rope there be a stone tie to the end of each these stone hang round the bottom of the roof and make it look like a lady 's hair in papers but i should think that when there be wind they would come down and knock people on the head we dine at the inn at sconser where i have the pleasure to find a letter from my wife here we part from we learn companion mr donald m ` queen dr johnson take leave of he very affectionately say ` dear sir do not forget I ' we settle that he should write a account of the isle of sky which dr johnson promise to revise he say mr m ` queen should tell all that he could distinguish what he himself know what be traditional and what conjectural we send we horse round a point of land that we might shun some very bad road and resolve to go forward by sea it be seven o'clock when we get into we boat we have many shower and it soon grow pretty dark dr johnson sit silent and patient once he say as he look on the black coast of sky-black as be compose of rock see in the dusk -- ` this be very solemn ' we boatman be rude singer and seem so like wild indian that a very little imagination be necessary to give one a impression of be upon a american river we land at _ strolimus _ from whence we get a guide to walk before we for two mile to _ corrichatachin _ not be able to procure a horse for we baggage i take one portmanteau before I and joseph another we have but a single star to light we on we way it be about eleven when we arrive we be most hospitably receive by the master and mistress who be just go to bed but with unaffected ready kindness make a good fire and at twelve o'clock at night have supper on the table jame macdonald of _ knockow _ kingsburgh 's brother whom we have see at kingsburgh be there he shew I a bond grant by the late sir jame macdonald to old kingsburgh the preamble of which do so much honor to the feeling of that much-lamented gentleman that i think it worth transcribe it be as follow : -- ' i sir jame macdonald of macdonald baronet now after arrive at my perfect age from the friendship i bear to alexander macdonald of kingsburgh and in return for the long and faithful service do and perform by he to my deceased father and to myself during my minority when he be one of my tutor and curator be resolve now that the say alexander macdonald be advance in year to contribute my endeavor for make he old age placid and comfortable ' -- therefore he grant he a annuity of fifty pound sterling dr johnson go to bed soon when one bowl of punch be finish i rise and be near the door in my way up stair to bed but corrichatachin say it be the first time col have be in he house and he should have he bowl-and would not i join in drink it the heartiness of my honest landlord and the desire of do social honor to we very oblige conductor induce I to sit down again col 's bowl be finish and by that time we be well warm a third bowl be soon make and that too be finish we be cordial and merry to a high degree but of what pass i have no recollection with any accuracy i remember call _ corrichatachin _ by the familiar appellation of _ corrus _ which he friend do a fourth bowl be make by which time col and young m ` kinnon corrichatachin 's son slip away to bed i continue a little with corrus and knockow but at last i leave they it be near five in the morning when i get to bed Sunday September 26 i awaked at noon with a severe head-ach i be much vex that i should have be guilty of such a riot and afraid of a reproof from dr johnson i think it very inconsistent with that conduct which i ought to maintain while the companion of the rambler about one he come into my room and accost I ` what drunk yet ' he tone of voice be not that of severe upbraid so i be relieve a little ` sir -lrb- say i -rrb- they keep I up ' he answer ` no you keep they up you drunken dog : ' - this he say with good-humoured _ english _ pleasantry soon afterwards corrichatachin col and other friend assemble round my bed corrus have a brandy-bottle and glass with he and insist i should take a dram ` ay say dr johnson fill he drunk again do it in the morning that we may laugh at he all day it be a poor thing for a fellow to get drunk at night and sculk to bed and let he friend have no sport ' find he thus jocular i become quite easy and when i offer to get up he very good naturedly say ` you need be in no such hurry now -lrb- 708 -rrb- ' i take my host 's advice and drink some brandy which i find a effectual cure for my head-ach when i rise i go into dr johnson 's room and take up mr m ` kinnon 's prayer-book i open it at the twentieth Sunday after trinity in the epistle for which i read ` and be not drunk with wine wherein there be excess -lrb- 709 -rrb- ' some would have take this as a divine interposition mr m ` kinnon tell we at dinner that old kingsburgh she father be examine at mugstot by general campbell as to the particulars of the dress of the person who have come to he house in woman 's clothes along with miss flora m ` donald as the general have receive intelligence of that disguise the particulars be take down in write that it might be see how far they agree with the dress of the _ irish girl _ who go with miss flora from the long island kingsburgh she say have but one song which he always sing when he be merry over a glass she dictate the word to I which be foolish enough : -- ` green sleeve -lrb- 710 -rrb- and pudding pie tell I where my mistress lie and i 'll be with she before she rise fiddle and aw ' together may we affair abroad succeed and may we king come home with speed and all pretender shake for dread and let _ he _ health go round to all we injured friend in need this side and beyond the tweed -- let all pretender shake for dread and let _ he _ health go round green sleeve ' & c while the examination be go on the present talisker who be there as one of m ` leod 's militia could not resist the pleasantry of ask kingsburgh in allusion to he only song ` have she _ green sleeve _ ' kingsburgh give he no answer lady margaret m ` donald be very angry at talisker for joke on such a serious occasion as kingsburgh be really in danger of he life mr m ` kinnon add that lady margaret be quite adore in sky that when she travel through the island the people run in crowd before she and take the stone off the road lest she horse should stumble and she be hurt -lrb- 711 -rrb- she husband sir alexander be also remember with great regard we be tell that every week a hogshead of claret be drunk at he table this be another day of wind and rain but good cheer and good society help to beguile the time i feel myself comfortable enough in the afternoon i then think that my last night 's riot be no more than such a social excess as may happen without much moral blame and recollect that some physician maintain that a fever produce by it be upon the whole good for health : so different be we reflection on the same subject at different period and such the excuse with which we palliate what we know to be wrong Monday September 27 mr donald m ` leod we original guide who have part from we at dunvegan join we again to-day the weather be still so bad that we could not travel i find a closet here with a good many book beside those that be lie about dr johnson tell I he find a library in he room at talisker and observe that it be one of the remarkable thing of sky that there be so many book in it though we have here great abundance of provision it be remarkable that corrichatachin have literally no garden : not even a turnip a carrot or a cabbage after dinner we talk of the crooked spade use in sky already describe and they maintain that it be better than the usual garden-spade and that there be a art in toss it by which those who be accustom to it could work very easily with it ` nay -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- it may be useful in land where there be many stone to raise but it certainly be not a good instrument for digging good land a man may toss it to be sure but he will toss a light spade much better : its weight make it a incumbrance a man _ may _ dig any land with it but he have no occasion for such a weight in digging good land you may take a field piece to shoot sparrow but all the sparrow you can bring home will not be worth the charge ' he be quite social and easy amongst they and though he drink no fermented liquor toast highland beauty with great readiness he conviviality engage they so much that they seem eager to shew they attention to he and vie with each other in cry out with a strong celtick pronunciation ` toctor shonson toctor shonson you health ' this evening one of we married lady a lively pretty little woman good-humouredly sit down upon dr johnson 's knee and be encourage by some of the company put she hand round he neck and kiss he ` do it again -lrb- say he -rrb- and let we see who will tire first ' he keep she on he knee some time while he and she drink tea he be now like a _ buck _ -lrb- 712 -rrb- indeed all the company be much entertain to find he so easy and pleasant to I it be highly comick to see the grave philosopher -- the rambler-toying with a highland beauty -lrb- 713 -rrb- -- but what could he do he must have be surly and weak too have he not behave as he do he would have be laugh at and not more respected though less loved he read to-night to himself as he sit in company a great deal of my journal and say to I ` the more i read of this i think the more highly of you ' the gentleman sit a long time at they punch after he and i have retire to we chamber the manner in which they be attend strike I as singular : -- the bell be break a smart lad lay on a table in the corner of the room ready to spring up and bring the kettle whenever it be want they continue drinking and singing erse song till near five in the morning when they all come into my room where some of they have bed unluckily for I they find a bottle of punch in a corner which they drink and corrichatachin go for another which they also drink they make many apology for disturbing I i tell they that have be keep awake by they mirth i have once thought of get up and join they again honest corrichatachin say ` to have have you do so i would have give a cow ' Tuesday September 28 the weather be worse than yesterday i feel as if imprison dr johnson say it be irksome to be detain thus : yet he seem to have less uneasiness or more patience than i have what make we situation worse here be that we have no room that we could command for the good people have no notion that a man could have any occasion but for a mere sleeping-place so during the day the bed chamber be common to all the house servant eat in dr johnson 's and mine be a kind of general rendezvous of all under the roof child and dog not except as the gentleman occupy the parlor the lady have no place to sit in during the day but dr johnson 's room i have always some quiet time for write in it before he be up and by degree i accustom the lady to let I sit in it after breakfast at my _ journal _ without mind I dr johnson be this morning for go to see as many island as we could not recollect the uncertainty of the season which might detain we in one place for many week he say to I ' i have more the spirit of adventure than you ' for my part i be anxious to get to mull from whence we might almost any day reach the main land dr johnson mention that the few ancient irish gentleman yet remain have the highest pride of family that mr sandford a friend of he whose mother be irish tell he that o'hara -lrb- who be true irish both by father and mother -rrb- and he and mr ponsonby son to the earl of besborough the greatest man of the three but of a english family go to see one of those ancient irish and that he distinguish they thus : ` o'hara you be welcome mr sandford you mother 's son be welcome mr ponsonby you may sit down ' he talk both of threshing and thatching he say it be very difficult to determine how to agree with a thresher ` if you pay he by the day 's wages he will thresh no more than he please though to be sure the negligence of a thresher be more easily detect than that of most labourer because he must always make a sound while he work if you pay he by the piece by the quantity of grain which he produce he will thresh only while the grain come freely and though he leave a good deal in the ear it be not worth while to thresh the straw over again nor can you fix he to do it sufficiently because it be so difficult to prove how much less a man thresh than he ought to do here then be a dilemma : but for my part i would engage he by the day : i would rather trust he idleness than he fraud ' he say a roof thatch with lincolnshire reed would last seventy year as he be inform when in that county and that he tell this in london to a great thatcher who say he believe it might be true such be the pain that dr johnson take to get the best information on every subject -lrb- 714 -rrb- he proceed : -- ` it be difficult for a farmer in england to find day-labourer because the lowest manufacturer can always get more than a day-labourer it be of no consequence how high the wages of manufacturer be but it would be of very bad consequence to raise the wages of those who procure the immediate necessaries of life for that would raise the price of provision here then be a problem for politician it be not reasonable that the most useful body of man should be the worst pay yet it do not appear how it can be order otherwise it be to be wish that a mode for its be otherwise be find out in the mean time it be better to give temporary assistance by charitable contribution to poor labourer at time when provision be high than to raise they wages because if wages be once raise they will never get down again -lrb- 715 -rrb- ' happily the weather clear up between one and two o'clock and we get ready to depart but we kind host and hostess would not let we go without take a _ snatch _ as they call it which be in truth a very good dinner while the punch go round dr johnson keep a close whispering conference with mr m ` kinnon which however be loud enough to let we hear that the subject of it be the particulars of prince charle 's escape the company be entertain and please to observe it upon that subject there be something congenial between the soul of dr samuel johnson and that of a isle of sky farmer 's wife it be curious to see people how far so ever remove from each other in the general system of they life come close together on a particular point which be common to each we be merry with corrichatachin on dr johnson 's whisper with he wife she perceive this humourously cry ' i be in love with he what be it to live and not to love ' upon she say something which i do not hear or can not recollect he seize she hand eagerly and kiss it as we be go the scottish phrase of ' _ honest man _ ' which be a expression of kindness and regard be again and again apply by the company to dr johnson i be also treat with much civility and i must take some merit from my assiduous attention to he and from my contrive that he shall be easy wherever he go that he shall not be ask twice to eat or drink any thing -lrb- which always disgust he -rrb- that he shall be provide with water at he meal and many such little thing which if not attend to would fret he i also may be allow to claim some merit in lead the conversation : i do not mean lead as in a orchestra by play the first fiddle but lead as one do in examine a witness -- start topic and make he pursue they he appear to I like a great mill into which a subject be throw to be ground it require indeed fertile mind to furnish material for this mill i regret whenever i see it unemployed but sometimes i feel myself quite barren and have nothing to throw in i know not if this mill be a good figure though pope make he mind a mill for turn verse -lrb- 716 -rrb- we set out about four young corrichatachin go with we we have a fine evening and arrive in good time at _ ostig _ the residence of mr martin m ` pherson minister of slate it be a pretty good house build by he father upon a farm near the church we be receive here with much kindness by mr and mr m ` pherson and he sister miss m ` pherson who please dr johnson much by singing erse song and play on the guittar he afterwards send she a present of he _ rassela _ in he bed-chamber be a press store with book greek latin french and english most of which have belong to the father of we host the learn dr m ` pherson who though he _ dissertation _ have be mention in a former page -lrb- 717 -rrb- as unsatisfactory be a man of distinguished talent dr johnson look at a latin paraphrase of the song of mose write by he and publish in the _ scot magazine _ for 1747 and say ` it do he honor he have a good deal of latin and good latin ' dr m ` pherson publish also in the same magazine June 1739 a original latin ode which he write from the isle of barra where he be minister for some year it be very poetical and exhibit a striking proof how much all thing depend upon comparison : for barra it seem appear to he so much worse than sky he _ natale solum _ -lrb- 718 -rrb- that he languish for its ` bless mountain ' and think himself bury alive amongst barbarian where he be my reader will probably not be displeased to have a specimen of this ode : -- ` hei mihi quantos patior dolores dum procul specto juga ter bea dum ferae barrae sterile arena solus oberro ` ingemo indignor crucior quod inter barbaro thulen lateam colente torpeo languen morior sepultus carcere coeco ' after wish for wing to fly over to he dear country which be in he view from what he call _ thule _ as be the most western isle of scotland except st kilda after describe the pleasure of society and the misery of solitude he at last with become propriety have recourse to the only sure relief of think man -- _ sursum corda _ -lrb- 719 -rrb- -- the hope of a better world dispose he mind to resignation : -- ` interim fiat tua rex volunta : erigor sursum quoty subit spe certa migrandi solymam supernam numini aulam ' he conclude in a noble strain of orthodox piety : -- ` vita tum demum vocitanda vita est tum licet gratos socios habere seraphim et sanctos triadem verendam concelebrante ' Wednesday September 29 -lrb- 720 -rrb- after a very good sleep i rise more refresh than i have be for some night we be now at but a little distance from the shore and see the sea from we window which make we voyage seem nearer mr m ` pherson 's manners and address pleased we much he appear to be a man of such intelligence and taste as to be sensible of the extraordinary power of he illustrious guest he say to I ` dr johnson be a honor to mankind and if the expression may be use be a honor to religion ' col who have go yesterday to pay a visit at camuscross join we this morning at breakfast some other gentleman also come to enjoy the entertainment of dr johnson 's conversation the day be windy and rainy so that we have just seize a happy interval for we journey last night we have good entertainment here better accommodation than at corrichatachin and time enough to ourselves the hour slip along imperceptibly we talk of shenstone dr johnson say he be a good layer-out of land -lrb- 721 -rrb- but would not allow he to approach excellence as a poet he say he believe he have try to read all he _ love pastoral _ but do not get through they i repeat the stanza ` she gaze as i slowly withdraw my path i could hardly discern so sweetly she bid I adieu i think that she bid I return -lrb- 722 -rrb- ' he say ` that seem to be pretty ' i observe that shenstone from he short maxim in prose appear to have some power of think but dr johnson would not allow he that merit -lrb- 723 -rrb- he agree however with shenstone that it be wrong in the brother of one of he correspondent to burn he letter -lrb- 724 -rrb- : ` for -lrb- say he -rrb- shenstone be a man whose correspondence be a honor ' he be this afternoon full of critical severity and deal about he censure on all side he say hammond 's _ love elegy _ be poor thing -lrb- 725 -rrb- he speak contemptuously of we lively and elegant though too licentious lyrick bard hanbury william and say ` he have no fame but from boy who drink with he -lrb- 726 -rrb- ' while he be in this mood i be unfortunate enough simply perhaps but i could not help think undeservedly to come within ` the whiff and wind of he fell sword -lrb- 727 -rrb- ' i ask he if he have ever be accustom to wear a night-cap he say ` no ' i ask if it be best not to wear one johnson ` sir i have this custom by chance and perhaps no man shall ever know whether it be best to sleep with or without a night-cap ' soon afterwards he be laugh at some deficiency in the highland and say ` one might as well go without shoe and stocking ' think to have a little hit at he own deficiency i venture to add ------ ' or without a night-cap sir ' but i have better have be silent for he retort directly ' i do not see the connection there -lrb- laughing -rrb- nobody before be ever foolish enough to ask whether it be best to wear a night-cap or not this come of be a little wrong-headed ' he carry the company along with he : and yet the truth be that if he have always wear a night-cap as be the common practice and find the highlander do not wear one he would have wonder at they barbarity so that my hit be fair enough Thursday September 30 there be as great a storm of wind and rain as i have almost ever see which necessarily confine we to the house but we be fully compensate by dr johnson 's conversation he say he do not grudge burke 's be the first man in the house of common for he be the first man every where but he grudge that a fellow who make no figure in company and have a mind as narrow as the neck of a vinegar cruet should make a figure in the house of common merely by have the knowledge of a few form and be furnish with a little occasional information -lrb- 728 -rrb- he tell we the first time he see dr young be at the house of mr richardson the author of _ clarissa _ he be send for that the doctor might read to he he _ conjecture on original composition _ -lrb- 729 -rrb- which he do and dr johnson make he remark and he be surprize to find young receive as novelty what he think very common maxim he say he believe young be not a great scholar nor have study regularly the art of write -lrb- 730 -rrb- that there be very fine thing in he _ night thought _ -lrb- 731 -rrb- though you could not find twenty line together without some extravagance he repeat two passage from he _ love of fame _ -- the character of brunetta -lrb- 732 -rrb- and stellum -lrb- 733 -rrb- which he praise highly he say young press he much to come to wellwyn he always intend it but never go -lrb- 734 -rrb- he be sorry when young die the cause of quarrel between young and he son he tell we be that he son insist young should turn away a clergyman 's widow who live with he and who have acquire great influence over the father be saucy to the son dr johnson say she could not conceal she resentment at he for say to young that ` a old man should not resign himself to the management of any body ' i ask he if there be any improper connection between they ` no sir no more than between two statue he be past fourscore and she a very coarse woman she read to he and i suppose make he coffee and froth he chocolate and do such thing as a old man wish to have do for he ' dr doddridge be mention he observe that ` he be author of one of the finest epigram in the english language it be in orton 's life of he -lrb- 735 -rrb- the subject be he family motto -- _ dum vivimus vivamus _ which in its primary signification be to be sure not very suitable to a christian divine but he paraphrase it thus : live while you live the _ epicure _ would say and seize the pleasure of the present day live while you live the sacred _ preacher _ cry and give to god each moment as it fly lord in my view let both unite be i live in _ pleasure _ when i live to _ thee _ ' i ask if it be not strange that government should permit so many infidel writings to pass without censure johnson ` sir it be mighty foolish it be for want of know they own power the present family on the throne come to the crown against the will of nine tenth of the people -lrb- 736 -rrb- whether those nine tenth be right or wrong it be not we business now to enquire but such be the situation of the royal family they be glad to encourage all who would be they friend now you know every bad man be a whig every man who have loose notion the church be all against this family they be as i say glad to encourage any friend and therefore since they accession there be no instance of any man be keep back on account of he bad principle and hence this inundation of impiety -lrb- 737 -rrb- ' i observe that mr hume some of whose writings be very unfavourable to religion be however a tory johnson ` sir hume be a tory by chance -lrb- 738 -rrb- as be a scotchman but not upon a principle of duty for he have no principle if he be any thing he be a hobbist ' there be something not quite serene in he humor to-night after supper for he speak of hasten away to london without stop much at edinburgh i remind he that he have general oughton and many other to see johnson ` nay i shall neither go in jest nor stay in jest i shall do what be fit ' boswell ` ay sir but all i desire be that you will let I tell you when it be fit ' johnson ` sir i shall not consult you ' boswell ` if you be to run away from we as soon as you get loose we will keep you confine in a island ' he be however on the whole very good company mr donald mcleod express very well the gradual impression make by dr johnson on those who be so fortunate as to obtain he acquaintance ` when you see he first you be strike with awful reverence -- then you admire he -- and then you love he cordially ' i read this evening some part of voltaire 's _ history of the war _ in 1741 -lrb- 739 -rrb- and of lord kame against hereditary indefeasible right this be a very slight circumstance with which i should not trouble my reader but for the sake of observe that every man should keep minute of whatever he read every circumstance of he study should be record what book he have consult how much of they he have read at what time how often the same author and what opinion he form of they at different period of he life such a account would much illustrate the history of he mind -lrb- 740 -rrb- Friday October 1 i shewed to dr johnson verse in a magazine on he _ dictionary _ compose of uncommon word take from it : -- ` little of _ anthropopathy _ -lrb- 741 -rrb- have he ' & c he read a few of they and say ' i be not answerable for all the word in my _ dictionary _ ' i tell he that garrick keep a book of all who have either praise or abuse he on the subject of he own reputation he say ' now that i see it have be so current a topick i wish i have do so too but it could not well be do now as so many thing be scatter in newspaper ' he say he be angry at a boy of oxford who write in he defense against kenrick because it be do he hurt to answer kenrick he be tell afterwards the boy be to come to he to ask a favor he first think to treat he rudely on account of he meddling in that business but then he consider he have mean to do he all the service in he power and he take another resolution he tell he he would do what he could for he and do so and the boy be satisfied he say he do not know how he pamphlet be do as he have ` read very little of it the boy make a good figure at oxford but die -lrb- 742 -rrb- he remark that attack on author do they much service ' a man who tell I my play be very bad be less my enemy than he who let it die in silence a man whose business it be to be talk of be much help by be attack ' -lrb- 743 -rrb- garrick i observe have be often so help johnson ` yes sir though garrick have more opportunity than almost any man to keep the publick in mind of he by exhibit himself to such number he would not have have so much reputation have he not be so much attack every attack produce a defense and so attention be engage there be no sport in mere praise when people be all of a mind ' boswell ` then hume be not the worse for beattie 's attack -lrb- 744 -rrb- ' johnson ` he be because beattie have confute he i do not say but that there may be some attack which will hurt a author though hume suffer from beattie he be the better for other attack ' -lrb- he certainly could not include in that number those of dr adam -lrb- 745 -rrb- and mr tytler -lrb- 746 -rrb- -rrb- boswell ` goldsmith be the better for attack ' johnson ` yes sir but he do not think so yet when goldsmith and i publish each of we something at the same time -lrb- 747 -rrb- we be give to understand that we might review each other goldsmith be for accept the offer i say no set reviewer at defiance it be say to old bentley upon the attack against he why they 'll write you down no sir he reply depend upon it no man be ever write down but by himself -lrb- 748 -rrb- ` he observe to I afterwards that the advantage author derive from attack be chiefly in subject of taste where you can not confute as so much may be say on either side -lrb- 749 -rrb- he tell I he do not know who be the author of the _ adventure of a guinea _ -lrb- 750 -rrb- but that the bookseller have send the first volume to he in manuscript to have he opinion if it should be print and he think it should the weather be now somewhat better mr jame mcdonald factor to sir alexander mcdonald in slate insist that all the company at ostig should go to the house at armidale which sir alexander have leave have go with he lady to edinburgh and be he guest till we have a opportunity of sailing to mull we accordingly get there to dinner and pass we day very cheerfully be no less than fourteen in number Saturday October 2 dr johnson say that ' a chief and he lady should make they house like a court they should have a certain number of the gentleman 's daughter to receive they education in the family to learn pastry and such thing from the housekeeper and manners from my lady that be the way in the great family in wale at lady salisbury 's -lrb- 751 -rrb- mr thrale 's grandmother and at lady philip 's -lrb- 752 -rrb- i distinguish the family by the lady as i speak of what be properly they province there be always six young lady at sir john philip 's : when one be marry she place be fill up there be a large school-room where they learn needle-work and other thing ' i observe that at some court in germany there be academy for the page who be the son of gentleman and receive they education without any expence to they parent dr johnson say that manners be best learn at those court ' you be admit with great facility to the prince 's company and yet must treat he with much respect at a great court you be at such a distance that you get no good ' i say ` very true : a man see the court of versaille as if he see it on a theater ' he say ` the best book that ever be write upon good breeding _ il corteggiano _ by castiglione -lrb- 753 -rrb- grow up at the little court of urbino and you should read it ' i be glad always to have he opinion of book at mr mcpherson 's he commend whitby 's _ commentary _ -lrb- 754 -rrb- and say he have hear he call rather lax but he do not perceive it he have look at a novel call _ the man of the world _ -lrb- 755 -rrb- at rasay but think there be nothing in it he say to-day while read my _ journal _ ` this will be a great treasure to we some year hence ' talk of a very penurious gentleman of we acquaintance -lrb- 756 -rrb- he observe that he exceed _ l'avare _ in the play -lrb- 757 -rrb- i concur with he and remark that he would do well if introduce in one of foote 's farce that the best way to get it do would be to bring foote to be entertain at he house for a week and then it would be _ facit indignatio _ -lrb- 758 -rrb- johnson ` sir i wish he have he i who have eat he bread will not give he to he but i should be glad he come honestly by he ' he say he be angry at thrale for sit at general oglethorpe 's without speak he censure a man for degrade himself to a non-entity i observe that goldsmith be on the other extreme for he speak at all venture -lrb- 759 -rrb- johnson ` yes sir goldsmith rather than not speak will talk of what he know himself to be ignorant which can only end in expose he ' ' i wonder -lrb- say i -rrb- if he feel that he expose himself if he be with two taylor ' ` or with two founder -lrb- say dr johnson interrupt I -rrb- he would fall a talk on the method of make cannon though both of they would soon see that he do not know what metal a cannon be make of ' we be very social and merry in he room this forenoon in the evening the company dance as usual we perform with much activity a dance which i suppose the emigration from sky have occasion they call it _ america _ each of the couple after the common _ involution _ and _ evolution _ successively whirl round in a circle till all be in motion and the dance seem intend to shew how emigration catch till a whole neighborhood be set afloat mr m ` kinnon tell I that last year when a ship sail from portree for america the people on shore be almost distract when they see they relation go off they lay down on the ground tumble and tear the grass with they tooth this year there be not a tear shed the people on shore seem to think that they would soon follow this indifference be a mortal sign for the country we dance to-night to the musick of the bagpipe which make we beat the ground with prodigious force i think it better to endeavor to conciliate the kindness of the people of sky by join heartily in they amusement than to play the abstract scholar i look on this tour to the hebride as a copartnership between dr johnson and I each be to do all he could to promote its success and i have some reason to flatter myself that my gayer exertion be of service to we dr johnson 's immense fund of knowledge and wit be a wonderful source of admiration and delight to they but they have it only at time and they require to have the interval agreeably fill up and even little elucidation of he learn text i be also fortunate enough frequently to draw he forth to talk when he would otherwise have be silent the fountain be at time lock up till i open the spring it be curious to hear the hebridian when any dispute happen while he be out of the room say ` stay till dr johnson come : say that to _ he _ yesterday dr johnson say ' i can not but laugh to think of myself rove among the hebride at sixty -lrb- 760 -rrb- i wonder where i shall reeve at fourscore -lrb- 761 -rrb- ' this evening he dispute the truth of what be say as to the people of st kilda catch cold whenever stranger come ` how can there -lrb- say he -rrb- be a physical effect without a physical cause -lrb- 762 -rrb- ' he add laugh ` the arrival of a ship full of stranger would kill they for if one stranger give they one cold two stranger must give they two cold and so in proportion ' i wonder to hear he ridicule this as he have praise m ` aulay for put it in he book : say that it be manly in he to tell a fact however strange if he himself believe it -lrb- 763 -rrb- he say the evidence be not adequate to the improbability of the thing that if a physician rather dispose to be incredulous should go to st kilda and report the fact then he would begin to look about he they say it be annually prove by m ` leod 's steward on whose arrival all the inhabitant catch cold he jocularly remark ` the steward always come to demand something from they and so they fall a cough i suppose the people in sky all take a cold when -- -lrb- name a certain person -lrb- 764 -rrb- -rrb- come ' they say he come only in summer johnson ` that be out of tenderness to you bad weather and he at the same time would be too much ' Sunday October 3 joseph report that the wind be still against we dr johnson say ' a wind or not a wind that be the question -lrb- 765 -rrb- ' for he can amuse himself at time with a little play of word or rather sentence i remember when he turn he cup at aberbrothick where we drink tea he mutter _ claudite jam rivo puerus ' _ -lrb- 766 -rrb- i must again and again apologize to fastidious reader for record such minute particulars they prove the scrupulous fidelity of my _ journal _ dr johnson say it be a very exact picture of a portion of he life while we be chat in the indolent stile of man who be to stay here all this day at least we be suddenly rouse at be tell that the wind be fair that a little fleet of herring-bus be pass by for mull and that mr simpson 's vessel be about to sail hugh m ` donald the skipper come to we and be impatient that we should get ready which we soon do dr johnson with composure and solemnity repeat the observation of epictetus that ` as man have the voyage of death before he -- whatever may be he employment he should be ready at the master 's call and a old man should never be far from the shore lest he should not be able to get himself ready ' he ride and i and the other gentleman walk about a english mile to the shore where the vessel lay dr johnson say he should never forget sky and return thanks for all civility we be carry to the vessel in a small boat which she have and we set sail very briskly about one o'clock i be much pleased with the motion for many hour dr johnson grow sick and retire under cover as it rain a good deal i keep above that i might have fresh air and finding myself not affect by the motion of the vessel i exulted in be a stout seaman while dr johnson be quite in a state of annihilation but i be soon humble for after imagine that i could go with ease to america or the east-indy i become very sick but keep above board though it rain hard as we have be detain so long in sky by bad weather we give up the scheme that col have plan for we of visit several island and contented ourselves with the prospect of see mull and icolmkill and inchkenneth which lie near to it mr simpson be sanguine in he hope for awhile the wind be fair for we he say he would land we at icolmkill that night but when the wind fail it be resolve we should make for the sound of mull and land in the harbor of tobermorie we keep near the five herr vessel for some time but afterwards four of they get before we and one little wherry fall behind we when we get in full view of the point of ardnamurchan the wind change and be directly against we get into the sound we be then oblige to tack and get forward in that tedious manner as we advance the storm grow greater and the sea very rough col then begin to talk of make for egg or canna or he own island we skipper say he would get we into the sound have struggle for this a good while in vain he say he would push forward till we be near the land of mull where we might cast anchor and lie till the morning for although before this there have be a good moon and i have pretty distinctly see not only the land of mull but up the sound and the country of morven as at one end of it the night be now grow very dark we crew consist of one m ` donald we skipper and two sailor one of whom have but one eye : mr simpson himself col and hugh m ` donald he servant all help simpson say he would willingly go for col if young col or he servant would undertake to pilot we to a harbor but as the island be low land it be dangerous to run upon it in the dark col and he servant appear a little dubious the scheme of run for canna seem then to be embrace but canna be ten league off all out of we way and they be afraid to attempt the harbor of egg all these different plan be successively in agitation the old skipper still try to make for the land of mull but then it be consider that there be no place there where we could anchor in safety much time be lose in strive against the storm at last it become so rough and threaten to be so much worse that col and he servant take more courage and say they would undertake to hit one of the harbor in col ` then let we run for it in god 's name ' say the skipper and instantly we turn towards it the little wherry which have fall behind we have hard work the master beg that if we make for col we should put out a light to he accordingly one of the sailor wave a glowing peat for some time the various difficulty that be start give I a good deal of apprehension from which i be relieve when i find we be to run for a harbor before the wind but my relief be but of short duration : for i soon hear that we sail be very bad and be in danger of be tear in piece in which case we should be drive upon the rocky shore of col it be very dark and there be a heavy and incessant rain the spark of the burning peat fly so much about that i dread the vessel might take fire then as col be a sportsman and have powder on board i figure that we might be blow up simpson and he appear a little frightened which make I more so and the perpetual talking or rather shout which be carry on in erse alarm I still more a man be always suspicious of what be say in a unknown tongue and if fear be he passion at the time he grow more afraid we vessel often lay so much on one side that i tremble lest she should be overset and indeed they tell I afterwards that they have run she sometimes to within a inch of the water so anxious be they to make what haste they could before the night should be worse i now see what i never see before a prodigious sea with immense billow come upon a vessel so as that it seem hardly possible to escape there be something grandly horrible in the sight i be glad i have see it once amidst all these terrifying circumstance i endeavor to compose my mind it be not easy to do it for all the story that i have hear of the dangerous sailing among the hebride which be proverbial -lrb- 767 -rrb- come full upon my recollection when i thought of those who be dearest to I and would suffer severely should i be lose i upbraid myself as not have a sufficient cause for put myself in such danger piety afford I comfort yet i be disturb by the objection that have be make against a particular providence and by the argument of those who maintain that it be in vain to hope that the petition of a individual or even of congregation can have any influence with the deity objection which have be often make and which dr hawkesworth have lately revive in he preface to the _ voyage to the south sea _ -lrb- 768 -rrb- but dr ogden 's excellent doctrine on the efficacy of intercession prevail it be half a hour after eleven before we set ourselves in the course for col as i see they all busy do something i ask col with much earnestness what i could do he with a happy readiness put into my hand a rope which be fix to the top of one of the mast and tell I to hold it till he bid I pull if i have consider the matter i might have see that this could not be of the least service but he object be to keep I out of the way of those who be busy work the vessel and at the same time to divert my fear by employ I and make I think that i be of use thus do i stand firm to my post while the wind and rain beat upon I always expect a call to pull my rope the man with one eye steer old m ` donald and col and he servant lay upon the fore-castle look sharp out for the harbor it be necessary to carry much _ cloth _ as they term it that be to say much sail in order to keep the vessel off the shore of col this make violent plunging in a rough sea at last they spy the harbor of lochiern and col cry ` thank god we be safe ' we run up till we be opposite to it and soon afterwards we get into it and cast anchor dr johnson have all this time be quiet and unconcerned he have lie down on one of the bed and have get free from sickness be satisfy the truth be he know nothing of the danger we be in -lrb- 769 -rrb- but fearless and unconcerned might have say in the word which he have choose for the motto to he _ rambler _ ` quo I cunque rapit tempesta deferor hospe -lrb- 770 -rrb- ' once during the doubtful consultation he ask whither we be go and upon be tell that it be not certain whether to mull or col he cry ` col for my money ' i now go down with col and mr simpson to visit he he be lie in philosophick tranquillity with a greyhound of col 's at he back keep he warm col be quite the _ juveni quus gaudet canibus _ -lrb- 771 -rrb- he have when we leave talisker two greyhound two terrier a pointer and a large newfoundland water-dog he lose one of he terrier by the road but have still five dog with he i be very ill and very desirous to get to shore when i be tell that we could not land that night as the storm have now increase i look so miserably as col afterwards inform I that what shakspeare have make the frenchman say of the english soldier when scantily diet _ ` piteous they will look like drowned mouse ' _ -lrb- 772 -rrb- might i believe have be well apply to I there be in the harbor before we a campbelltown vessel the betty kenneth morrison master take in kelp and bind for ireland we send we boat to beg bed for two gentleman and that the master would send he boat which be larger than ours he accordingly do so and col and i be accommodate in he vessel till the morning Monday October 4 about eight o'clock we go in the boat to mr simpson 's vessel and take in dr johnson he be quite well though he have taste nothing but a dish of tea since Saturday night on we express some surprise at this he say that ` when he lodge in the temple and have no regular system of life he have fast for two day at a time during which he have go about visit though not at the hour of dinner or supper that he have drunk tea but eat no bread that this be no intentional fasting but happen just in the course of a literary life ' -lrb- 773 -rrb- there be a little miserable publick-house close upon the shore to which we should have go have we land last night : but this morning col resolve to take we directly to the house of captain lauchlan m ` lean a descendant of he family who have acquire a fortune in the east-indy and take a farm in col -lrb- 774 -rrb- we have about a english mile to go to it col and joseph and some other run to some little horse call here _ shelty _ that be run wild on a heath and catch one of they we have a saddle with we which be clap upon it and a straw halter be put on its head dr johnson be then mount and joseph very slowly and gravely lead the horse i say to dr johnson ' i wish sir _ the club _ see you in this attitude -lrb- 775 -rrb- ' it be a very heavy rain and i be wet to the skin captain m ` lean have but a poor temporary house or rather hut however it be a very good haven to we there be a blaze peat-fire and mr m ` lean daughter of the minister of the parish get we tea i feel still the motion of the sea dr johnson say it be not in imagination but a continuation of motion on the fluid like that of the sea itself after the storm be over there be some book on the board which serve as a chimney-piece dr johnson take up burnet 's _ history of he own time _ -lrb- 776 -rrb- he say ` the first part of it be one of the most entertaining book in the english language it be quite dramatick : while he go about every where saw every where and hear every where by the first part i mean so far as it appear that burnet himself be actually engage in what he have tell and this may be easily distinguish ' captain m ` lean censured burnet for he high praise of lauderdale in a dedication -lrb- 777 -rrb- when he shew he in he history to have be so bad a man johnson ' i do not myself think that a man should say in a dedication what he could not say in a history however allowance should be make for there be a great difference the known style of a dedication be flattery : it profess to flatter there be the same difference between what a man say in a dedication and what he say in a history as between a lawyer 's plead a cause and report it ' the day pass away pleasantly enough the wind become fair for mull in the evening and mr simpson resolve to sail next morning : but have be throw into the island of col we be unwilling to leave it unexamined especially as we consider that the campbelltown vessel would sail for mull in a day or two and therefore we determine to stay Tuesday October 5 i rise and write my _ journal _ till about nine and then go to dr johnson who sit up in bed and talk and laugh i say it be curious to look back ten year to the time when we first think of visit the hebride -lrb- 778 -rrb- how distant and improbable the scheme then appear yet here we be actually among they ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- people may come to do any thing almost by talk of it i really believe i could talk myself into build a house upon island isa -lrb- 779 -rrb- though i should probably never come back again to see it i could easily persuade reynold to do it and there would be no great sin in persuade he to do it sir he would reason thus : what will it cost I to be there once in two or three summer why perhaps five hundred pound and what be that in comparison of have a fine retreat to which a man can go or to which he can send a friend he would never find out that he may have this within twenty mile of london then i would tell he that he may marry one of the miss m ` leod a lady of great family sir it be surprising how people will go to a distance for what they may have at home i know a lady who come up from lincolnshire to knightsbridge with one of she daughter and give five guinea a week for a lodging and a warm bath that be mere warm water _ that _ you know could not be have in _ lincolnshire _ she say it be make either too hot or too cold there ' after breakfast dr johnson and i and joseph mount horse and col and the captain walk with we about a short mile across the island we pay a visit to the reverend mr hector m ` lean he parish consist of the island of col and tyr-yus he be about seventy-seven year of age a decent ecclesiastick dress in a full suit of black clothes and a black wig he appear like a dutch pastor or one of the assembly of divine at westminster dr johnson observe to I afterwards ` that he be a fine old man and be as well-dressed and have as much dignity in he appearance as the dean of a cathedral ' we be tell that he have a valuable library though but poor accommodation for it be oblige to keep he book in large chest it be curious to see he and dr johnson together neither of they hear very distinctly so each of they talk in he own way and at the same time mr m ` lean say he have a confutation of bayle by leibnitz johnson ' a confutation of bayle sir what part of bayle do you mean the greatest part of he writings be not confutable : it be historical and critical ' mr m ` lean say ` the irreligious part ' and proceed to talk of leibnitz 's controversy with clarke call leibnitz a great man johnson ` why sir leibnitz persist in affirm that newton call space _ sensorium numini _ notwithstanding he be correct and desire to observe that newton 's word be quasi _ sensorium numini _ -lrb- 780 -rrb- no sir leibnitz be as paltry a fellow as i know out of respect to queen caroline who patronise he clarke treat he too well -lrb- 781 -rrb- ' during the time that dr johnson be thus go on the old minister be stand with he back to the fire crest up erect pull down the front of he periwig and talk what a great man leibnitz be to give a idea of the scene would require a page with two column but it ought rather to be represent by two good player the old gentleman say clarke be very wicked for go so much into the arian system -lrb- 782 -rrb- ' i will not say he be wicked say dr johnson he might be mistaken ' m ` lean ` he be wicked to shut he eye against the scripture and worthy man in england have since confute he to all intent and purpose ' johnson ' i know not _ who _ have confute he to _ all intent and purpose _ ' here again there be a double talk each continue to maintain he own argument without hear exactly what the other say i regret that dr johnson do not practice the art of accommodate himself to different sort of people have he be softer with this venerable old man we might have have more conversation but he forcible spirit and impetuosity of manner may be say to spare neither sex nor age i have see even mr thrale stunned but i have often maintain that it be better he should retain he own manner -lrb- 783 -rrb- pliability of address i conceive to be inconsistent with that majestick power of mind which he possess and which produce such noble effect a lofty oak will not bend like a supple willow he tell I afterwards he like firmness in a old man and be please to see mr m ` lean so orthodox ` at he age it be too late for a man to be ask himself question as to he belief -lrb- 784 -rrb- ' we ride to the northern part of the island where we see the ruin of a church or chapel -lrb- 785 -rrb- we then proceed to a place call grissipol or the rough pool at grissipol we find a good farm house belong to the laird of col and possess by mr m ` sweyn on the beach here there be a singular variety of curious stone i pick up one very like a small cucumber by the by dr johnson tell I that gay 's line in _ the beggar opera _ ` as man should serve a cucumber -lrb- 786 -rrb- ' & c have no waggish meaning with reference to man fling away cucumber as too _ cooling _ which some have think for it have be a common saying of physician in england that a cucumber should be well sliced and dress with pepper and vinegar and then throw out as good for nothing mr m ` sweyn 's predecessor have be in sky from a very remote period upon the estate belong to m ` leod probably before m ` leod have it the name be certainly norwegian from _ sueno _ king of norway the present mr m ` sweyn leave sky upon the late m ` leod 's raise he rent he then get this farm from col he appear to be near fourscore but look as fresh and be as strong as a man of fifty he son hugh look older and as dr johnson observe have more the manners of a old man than he i have often hear of such instance but never see one before mr m ` sweyn be a decent old gentlewoman she be dress in tartan and could speak nothing but erse she say she teach sir jame m ` donald erse and would teach I soon i could now sing a verse of the song _ hatyin foam ` eri _ -lrb- 787 -rrb- make in honor of allan the famous captain of clanranald who fall at sherrif-muir -lrb- 788 -rrb- whose servant who lay on the field watch he master 's dead body be ask next day who that be answer ` he be a man yesterday ' we be entertain here with a primitive heartiness whiskey be serve round in a shell accord to the ancient highland custom dr johnson would not partake of it but be desirous to do honor to the mode ` of other time ' drink some water out of the shell in the forenoon dr johnson say ` it would require great resignation to live in one of these island ' boswell ' i do not know sir i have feel myself at time in a state of almost mere physical existence satisfy to eat drink and sleep and walk about and enjoy my own thought and i can figure a continuation of this ' johnson ` ay sir but if you be shut up here you own thought would torment you you would think of edinburgh or london and that you could not be there ' we set out after dinner for _ breacacha _ the family seat of the laird of col accompany by the young laird who have now get a horse and by the younger mr m ` sweyn whose wife have go thither before we to prepare every thing for we reception the laird and he family be absent at aberdeen it be call _ breacacha _ or the spotted field because in summer it be enamel with clover and daisy as young col tell I we pass by a place where there be a very large stone i may call it a _ rock _ -- ' a vast weight for ajax -lrb- 789 -rrb- ' the tradition be that a giant throw such another stone at he mistress up to the top of a hill at a small distance and that she in return throw this mass down to he -lrb- 790 -rrb- it be all in sport ` malo I petit lasciva puellum -lrb- 791 -rrb- ' as we advance we come to a large extent of plain ground i have not see such a place for a long time col and i take a gallop upon it by way of race it be very refreshing to I after have be so long take short step in hilly country it be like stretch a man 's leg after be cramp in a short bed we also pass close by a large extent of sand-hill near two mile square dr johnson say ` he never have the image before it be horrible if barrenness and danger could be so ' i hear he after we be in the house of _ breacacha _ repeat to himself as he walk about the room ` and smother would in the dusty whirlwind die -lrb- 792 -rrb- ' probably he have be think of the whole of the simile in _ cato _ of which that be the conclude line the sandy desart have strike he so strongly the sand have of late be blow over a good deal of meadow and the people of the island say that they father remember much of the space which be now cover with sand to have be under tillage -lrb- 793 -rrb- col 's house be situate on a bay call _ breacacha _ bay we find here a neat new-built gentleman 's house better than any we have be in since we be at lord errol 's dr johnson relish it much at first but soon remark to I that ` there be nothing become a chief about it : it be a mere tradesman 's box -lrb- 794 -rrb- ' he seem quite at home and no longer find any difficulty in use the highland address for as soon as we arrive he say with a spirited familiarity ` now _ col _ if you could get we a dish of tea ' dr johnson and i have each a excellent bed-chamber we have a dispute which of we have the best curtain he be rather the best being of linen but i insist that my bed have the best post which be undeniable ` well -lrb- say he -rrb- if you _ have _ the best _ post _ we will have you tie to they and whip ' i mention this slight circumstance only to shew how ready he be even in mere trifle to get the better of he antagonist by place he in a ludicrous view i have know he sometimes use the same art when hard press in serious disputation goldsmith i remember to retaliate for many a severe defeat which he have suffer from he apply to he a lively say in one of cibber 's comedy which put this part of he character in a strong light -- ` there be no argue with johnson for _ if he pistol miss fire he knock you down with the butt end of it _ -lrb- 795 -rrb- ' Wednesday October 6 after a sufficiency of sleep we assemble at breakfast we be just as if in barracks every body be master we go and view the old castle of col which be not far from the present house near the shore and found on a rock it have never be a large feudal residence and have nothing about it that require a particular description like other old inconvenient building of the same age it exemplify gray 's picturesque line ` huge -lrb- 796 -rrb- window that exclude the light and passage that lead to nothing ' it may however be worth mention that on the second story we see a vault which be and still be the family prison there be a woman put into it by the laird for theft within these ten year and any offender would be confine there yet for from the necessity of the thing as the island be remote from any power establish by law the laird must exercise he jurisdiction to a certain degree we be shewn in a corner of this vault a hole into which col say greater criminal use to be put it be now fill up with rubbish of different kind he say it be of a great depth ` ay -lrb- say dr johnson smile -rrb- all such place that _ be fill up _ be of a great depth ' he be very quick in shew that he do not give credit to careless or exaggerated account of thing after see the castle we look at a small hut near it it be call _ teigh franchich ie _ the frenchman 's house col could not tell we the history of it a poor man with a wife and child now live in it we go into it and dr johnson give they some charity there be but one bed for all the family and the hut be very smoky when he come out he say to I _ ` et hoc secundum sententiam philosophorum est esse beatus _ -lrb- 797 -rrb- ' boswell ` the philosopher when they place happiness in a cottage suppose cleanliness and no smoke ' johnson ` sir they do not think about either ' we walk a little in the laird 's garden in which endeavor have be use to rear some tree but as soon as they get above the surround wall they die dr johnson recommend sowing the seed of hardy tree instead of plant col and i ride out this morning and view a part of the island in the course of we ride we see a turnip-field which he have hoe with he own hand he first introduce this kind of husbandry into the western island -lrb- 798 -rrb- we also look at a appearance of lead which seem very promising it have be long know for i find letter to the late laird from sir john areskine and sir alexander murray respect it after dinner come mr m ` lean of corneck brother to isle of muck who be a cadet of the family of col he possess the two end of col which belong to the duke of argyll corneck have lately take a lease of they at a very advanced rent rather than let the campbell get a footing in the island one of whom have offer nearly as much as he dr johnson well observe that ` landlord err much when they calculate merely what they land _ may _ yield the rent must be in a proportionate ratio of what the land may yield and of the power of the tenant to make it yield a tenant can not make by he land but accord to the corn and cattle which he have suppose you should give he twice as much land as he have it do he no good unless he get also more stock it be clear then that the highland landlord who let they substantial tenant leave they be infatuate for the poor small tenant can not give they good rent from the very nature of thing they have not the means of raise more from they farm -lrb- 799 -rrb- ' corneck dr johnson say be the most distinct man that he have meet with in these isle : he do not shut he eye or put he finger in he ear which he seem to think be a good deal the mode with most of the people whom we have see of late Thursday October 7 captain m ` lean join we this morning at breakfast there come on a dreadful storm of wind and rain which continue all day and rather increase at night the wind be directly against we get to mull we be in a strange state of abstraction from the world : we could neither hear from we friend nor write to they col have bring daille _ on the father _ -lrb- 800 -rrb- luca _ on happiness _ -lrb- 801 -rrb- and more 's _ dialogue

-rrb- dr johnson read a good deal of burnet and of gregory and i observe he make some geometrical note in the end of he pocket-book i read a little of young 's _ six week ' tour through the southern county _ and ovid 's _ epistle _ which i have buy at inverness and which help to solace many a weary hour we be to have go with dr johnson this morning to see the mine but be prevent by the storm while it be rage he say ` we may be glad we be not _ damnatus ad metallum _ ' Friday October 8 dr johnson appear to-day very weary of we present confine situation he say ' i want to be on the main land and go on with existence this be a waste of life ' i shall here insert without regard to chronology some of he conversation at different time ` there be a man some time ago who be well receive for two year among the gentleman of northamptonshire by call himself my brother at last he grow so impudent as by he influence to get tenant turn out of they farm allen the printer -lrb- 804 -rrb- who

fellow be dismiss it pleased I to hear that so much be get by use my name it be not every name that can carry double do both for a man 's self and he brother -lrb- laughing -rrb- i should be glad to see the fellow however i could have do nothing against he a man can have no redress for he name be use or ridiculous story be tell of he in the newspaper except he can shew that he have suffer damage some year ago a foolish piece be publish say to be write _ by s johnson _ some of my friend want I to be very angry about this i say it would be in vain for the answer would be _ s johnson _ may be simon johnson or simeon johnson or solomon johnson and even if the full name samuel johnson have be use it might be say it be not you it be a much cleverer fellow ` beauclerk and i and langton and lady sydney beauclerk mother to we friend be one day drive in a coach by cuper 's garden -lrb- 805 -rrb- which be then unoccupied i in sport propose that beauclerk and langton and myself should take they and we amuse ourselves with scheming how we should all do we part lady sydney grow angry and say a old man should not put such thing in young people 's head she have no notion of a joke sir have come late into life and have a mighty unpliable understanding ' _ carte 's life of the duke of ormond _ be consider as a book of authority but it be ill-written the matter be diffuse in too many word there be no animation no compression no vigor two good volume in duodecimo might be make out of the two in folio -lrb- 806 -rrb- talking of we confinement here i observe that we discontent and impatience could not be consider as very unreasonable for that we be just in the state of which seneca complain so grievously while in exile in corsica -lrb- 807 -rrb- ` yes -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- and he be not farther from home than we be ' the truth be he be much nearer there be a good deal of rain to-day and the wind be still contrary corneck attend I while i amuse myself in examine a

not repay we trouble in get to it he amuse himself with read _ gataker on lot and on the christian watch -lrb- 817 -rrb- _ a very learn book of the last age which have be find in the garret of col 's house and which he say be a treasure here when we descry he from above he have a most eremitical appearance and on we return tell we he have be so much engage by gataker that he have never miss we he avidity for variety of book while we be in col be frequently express and he often complain that so few be within he reach upon which i observe to he that it be strange he should complain of want of book when he could at any time make such good one we next proceed to the lead mine in we way we come to a strand of some extent where we be glad to take a gallop in which my learn friend join with great alacrity dr johnson mount on a large bay mare without shoe and follow by a foal which have some difficulty in keep up with he be a singular spectacle after examine the mine we return through a very uncouth district full of sand hill down which though apparent precipice we horse carry we with safety the sand always gently slide away from they foot vestige of house be point out to we which col and two other who have join we assert have be overwhelm with sand blow over they but on go close to one of they dr johnson shew the absurdity of the notion by remark that ` it be evidently only a house abandon the stone of which have be take away for other purpose for the large stone which form the lower part of the wall be still stand higher than the sand if _ they _ be not blow over it be clear nothing higher than they could be blow over ' this be quite convincing to I but it make not the least impression on col and the other who be not to be argue out of a highland tradition we do not sit down to dinner till between six and seven we live plentifully here and have a true welcome in such a season good firing be of no small importance the peat be excellent and burned cheerfully those at dunvegan which be damp dr johnson call ' a sullen fuel ' here a scottish phrase be singularly apply to he one of the company have remark that he have go out on a stormy evening and bring in a supply of peat from the stack old mr m ` sweyn say ` that be _ main honest _ -lrb- 818 -rrb- ' blenheim be occasionally mention he tell I he have never see it -lrb- 819 -rrb- : he have not go formerly and he would not go now just as a common spectator for he money : he would not put it in the power of some man about the duke of marlborough to say ` johnson be here i know he but i take no notice of he -lrb- 820 -rrb- ' he say he should be very glad to see it if properly invite which in all probability would never be the case as it be not worth he while to seek for it i observe that he might be easily introduce there by a common friend of ours nearly related to the duke -lrb- 821 -rrb- he answer with a uncommon attention to delicacy of feeling ' i doubt whether we friend be on such a footing with the duke as to carry any body there and i would not give he the uneasiness of see that i know he be not or even of be himself remind of it ' Sunday October 10 there be this day the most terrible storm of wind and rain that i ever remember -lrb- 822 -rrb- it make such a awful impression on we all as to produce for some time a kind of dismal quietness in the house the day be pass without much conversation : only upon my observe that there must be something bad in a man 's mind who do not like to give lease to he tenant but wish to keep they in a perpetual wretched dependance on he will dr johnson say ` you be right : it be a man 's duty to extend comfort and security among as many people as he can he should not wish to have he tenant mere _ ephemerae _ -- mere being of a hour -lrb- 823 -rrb- ' boswell ` but sir if they have lease be there not some danger that they may grow insolent i remember you yourself once tell I a english tenant be so independent that if provoke he would _ throw _ he rent at he landlord ' johnson ` depend upon it sir it be the landlord 's own fault if it be throw at he a man may always keep he tenant in dependence enough though they have lease he must be a good tenant indeed who will not fall behind in he rent if he landlord will let he and if he do fall behind he landlord have he at he mercy indeed the poor man be always much at the mercy of the rich no matter whether landlord or tenant if the tenant let he landlord have a little rent beforehand or have lend he money then the landlord be in he power there can not be a greater man than a tenant who have lend money to he landlord for he have under subjection the very man to whom he should be subject ' Monday October ii we have some day ago engage the campbelltown vessel to carry we to mull from the harbor where she lay the morning be fine and the wind fair and moderate so we hope at length to get away mr m ` sweyn who officiate as we landlady here have never be on the main land on hearing this dr johnson say to I before she ` that be rather be behind-hand with life i would at least go and see glenelg ' boswell ` you yourself sir have never see till now any thing but you native island ' johnson ` but sir by see london i have see as much of life as the world can shew -lrb- 824 -rrb- ' boswell ` you have not see pekin ' johnson ` what be pekin ten thousand londoner would _ drive _ all the people of pekin : they would drive they like deer ' we set out about eleven for the harbor but before we reach it so violent a storm come on that we be oblige again to take shelter in the house of captain m ` lean where we dine and pass the night Tuesday October 12 after breakfast we make a second attempt to get to the harbor but another storm soon convinced we that it would be in vain captain m ` lean 's house be in some confusion on account of mr m ` lean be expect to lie-in we resolve to go to mr m ` sweyn 's where we arrive very wet fatigue and hungry in this situation we be somewhat disconcerted by be tell that we should have no dinner till late in the evening but should have tea in the mean time dr johnson oppose this arrangement but they persist and he take the tea very readily he say to I afterwards ` you must consider sir a dinner here be a matter of great consequence it be a thing to be first plan and then execute i suppose the mutton be bring some mile off from some place where they know there be a sheep kill ' talk of the good people with whom we be he say ` life have not get at all forward by a generation in m ` sweyn 's family for the son be exactly form upon the father what the father say the son say and what the father look the son look ' there be little conversation to-night i must endeavor to recollect what i may have omit on former occasion when i boast at rasay of my independency of spirit and that i could not be bribe he say ` yes you may be bribe by flattery ' at the reverend mr m ` lean 's dr johnson ask he if the people of col have any superstition he say ` no ' the cut peat at the increase of the moon be mention as one but he would not allow it say it be not a superstition but a whim dr johnson would not admit the distinction there be many superstition he maintain not connect with religion and this be one of they -lrb- 825 -rrb- on Monday we have a dispute at the captain 's whether sand-hill could be fix down by art dr johnson say ` how _ the devil _ can you do it ' but instantly correct himself ` how can you do it -lrb- 826 -rrb- ' i never before hear he use a phrase of that nature he have particularity which it be impossible to explain -lrb- 827 -rrb- he never wear a night-cap as i have already mention but he put a handkerchief on he head in the night the day that we leave talisker he bid we ride on he then turn the head of he horse back towards talisker stop for some time then wheel round to the same direction with ours and then come briskly after we he set open a window in the coldest day or night and stand before it it may do with he constitution but most people amongst whom i be one would say with the frog in the fable ` this may be sport to you but it be death to we ' it be in vain to try to find a meaning in every one of he particularity which i suppose be mere habit contract by chance of which every man have some that be more or less remarkable he speak to himself or rather repeat be a common habit with studious man accustom to deep thinking and in consequence of they be thus rapt they will even laugh by themselves if the subject which they be muse on be a merry one dr johnson be often utter pious ejaculation when he appear to be talk to himself for sometimes he voice grow stronger and part of the lord 's prayer be hear -lrb- 828 -rrb- i have sit beside he with more than ordinary reverence on such occasion -lrb- 829 -rrb- in we tour i observe that he be disgusted whenever he meet with coarse manners he say to I ' i know not how it be but i can not bear low life -lrb- 830 -rrb- : and i find other who have as good a right as i to be fastidious bear it better by have mix more with different sort of man you would think that i have mix pretty well too ' he read this day a good deal of my _ journal _ write in a small book with which he have supply I and be please for he say ' i wish thy book be twice as big ' he help I to fill up blank which i have leave in first write it when i be not quite sure of what he have say and he correct any mistake that i have make ` they call I a scholar -lrb- say he -rrb- and yet how very little literature be there in my conversation ' boswell ` that sir must be accord to you company you would not give literature to those who can not taste it stay till we meet lord elibank ' we have at last a good dinner or rather supper and be very well satisfy with we entertainment Wednesday October 13 col call I up with intelligence that it be a good day for a passage to mull and just as we rise a sailor from the vessel

all boy do it and you be longer a boy than other ' he himself have no alertness or whatever it may be call so he may dislike it as _ oderunt hilarem triste -lrb- 832 -rrb- _ before we reach the harbor the wind grow high again however the small boat be wait and take we on board we remain for some time in uncertainty what to do : at last it be determine that as a good part of the day be over and it be dangerous to be at sea at night in such a vessel and such weather we should not sail till the morning tide when the wind would probably be more gentle we resolve not to go ashore again but lie here in readiness dr johnson and i have each a bed in the cabin col sit at the fire in the fore-castle with the captain and joseph and the rest i eat some dry oatmeal of which i find a barrel in the cabin i have not do this since i be a boy dr johnson own that he too be fond of it when a boy -lrb- 833 -rrb- a circumstance which i be highly please to hear from he as it give I a opportunity of observe that notwithstanding he joke on the article of oats -lrb- 834 -rrb- he be himself a proof that this kind of _ food _ be not peculiar to the people of scotland Thursday October 14 when dr johnson awake this morning he call _ ` lanky ' _ have i suppose be think of langton but correct himself instantly and cry _ ` bozzy ' _ he have a way of contract the name of he friend goldsmith feel himself so important now as to be displeased at it i remember one day when tom davy be tell that dr johnson say we be all in labor for a name to _ goldy 's _ play ' goldsmith cry ' i have often desire he not to call I _ goldy -lrb- 835 -rrb- ' _ between six and seven we haul we anchor and set sail with a fair breeze and after a pleasant voyage we get safely and agreeably into the harbor of tobermorie before the wind rise which it always have do for some day about noon tobermorie be a excellent harbor a island lie before it and it be surround by a hilly theater -lrb- 836 -rrb- the island be too low otherwise this would be quite a secure port but the island not be a sufficient protection some storm blow very hard here not long ago fifteen vessel be blow from they mooring there be sometimes sixty or seventy sail here : to-day there be twelve or fourteen vessel to see such a fleet be the next thing to see a town the vessel be from different place clyde campbelltown newcastle & c one be return

spirit when we have land dr johnson say ` boswell be now all alive he be like antaeus he get new vigor whenever he touch the ground ' i go to the top of a hill front the harbor from whence i have a good view of it we have here a tolerable inn dr johnson have own to I this morning that he be out of humor indeed he shew it a good deal in the ship for when i be express my joy on the prospect of we landing in mull he say he have no joy when he recollect that it would be five day before he should get to the main land i be afraid he would now take a sudden resolution to give up see icolmkill a dish of tea and some good bread and butter do he service and he bad humor go off i tell he that i be divert to hear all the people whom we have visit in we tour say _ ` honest man _ he be pleased with every thing he be always content ' -- ` little do they know ' say i he laugh and say ` you rogue -lrb- 837 -rrb- ' we send to hire horse to carry we across the island of mull to the shore opposite to

lean a physician who live about a mile from tobermorie dr johnson and i sit by ourselves at the inn and talk a good deal i tell he that i have find in leandro albertus 's description of italy much of what addison have give we in he _ remark _ -lrb- 838 -rrb- he say ` the collection of passage from the classick have be make by another italian : it be however impossible to detect a man as a plagiary in such a case because all who set about make such a collection must find the same passage but if you find the same application in another book then addison 's learning in he _ remark _ tumble down it be a tedious book and if it be not attach to addison 's previous reputation one would not think much of it have he write nothing else he name would not have live addison do not seem to have go deep in italian literature : he shew nothing of it in he subsequent writings he shew a great deal of french learning there be perhaps more knowledge circulate in the french language than in any other -lrb- 839 -rrb- there be more original knowledge in english ' ` but the french -lrb- say i -rrb- have the art of accommodate -lrb- 840 -rrb- literature ' johnson ` yes sir : we have no such book as morerus 's _ dictionary _ -lrb- 841 -rrb- ' boswell ` they _ ana _ -lrb- 842 -rrb- be good ' johnson ' a few of they be good but we have one book of that kind better than any of they selden 's _ table-talk _ as to original literature the french have a couple of tragick poet who go round the world racine and corneille and one comick poet moliere ' boswell ` they have fenelon ' johnson ` why sir _ telemachus _ be pretty well ' boswell ` and voltaire sir ' johnson ` he have not stand he trial yet and what make voltaire chiefly circulate be collection such as he _ universal history _ ' boswell ` what do you say to the bishop of meaux ' johnson ` sir nobody read he -lrb- 843 -rrb- ' he would not allow massilon and bourdaloue to go round the world in general however he give the french much praise for they industry he ask I whether he have mention in any of the papers of the _ rambler _ the description in virgil of the entrance into hell with a application to the press ` for -lrb- say he -rrb- i do not much remember they ' i tell he ` no ' upon which he repeat it : -- ` vestibulum ante ipsum primisque in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia curae pallentesque habitant morbi tristisque senectus et metus et malesuada fame et turpis egestas terribiles visu formae lethumque laborque -lrb- 844 -rrb- ' ` now -lrb- say he -rrb- almost all these apply exactly to a author : all these be the concomitant of a printing-house i propose to he to dictate a essay on it and offer to write it he say he would not do it then but perhaps would write one at some future period the Sunday evening that we sit by ourselves at aberdeen i ask he several particulars of he life from he early year which he readily tell I and i write they down before he this day i proceed in my inquiry also write they in he presence i have they on detach sheet i shall collect authentick material for the life of samuel johnson lld and if i survive he i shall be one who will most faithfully do honor to he memory i have now a vast treasure of he conversation at different time since the year 1762 -lrb- 845 -rrb- when i first obtain he acquaintance and by assiduous inquiry i can make up for not know he sooner -lrb- 846 -rrb- a newcastle ship-master who happen to be in the house intrude himself upon we he be much in liquor and talk nonsense about he be a man for _ wilke and liberty _ and against the ministry dr johnson be angry that ' a fellow should come into _ we _ company who be fit for _ no _ company ' he leave we soon col return from he aunt and tell we she insist that we should come to she house that night he introduce to we mr campbell the duke of argyle 's factor in tyr-yus he be a genteel agreeable man he be go to inverary and promise to put letter into the post-office for we -lrb- 847 -rrb- i now find that dr johnson 's desire to get on the main land arise from he anxiety to have a opportunity of convey letter to he friend after dinner we proceed to dr m ` lean 's which be about a mile from we inn he be not at home but we be receive by he lady and daughter who entertain we so well that dr johnson seem quite happy when we have sup he ask I to give he some paper to write letter i begged he would write short one and not _ expatiate _ as we ought to set off early he be irritated by this and say ` what must be do must be do : the thing be past a joke ' ` nay sir -lrb- say i -rrb- write as much as you please but do not blame I if we be keep six day before we get to the main land you be very impatient in the morning : but no sooner do you find yourself in good quarter than you forget that you be to move ' i get he paper enough and we part in good humor let I now recollect whatever particulars i have omit in the morning i say to he before we land at tobermorie ` we shall see dr m ` lean who have write _ the history of the m ` lean ' _ johnson ' i have no great patience to stay to hear the history of the m ` lean i would rather hear the history of the thrale ' when on mull i say ` well sir this be the fourth of the hebride that we have be upon ' johnson ` nay we can not boast of the number we have see we think we should see many more we think of sailing about easily from island to island and so we should have we come at a better season -lrb- 848 -rrb- but we be wise man think it would be summer all the year where _ we _ be however sir we have see enough to give we a pretty good notion of the system of insular life ' let I not forget that he sometimes amuse himself with very slight reading from which however he conversation shew that he contrived to extract some benefit at captain m ` lean 's he read a good deal in _ the charmer _ a collection of song -lrb- 849 -rrb- we this morning find that we could not proceed there be a violent storm of wind and rain and the river be impassable when i express my discontent at we confinement dr johnson say ` now that i have have a opportunity of write to the main land i be in no such haste ' i be amuse with he be so easily satisfied for the truth be that the gentleman who be to convey we letter as i be now inform be not to set out for inverary for some time so that it be probable we should be there as soon as he : however i do not undeceive my friend but suffer he to enjoy he fancy dr johnson ask in the evening to see dr m ` lean 's book he take down willi _ de anima brutorum _ -lrb- 850 -rrb- and pore over it a good deal miss m ` lean produce some erse poem by john m ` lean who be a famous bard in mull and have die only a few year ago he could neither read nor write she read and translate two of they one a kind of elegy on sir john m ` lean 's be oblige to fly he country in 1715 another a dialogue between two roman catholick young lady sister whether it be better to be a nun or to marry i could not perceive much poetical imagery in the translation yet all of we company who understand erse seem charm with the original there may perhaps be some choice of expression and some excellence of arrangement that can not be shewn in translation after we have exhaust the erse poem of which dr johnson say nothing miss m ` lean give we several tune on a spinnet which though make so long ago as in 1667 be still very well tone she sing along with it dr johnson seem pleased with the musick though he own he neither like it nor have hardly any perception of it at mr m ` pherson be in slate he tell we that ` he know a drum from a trumpet and a bagpipe from a guittar which be about the extent of he knowledge of musick ' to-night he say that ` if he have learn musick he should have be afraid he would have do nothing else but play it be a method of employ the mind without the labor of think at all and with some applause from a man 's self -lrb- 851 -rrb- ' we have the musick of the bagpipe every day at armidale dunvegan and col dr johnson appear fond of it and use often to stand for some time with he ear close to the great drone the penurious gentleman of we acquaintance formerly allude to -lrb- 852 -rrb- afford we a topick of conversation to-night dr johnson say i ought to write down a collection of the instance of he narrowness as they almost exceed belief col tell we that o'kane the famous irish harper be once at that gentleman 's house he could not find in he heart to give he any money but give he a key for a harp which be finely ornament with gold and silver and with a precious stone and be worth eighty or a hundred guinea he do not know the value of it and when he come to know it he would fain have have it back but o'kane take care that he should not johnson ` they exaggerate the value every body be so desirous that he should be fleece i be very willing it should be worth eighty or a hundred guinea but i do not believe it ' boswell ' i do not think o'kane be oblige to give it back ' johnson ` no sir if a man with he eye open and without any means use to deceive he give I a thing i be not to let he have it again when he grow wiser i like to see how avarice defeat itself : how when avoid to part with money the miser give something more valuable ' col say the gentleman 's relation be angry at he give away the harp-key for it have be long in the family johnson ` sir he value a new guinea more than a old friend ' col also tell we that the same person have come up with a serjeant and twenty man work on the high road he enter into discourse with the serjeant and then give he sixpence for the man to drink the serjeant ask ` who be this fellow ' upon be inform he say ` if i have know who he be i should have throw it in he face ' johnson ` there be much want of sense in all this he have no business to speak with the serjeant he might have be in haste and trot on he have not learn to be a miser : i believe we must take he apprentice ' boswell ` he would grudge give half a guinea to be teach ' johnson ` nay sir you must teach he _ grati _ you must give he a opportunity to practice you precept ' let I now go back and glean _ johnsoniana _ the Saturday before we sail from slate i sit awhile in the afternoon with dr johnson in he room in a quiet serious frame i observe that hardly any man be accurately prepare for die but almost every one leave something undo something in confusion that my father indeed tell I he know one man -lrb- carlisle of limekiln -rrb- after whose death all he papers be find in exact order and nothing be omit in he will johnson ` sir i have a uncle who die so but such attention require great leisure and great firmness of mind if one be to think constantly of death the business of life would stand still i be no friend to make religion appear too hard many good people have do harm by give severe notion of it in the same way as to learning : i never frighten young people with difficulty on the contrary i tell they that they may very easily get as much as will do very well i do not indeed tell they that they will be _ bentley _ the night we ride to col 's house i say ` lord elibank be probably wonder what be become of we ' johnson ` no no he be not think of we ' boswell ` but recollect the warmth with which he write -lrb- 853 -rrb- be we not to believe a man when he say he have a great desire to see another do not you believe that i be very impatient for you come to scotland ' johnson ` yes sir i believe you be and i be impatient to come to you a young man feel so but seldom a old man ' i however convinced he that lord elibank who have much of the spirit of a young man might feel so he ask I if we jaunt have answer expectation i say it have much exceed it i expect much difficulty with he and have not find it ` and -lrb- he add -rrb- wherever we have come we have be receive like prince in they progress ' he say he would not wish not to be disgust in the highland for that would be to lose the power of distinguish and a man might then lie down in the middle of they he wish only to conceal he disgust at captain m ` lean 's i mention pope 's friend spence johnson ` he be a weak conceited man -lrb- 854 -rrb- ' boswell ' a good scholar sir ' johnson ` why no sir ' boswell ` he be a pretty scholar ' johnson ` you have about reach he ' last night at the inn when the factor in tyr-yi speak of he have hear that a roof be put on some part of the building at icolmkill i unluckily say ` it will be fortunate if we find a cathedral with a roof on it ' i say this from a foolish anxiety to engage dr johnson 's curiosity more he take I short at once ` what sir how can you talk so if we shall _ find _ a cathedral roof as if we be go to a _ terra incognita _ when every thing that be at icolmkill be so well know you be like some new-england-man who come to the mouth of the thame come -lrb- say they -rrb- let we go up and see what sort of inhabitant there be here they talk sir as if they have be to go up the susquehannah or any other american river ' Saturday October 16 this day there be a new moon and the weather change for the better dr johnson say of miss m ` lean ` she be the most accomplished lady that i have find in the highland she know french musick and draw sew neatly make shellwork and can milk cow in short she can do every thing she talk sensibly and be the first person whom i have find that can translate erse poetry literally -lrb- 855 -rrb- ' we set out mount on little mull horse mull correspond exactly with the idea which i have always have of it a hilly country diversify with heath and grass and many rivulet dr johnson be not in very good humor he say it be a dreary country much worse than sky i differ from he ' o sir -lrb- say he -rrb- a most dolorous country -lrb- 856 -rrb- ' we have a very hard journey to-day i have no bridle for my sheltie but only a halter and joseph ride without a saddle at one place a loch have swell over the road we be oblige to plunge through pretty deep water dr johnson observe how helpless a man would be be he travel here alone and should meet with any accident and say ` he long to get to _ a country of saddle and bridle _ ' he be more out of humor to-day than he have be in the course of we tour be fret to find that he little horse could scarcely support he weight and have suffer a loss which though small in itself be of some consequence to he while travel the rugged steep of mull where he be at time oblige to walk the loss that i allude to be that of the large oak-stick which as i formerly mention he have bring with he from london -lrb- 857 -rrb- it be of great use to he in we wild peregrination for ever since he last illness in 1766 -lrb- 858 -rrb- he have have a weakness in he knee and have not be able to walk easily it have too the property of a measure for one nail be drive into it at the length of a foot another at that of a yard in return for the service it have do he he say this morning he would make a present of it to some museum but he little think he be so soon to lose it as he prefer ride with a switch it be entrust to a fellow to be deliver to we baggage-man who follow we at some distance but we never see it more i could not persuade he out of a suspicion that it have be steal ` no no my friend -lrb- say he -rrb- it be not to be expect that any man in mull who have get it will part with it consider sir the value of such a _ piece of timber _ here ' as we travel this forenoon we meet dr mclean who express much regret at he have be so unfortunate as to be absent while we be at he house we be in hope to get to sir allan maclean 's at inchkenneth to-night but the eight mile of which we road be say to consist be so very long that we do not reach the opposite coast of mull till seven at night though we have set out about eleven in the forenoon and when we do arrive there we find the wind strong against we col determine that we should pass the night at m ` quarrie be in the island of ulva which lie between mull and inchkenneth and a servant be send forward to the ferry to secure the boat for we but the boat be go to the ulva side and the wind be so high that the people could not hear he call and the night so dark that they could not see a signal we should have be in a very bad situation have there not

ferry we over m ` quarrie 's house be mean but we be agreeably surprize with the appearance of the master whom we find to be intelligent polite and much a man of the world though he clan be not numerous he be a very ancient chief and have a burial place at icolmkill he tell we he family have possess ulva for nine hundred year but i be distressed to hear that it be soon to be sell for payment of he debt captain m ` lure whom we find here be of scotch extraction and properly a mcleod be descend of some of the m ` leod who go with sir normand of bernera to the battle of worcester and after

we he have name he ship the bonnetta out of gratitude to providence for once when he be sail to america with a good number of passenger the ship in which he then sail be becalm for five week and during all that time number of the fish bonnetta swam close to she and be catch for food he resolve therefore that the ship he should next get should be call the bonnetta m ` quarrie tell we a strong instance of the second sight he have go to edinburgh and take a man-servant along with he a old woman who be in the house say one day be ` quarrie will be at home to-morrow and will bring two gentleman with he ' and she say she see he servant return in red and green he do come home next day he have two gentleman with he and he servant have a new red and green livery which m ` quarrie have buy for he at edinburgh upon a sudden thought not have the least intention when he leave home to put he servant in livery so that the old woman could not have hear any previous mention of it this he assure we be a true story m ` quarrie insist that the _ mercheta mulierum _ mention in we old charter do really mean the privilege which a lord of the manor or a baron have to have the first night of all he vassal ' wife dr johnson say the belief of such a custom have exist be also hold in england where there be a tenure call _ borough english _ by which the eldest child do not inherit from a doubt of he be the son of the tenant -lrb- 860 -rrb- m ` quarrie tell we that still on the marriage of each of he tenant a sheep be due to he for which the composition be fix at five shilling -lrb- 861 -rrb- i suppose ulva be the only place where this custom remain talk of the sale of a estate of a ancient family which be say to have be purchase much under its value by the confidential lawyer of that family and it be mention that the sale would probably be set aside by a suit in equity dr johnson say ' i be very willing that this sale should be set aside but i doubt much whether the suit will be successful for the argument for avoid the sale be found on vague and indeterminate principle as that the price be too low and that there be a great degree of confidence place by the seller in the person who become the purchaser now how low should a price be or what degree of confidence should there be to make a bargain be set aside a bargain which be a wager of skill between man and man if indeed any fraud can be prove that will do ' when dr johnson and i be by ourselves at night i observe of we host ' _ aspectum generosum habet ' -- ` et generosum animum _ ' he add for fear of be overhear in the small highland house i often talk to he in such latin as i could speak and with as much of the english accent as i could assume so as not to be understand in case we conversation should be too loud for the space we have each a elegant bed in the same room and here it be that a circumstance occur as to which he have be strangely misunderstand from he description of he chamber it have erroneously be suppose that he bed be too short for he he foot during the night be in the mire whereas he have only say that when he undress he feel he foot in the mire : that be the clay-floor of the room on which he stand upon before he go into bed be wet in consequence of the window be break which let in the rain -lrb- 862 -rrb- Sunday October 17 be inform that there be nothing worthy of observation in ulva we take boat and proceed to inchkenneth where we be introduce by we friend col to sir allan m ` lean the chief of he clan and to two young lady he daughter inchkenneth be a pretty little island a mile long and about half a mile broad all good land -lrb- 863 -rrb- as we walk up from the shore dr johnson 's heart be cheer by the sight of a road mark with cart-wheel as on the main land a thing which we have not see for a long time it give we a pleasure similar to that which a traveller feel when whilst wander on what he fear be a desert island he perceive the print of human foot military man acquire excellent habit of have all convenience about they sir allan m ` lean who have be long in the army and have now a lease of the island have form a commodious habitation though it consist but of a few small building only one story high -lrb- 864 -rrb- he have in he little apartment more thing than i could enumerate in a page or two among other agreeable circumstance it be not the least to find here a parcel of the _ caledonian mercury _ publish since we leave edinburgh which i read with that pleasure which every man feel who have be for some time seclude from the animated scene of the busy world dr johnson find book here he bid I buy bishop gastrell 's _ christian institute _ -lrb- 865 -rrb- which be lie in the room he say ' i do not like to read any thing on a Sunday but what be theological not that i would scrupulously refuse to look at any thing which a friend should shew I in a newspaper but in general i would read only what be theological i read just now some of drummond 's _ travel _ -lrb- 866 -rrb- before i perceive what book be here i then take up derham 's _ physico-theology _ -lrb- 867 -rrb- ' every particular concern this island have be so well describe by dr johnson it would be superfluous in I to present the publick with the observation that i make upon it in my _ journal _ i be quite easy with sir allan almost instantaneously he know the great intimacy that have be between my father and he predecessor sir hector and be himself of a very frank disposition after dinner sir allan say he have get dr campbell about a hundred subscriber to he _ britannium elucida _ -lrb- a work since publish under the title of _ a political survey of great britain _ -lrb- 868 -rrb- -rrb- of whom he believe twenty be dead the publication have be so long delay johnson ` sir i imagine the delay of publication be owe to this -- that after publication there will be no more subscriber and few will send the additional guinea to get they book : in which they will be wrong for there will be a great deal of instruction in the work i think highly of campbell -lrb- 869 -rrb- in the first place he have very good part in the second place he have very extensive reading not perhaps what be properly call learning but history politick and in short that popular knowledge which make a man very useful in the third place he have learn much by what be call the _ vox viva _ he talk with a great many people ' speaking of this gentleman at rasay he tell we that he one day call on he and they talk of tull 's _ husbandry _ -lrb- 870 -rrb- dr campbell say something dr johnson begin to dispute it ` come -lrb- say dr campbell -rrb- we do not want to get the better of one another : we want to encrease each other 's idea ' dr johnson take it in good part and the conversation then go on coolly and instructively he candor in relate this anecdote do he much credit and he conduct on that occasion prove how easily he could be persuade to talk from a better motive than ` for victory -lrb- 871 -rrb- ' dr johnson here shew so much of the spirit of a highlander that he win sir allan 's heart : indeed he have shew it during the whole of we tour one night in col he strut about the room with a broad sword and target and make a formidable appearance and another night i take the liberty to put a large blue bonnet on he head he age he size and he bushy gray wig with this cover on it present the image of a venerable _ senachus _ -lrb- 872 -rrb- : and however unfavourable to the lowland scot he seem much pleased to assume the appearance of a ancient caledonian we only regret that he could not be prevail with to partake of the social glass one of he argument against drinking appear to I not convince he urge that ` in proportion as drinking make a man different from what he be before he have drunk it be bad because it have so far affect he reason ' but may it not be answer that a man may be alter by it _ for the better _ that he spirit may be exhilarate without he reason be affect -lrb- 873 -rrb- on the general subject of drinking however i do not mean positively to take the other side i be _ dubius non improbus _ in the evening sir allan inform we that it be the custom of he house to have prayer every Sunday and miss m ` lean read the evening service in which we all join i then read ogden 's second and ninth _ sermon on prayer _ which with they other distinguished excellence have the merit of be short dr johnson say that it be the most agreeable Sunday he have ever pass -lrb- 874 -rrb- and it make such a impression on he mind that he afterwards write the follow latin verse upon inchkenneth -lrb- 875 -rrb- : -- insulum sanctus kennethus parva quidem regio sed relligione priorum nota caledonias panditur inter aqua voce ubus cennethus populo domuisse feroce dicitur et vanos dedocuisse deo hue ego delatus placido per coerulum cursu scire locum voluus quid daret ille novi illic leniade humili regnabat in aula leniades magnis nobilitatus avis : una duas habuit casa cum genitore puellas quas amor undarum fingeret esse dea : non tamen incultus gelidi latuere sub antri accolum danubii qualium saevus habet mollium non

hic et honestus amor -lrb- 877 -rrb- Monday October 18 we agree to pass this day with sir allan and he engage to have every thing in order for we voyage to-morrow be now soon to be separate from we amiable friend young col he merit be all remember at ulva he have appear in a new character have give we a good prescription for a cold on my mention he with warmth dr johnson say ` col do every thing for we : we will erect a statue to col ' ` yes say i and we will have he with he various attribute and character like mercury or any other of the heathen god we will have he as a pilot we will have he as a fisherman as a hunter as a husbandman as a physician ' i this morning take a spade and dig a little grave in the floor of a ruin chapel -lrb- 878 -rrb- near sir allan m ` lean 's house in which i bury some human bone i find there dr johnson praise I for what i have do though he own he could not have do it he shew in the chapel at rasay -lrb- 879 -rrb- he horror at dead man 's bone he shew it again at col 's house in the charter-room there be a remarkable large shin-bone which be say to have be a bone of _ john garve _ -lrb- 880 -rrb- one of the laird dr johnson would not look at it but start away at breakfast i ask ` what be the reason that we be angry at a trader 's have opulence -lrb- 881 -rrb- ' johnson ` why sir the reason be -lrb- though i do not undertake to prove that there be a reason -rrb- we see no quality in trade that should entitle a man to superiority we be not angry at a soldier 's get riches because we see that he possess quality which we have not if a man return from a battle have lose one hand and with the other full of gold we feel that he deserve the gold but we can not think that a fellow by sit all day at a desk be entitle to get above we ' boswell ` but sir may we not suppose a merchant to be a man of a enlarged mind such as addison in the _ spectator _ describe sir andrew freeport to have be ' johnson ` why sir we may suppose any fictitious character we may suppose a philosophical day-labourer who be happy in reflect that by he labor he contribute to the fertility of the earth and to the support of he fellow-creature but we find no such philosophical day-labourer a merchant may perhaps be a man of a enlarged mind but there be nothing in trade connect with a enlarged mind -lrb- 882 -rrb- ' i mention that i have hear dr solander say he be a swedish laplander -lrb- 883 -rrb- johnson ` sir i do not believe he be a laplander the laplander be not much above four foot high he be as tall as you and he have not the copper color of a laplander ' boswell ` but what motive could he have to make himself a laplander ' johnson ` why sir he must either mean the word laplander in a very extensive sense or may mean a voluntary degradation of himself for all my be the great man that you see I now i be originally a barbarian as if burke should say i come over a wild irishman which he might say in he present state of exaltation ' have express a desire to have a island like inchkenneth dr johnson set himself to think what would be necessary for a man in such a situation ` sir i should build I a fortification if i come to live here for if you have it not what should hinder a parcel of ruffian to land in the night and carry off every thing you have in the house which in a remote country would be more valuable than cow and sheep add to all this the danger of have you throat cut ' boswell ' i would have a large dog ' johnson ` so you may sir but a large dog be of no use but to alarm ' he however i apprehend think too lightly of the power of that animal i have hear he say that he be afraid of no dog ` he would take he up by the hinder leg which would render he quite helpless -- and then knock he head against a stone and beat out he brain ' topham beauclerk tell I that at he house in the country two large ferocious dog be fight dr johnson look steadily at they for a little while and then as one would separate two little boy who be foolishly hurt each other he run up to they and cuff they head till he drive they asunder -lrb- 884 -rrb- but few man have he intrepidity herculean strength or presence of mind most thief or robber would be afraid to encounter a mastiff i observe that when young col talk of the land belong to he family he always say ' _ my _ land -lrb- 885 -rrb- ' for this he have a plausible pretence for he tell I there have be a custom in this family that the laird resign the estate to the eldest son when he come of age reserve to himself only a certain life-rent he say it be a voluntary custom but i think i find a instance in the charter-room that there be such a obligation in a contract of marriage if the custom be voluntary it be only curious but if found on obligation it might be dangerous for i have be tell that in otaheité whenever a child be bear -lrb- a son i think -rrb- the father lose he right to the estate and honor and that this unnatural or rather absurd custom occasion the murder of many child young col tell we he could run down a greyhound ` for -lrb- say he -rrb- the dog run himself out of breath by go too quick and then i get up with he -lrb- 886 -rrb- ' i account for he advantage over the dog by remark that col have the faculty of reason and know how to moderate he pace which the dog have not sense enough to do dr johnson say ` he be a noble animal he be as complete a islander as the mind can figure he be a farmer a sailor a hunter a fisher : he will run you down a dog : if any man have a _ tail _ -lrb- 887 -rrb- it be col he be hospitable and he have a intrepidity of talk whether he understand the subject or not i regret that he be not more intellectual ' dr johnson observe that there be nothing of which he would not undertake to persuade a frenchman in a foreign country ` i 'll carry a frenchman to st paul 's church-yard and i 'll tell he by we law you may walk half round the church but if you walk round the whole you will be punish capitally and he will believe I at once now no englishman would readily swallow such a thing : he would go and inquire of somebody else -lrb- 888 -rrb- ' the frenchman 's credulity i observe must be owe to he be accustom to implicit submission whereas every englishman reason upon the law of he country and instruct he representative who compose the legislature this day be pass in look at a small island adjoining inchkenneth which afford nothing worthy of observation and in such social and gay entertainment as we little society could furnish Tuesday October 19 after breakfast we take leave of the young lady and of we excellent companion col to whom we have be so much oblige he have now put we under the care of he chief and be to hasten back to sky we part from he with very strong feeling of kindness and gratitude and we hope to have have some future opportunity of prove to he the sincerity of what we feel but in the following year he be unfortunately lose in the sound between ulva and mull -lrb- 889 -rrb- and this imperfect memorial join to the high honor of be tenderly and respectfully mention by dr johnson be the only return which the uncertainty of human event have permit we to make to this deserving young man sir allan who obligingly undertake to accompany we to icolmkill -lrb- 890 -rrb- have a strong good boat with four stout rower we coast along mull till we reach _ gribon _ where be what be call mackinnon 's cave compare with which that at ulinish -lrb- 891 -rrb- be inconsiderable it be in a rock of a great height close to the sea upon the left of its entrance there be a cascade almost perpendicular from the top to the bottom of the rock there be a tradition that it be conduct thither artificially to supply the inhabitant of the cave with water dr johnson give no credit to this tradition as on the one hand he faith in the christian religion be firmly found upon good grounds so on the other he be incredulous when there be no sufficient reason for belief -lrb- 892 -rrb- be in this respect just the reverse of modern infidel who however nice and scrupulous in weigh the evidence of religion be yet often so ready to believe the most absurd and improbable tale of another nature that lord haile well observe a good essay might be write _ sur la crédulité des incrédules _ the height of this cave i can not tell with any tolerable exactness but it seem to be very lofty and to be a pretty regular arch we penetrate by candlelight a great way by we measurement no less than four hundred and eighty-five foot tradition say that a piper and twelve man once advance into this cave nobody can tell how far and never return at the distance to which we proceed the air be quite pure for the candle burn freely without the least appearance of the flame grow globular but as we have only one we think it dangerous to venture farther lest should it have be extinguish we should have have no means of ascertain whether we could remain without danger dr johnson say this be the greatest natural curiosity he have ever see we see the island of staffa at no very great distance but could not land upon it the surge be so high on its rocky coast -lrb- 893 -rrb- sir allan anxious for the honor of mull be still talk of its _ wood _ and point they out to dr johnson as appear at a distance on the skirt of that island as we sail along johnson ` sir i saw at tobermorie what they call a wood which i unluckily take for _ heath _ if you shew I what i shall take for _ furze _ it will be something ' in the afternoon we go ashore on the coast of mull and partake of a cold repast which we carry with we we hope to have procure some rum or brandy for we boatman and servant from a publick-house near where we land but unfortunately a funeral a few day before have exhaust all they store -lrb- 894 -rrb- mr campbell however one of the duke of argyle 's tacksman who live in the neighborhood on receive a message from sir allan send we a liberal supply we continue to coast along mull and pass by nun ' island which it be say belong to the nun of icolmkill and from which we be tell the stone for the building there be take as we sail along by moon-light in a sea somewhat rough and often between black and gloomy rock dr johnson say ` if this be not _ roving among the hebride _ nothing be -lrb- 895 -rrb- the repetition of word which he have so often previously use make a strong impression on my imagination and by a natural course of think lead I to consider how we present adventure would appear to I at a future period i have often experienced that scene through which a man have pass improve by lie in the memory : they grow mellow _ actus labore sunt jucundus _ -lrb- 896 -rrb- this may be owe to compare they with present listless ease even harsh scene acquire a softness by length of time -lrb- 897 -rrb- and some be like very loud sound which do not please or at least do not please so much till you be remove to a certain distance they may be compare to strong coarse picture which will not bear to be view near even please scene improve by time and seem more exquisite in recollection than when they be present if they have not fade to dimness in the memory perhaps there be so much evil in every human enjoyment when present -- so much dross mix with it that it require to be refine by time and yet i do not see why time should not melt away the good and the evil in equal proportion -- why the shade should decay and the light remain in preservation after a tedious sail which by we follow various turning of the coast of mull be extend to about forty mile it give we no small pleasure to perceive a light in the village at icolmkill in which almost all the inhabitant of the island live close to where the ancient building stand as we approach the shore the tower of the cathedral just discernible in the air be a picturesque object when we have land upon the sacred place which as long as i can remember i have think on with veneration dr johnson and i cordially embrace we have long talk of visit icolmkill and from the lateness of the season be at time very doubtful whether we should be able to effect we purpose to have see it even alone would have give I great satisfaction but the venerable scene be render much more please by the company of my great and pious friend who be no less affect by it than i be and who have describe the impression it should make on the mind with such strength of thought and energy of language that i shall quote he word as convey my own sensation much more forcibly than i be capable of do : -- ` we be now tread that illustrious island which be once the luminary of the caledonian region whence savage clan and rove barbarian derive the benefit of knowledge and the blessing of religion to abstract the mind from all local emotion would be impossible if it be endeavor and would be foolish if it be possible whatever withdraw we from the power of we sens whatever make the past the distant or the future predominate over the present advance we in the dignity of think being far from I and from my friend be such frigid philosophy as may conduct we indifferent and unmoved over any ground which have be dignified by wisdom bravery or virtue that man be little to be envy whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of _ marathon _ or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruin of _ iona _ -lrb- 898 -rrb- ' upon hear that sir allan m ` lean be arrive the inhabitant who still consider themselves as the people of m ` lean to whom the island formerly belong though the duke of argyle have at present possession of it run eagerly to he we be accommodate this night in a large barn the island afford no lodging that we should have like so well some good hay be strew at one end of it to form a bed for we upon which we lay with we clothes on and we be furnish with blanket from the village -lrb- 899 -rrb- each of we have a portmanteau for a pillow when i awaked in the morning and look round I i could not help smile at the idea of the chief of the m ` lean the great english moralist and myself lie thus extend in such a situation Wednesday October 20 early in the morning we survey the remains of antiquity at this place accompany by a illiterate fellow as _ cicerone _ who call himself a descendant of a cousin of saint columba the founder of the religious establishment here as i know that many person have already examine they and as i see dr johnson inspect and measure several of the ruin of which he have since give so full a account my mind be quiescent and i resolve to stroll among they at my ease to take no trouble to investigate minutely and only receive the general impression of solemn antiquity and the particular idea of such object as should of themselves strike my attention we walk from the monastery of nun to the great church or cathedral as they call it along a old broken causeway they tell we that this have be a street and that there be good house build on each side dr johnson doubt if it be any thing more than a paved road for the nun the convent of monk the great church oran 's chapel and four other chapel be still to be discern but i must own that icolmkill do not answer my expectation for they be high from what i have read of it and still more from what i have hear and think of it from my earliest year dr johnson say it come up to he expectation because he have take he impression from a account of it subjoin to sacheverel 's _ history of the isle of man _ -lrb- 900 -rrb- where it be say there be not much to be see here we be both disappoint when we be shewn what be call the monument of the king of scotland ireland and denmark and of a king of france there be only some grave-stone flat on the earth and we could see no inscription how far short be this of marble monument like those in westminster abbey which i have imagine here the grave-stone of sir allan m ` lean 's family and of that of m ` quarrie have as good a appearance as the royal grave-stone if they be royal we doubt my easiness to give credit to what i hear in the course of we tour be too great dr johnson 's peculiar accuracy of investigation detect much traditional fiction and many gross mistake it be not to be wonder at that he be provoke by people carelessly tell he with the utmost readiness and confidence what he find on question they a little more be erroneous -lrb- 901 -rrb- of this there be innumerable instance i leave he and sir allan at breakfast in we barn and steal back again to the cathedral to indulge in solitude and devout meditation -lrb- 902 -rrb- while contemplate the venerable ruin i refleet with much satisfaction that the solemn scene of piety never lose they sanctity and influence though the care and folly of life may prevent we from visit they or may even make we fancy that they effect be only ` as yesterday when it be past -lrb- 903 -rrb- ' and never again to be perceive i hope that ever after have be in this holy place i should maintain a exemplary conduct one have a strange propensity to fix upon some point of time from whence a better course of life may begin -lrb- 904 -rrb- be desirous to visit the opposite shore of the island where saint columba be say to have land i procure a horse from one m ` ginnis -lrb- 905 -rrb- who run along as my guide the m ` ginnise be say to be a branch of the clan of m ` lean sir allan have be tell that this man have refuse to send he some rum at which the knight be in great indignation ` you rascal -lrb- say he -rrb- do not you know that i can hang you if i please ' not advert to the chieftain 's power over he clan i imagine that sir allan have know of some capital crime that the fellow have commit which he could discover and so get he condemn and say ` how so ' ` why -lrb- say sir allan -rrb- be they not all my people ' sensible of my inadvertency and most willing to contribute what i could towards the continuation of feudal authority ` very true ' say i sir allan go on : ` refuse to send rum to I you rascal do not you know that if i order you to go and cut a man 's throat you be to do it ' ` yes a not please you honor and my own too and hang myself too ' the poor fellow deny that he have refuse to send the rum he make these profession be not merely a pretence in presence of he chief for after he and i be out of sir allan 's hearing he tell I ` have he send he dog for the rum i would have give it : i would cut my bone for he ' it be very remarkable to find such a attachment to a chief though he have then no connection with the island and have not be there for fourteen year sir allan by way of upbraid the fellow say ' i believe you be a _ campbell _ ' the place which i go to see be about two mile from the village they call it _ portawherry _ from the wherry in which columba come though when they shew the length of he vessel as mark on the beach by two heap of stone they say ` here be the length of the _ currach _ ' use the erse word icolmkill be a fertile island the inhabitant export some cattle and grain and i be tell they import nothing but iron and salt they be industrious and make they own woollen and linen cloth and they brew a good deal of beer which we do not find in any of the other island -lrb- 906 -rrb- we set sail again about mid-day and in the evening land on mull near the house of the reverend mr neal m ` leod who have be inform of we come by a message from sir allan come out to meet we we be this night very agreeably entertain at he house dr johnson observe to I that he be the cleanest-headed man that he have meet with in the western island he seem to be well acquaint with dr johnson 's writings and courteously say ' i have be often oblige to you though i never have the pleasure of see you before ' he tell we he have live for some time in st kilda under the tuition of the minister or catechist there and have there first read horace and virgil the scene which they describe must have be a strong contrast to the dreary waste around he Thursday October 21 this morning the subject of politick be introduce johnson ` pulteney be as paltry a fellow as could be -lrb- 907 -rrb- he be a whig who pretend to be honest and you know it be ridiculous for a whig to pretend to be honest he can not hold it out -lrb- 908 -rrb- ' he call mr pitt a meteor sir robert walpole a fix star -lrb- 909 -rrb- he say ` it be wonderful to think that all the force of government be require to prevent wilke from be choose the chief magistrate of london -lrb- 910 -rrb- though the liveryman know he would rob they shop -- know he would debauch they daughter -lrb- 911 -rrb- ' boswell ` the history of england be so strange that if it be not so well vouch as it be it would hardly be credible ' johnson ` sir if it be tell as shortly and with as little preparation for introduce the different event as the history of the jewish king it would be equally liable to objection of improbability ' mr m ` leod be much pleased with the justice and novelty of the thought dr johnson illustrate what he have say as follow : ` take as a instance charle the first 's concession to he parliament which be greater and greater in proportion as the parliament grow more insolent and less deserving of trust have these concession be related nakedly without any detail of the circumstance which generally lead to they they would not have be believe ' sir allan m ` lean brag that scotland have the advantage of england by its have more water johnson ` sir we would not have you water to take the vile bog which produce it you have too much a man who be drown have more water than either of we ' -- and then he laugh -lrb- but this be surely robust sophistry : for the people of taste in england who have see scotland own that its variety of river and lake make it naturally more beautiful than england in that respect -rrb- pursue he victory over sir allan he proceed : ` you country consist of two thing stone and water there be indeed a little earth above the stone in some place but a very little and the stone be always appear it be like a man in rag the naked skin be still peep out ' he take leave of mr m ` leod say ` sir i thank you for you entertainment and you conversation ' mr campbell who have be so polite yesterday come this morning on purpose to breakfast with we and very obligingly furnish we with horse to proceed on we journey to mr m ` lean 's of _ lochbuy _ where we be to pass the night we dine at the house of dr alexander m ` lean another physician in mull who be so much strike with the uncommon conversation of dr johnson that he observe to I ` this man be just a _ hogshead _ of sense ' dr johnson say of the _ turkish spy _ -lrb- 912 -rrb- which lay in the room that it tell nothing but what every body might have know at that time and that what be good in it do not pay you for the trouble of read to find it after a very tedious ride through what appear to I the most gloomy and desolate country i have ever behold -lrb- 913 -rrb- we arrive between seven and eight o'clock at may the seat of the laird of _ lochbuy _ _ buy _ in erse signify yellow and i at first imagine that the loch or branch of the sea here be thus denominate in the same manner as the _ red sea _ but i afterwards learn that it derive its name from a hill above it which be of a yellowish hue have the epithet of _ buy _ we have hear much of lochbuy 's be a great roaring braggadocio a kind of sir john falstaff both in size and manners but we find that they have swell he up to a fictitious size and clothe he with imaginary quality col 's idea of he be equally extravagant though very different : he tell we he be quite a don quixote and say he would give a great deal to sec he and dr johnson together the truth be that lochbuy prove to be only a bluff comely noisy old gentleman proud of he hereditary consequence and a very hearty and hospitable landlord lady lochbuy be sister to sir allan m ` lean but much older he say to I ` they be quite _ antediluvian _ ' be tell that dr johnson do not hear well lochbuy bawl out to he ` be you of the johnston of glencro or of ardnamurchan -lrb- 914 -rrb- ' dr johnson give he a significant look but make no answer and i tell lochbuy that he be not johns_ton _ but john_son _ and that he be a englishman -lrb- 915 -rrb- lochbuy some year ago try to prove himself a weak man liable to imposition or as we term it in scotland a _ facile _ man in order to set aside a lease which he have grant but fail in the attempt on my mention this circumstance to dr johnson he seem much surprize that such a suit be admit by the scottish law and observe that ` in england no man be allow to _ stultify _ himself -lrb- 916 -rrb- ' sir allan lochbuy and i have the conversation chiefly to ourselves to-night : dr johnson be extremely weary go to bed soon after supper Friday October 22 before dr johnson come to breakfast lady lochbuy say `

sheep 's - head for breakfast sir allan seem displeased at he sister 's vulgarity and wonder how such a thought should come into she head from a mischievous love of sport i take the lady 's part and

i sit quietly by and enjoy my success after breakfast we survey the old castle in the pit or dungeon of which lochbuy have some year before take upon he to imprison several person -lrb- 918 -rrb- and though he have be fine in a considerable sum by the court of justiciary he be so little affect by it that while we be examine the dungeon he say to I with a smile ` you father know something of this '

-rrb- sir allan m ` lean on the shore of mull and then get into the ferry-boat the bottom of which be strew with branch of tree or bush upon which we sit we have a good day and a fine passage and in the evening land at oban where we find a tolerable inn after have be so long confine at different time in island from which it be always uncertain when we could get away it be comfortable to be now on the mainland and to know that if in health we might get to any place in scotland or england in a certain number of day here we discover from the conjecture which be form that the people on the main land be entirely ignorant of we motion for in a glasgow newspaper we find a paragraph which as it contain a just and well-turned compliment to my illustrious friend i shall here insert : -- ` we be well assure that dr johnson be confine by tempestuous weather to the isle of sky it be unsafe to venture in a small boat upon such a stormy surge as be very common there at this time of the year such a philosopher detain on a almost barren island resemble a whale leave upon the strand the latter will be welcome to every body on account of he oil he bone & c and the other will charm he companion and the rude inhabitant with he superior knowledge and wisdom calm resignation and unbounded benevolence ' Saturday October 23 after a good night 's rest we breakfast at we leisure we talk of goldsmith 's _ traveller _ of which dr johnson speak highly and while i be help he on with he great coat he repeat from it the character of the british nation which he do with such energy that the tear start into he eye : -- ` stern o'er each bosom reason hold she state with daring aim irregularly great pride in they port defiance in they eye i see the lord of human kind pass by intent on high design a thoughtful band by form unfashion would fresh from nature 's hand fierce in they native hardiness of soul true to imagin would right above control while ev 'n the peasant boast these rights to scan and learn to venerate himself as man ' we could get but one bridle here which accord to the maxim _ detur digniorus _ be appropriate to dr johnson 's sheltie i and joseph ride with halter we cross in a ferry-boat a pretty wide lake -lrb- 921 -rrb- and on the farther side of it close by the shore find a hut for we inn we be much wet i change my clothes in part and be at pain to get myself well dry dr johnson resolutely keep on all he clothes wet as they be let they steam before the smoky turf fire i think he in the wrong but he firmness be perhaps a species of heroism i remember but little of we conversation i mention shenstone 's say of pope that he have the art of condense sense more than any body -lrb- 922 -rrb- dr johnson say ` it be not true sir there be more sense in a line of cowley than in a page -lrb- or a sentence or ten line -- i be not quite certain of the very phrase -rrb- of pope ' he maintain that archibald duke of argyle -lrb- 923 -rrb- be a narrow man i wonder at this and observe that he building so great a house at inverary be not like a narrow man ` sir -lrb- say he -rrb- when a narrow man have resolve to build a house he build it like another man but archibald duke of argyle be narrow in he ordinary expence in he quotidian expence ' the distinction be very just it be in the ordinary expence of life that a man 's liberality or narrowness be to be discover i never hear the word _ quotidian _ in this sense and i imagine it to be a word of dr johnson 's own fabrication but i have since find it in _ young 's night thought _ -lrb- night fifth -rrb- ` death be a destroyer of quotidian prey ' and in my friend 's _ dictionary _ support by the authority of charle i and dr donne it rain very hard as we journy on after dinner the roar of torrent from the mountain as we pass along in the dusk and the other circumstance attend we ride in the evening have be mention with so much animation by dr johnson that i shall not attempt to say any thing on the subject -lrb- 924 -rrb- we get at night to inverary where we find a excellent inn even here dr johnson would not change he wet clothes the prospect of good accommodation cheer we much we sup well and after supper dr johnson whom i have not see taste any fermented liquor during all we travels call for a gill of whiskey ` come -lrb- say he -rrb- let I know what it be that make a scotchman happy -lrb- 925 -rrb- ' he drink it all but a drop which i begged leave to pour into my glass that i might say we have drunk whisky together i propose mr thrale should be we toast he would not have _ she _ drunk in whisky but rather ` some insular lady ' so we drink one of the lady whom we have lately leave he own to-night that he get as good a room and bed as at a english inn i have here the pleasure of find a letter from home which relieve I from the anxiety i have suffer in consequence of not have receive any account of my family for many week i also find a letter from mr garrick which be a regale -lrb- 926 -rrb- as agreeable as a pine-apple would be in a desert -lrb- 927 -rrb- he have favor I with he correspondence for many year and when dr johnson and i be at inverness i have write to he as follow : -- inverness Sunday 29 August 1773 my dear sir ` here i be and mr samuel johnson actually with I we be a night at fore in come to which in the dusk of the evening we pass over the bleak

wild in they attire & c this day we visit the ruin of macbeth 's castle at inverness i have have great romantick satisfaction in see johnson upon the classical scene of shakspeare in scotland which i really look upon as almost as improbable as that birnam wood should come to dunsinane -lrb- 930 -rrb- indeed as i have always be accustom to view he as a permanent london object it would not be much more wonderful to I to see st paul 's church move along where we now be as yet we have travel in post-chaise but to-morrow we be to mount on horseback and ascend into the mountain by fort augustus and so on to the ferry where we be to cross to sky we shall see that island fully and then visit some more of the hebride after which we be to land in argyleshire proceed by glasgow to auchinleck repose

gout in my hand ' ' _ to jame boswell esq edinburgh _ ' Sunday October 24 we pass the forenoon calmly and placidly i prevail on dr johnson to read aloud ogden 's sixth sermon on prayer which he do with a distinct expression and pleasing solemnity he praise my favorite preacher he elegant language and remarkable acuteness and say he fight infidel with they own weapon as a specimen of ogden 's manner i insert the following passage from the sermon which dr johnson now read the preacher after argue against that vain philosophy which maintain in conformity with the hard principle of eternal necessity or unchangeable predetermination that the only effect of prayer for other although we be exhort to pray for they be to produce good disposition in ourselves towards they thus express himself : -- ' a plain man may be apt to ask but if this then though enjoin in the holy scripture be to be my real aim and intention when i be teach to pray for other person why be it that i do not plainly so express it why be not the form of the petition bring nearer to the meaning give they say i to we heavenly father what be good but this i be to understand will be as it will be and be not for I to alter what be it then that i be do i be desire to become charitable myself and why may i not plainly say so be there shame in it or impiety the wish be laudable : why should i form design to hide it ` or be it perhaps better to be bring about by indirect means and in this artful manner alas who be it that i would impose on from whom can it be in this commerce that i desire to hide any thing when as my savior command I i have _ enter into my closet and shut my door _ there be but two party privy to my devotions god and my own heart which of the two be i deceive ' he wish to have more book and upon inquire if there be any in the house be tell that a waiter have some which be bring to he but i recollect none of they except hervey 's _ meditation _ he think slightingly of this admire book he treat it with ridicule and would not allow even the scene of the die husband and father to be pathetick -lrb- 941 -rrb- i be not a impartial judge for hervey 's _ meditation _ engage my affection in my early year he read a passage concern the moon ludicrously and shew how easily he could in the same style make reflection on that planet the very reverse of hervey 's -lrb- 942 -rrb- represent she as treacherous to mankind he do this with much humor but i have not preserve the particulars he then indulge a playful fancy in make a _ meditation on a pudding _ -lrb- 943 -rrb- of which i hastily write down in he presence the follow note which though imperfect may serve to give my reader some idea of it meditation on a pudding ` let we seriously reflect of what a pudding be compose it be compose of flour that once wave in the golden grain and drink the dew of the morning of milk press from the swell udder by the gentle hand of the beauteous milk-maid whose beauty and innocence might have recommend a worse draught who while she stroke the udder indulge no ambitious thought of wander in palace form no plan for the destruction of she fellow-creature : milk which be draw from the cow that useful animal that eat the grass of the field and supply we with that which make the greatest part of the food of mankind in the age which the poet have agree to call golden it be make with a egg that miracle of nature which the theoretical burnet -lrb- 944 -rrb- have compare to creation a egg contain water within its beautiful smooth surface and a unformed mass by the incubation of the parent become a regular animal furnish with bone and sinew and cover with feather let we consider can there be more want to complete the meditation on a pudding if more be want more may be find it contain salt which keep the sea from putrefaction : salt which be make the image of intellectual excellence contribute to the formation of a pudding ' in a magazine i find a say of dr johnson 's something to this purpose that the happiest part of a man 's life be what he pass lie awake in bed in the morning i read it to he he say ' i may perhaps have say this for nobody at time talk more laxly than i do -lrb- 945 -rrb- ' i venture to suggest to he that this be dangerous from one of he authority i speak of living in the country and upon what foot one should be with neighbor i observe that some people be afraid of be on too easy a footing with they from a apprehension that they time would not be they own he make the obvious remark that it depend much on what kind of neighbor one have whether it be desirable to be on a easy footing with they or not i mention a certain baronet who tell I he never be happy in the country till he be not on speak term with he neighbor which he contrived in different way to bring about ` lord ---------- -lrb- say he -rrb- stick long but at last the fellow pound my pig and then i get rid of he ' johnson ` nay sir my lord get rid of sir john and shew how little he value he by put he pig in the pound ' i tell dr johnson i be in some difficulty how to act at inverary i have reason to think that the duchess of argyle dislike I on account of my zeal in the dougla cause -lrb- 946 -rrb- but the duke of argyle have always be please to treat I with great civility they be now at the castle which be a very short walk from we inn and the question be whether i should go and pay my respects there dr johnson to whom i have state the case be clear that i ought but in he usual way he be very shy of discover a desire to be invite there himself though from a conviction of the benefit of subordination -lrb- 947 -rrb- to society he have always shewn great respect to person of high rank when he happen to be in they company yet he pride of character have ever make he guard against any appearance of court the great besides he be impatient to go to glasgow where he expect letter at the same time he be i believe secretly not unwilling to have attention pay he by so great a chieftain and so exalt a nobleman he insist that i should not go to the castle this day before dinner as it would look like seek a invitation ` but -lrb- say i -rrb- if the duke invite we to dine with he to-morrow shall we accept ' ` yes sir ' i think he say ` to be sure ' but he add ` he will not ask we ' i mention that i be afraid my company might be disagreeable to the duchess he treat this objection with a manly disdain : ' _ that _ sir he must settle with he wife ' we dine well i go to the castle just about the time when i suppose the lady would be retire from dinner i send in my name and be shewn in find the amiable duke sit at the head of he table with several gentleman i be most politely receive and give he grace some particulars of the curious journey which i have be make with dr johnson when we rise from table the duke say to I ' i hope you and dr johnson will dine with we to-morrow ' i thank he grace but tell he my friend be in a great hurry to get back to london the duke with a kind complacency say ` he will stay one day and i will take care he shall see this place to advantage ' i say i should be sure to let he know he grace 's invitation as i be go away the duke say ` mr boswell will not you have some tea ' i think it best to get over the meeting with the duchess this night so respectfully agree i be conduct to the drawing room by the duke who announce my name but the duchess who be sit with she daughter lady betty hamilton -lrb- 948 -rrb- and some other lady take not the least notice of I i should have be mortify at be thus coldly receive by a lady of whom i with the rest of the world have always entertain a very high admiration have i not be console by the oblige attention of the duke when i return to the inn i inform dr johnson of the duke of argyle 's invitation with which he be much pleased and readily accept of it we talk of a violent contest which be then carry on with a view to the next general election for ayrshire where one of the candidate in order to undermine the old and established interest have artfully hold himself out as a champion for the independency of the county against aristocratick influence and have persuade several gentleman into a resolution to oppose every candidate who be support by peer -lrb- 949 -rrb- ` foolish fellow -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- do not they see that they be as much dependent upon the peer one way as the other the peer have but to _ oppose _ a candidate to ensure he success it be say the only way to make a pig go forward be to pull he back by the tail these people must be treat like pig ' Monday October 25 my acquaintance the reverend mr john m ` aulay -lrb- 950 -rrb- one of the minister of inverary and brother to we good friend at calder -lrb- 951 -rrb- come to we this morning and accompany we to the castle where i present dr johnson to the duke of argyle we be shew through the house and i never shall forget the impression make upon my fancy by some of the lady ' maid trip about in neat morning dress after see for a long time little but rusticity they lively manner and gay invite appearance pleased I so much that i think for the moment i could have be a knight-errant for they -lrb- 952 -rrb- we then get into a low one-horse chair order for we by the duke in which we drive about the place dr johnson be much strike by the grandeur and elegance of this princely seat he think however the castle too low and wish it have be a story higher he say ` what i admire here be the total defiance of expence ' i have a particular pride in shew he a great number of fine old tree to compensate for the nakedness which have make such a impression on he on the eastern coast of scotland when we come in before dinner we find the duke and some gentleman in the hall dr johnson take much notice of the large collection of arm which be excellently dispose there i tell what he have say to sir alexander m ` donald of he ancestor not suffer they arm to rust -lrb- 953 -rrb- ` well -lrb- say the doctor -rrb- but let we be glad we live in time when arm _ may _ rust we can sit to-day at he grace 's table without any risk of be attack and perhaps sit down again wound or maim ' the duke place dr johnson next himself at table i be in fine spirit and though sensible that i have the misfortune of not be in favor with the duchess i be not in the least disconcerted and offer she grace some of the dish that be before I it must be own that i be in the right to be quite unconcerned if i could i be the duke of argyle 's guest and i have no reason to suppose that he adopt the prejudice and resentment of the duchess of hamilton i know it be the rule of modern high life not to drink to any body but that i might have the satisfaction for once to look the duchess in the face with a glass in my hand i with a respectful air address she -- ` my lady duchess i have the honor to drink you grace 's good health ' i repeat the word audibly and with a steady countenance this be perhaps rather too much but some allowance must be make for human feeling the duchess be very attentive to dr johnson i know not how a _ middle state -lrb- 954 -rrb- _ come to be mention she grace wish to hear he on that point ` madam -lrb- say he -rrb- you own relation mr archibald campbell can tell you better about it than i can he be a bishop of the nonjuring communion and write a book upon the subject -lrb- 955 -rrb- ' he engage to get it for she grace he afterwards give a full history of mr archibald campbell which i be sorry i do not recollect particularly he say mr campbell have be breed a violent whig but afterwards ` keep better company and become a tory ' he say this with a smile in pleasant allusion as i think to the opposition between he own political principle and those of the duke 's clan he add that mr campbell after the revolution be throw into gaol on account of he tenet but on application by letter to the old lord townshend -lrb- 956 -rrb- be release that he always speak of he lordship with great gratitude say ` though a _ whig _ he have humanity ' dr johnson and i pass some time together in June 1784 -lrb- 957 -rrb- at pembroke college oxford with the reverend dr adam the master and i have express a regret that my note relative to mr archibald campbell be imperfect he be then so good as to write with he own hand on the blank page of my _ journal _ opposite to that which contain what i have now mention the follow paragraph which however be not quite so full as the narrative he give at inverary : -- ' _ the honorable _ archibald campbell _ be i believe the nephew -lrb- 958 -rrb- of the marquis of argyle he begin life by engage in monmouth 's rebellion and to escape the law live some time in surinam when he return he become zealous for episcopacy and monarchy and at the revolution adhere not only to the nonjuror but to those who refuse to communicate with the church of england or to be present at any worship where the usurper be mention as king he be i believe more than once apprehend in the reign of king william and once at the accession of george he be the familiar friend of hick -lrb- 959 -rrb- and nelson -lrb- 960 -rrb- a man of letter but injudicious and very curious and inquisitive but credulous he live -lrb- 961 -rrb- in 1743 or 44 about 75 year old ' _ the subject of luxury have be introduce dr johnson defend it ` we have now -lrb- say he -rrb- a splendid dinner before we which of all these dish be unwholesome ' the duke assert that he have observe the grandee of spain diminish in they size by luxury dr johnson politely refrain from oppose directly a observation which the duke himself have make but say ` man must be very different from other animal if he be diminish by good living for the size of all other animal be increase by it -lrb- 962 -rrb- ' i make some remark that seem to imply a belief in _ second sight _ the duchess say ' i fancy you will be a _ methodist _ ' this be the only sentence she grace deign to utter to I and i take it for grant she think it a good hit on my _ credulity _ in the dougla cause a gentleman in company after dinner be desire by the duke to go to another room for a specimen of curious marble which he grace wish to shew we he bring a wrong piece upon which the duke send he back again he could not refuse but to avoid any appearance of servility he whistle as he walk out of the room to shew he independency on my mention this afterwards to dr johnson he say it be a nice trait of character dr johnson talk a great deal and be so entertaining that lady betty hamilton after dinner go and place she chair close to he lean upon the back of it and listen eagerly it would have make a fine picture to have draw the sage and she at this time in they several attitude he do not know all the while how much he be honor i tell he afterwards i never see he so gentle and complaisant as this day we go to tea the duke and i walk up and down the drawing-room converse the duchess still continue to shew the same marked coldness for I for which though i suffer from it i make every allowance consider the very warm part that i have take for dougla in the cause in which she think she son deeply interested have not she grace discover some displeasure towards I i should have suspect she of insensibility or dissimulation she grace make dr johnson come and sit by she and ask he why he make he journey so late in the year ` why madam -lrb- say he -rrb- you know mr boswell must attend the court of session and it do not rise till the twelfth of August ' she say with some sharpness ' i _ know nothing _ of mr boswell ' poor lady lucy dougla -lrb- 963 -rrb- to whom i mention this observe ` she know _ too much _ of mr boswell ' i shall make no remark on she grace 's speech i indeed feel it as rather too severe but when i recollect that my punishment be inflict by so dignified a beauty i have that kind of consolation which a man would feel who be strangle by a _ silken cord _ dr johnson be all attention to she grace he use afterwards a droll expression upon she enjoy the three title of hamilton brandon and argyle -lrb- 964 -rrb- borrow a image from the turkish empire he call she a _ duchess _ with _ three tail _ he be much pleased with we visit at the castle of inverary the duke of argyle be exceedingly polite to he and upon he complain of the shelty which he have hitherto ridden be too small for he he grace tell he he should be provide with a good horse to carry he next day mr john m ` aulay pass the evening with we at we inn when dr johnson speak of people whose principle be good but whose practice be faulty mr m ` aulay say he have no notion of people be in earnest in they good profession whose practice be not suitable to they the doctor grow warm and say ` sir you be so grossly ignorant of human nature as not to know that a man may be very sincere in good principle without have good practice -lrb- 965 -rrb- ' dr johnson be unquestionably in the right and whoever examine himself candidly will be satisfy of it though the inconsistency between principle and practice be greater in some man than in other i recollect very little of this night 's conversation i be sorry that indolence come upon I towards the conclusion of we journey so that i do not write down what pass with the same assiduity as during the greatest part of it Tuesday October 26 mr m ` aulay breakfast with we nothing hurt or dismayed by he last night 's correction be a man of good sense he have a just admiration of dr johnson either yesterday morning or this i communicate to dr johnson from mr m ` aulay 's information the news that dr beattie have get a pension of two hundred pound a year -lrb- 966 -rrb- he sit up in he bed clap he hand and cry ' o brave we -lrb- 967 -rrb- ' -- a peculiar exclamation of he when he rejoice -lrb- 968 -rrb- as we sit over we tea mr home 's tragedy of _ dougla _ be mention i put dr johnson in mind that once in a coffee house at oxford he call to old mr sheridan ` how come you sir to give home a gold medal for write that foolish play ' and defy mr sheridan to shew ten good line in it he do not insist they should be together but that there be not ten good line in the whole play -lrb- 969 -rrb- he now persist in this i endeavor to defend that pathetick and beautiful tragedy and repeat the following passage : -- -- ` sincerity thou first of virtue let no mortal leave thy onward path although the earth should gape and from the gulph of hell destruction cry to take dissimulation 's wind way -lrb- 970 -rrb- ' johnson ` that will not do sir nothing be good but what be consistent with truth or probability which this be not juvenal indeed give we a noble picture of inflexible virtue : -- esto bonus mile tutor bonus arbiter idem integer : ambiguae si quando citabere testis incertaeque reus phalari licet imperet ut si falsus et admoto dictet perjurium tauro summum crede nefa animam praeferre pudorus et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas -lrb- 2 -rrb- ' he repeat the line with great force and dignity then add ` and after this come johnny home with he _ earth gaping _ and he _ destruction cry _ : -- pooh -lrb- 971 -rrb- ' while we be lament the number of ruin religious building which we have lately see i speak with peculiar feeling of the miserable neglect of the chapel belong to the palace of holyrood-house in which be deposit the remains of many of the king of scotland and many of we nobility i say it be a disgrace to the country that it be not repair : and particularly complain that my friend dougla the representative of a great house and proprietor of a vast estate should suffer the sacred spot where he mother lie inter to be unroofed and expose to all the inclemency of the weather dr johnson who i know not how have form a opinion on the hamilton side in the dougla cause slily answer ` sir sir do not be too severe upon the gentleman do not accuse he of want of filial piety lady jane dougla be not _ he _ mother ' he rouse my zeal so much that i take the liberty to tell he he know nothing of the cause : which i do most seriously believe be the case -lrb- 972 -rrb-

highly pleased and joseph say ` he now look like a bishop ' we dine at the inn at tarbat and at night come to rosedow the beautiful seat of sir jame colquhoun on the bank of lochlomond where i and any friend whom i have introduce have ever be receive with kind and elegant hospitality Wednesday October 27 when i go into dr johnson 's room this morning i observe to he how wonderfully courteous he have be at inveraray and say ` you be quite a fine gentleman when with the duchess ' he answer in good humor ` sir i look upon myself as a very polite man : ' and he be right in a proper manly sense of the word -lrb- 974 -rrb- as a immediate proof of it let I observe that he would not send back the duke of argyle 's horse without a letter of thanks which i copy ` to he grace the duke of argyle `

writings might have be preserve that be now lose -lrb- 977 -rrb- after breakfast dr johnson and i be furnish with a boat and sail about upon lochlomond and land on some of the island which be intersperse -lrb- 978 -rrb- he be much pleased with the scene which be so well know by the account of various traveller that it be unnecessary for I to attempt any description of it i recollect none of he conversation except that when talk of dress he say ` sir be i to have any thing fine it should be very fine be i to wear a ring it should not be a bauble but a stone of great value be i to wear a lace or embroidered waistcoat it should be very rich i have once a very rich lace waistcoat which i wear the first night of my tragedy -lrb- 979 -rrb- ' lady helen colquhoun be a very pious woman the conversation after dinner take a religious turn she ladyship defend the presbyterian mode of publick worship upon which dr johnson deliver those excellent argument for a form of prayer which he have introduce into he _ journey _ -lrb- 980 -rrb- i be myself fully convince that a form of prayer for publick worship be in general most decent and edifying _ solennium verba _ have a kind of prescriptive sanctity and make a deeper impression on the mind than extemporaneous effusion in which as we know not what they be to be we can not readily acquiesce yet i would allow also of a certain portion of extempore address as occasion may require this be the practice of the french protestant church and although the office of form supplication to the throne of heaven be in my mind too great a trust to be indiscriminately commit to the discretion of every minister i do not mean to deny that sincere devotion may be experience when join in prayer with those who use no liturgy we be favor with sir jame colquhoun 's coach to convey we in the evening to cameron the seat of commissary smollet -lrb- 981 -rrb- we satisfaction of find ourselves again in a comfortable carriage be very great we have a please conviction of the commodiousness of civilization and heartily laugh at the ravings of those absurd visionary who have attempt to persuade we of the superior advantage of a _ state of nature _ -lrb- 982 -rrb- mr smollet be a man of considerable learning with abundance of animal spirit so that he be a very good companion for dr johnson who say to I ` we have have more solid talk here than at any place where we have be ' i remember dr johnson give we this evening a able and eloquent discourse on the _ origin of evil _ -lrb- 983 -rrb- and on the consistency of moral evil with the power and goodness of god he shew we how it arise from we free agency a extinction of which would be a still greater evil than any we experience i know not that he say any thing absolutely new but he say a great deal wonderfully well and perceive we to be delighted and satisfied he conclude he harangue with a air of benevolent triumph over a objection which have distressed many worthy mind : ` this then be the answer to the question _ pothen to kakon _ ' mr smollet whisper I that it be the best sermon she have ever hear much do i upbraid myself for have neglect to preserve it Thursday October 28 mr smollet pleased dr johnson by produce a collection of newspaper in the time of the usurpation from which it appear that all sort of crime be very frequent during that horrible anarchy by the side of the high road to glasgow at some distance from he house he have erect a pillar to the memory of he ingenious kinsman dr smollet and he consult dr johnson as to a inscription for it lord kame who though he have a great store of knowledge with much ingenuity and uncommon activity of mind be no profound scholar have it seem recommend a english inscription -lrb- 984 -rrb- dr johnson treat this with great contempt say ` a english inscription would be a disgrace to dr smollet -lrb- 985 -rrb- ' and in answer to what lord kame have urge as to the advantage of its be in english because it would be generally understand i observe that all to whom dr smollet 's merit could be a object of respect and imitation would understand it as well in latin and that surely it be not mean for the highland drover or other such people who pass and repass that way we be then shew a latin inscription propose for this monument dr johnson sit down with a ardent and liberal earnestness to revise it and greatly improve it by several addition and variation i unfortunately do not take a copy of it as it originally stand but i have happily preserved every fragment of what dr johnson write : -- quisquis ades viator -lrb- 986 -rrb- vel mente felix vel studiis cultus immorare paululum memoria tobiae smollet md virus ii virtutibus qua in homine et cive et laudes et imiteris postquam mira -- se -- tali tantoque viro suo patruelus hanc columnam amori eheu inane monumentum in ipsis leviniae ripis quas primis infans vagitibus personuit versiculisque jam fere moriturus illustravit -lrb- 987 -rrb- ponendam curavit -lrb- 988 -rrb- we have this morning a singular proof of dr johnson 's quick and retentive memory hay 's translation of _ martial _ be lie in a window i say i think it be pretty well do and shew he a particular epigram i think of ten but be certain of eight line he read it and toss away the book say -- ` no it be not pretty well ' as i persist in my opinion he say ` why sir the original be thus ' -- -lrb- and he repeat it -rrb- ` and this man 's translation be thus ' -- and then he repeat that also exactly though he have never see it before and read it over only once and that too without any intention of get it by heart -lrb- 989 -rrb- here a post-chaise which i have order from glasgow come for we and we drive on in high spirit we stop at dunbarton and though the approach to the castle there be very steep dr johnson ascend it with alacrity and survey all that be to be see during the whole of we tour he shew uncommon spirit could not bear to be treat like a old or infirm man and be very unwilling to accept of any assistance insomuch that at we landing at icolmkill when sir allan m ` lean and i submit to be carry on man 's shoulder from the boat to the shore as it could not be bring quite close to land he spring into the sea and wade vigorously out on we arrival at the saracen 's head inn at glasgow i be make happy by good account from home and dr johnson who have not receive a single letter since we leave aberdeen -lrb- 990 -rrb- find here a great many the perusal of which entertain he much he enjoy in imagination the comfort which we could now command and seem to be in high glee i remember he put a leg up on each side of the grate and say with a mock solemnity by way of soliloquy but loud enough for I to hear it ` here be i a english man sit by a _ coal _ fire ' Friday October 29 the professor -lrb- 991 -rrb- of the university be inform of we arrival dr stevenson dr reid -lrb- 992 -rrb- and mr anderson breakfast with we mr anderson accompany we while dr johnson view this beautiful city he have tell I that one day in london when dr adam smith be boast of it he turn to he and say ` pray sir have you ever see brentford -lrb- 993 -rrb- ' this be surely a strong instance of he impatience and spirit of contradiction i put he in mind of it to-day while he express he admiration of the elegant building and whisper he ` do not you feel some remorse -lrb- 994 -rrb- ' we be receive in the college by a number of the professor who shew all due respect to dr johnson and then we pay a visit to the principal dr leechman -lrb- 995 -rrb- at he own house where dr johnson have the satisfaction of be tell that he name have be gratefully celebrate in one of the parochial congregation in the highland as the person to whose influence it be chiefly owe that the new testament be allow to be translate into the erse language it seem some political member of the society in scotland for propagate christian knowledge have oppose this pious undertaking as tend to preserve the distinction between the highlander and lowlander dr johnson write a long letter upon the subject to a friend which be shewn to they make they ashamed and afraid of be publickly expose so they be force to a compliance it be now in my possession and be perhaps one of the best production of he masterly pen -lrb- 996 -rrb- professor reid and anderson and the two monsieur fouli the elzevir of glasgow dine and drink tea with we at we inn after which the professor go away and i have a letter to write left my fellow-traveller with monsieur fouli though good and ingenious man they have that unsettled speculative mode of conversation which be offensive to a man regularly teach at a english school and university i find that instead of listen to the dictate of the sage they have teaze he with question and doubtful disputation he come in a flutter to I and desire i might come back again for he could not bear these man ' o ho sir -lrb- say i -rrb- you be fly to I for refuge ' he never in any situation be at a loss for a ready repartee he answer with a quick vivacity ` it be of two evil choose the least ' i be delighted with this flash burst from the cloud which hang upon he mind close my letter directly and join the company we sup at professor anderson 's the general impression upon my memory be that we have not much conversation at glasgow where the professor like they brethren at aberdeen -lrb- 997 -rrb- do not venture to expose themselves much to the battery of cannon which they know might play upon they -lrb- 998 -rrb- dr johnson who be fully conscious of he own superior power afterwards praise principal robertson for he caution in this respect -lrb- 999 -rrb- he say to I ` robertson sir be in the right robertson be a man of eminence and the head of a college at edinburgh he have a character to maintain and do well not to risk its be lessen ' Saturday October 30 we set out towards ayrshire i send joseph on to loudoun with a message that if the earl be at home dr johnson and i would have the honor to dine with he joseph meet we on the road and report that the earl ' _ jump for joy _ ' and say ' i shall be very happy to see they ' we be receive with a most please courtesy by he lordship and by the countess he mother who in she ninety-fifth year have all she faculty quite unimpaired -lrb- 1000 -rrb- this be a very cheer sight to dr johnson who have a extraordinary desire for long life she ladyship be sensible and well-informed and have see a great deal of the world she lord have hold several high office and she be sister to the great earl of stair -lrb- 1001 -rrb- i can not here refrain from pay a just tribute to the character of john earl of loudoun who do more service to the county of ayr in general as well as to the individual in it than any man we have ever have it be painful to think that he meet with much ingratitude from person both in high and low rank : but such be he temper such he knowledge of ` base mankind -lrb- 1002 -rrb- ' that as if he have expect no other return he mind be never sour and he retain he good-humour and benevolence to the last the tenderness of he heart be prove in 1745-6 when he have a important command in the highland and behave with a generous humanity to the unfortunate i can not figure a more honest politician for though he interest in we county be great and generally successful he not only do not deceive by fallacious promise but be anxious that people should not deceive themselves by too sanguine expectation he kind and dutiful attention to he mother be unremitted at he house be true hospitality a plain but a plentiful table and every guest be leave at perfect freedom feel himself quite easy and happy while i live i shall honor the memory of this amiable man -lrb- 1003 -rrb- at night we advance a few mile farther to the house of mr campbell of treesbank who be marry to one of my wife 's sister and be entertain very agreeably by a worthy couple Sunday October 31 we repose here in tranquillity dr johnson be please to find a numerous and excellent collection of book which have mostly belong to the reverend mr john campbell brother of we host i be desirous to have procure for my fellow-traveller to-day the company of sir john cuninghame of caprington whose castle be but two mile from we he be a very distinguished scholar be long abroad and during part of the time live much with the learn cuninghame -lrb- 1004 -rrb- the opponent of bentley as a critick upon horace he write latin with great elegance and what be very remarkable read homer and ariosto through every year i write to he to request he would come to we but unfortunately he be prevent by indisposition Monday November 1 though dr johnson be lazy and averse to move i insist that he should go with I and pay a visit to the countess of eglintoune mother of the late and present earl i assure he he would find himself amply recompense for the trouble and he yield to my solicitation though with some unwillingness we be well mount and have not many mile to ride he talk of the attention that be necessary in order to distribute we charity judiciously ` if thoughtlessly do we may neglect the most deserving object and as every man have but a certain proportion to give if it be lavish upon those who first present themselves there may be nothing leave for such as have a better claim a man should first relieve those who be nearly connect with he by whatever tie and then if he have any thing to spare may extend he bounty to a wider circle -lrb- 1005 -rrb- ' as we pass very near the castle of dundonald which be one of the many residence of the king of scotland and in which robert the second live and die dr johnson wish to survey it particularly it stand on a beautiful rise ground which be see at a great distance on several quarter and from whence there be a extensive prospect of the rich district of cuninghame the western sea the isle of arran and a part of the northern coast of ireland it have long be unroofed and though of considerable size we could not by any power of imagination figure it as have be a suitable habitation for majesty -lrb- 1006 -rrb- dr johnson to irritate my _ old scottish _ -lrb- 1007 -rrb- enthusiasm be very jocular on the homely accommodation of ` king _ bob _ ' and roar and laugh till the ruin echo lady eglintoune though she be now in she eighty-fifth year and have live in the retirement of the country for almost half a century be still a very agreeable woman she be of the noble house of kennedy and have all the elevation which the consciousness of such birth inspire she figure be majestick she manners high-breed she reading extensive and she conversation elegant she have be the admiration of the gay circle of life and the patroness of poet -lrb- 1008 -rrb- dr johnson be delighted with he reception here she principle in church and state be congenial with he she know all he merit and have hear much of he from she son earl alexander -lrb- 1009 -rrb- who love to cultivate the acquaintance of man of talent in every department all who know he lordship will allow that he understanding and accomplishment be of no ordinary rate from the gay habit which he have early acquire he spend too much of he time with man and in pursuit far beneath such a mind as he he afterwards become sensible of it and turn he thought to object of importance but be cut off in the prime of he life i can not speak but with emotion of the most affectionate regret of one in whose company many of my early day be pass and to whose kindness i be much indebted often must i have occasion to upbraid myself that soon after we return to the main land i allow indolence to prevail over I so much as to shrink from the labor of continue my journal with the same minuteness as before shelter myself in the thought that we have do with the hebride and not consider that dr johnson 's memorabilia be likely to be more valuable when we be restore to a more polished society much have thus be irrecoverably lose in the course of we conversation this day it come out that lady eglintoune be marry the year before dr johnson be bear upon which she graciously say to he that she might have be he mother and that she now adopt he and when we be go away she embrace he say ` my dear son farewell -lrb- 1010 -rrb- ' my friend be much pleased with this day 's entertainment and own that i have do well to force he out Tuesday November 2 we be now in a country not only ' _ of saddle and bridle _ -lrb- 1011 -rrb- ' but of post-chaise and have order one from kilmarnock we get to auchinleck -lrb- 1012 -rrb- before dinner my father be not quite a year and a half older than dr johnson but he conscientious discharge of he laborious duty as a judge in scotland where the law proceedings be almost all in write -- a severe complaint which end in he death -- and the loss of my mother a woman of almost unexampled piety and goodness -- have before this time in some degree affect he spirit -lrb- 1013 -rrb- and render he less disposed to exert he faculty : for he have originally a very strong mind and cheerful temper he assure I he never have feel one moment of what be call low spirit or uneasiness without a real cause he have a great many good story which he tell uncommonly well and he be remarkable for ` humor _ incolumus gravitate _ -lrb- 1014 -rrb- ' as lord monboddo use to characterise it he age he office and he character have long give he a acknowledge claim to great attention in whatever company he be and he could ill brook any diminution of it he be as sanguine a whig and presbyterian as dr johnson be a tory and church of england man : and as he have not much leisure to be inform of dr johnson 's great merit by read he work he have a partial and unfavourable notion of he found on he suppose political tenet which be so discordant to he own that instead of speaking of he with that respect to which he be entitle he use to call he ' a _ jacobite fellow _ ' know all this i should not have venture to bring they together have not my father out of kindness to I desire I to invite dr johnson to he house i be very anxious that all should be well and beg of my friend to avoid three topick as to which they differ very widely whiggism presbyterianism and -- sir john pringle -lrb- 1015 -rrb- he say courteously ' i shall certainly not talk on subject which i be tell be disagreeable to a gentleman under whose roof i be especially i shall not do so to _ you father _ ' we first day go off very smoothly it rain and we could not get out but my father shew dr johnson he library which in curious edition of the greek and roman classick be i suppose not excel by any private collection in great britain my father have study at leyden and be very intimate with the gronovius and other learn man there he be a sound scholar and in particular have collate manuscript and different edition of _ anacreon _ and other of the greek lyrick poet with great care so that my friend and he have much matter for conversation without touch on the fatal topick of difference dr johnson find here baxter 's _ anacreon _ -lrb- 1016 -rrb- which he tell I he have long enquire for in vain and begin to suspect there be no such book baxter be the keen antagonist of barne -lrb- 1017 -rrb- he life be in the _ biographium britannica _ -lrb- 1018 -rrb- my father have write many note on this book and dr johnson and i talk of have it reprint Wednesday November 3 it rain all day and give dr johnson a impression of that incommodiousness of climate in the west of which he have take notice in he _ journey _ -lrb- 1019 -rrb- but be well accommodate and furnish with variety of book he be not dissatisfy some gentleman of the neighborhood come to visit my father but there be little conversation one of they ask dr johnson how he like the highland the question seem to irritate he for he answer ` how sir can you ask I what oblige I to speak unfavourably of a country where i have be hospitably entertain who _ can _ like the highland -lrb- 1020 -rrb- i like the inhabitant very well -lrb- 1021 -rrb- ' the gentleman ask no more question let I now make up for the present neglect by again glean from the past at lord monboddo 's after the conversation upon the decrease of learn in england he lordship mention _ herme _ by mr harri of salisbury -lrb- 1022 -rrb- as the work of a living author for whom he have a great respect dr johnson say nothing at the time but when we be in we post-chaise he tell I he think harri ' a coxcomb ' this he say of he not as a man but as a author -lrb- 1023 -rrb- and i give he opinion of man and book faithfully whether they agree with my own or not i do admit that there always appear to I something of affectation in mr harri 's manner of write something of a habit of clothing plain thought in analytick and categorical formality but all he writings be imbue with learning and all breathe that philanthropy and amiable disposition which distinguish he as a man -lrb- 1024 -rrb- at another time during we tour he draw the character of a rapacious highland chief -lrb- 1025 -rrb- with the strength of theophrastus or la bruyère conclude with these word : -- ` sir he have no more the soul of a chief than a attorney who have twenty house in a street and consider how much he can make by they ' he this day when we be by ourselves observe how common it be for people to talk from book to retail the sentiment 's of other and not they own in short to converse without any originality of think he be please to say ` you and i do not talk from book -lrb- 1026 -rrb- ' Thursday November 4 i be glad to have at length a very fine day on which i could shew dr johnson the _ place _ of my family which he have honor with so much attention in he _ journey _ he be however mistake in think that the celtick name _ auchinleck _ have no relation to the natural appearance of it i believe every celtick name of a place will be find very descriptive _ auchinleck _ do not signify a _ stony field _ as he have say but a _ field of flag stone _ and this place have a number of rock which abound in stratum of that kind the ` sullen dignity of the old castle ' as he have forcibly express it delighted he exceedingly -lrb- 1027 -rrb- on one side of the rock on which its ruin stand run the river lugar which be here of considerable breadth and be border by other high rock shaded with wood on the other side run a brook skirt in the same manner but on a smaller scale i can not figure a more romantick scene i feel myself elate here and expatiate to my illustrious mentor on the antiquity and honorable alliance of my family and on the merit of its founder thoma boswell who be highly favor by he sovereign jame iv of scotland and fall with he at the battle of flodden-field -lrb- 1028 -rrb- and in the glow of what i be sensible will in a commercial age be consider as genealogical enthusiasm do not omit to mention what i be sure my friend would not think lightly of my relation -lrb- 1029 -rrb- to the royal personage whose liberality on he accession to the throne have give he comfort and independence -lrb- 1030 -rrb- i have in a former page -lrb- 1031 -rrb- acknowledge my pride of ancient blood in which i be encourage by dr johnson : my reader therefore will not be surprise at my have indulge it on this occasion not far from the old castle be a spot of consecrated earth on which may be trace the foundation of a ancient chapel dedicate to st vincent and where in old time ` be the place of grave ' for the family it grieve I to think that the remains of sanctity here which be considerable be drag away and employ in build a part of the house of auchinleck of the middle age which be the family residence till my father erect that ` elegant modern mansion ' of which dr johnson speak so handsomely perhaps this chapel may one day be restore dr johnson be please when i shewed he some venerable old tree under the shade of which my ancestor have walk he exhort I to plant assiduously -lrb- 1032 -rrb- as my father have do to a great extent as i wandered with my reverend friend in the grove of auchinleck i tell he that if i survive he it be my intention to erect a monument to he here among scene which in my mind be all classical for in my youth i have appropriate to they many of the description of the roman poet he could not bear to have death present to he in any shape for he constitutional melancholy make the king of terror more frightful he turn off the subject say ` sir i hope to see you grand-child ' this forenoon he observe some cattle without horn of which he have take notice in he _ journey _ -lrb- 1033 -rrb- and seem undecided whether they be of a particular race he doubt appear to have have no foundation for my respectable neighbor mr fairlie who with all he attention to agriculture find time both for the classick and he friend assure I they be a distinct species and that when any of they calf have horn a mixture of breed can be trace in confirmation of he opinion he point out to I the follow passage in tacitus -- ' _ ne armenti quidem suus honor aut glorium fronti _ -lrb- 1034 -rrb- ' -lrb- _ de mor germ § 5 _ -rrb- which he wonder have escape dr johnson on the front of the house of auchinleck be this inscription : -- ` quod petis hic est est ulubris animus si te non deficit aequus -lrb- 1035 -rrb- ' it be characteristick of the founder but the _ animus aequus _ be alas not inheritable nor the subject of devise he always talk to I as if it be in a man 's own power to attain it but dr johnson tell I that he own to he when they be alone he persuasion that it be in a great measure constitutional or the effect of cause which do not depend on ourselves and that horace boast too much when he say _ aequum mi animum ipse parabo _ -lrb- 1036 -rrb- Friday November 5 the reverend mr dun we parish minister who have dine with we yesterday with some other company insist that dr johnson and i should dine with he to-day this give I a opportunity to shew my friend the road to the church make by my father at a great expence for above three mile on he own estate through a range of well enclosed farm with a row of tree on each side of it he call it the _ via sacra _ and be very fond of it -lrb- 1037 -rrb- dr johnson though he hold notion far distant from those of the presbyterian clergy yet could associate on good term with they he indeed occasionally attack they one of they discover a narrowness of information concern the dignitary of the church of england among whom may be find man of the greatest learning virtue and piety and of a truly apostolic character he talk before dr johnson of fat bishop and drowsy dean and in short seem to believe the illiberal and profane scoffing of profess satyrist or vulgar railer dr johnson be so highly offend that he say to he ` sir you know no more of we church than a hottentot -lrb- 1038 -rrb- ' i be sorry that he bring this upon himself Saturday November 6 i can not be certain whether it be on this day or a former that dr johnson and my father come in collision if i recollect right the contest begin while my father be shew he he collection of medal and oliver cromwell 's coin unfortunately introduce charle the first and toryism they become exceedingly warm and violent and i be very much distressed by be present at such a altercation between two man both of whom i reverenced yet i durst not interfere it would certainly be very unbecoming in I to exhibit my honor father and my respected friend as intellectual gladiator for the entertainment of the publick : and therefore i suppress what would i dare say make a interesting scene in this dramatick sketch -- this account of the transit of johnson over the caledonian hemisphere -lrb- 1039 -rrb- yet i think i may without impropriety mention one circumstance as a instance of my father 's address dr johnson challenge he as he do we all at talisker -lrb- 1040 -rrb- to point out any theological work of merit write by presbyterian minister in scotland my father whose study do not lie much in that way own to I afterwards that he be somewhat at a loss how to answer but that luckily he recollect have read in catalogue the title of _ durham on the galatian _ upon which he boldly say ` pray sir have you read mr durham 's excellent commentary on the galatian ' ` no sir ' say dr johnson by this lucky thought my father keep he at bay and for some time enjoy he triumph -lrb- 1041 -rrb- but he antagonist soon make a retort which i forbear to mention in the course of they altercation whiggism and presbyterianism toryism and episcopacy be terribly buffet my worthy hereditary friend sir john pringle never have be mention happily escape without a bruise my father 's opinion of dr johnson may be conjecture from the name he afterwards give he which be ursa major -lrb- 1042 -rrb- but it be not true as have be report that it be in consequence of my say that he be a _ constellation _ -lrb- 1043 -rrb- of genius and literature it be a sly abrupt expression to one of he brethren on the bench of the court of session in which dr johnson be then stand but it be not say in he hearing Sunday November 7 my father and i go to publick worship in we parish-church in which i regret that dr johnson would not join we for though we have there no form of prayer nor magnificent solemnity yet as god be worship in spirit and in truth and the same doctrine preach as in the church of england my friend would certainly have shew more liberality have he attend i doubt not however but he employ he time in private to very good purpose he uniform and fervent piety be manifest on many occasion during we tour which i have not mention he reason for not join in presbyterian worship have be record in a former page -lrb- 1044 -rrb- Monday November 8 notwithstanding the altercation that have pass my father who have the dignified courtesy of a old baron be very civil to dr johnson and politely attend he to the post-chaise which be to convey we to edinburgh -lrb- 1045 -rrb- thus they part they be now in another and a higher state of existence : and as they be both worthy christian man i trust they have meet in happiness but i must observe in justice to my friend 's political principle and my own that they have meet in a place where there be no room for _ whiggism _ -lrb- 1046 -rrb- we come at night to a good inn at hamilton i recollect no more Tuesday November 9 i wish to have shewn dr johnson the duke of hamilton 's house commonly call the _ palace _ of hamilton which be close by the town it be a object which have be point out to I as a splendid edifice from my earliest year in travel between auchinleck and edinburgh have still great grandeur in my imagination my friend consent to stop and view the outside of it but could not be persuade to go into it we arrive this night at edinburgh after a absence of eighty-three day for five week together of the tempestuous season there have be no account receive of we i can not express how happy i be on find myself again at home Wednesday November 10 old mr drummond the bookseller -lrb- 1047 -rrb- come to breakfast dr johnson and he have not meet for ten year there be respect on he side and kindness on dr johnson 's soon afterwards lord elibank come in and be much pleased at see dr johnson in scotland he lordship say ` hardly any thing seem to he more improbable ' dr johnson have a very high opinion of he speak of he to I he characterize he thus : ` lord elibank have read a great deal it be true i can find in book all that he have read but he have a great deal of what be in book prove by the test of real life ' indeed there have be few man whose conversation discover more knowledge enliven by fancy he publish several small piece of distinguished merit and have leave some in manuscript in particular a account of the expedition against carthagena in which he serve as a officer in the army he writings deserve to be collect he be the early patron of dr robertson the historian and mr home the tragick poet who when they be minister of country parish live near he seat he tell I ' i see these lad have talent and they be much with I ' i hope they will pay a grateful tribute to he memory -lrb- 1048 -rrb- the morning be chiefly take up by dr johnson 's give he a account of we tour the subject of difference in political principle be introduce johnson ` it be much increase by opposition there be a violent whig with whom i use to contend with great eagerness after he death i feel my toryism much abate ' i suppose he mean mr walmsley of lichfield whose character he have draw so well in he _ life of edmund smith _ -lrb- 1049 -rrb- mr nairne -lrb- 1050 -rrb- come in and he and i accompany dr johnson to edinburgh castle which he own be ' a great place ' but i must mention as a striking instance of that spirit of contradiction to which he have a strong propensity when lord elibank be some day after talk of it with the natural elation of a scotchman or of any man who be proud of a stately fortress in he own country dr johnson affect to despise it observe that ` it would make a good _ prison _ in england ' lest it should be suppose that i have suppress one of he sally against my country it may not be improper here to correct a mistaken account that have be circulate as to he conversation this day it have be say that be desire to attend to the noble prospect from the castle-hill he reply ` sir the noblest prospect that a scotchman ever see be the high road that lead he to london ' this lively sarcasm be throw out at a tavern -lrb- 1051 -rrb- in london in my presence many year before we have with we to-day at dinner at my house the lady dowager colvill and lady anne erskine sister of the earl of kelly -lrb- 1052 -rrb- the honorable archibald erskine who have now succeed to that title lord elibank the reverend dr blair mr tytler the acute vindicator of mary queen of scot -lrb- 1053 -rrb- and some other friend -lrb- 1054 -rrb- _ fingal _ be talk of dr johnson who use to boast that he have from the first resist both ossian -lrb- 1055 -rrb- and the giant of patagonium -lrb- 1056 -rrb- aver he positive disbelief of its authenticity lord elibank say ' i be sure it be not m ` pherson 's mr johnson i keep company a great deal with you it be know i do i may borrow from you better thing than i can say myself and give they as my own but if i should every body will know whose they be ' the doctor be not soften by this compliment he deny merit to _ fingal _ suppose it to be the production of a man who have have the advantage that the present age afford and say ` nothing be more easy than to write enough in that style if once you begin -lrb- 1057 -rrb- ' -lrb- 1058 -rrb- one gentleman in company -lrb- 1059 -rrb- express he opinion ` that _ fingal _ be certainly genuine for that he have hear a great part of it repeat in the original ' dr johnson indignantly ask he whether he understand the original to which a answer be give in the negative ` why then -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- we see to what _ this _ testimony come : -- thus it be ' i mention this as a remarkable proof how liable the mind of man be to credulity when not guard by such strict examination as that which dr johnson habitually practice -lrb- 1060 -rrb- the talent and integrity of the gentleman who make the remark be unquestionable yet have not dr johnson make he advert to the consideration that he who do not understand a language can not know that something which be recite to he be in that language he might have believe and report to this hour that he have ` hear a great part of _ fingal _ repeat in the original ' for the satisfaction of those on the north of the tweed who may think dr johnson 's account of caledonian credulity and inaccuracy too strong -lrb- 1061 -rrb- it be but fair to add that he admit the same kind of ready belief might be find in he own country ` he would undertake -lrb- he say -rrb- to write a epick poem on the story of _ robin hood _ -lrb- 1062 -rrb- and half england to whom the name and place he should mention in it be familiar would believe and declare they have hear it from they earliest year ' one of he objection to the authenticity of _ fingal _ during the conversation at ulinish -lrb- 1063 -rrb- be omit in my _ journal _ but i perfectly recollect it ` why be not the original deposit in some publick library instead of exhibit attestation of its existence -lrb- 1064 -rrb- suppose there be a question in a court of justice whether a man be dead or alive : you aver he be alive and you bring fifty witness to swear it : i answer why do you not produce the man ' this be a argument found upon one of the first principle of the _ law of evidence _ which _ gilbert _ -lrb- 1065 -rrb- would have hold to be irrefragable i do not think it incumbent on I to give any precise decide opinion upon this question as to which i believe more than some and less than other -lrb- 1066 -rrb- the subject appear to have now become very uninteresting to the publick that _ fingal _ be not from begin to end a translation from the gallick but that _ some _ passage have be supply by the editor to connect the whole i have hear admit by very warm advocate for its authenticity if this be the case why be not these distinctly ascertain antiquary and admirer of the work may complain that they be in a situation similar to that of the unhappy gentleman whose wife inform he on she death-bed that one of they reputed child be not he and when he eagerly beg she to declare which of they it be she answer ' _ that _ you shall never know ' and expire leave he in irremediable doubt as to they all i beg leave now to say something upon _ second sight _ of which i have relate two instance -lrb- 1067 -rrb- as they impress my mind at the time i own i return from the hebride with a considerable degree of faith in the many story of that kind which i hear with a too easy acquiescence without any close examination of the evidence : but since that time my belief in those story have be much weakened -lrb- 1068 -rrb- by reflect on the careless inaccuracy of narrative in common matter from which we may certainly conclude that there may be the same in what be more extraordinary it be but just however to add that the belief in second sight be not peculiar to the highland and isle -lrb- 1069 -rrb- some year after we tour a cause -lrb- 1070 -rrb- be try in the court of session where the principal fact to be ascertain be whether a ship-master who use to frequent the western highland and isle be drown in one particular year or in the year after a great number of witness from those part be examine on each side and swear directly contrary to each other upon this simple question one of they a very respectable chieftain who tell I a story of second sight which i have not mention but which i too implicitly believe have in this case previous to this publick examination not only say but attest under he hand that he have see the ship-master in the year subsequent to that in which the court be finally satisfied he be drown when interrogate with the strictness of judicial inquiry and under the awe of a oath he recollect himself better and retract what he have formerly assert apologise for he inaccuracy by tell the judge ' a man will _ say _ what he will not _ swear _ ' by many he be much censure and it be maintain that every gentleman would be as attentive to truth without the sanction of a oath as with it dr johnson though he himself be distinguish at all time by a scrupulous adherence to truth controvert this proposition and as a proof that this be not though it ought to be the case urge the very different decision of election under mr grenville 's act -lrb- 1071 -rrb- from those formerly make ` gentleman will not pronounce upon oath what they would have say and vote in the house without that sanction ' however difficult it may be for man who believe in preternatural communication in modern time to satisfy those who be of a different opinion they may easily refute the doctrine of they opponent who impute a belief in _ second sight _ to _ superstition _ to entertain a visionary notion that one see a distant or future event may be call _ superstition _ : but the correspondence of the fact or event with such a impression on the fancy though certainly very wonderful _ if prove _ have no more connection with superstition than magnetism or electricity after dinner various topick be discuss but i recollect only one particular dr johnson compare the different talent of garrick and foote -lrb- 1072 -rrb- as companion and give garrick greatly the preference for elegance though he allow foote extraordinary power of entertainment he say ` garrick be restrain by some principle but foote have the advantage of a unlimited range garrick have some delicacy of feel it be possible to put he out you may get the better of he but foote be the most incompressible fellow that i ever know when you have drive he into a corner and think you be sure of he he run through between you leg or jump over you head and make he escape ' dr erskine -lrb- 1073 -rrb- and mr robert walker two very respectable minister of edinburgh sup with we as do the reverend dr webster -lrb- 1074 -rrb- the conversation turn on the moravian mission and on the methodist dr johnson observe in general that missionary be too sanguine in they account of they success among savage and that much of what they tell be not to be believe he own that the methodist have do good have spread religious impression among the vulgar part of mankind : -lrb- 1075 -rrb- but he say they have great bitterness against other christian and that he never could get a methodist to explain in what he excel other that it always end in the indispensible necessity of hear one of they preacher -lrb- 1076 -rrb- Thursday November 11 principal robertson come to we as we sit at breakfast he advance to dr johnson repeat a line of virgil which i forget i suppose either post vario casus per tot discrimina rerum -lrb- 1077 -rrb- -- or -- multum ille et terris jactatus et alto -lrb- 1078 -rrb- every body have accost we with some study compliment on we return dr johnson say ' i be really ashamed of the congratulation which we receive we be address as if we have make a voyage to nova zemblum and suffer five persecution in japan -lrb- 1079 -rrb- ' and he afterwards remark that ` to see a man come up with a formal air and a latin line when we have no fatigue and no danger be provoke -lrb- 1080 -rrb- ' i tell he he be not sensible of the danger have lie under cover in the boat during the storm -lrb- 1081 -rrb- : he be like the chicken that hide its head under its wing and then think itself safe lord elibank come to we as do sir william forbe the rash attempt in 1745 be mention i observe that it would make a fine piece of history dr johnson say it would -lrb- 1082 -rrb- lord elibank doubt whether any man of this age could give it impartially johnson ' a man by talk with those of different side who be actor in it and put down all that he hear may in time collect the material of a good narrative you be to consider all history be at first oral i suppose voltaire be fifty year -lrb- 1083 -rrb- in collect he _ loui xiv _ which he do in the way that i be propose ' robertson ` he do so he live much with all the great people who be concern in that reign and hear they talk of everything : and then either take mr boswell 's way of write down what he hear or which be as good preserved it in he memory for he have a wonderful memory ' with the leave however of this elegant historian no man 's memory can preserve fact or saying with such fidelity as may be do by write they down when they be recent dr robertson say ` it be now full time to make such a collection as dr johnson suggest for many of the people who be then in arm be drop off and both whig and jacobite be now come to talk with moderation ' lord elibank say to he ` mr robertson the first thing that give I a high opinion of you be you say in the _ select society _ -lrb- 1084 -rrb- while party run high soon after the year 1745 that you do not think worse of a man 's moral character for he have be in rebellion this be venture to utter a liberal sentiment while both side have a detestation of each other ' dr johnson observe that be in rebellion from a notion of another 's right be not connect with depravity and that we have this proof of it that all mankind applaud the pardoning of rebel which they would not do in the case of robber and murderer he say with a smile that ` he wonder that the phrase of _ unnatural _ rebellion should be so much use for that all rebellion be natural to man ' \* \* \* \* \* as i keep no journal of anything that pass after this morning i shall from memory group together this and the other day till that on which dr johnson depart for london they be in all nine day on which he dine at lady colvill 's lord haile 's sir adolphus oughton 's sir alexander dick 's principal robertson 's mr m ` laurin 's -lrb- 1085 -rrb- and thrice at lord elibank 's seat in the country where we also pass two night -lrb- 1086 -rrb- he sup at the honorable alexander gordon 's -lrb- 1087 -rrb- now one of we judge by the title of lord rockville at mr nairne 's now also one of we judge by the title of lord dunsinan at dr blair 's and mr tytler 's and at my house thrice one evening with a numerous company chiefly gentleman of the law another with mr menzy of culdare and lord monboddo who disengage himself on purpose to meet he and the evening on which we return from lord elibank 's he sup with my wife and I by ourselves -lrb- 1088 -rrb- he breakfast at dr webster 's at old mr drummond 's and at dr blacklock 's and spend one forenoon at my uncle dr boswell 's -lrb- 1089 -rrb- who shew he he curious museum and as he be a elegant scholar and a physician breed in the school of boerhaave -lrb- 1090 -rrb- dr johnson be please with he company on the morning when he breakfast at my house he have from ten o'clock till one or two a constant levee of various person of very different character and description i could not attend he be oblige to be in the court of session but my wife be so good as to devote the greater part of the morning to the endless task of pour out tea for my friend and he visitor such be the disposition of he time at edinburgh he say one evening to I in a fit of languor ` sir we have be harass by invitation ' i acquiesce ` ay sir ' he reply but how much worse would it have be if we have be neglect -lrb- 1091 -rrb- ' from what have be record in this _ journal _ it may well be suppose that a variety of admirable conversation have be lose by my neglect to preserve it i shall endeavor to recollect some of it as well as i can at lady colvill 's to whom i be proud to introduce any stranger of eminence that he may see what dignity and grace be to be find in scotland a officer observe that he have hear lord mansfield be not a great english lawyer johnson ` why sir suppose lord mansfield not to have the splendid talent which he possess he must be a great english lawyer from have be so long at the bar and have pass through so many of the great office of the law sir you may as well maintain that a carrier who have drive a packhorse between edinburgh and berwick for thirty year do not know the road as that lord mansfield do not know the law of england -lrb- 1092 -rrb- ' at mr nairne 's he draw the character of richardson the author of _ clarissa _ with a strong yet delicate pencil i lament much that i have not preserve it i only remember that he express a high opinion of he talent and virtue but observe that ` he perpetual study be to ward off petty inconvenience and procure petty pleasure that he love of continual superiority be such that he take care to be always surround by woman -lrb- 1093 -rrb- who listen to he implicitly and do not venture to controvert he opinion and that he desire of distinction be so great that he use to give large vail to the speaker onslow 's servant that they might treat he with respect ' on the same evening he would not allow that the private life of a judge in england be require to be so strictly decorous as i suppose ` why then sir -lrb- say i -rrb- accord to you account a english judge may just live like a gentleman ' johnson ` yes sir -lrb- 1094 -rrb- -- if he _ can _ ' at mr tytler 's i happen to tell that one evening a great many year ago when dr hugh blair and i be sit together in the pit of drury-lane play-house in a wild freak of youthful extravagance i entertain the audience _ prodigiously _ -lrb- 1095 -rrb- by imitate the lowing of a cow a little while after i have tell this story i differ from dr johnson i suppose too confidently upon some point which i now forget he do not spare I ` nay sir -lrb- say he -rrb- if you can not talk better as a man i would have you bellow like a cow -lrb- 1096 -rrb- ' at dr webster 's he say that he believe hardly any man die without affectation this remark appear to I to be well found and will account for many of the celebrated death-bed saying which be record -lrb- 1097 -rrb- on one of the evening at my house when he tell that lord lovat boast to a english nobleman that though he have not he wealth he have two thousand man whom he could at any time call into the field the honorable alexander gordon observe that those two thousand man bring he to the block ` true sir -lrb- say dr johnson : -rrb- but you may just as well argue concern a man who have fall over a precipice to which he have walk too near -- he two leg bring he to that be he not the better for have two leg ' at dr blair 's i leave he in order to attend a consultation during which he and he amiable host be by themselves i return to supper at which be principal robertson mr nairne and some other gentleman dr robertson and dr blair i remember talk well upon subordination -lrb- 1098 -rrb- and government and as my friend and i be walk home he say to I ` sir these two doctor be good man and wise man -lrb- 1099 -rrb- ' i begged of dr blair to recollect what he could of the long conversation that pass between dr johnson and he alone this evening and he obligingly write to I as follow : -- ' _ march _ 3 1785 ` dear sir ' -- as so many year have intervene since i chance to have that conversation with dr johnson in my house to which you refer i have forget most of what then pass but remember that i be both instruct and entertain by it among other subject the discourse happen to turn on modern latin poet the dr express a very favourable opinion of buchanan and instantly repeat from begin to end a ode of he intituled _ calendae maiae _ -lrb- the eleventh in he _ miscellaneorum liber _ -rrb- beginning with these word ' _ salvete sacris deliciis sacrae _ ' with which i have formerly be unacquainted but upon peruse it the praise which he bestow upon it as one of the happiest of buchanan 's poetical composition appear to I very just he also repeat to I a latin ode he have compose in one of the western island from which he have lately return we have much discourse concern he excursion to those island with which he express himself as have be highly pleased talk in a favourable manner of the hospitality of the inhabitant and particularly speak much of he happiness in have you for he companion and say that the longer he know you he love and esteem you the more this conversation pass in the interval between tea and supper when we be by ourselves you and the rest of the company who be with we at supper have often take notice that he be uncommonly bland and gay that evening and give much pleasure to all who be present this be all that i can recollect distinctly of that long conversation ` you 's sincerely ` hugh blair ' at lord haile 's we spend a most agreeable day but again i must lament that i be so indolent as to let almost all that pass evaporate into oblivion dr johnson observe there that ` it be wonderful how ignorant many officer of the army be consider how much leisure they have for study and the acquisition of knowledge -lrb- 1100 -rrb- ' i hope he be mistake for he maintain that many of they be ignorant of thing belong immediately to they own profession ` for instance many can not tell how far a musket will carry a bullet ' in proof of which i suppose he mention some particular person for lord haile from whom i solicit what he could recollect of that day write to I as follow : -- ` as to dr johnson 's observation about the ignorance of officer in the length that a musket will carry my brother colonel dalrymple be present and he think that the doctor be either mistaken by put the question wrong or that he have converse on the subject with some person out of service ` be it upon that occasion that he express no curiosity to see the room at dumfermline where charle i be bear i know that he be bear -lrb- say he -rrb- no matter where -- do he envy we the birth-place of the king ' near the end of he _ journey _ dr johnson have give liberal praise to mr braidwood 's academy for the deaf and dumb -lrb- 1101 -rrb- when he visit it a circumstance occur which be truly characteristical of we great lexicographer ` pray -lrb- say he -rrb- can they pronounce any _ long _ word ' mr braidwood inform he they could upon which dr johnson write one of he _ sesquipedalium verba _ -lrb- 1102 -rrb- which be pronounce by the scholar and he be satisfied my reader may perhaps wish to know what the word be but i can not gratify they curiosity mr braidwood tell I it remain long in he school but have be lose before i make my inquiry -lrb- 1103 -rrb- dr johnson one day visit the court of session -lrb- 1104 -rrb- he think the mode of plead there too vehement and too much address to the passion of the judge ` this -lrb- say he -rrb- be not the areopagus ' at old mr drummond 's sir john dalrymple quaintly say the two noblest animal in the world be a scotch highlander and a english sailor -lrb- 1105 -rrb- ` why sir -lrb- say dr johnson -rrb- i shall say nothing as to the scotch highlander but as to the english sailor i can not agree with you ' sir john say he be generous in give away he money ' johnson ` sir he throw away he money without thought and without merit i do not call a tree generous that shed its fruit at every breeze ' sir john have affect to complain of the attack make upon he _ memoirs _ -lrb- 1106 -rrb- dr johnson say ` nay sir do not complain it be advantageous to a author that he book should be attack as well as praise fame be a shuttlecock if it be strike only at one end of the room it will soon fall to the ground to keep it up it must be strike at both end -lrb- 1107 -rrb- ' often have i reflect on this since and instead of be angry at many of those who have write against I have smile to think that they be unintentionally subservient to my fame by use a battledoor to make I _ virum volitare per os _ -lrb- 1108 -rrb- at sir alexander dick 's from that absence of mind to which every man be at time subject i tell in a blunder manner lady eglingtoune 's complimentary adoption of dr johnson as she son for i unfortunately state that she ladyship adopt he as she son in consequence of she have be marry the year _ after _ he be bear dr johnson instantly correct I ` sir do not you perceive that you be defame the countess for suppose I to be she son and that she be not marry till the year after my birth i must have be she _ natural _ son ' a young lady of quality who be present very handsomely say ` might not the son have justify the fault ' my friend be much flatter by this compliment which he never forget when in more than ordinary spirit and talking of he journey in scotland he have call to I ` boswell what be it that the young lady of quality say of I at sir alexander dick 's ' nobody will doubt that i be happy in repeat it my illustrious friend be now desirous to be again in the great theater of life and animated exertion take a place in the coach which be to set out for london on Monday the 22nd of November -lrb- 1109 -rrb- sir john dalrymple press he to come on the Saturday before to he house at cranston which be twelve mile from edinburgh upon the middle road to newcastle -lrb- dr johnson have come to edinburgh by berwick and along the naked coast -lrb- 1110 -rrb- -rrb- it would make he journey easier as the coach would take he up at a more seasonable hour than that at which it set out sir john i perceive be ambitious of have such a guest but as i be well assure that at this very time he have join with some of he prejudiced countryman in railing at dr johnson -lrb- 1111 -rrb- and have say he ` wonder how any gentleman of scotland could keep company with he ' i think he do not deserve the honor : yet as it might be a convenience to dr johnson i contrived that he should accept the invitation and engage to conduct he i resolve that on we way to sir john 's we should make a little circuit by roslin castle and hawthornden and wish to set out soon after breakfast but young mr tytler come to shew dr johnson some essay which he have write and my great friend who be exceedingly oblige when thus consult -lrb- 1112 -rrb- be detain so long that it be i believe one o'clock before we get into we post-chaise i find that we should be too late for dinner at sir john dalrymple 's to which we be engage : but i would by no means lose the pleasure of see my friend at hawthornden -- of see _ sam johnson _ at the very spot where _ ben jonson _ visit the learn and poetical drummond -lrb- 1113 -rrb- we survey roslin castle the romantick scene around it and the beautiful gothick chapel -lrb- 1114 -rrb- and dine and drink tea at the inn after which we proceed to hawthornden and view the cave and i all the while have _ rare ben _ -lrb- 1115 -rrb- in my mind and be please to think that this place be now visit by another celebrated wit of england by this time ` the wane night be grow old ' and we be yet several mile from sir john dalrymple 's dr johnson do not seem much trouble at we have treat the baronet with so little attention to politeness but when i talk of the grievous disappointment it must have be to he that we do not come to the _ feast _ that he have prepare for we -lrb- for he tell we he have kill a seven-year old sheep on purpose -rrb- my friend get into a merry mood and jocularly say ' i dare say sir he have be very sadly distressed : nay we do not know but the consequence may have be fatal let I try to describe he situation in he own historical style i have as good a right to make he think and talk as he have to tell we how people think and talk a hundred year ago of which he have no evidence all history so far as it be not support by contemporary evidence be romance -lrb- 1116 -rrb- -- stay now -- let we consider ' he then -lrb- heartily laugh all the while -rrb- proceed in he imitation i be sure to the following effect though now at the distance of almost twelve year i can not pretend to recollect all the precise word : -- ` dinner be ready he wonder that he guest be not yet come he wonder be soon succeed by impatience he walk about the room in anxious agitation sometimes he look at he watch sometimes he look out at the window with a eager gaze of expectation and revolve in he mind the various accident of human life he family behold he with mute concern surely -lrb- say he with a sigh -rrb- they will not fail I the mind of man can bear a certain pressure but there be a point when it can bear no more a rope be in he view and he die a roman death -lrb- 1117 -rrb- it be very late before we reach the seat of sir john dalrymple who certainly with some reason be not in very good humor we conversation be not brilliant we sup and go to bed in ancient room which would have better suit the climate of italy in summer than that of scotland in the month of November i recollect no conversation of the next day worth preserve except one say of dr johnson which will be a valuable text for many decent old dowager and other good company in various circle to descant upon he say ' i be sorry i have not learn to play at card it be very useful in life : it generate kindness and consolidate society -lrb- 1118 -rrb- ' he certainly could not mean deep play my friend and i think we should be more comfortable at the inn at blackshield two mile farther on we therefore go thither in the evening and he be very entertaining but i have preserve nothing but the please remembrance and he verse on george the second and cibber -lrb- 1119 -rrb- and he epitaph on parnell -lrb- 1120 -rrb- which he be then so good as to dictate to I we breakfast together next morning and then the coach come and take he up he have as one of he companion in it as far as newcastle the worthy and ingenious dr hope botanical professor at edinburgh both dr johnson and he use to speak of they good fortune in thus accidentally meet for they have much instructive conversation which be always a most valuable enjoyment and when find where it be not expect be peculiarly relish i have now complete my account of we tour to the hebride i have bring dr johnson down to scotland and see he into the coach which in a few hour carry he back into england he say to I often that the time he spend in this tour be the pleasantest part of he life -lrb- 1121 -rrb- and ask I if i would lose the recollection of it for five hundred pound i answer i would not and he applaud my set such a value on a accession of new image in my mind -lrb- 1122 -rrb- have it not be for I i be persuade dr johnson never would have undertake such a journey and i must be allow to assume some merit from have be the cause that we language have be enrich with such a book as that which he publish on he return a book which i never read but with the utmost admiration as i have such opportunity of know from what very meager material it be compose but my praise may be suppose partial and therefore i shall insert two

a pity to have omit and a robbery not to have ascribe to its author -lrb- 1128 -rrb- ` there be nothing in the book from begin to end that a scotchman need to take amiss -lrb- 1129 -rrb- what he say

be better accommodate with all the little want of life than _ col _ or _ sir allan _ he reason candidly about the _ second sight _ but i wish he have enquire more before he venture to say he even doubt of the possibility of such a unusual and useless deviation from all the know law of nature -lrb- 1130 -rrb- the notion of the second sight i consider as a remnant of superstitious ignorance and credulity which a philosopher will set down as such till the contrary be clearly prove and then it will be class among the other certain though unaccountable part of we nature like dream -lrb- 1131 -rrb- and-i do not know what ` in regard to the language it have the merit of be all he own many word of foreign extraction be use where i believe common one would do as well especially on familiar

shall rank _ ossian _ and he _ fingal _ and _ oscar _ amongst the nursery tale not the true history of we country in all time to come ` upon the whole the book can not displease for it have no

however slow and imperceptible to we which scotland have undergo in consequence of the blessing of liberty and internal peace i could have draw my pen through the story of the old woman at st andrew be the only silly thing in the book -lrb- 1134 -rrb- he have take the opportunity of ingraft into the work several good observation which i dare say he have make upon man and thing before he set foot on scotch ground by which it be considerably enriched -lrb- 1135 -rrb- a long journey like a tall may-pole though not very beautiful itself yet be pretty enough when ornament with flower and garland it furnish a sort of cloak-pin for hang the furniture of you mind upon and whoever set out upon a journey without furnish he mind previously with much study and useful knowledge erect a may-pole in December and put up very useless cloak-pin -lrb- 1136 -rrb- ' i hope the book will induce many of he countryman to make the same jaunt and help to intermix the more liberal part of they still more

with the present laird or he grandfather nor could i have any temptation to such a renunciation from either of they i acknowledge the benefit of be chief of a clan be in we day of very little significancy and to trace out the progress of this honor to the founder of a family of any standing would perhaps be a matter of some difficulty ` the true state of the present case be this : the mcleod family consist of two different branch the m ` leod of lewi of which i be descend and the m ` leod of harri and though the former have lose a very extensive estate by forfeiture in king jame the sixth 's time there be still several respectable family of it exist who would justly blame I for such a unmeaning cession when they all acknowledge I head of that family which though in fact it be but a ideal point of honor be not hitherto so far disregard in we country but it would determine some of my friend to look on I as a much smaller man than either they or myself judge I at present to be i will therefore ask it as a favor of you to acquaint the doctor with the difficulty he have bring I to in travel among rival clan such a silly tale as this might easily be whisper into the ear of a pass stranger but as it have no foundation in fact i hope the doctor will be so good as to take he own way in undeceive the publick i principally mean my friend and connection who will be first angry at I and next sorry to find such a instance of my littleness record in a book which have a very fair chance of be much read i expect you will let I know what he will write you in return and we

of dunvegan i only design to express what i think generally admit -- that the house of rasay allow the superiority of the house of dunvegan even this i now find to be erroneous and will therefore omit or retract it in the next edition ` though what i have say have be true if it have be disagreeable to you i should have wish it unsaid for it be not my business to adjust precedence as it be mistaken i find myself dispose to correct both by my respect for you and my reverence for truth ` as i know not when the book will be reprint i have desire mr boswell to anticipate the correction in the

sense of this favor and shall faithfully and carefully return they to you you may rely that i shall neither copy any part nor permit the papers to be see ` they contain a curious picture of society and form a journal on the most instructive plan that can possibly be think of for i be not sure that a ordinary observer would become so well acquaint either with dr johnson or with the manners of the hebride by a personal intercourse as by a perusal of you _ journal _ ' i be very truly ` dear sir ` you most obedient ` and affectionate humble servant ` william forbe ' when i consider how many of the person mention in this tour be now go to ` that undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller return -lrb- 1145 -rrb- ' i feel a impression at once awful and tender -- _ requiescant in pace _ it may be object by some person as it have be by one of my friend that he who have the power of thus exhibit a exact transcript of conversation be not a desirable member of society i repeat the answer which i make to that friend : -- ` few very few need be afraid that they saying will be record can it be imagine that i would take the trouble to gather what grow on every hedge because i have collect such fruit as the _ nonpareil _ and the bon chretien -lrb- 1146 -rrb- ' on the other hand how useful be such a faculty if well exercise to it we owe all those interesting apophthegm and _

of _ ana _ affix to some celebrated name to it we owe the _ table-talk _ of selden -lrb- 1147 -rrb- the _ conversation _ between ben jonson and drummond of hawthornden spence 's _ anecdote _ of pope

excellence could not be omit i trust that they who be the subject of they have good sense and good temper enough not to be displeased i have only to add that i shall ever reflect with great pleasure on a tour which have be the means of preserve so much of the enlighten and instructive conversation of one whose virtue will i hope ever be a object of imitation and whose power of mind be so extraordinary that age may revolve before such a man shall again appear appendix no i _ in justice to the ingenious _ dr blacklock _ i publish the following letter from he relative to a passage in p 47 _ ` to jame boswell esq ` dear sir ` have lately have the pleasure of read you account of the journey which you take with dr samuel johnson to the western isle i take the liberty of transmit my idea of the conversation which happen between the doctor and myself concern lexicography and poetry which as it be a little different from the delineation exhibit in the former edition of you _ journal _ can not i hope be unacceptable particularly since i have be inform that a second edition of that work be now in contemplation if not in execution : and i be still more strongly tempt to encourage that hope from consider that if every one concern in the conversation related be to send you what they can recollect of these colloquial entertainment many curious and interesting particulars might be recover which the most assiduous attention could not observe nor the most tenacious memory retain a little reflection sir will convince you that there be not a axiom in euclid more intuitive nor more evident than the doctor 's assertion that poetry be of much easier execution than lexicography any mind therefore endowed with common sense must have be extremely absent from itself if it discover the least astonishment from hear that a poem might be write with much more facility than the same quantity of a dictionary ` the real cause of my surprise be what appear to I much more paradoxical that he could write a sheet of dictionary _ with as much pleasure _ as a sheet of poetry he acknowledge indeed that the latter be much easier than the former for in the one case book and a desk be requisite in the other you might compose when lie in bed or walk in the field & c he do not however descend to explain nor to this moment can i comprehend how the labor of a mere philologist in the most refined sense of that term could give equal pleasure with the exercise of a mind replete with elevated conception and pathetic idea while taste fancy and intellect be deeply enamoured of nature and in full exertion you may likewise perhaps remember that when i complain of the ground which scepticism in religion and moral be continually gain it do not appear to be on my own account as my private opinion upon these important subject have long be inflexibly determine what i then deplore and still deplore be the unhappy influence which that gloomy hesitation have not only upon particular character but even upon life in general as be equally the bane of action in we present state and of such consolation as we might derive from the hope of a future ' i have the pleasure of remain with sincere esteem and respect ` dear sir ` you most obedient humble servant ` thoma blacklock ' ` edinburgh nov 12 1785 ' i be very happy to find that dr blacklock 's apparent uneasiness on the subject of scepticism be not on he own account -lrb- as i suppose -rrb- but from a benevolent concern for the happiness of mankind with respect however to the question concern poetry and compose a dictionary i be confident that my state of dr johnson 's position be accurate one may misconceive the motive by which a person be induce to discuss a particular topick -lrb- as in the case of dr blacklock 's speaking of scepticism -rrb- but a assertion like that make by dr johnson can not be easily mistaken and indeed it seem not very probable that he who so pathetically lament the _ drudgery _ -lrb- 1153 -rrb- to which the unhappy lexicographer be doom and be know to have write he splendid imitation of _ juvenal _ with astonishing rapidity -lrb- 1154 -rrb- should have have ` as much pleasure in write a sheet of a dictionary as a sheet of poetry -lrb- 1155 -rrb- ' nor can i concur with the ingenious writer of the foregoing letter in think it a axiom as evident as any in euclid that ` poetry be of easier execution than lexicography ' i have no doubt that bailey -lrb- 1156 -rrb- and the ` mighty blunderbuss of law -lrb- 1157 -rrb- ' jacob write ten page of they respective _ dictionary _ with more ease than they could have write five page of poetry if this book should again be reprint i shall with the utmost readiness correct any error i may have commit in state conversation provide it can be clearly shewn to I that i have be inaccurate but i be slow to believe -lrb- as i have elsewhere observe -lrb- 1158 -rrb- -rrb- that any man 's memory at the distance of several year can preserve fact or saying with such fidelity as may be do by write they down when they be recent : and i beg it may be remember that it be not upon _ memory _ but upon what

mr boswell 's _ tour to the hebride _ in which it be say that _ i could not get through mr montague 's essay on shakspeare _ i do not delay a moment to declare that on the contrary i have always commend it myself and hear it commend by every one else and few thing would give I more concern than to be think incapable of tasting or unwilling to testify my opinion of its excellence ' it be remarkable that this postscript be so express as not to point out the person who say that mr thrale could not get through mr montague 's book and therefore i think it necessary to remind mr piozzus that the assertion concern she be dr johnson 's and not mine the second observation that i shall make on this postscript be that it do not deny the fact assert though i must acknowledge from the praise it bestow on mr montague 's book it may have be design to convey that meaning what mr thrale 's opinion be or be or what she may or may not have say to dr johnson concern mr montague 's book it be not necessary for I to enquire it be only incumbent on I to ascertain what dr johnson say to I i shall therefore confine myself to a very short state of the fact the unfavourable opinion of mr montague 's book which dr johnson be here report to have give be know to have be that which he uniformly express as many of he friend well remember so much for the authenticity of the paragraph as far as it relate to he own sentiment the word contain the assertion to which mr piozzus object be print from my manuscript journal and be take down at the time the journal be read by dr johnson who point out some inaccuracy which i correct but do not mention any inaccuracy in the paragraph in question : and what be still more material and very flattering to I a considerable part of my journal contain
