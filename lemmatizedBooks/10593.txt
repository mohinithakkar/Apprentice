produce by juliet sutherland sjaanus and the online distribute proofread team great possession by david grayson chapter i the well-flavoured earth sweet as eden be the air and eden-sweet the ray no paradise be lose for they who foot by branch root and stem and lightly with the woodland share the change of night and day for these many year since i have live here in the country i have have it in my mind to write something about the odour and taste of this well-flavoured earth the fact be both the sense of smell and the sense of taste have be shabbily treat in the amiable rivalry of the sens sight and hearing have be the swift and nimble brother and sight especially the tricky jacob of the family be keen upon the business of seize the entire inheritance while smell like hairy esau come late to the blessing hungry from the hill and willing to trade its inheritance for a mess of pottage i have always have a kind of errant love for the improvident and adventurous esaus of the earth i think they smell a wilder fragrance than i do and taste sweeter thing and i have think therefore of begin a kind of fragrant autobiography a chronicle of all the good odour and flavor that ever i have have in my life as i grow older a curious feeling come often to I in the spring as it come this spring more poignantly than ever before a sense of the temporariness of all thing the swiftness of life the sadness of a beauty that vanish so soon and i long to lay hold upon it as it pass by all the handle that i can i would not only see it and hear it but i would smell it and taste it and touch it and all with a new kind of intensity and eagerness harriet say i get more pleasure out of the smell of my supper than i get out of the supper itself i never need to ring for you say she but only open the kitchen door in a few minute i 'll see you straighten up lift you head sniff a little and come straight for the house the odour of you supper harriet i say after a day in the field would lure a man out of purgatory my father before I have a singularly keen nose i remember well when i be a boy and drive with he in the wild north country often through mile of unbroken forest how he would sometimes break a long silence lift he head with sudden awareness and say to I : david i smell open field in a few minute we be sure to come to a settler 's cabin a log barn or a clearing among the free odour of the forest he have catch afar off the common odour of the work of man when we be tramp or survey in that country i have see he stop suddenly draw in a long breath and remark : marsh or a stream yonder part of this strange keenness of sense often note by those who know that sturdy old cavalryman may have be base as so many of we talent be upon a defect my father give all the sweet sound of the world the voice of he son the song of he daughter to help free the southern slave he be deaf it be well know that when one sense be defective the other fly to the rescue and my father 's singular development of the sense of smell may have be due in part to this defect though i believe it to have be to a far larger degree a native gift I have a downright good nose all he life long he enjoy with more than ordinary keenness the odour of flower and would often pick a sprig of wild rose and carry it along with he in he hand sniff at it from time to time and he love the lilac as i do after he to ill odour he be not less sensitive and be impatient of rat in the barn and could smell they among other odour the moment the door be open he always have a peculiar sensitiveness to the presence of animal as of dog cat muskrat cattle horse and the like and would speak of they long before he have see they or could know that they be about i recall once on a wild northern lake when we be work along the shore in a boat how he stop suddenly and exclaim : david do you hear anything -- for i a boy be ear for he in those wilderness place no father what be it indian and sure enough in a short time i hear the bark of they dog and we come soon upon they camp where i remember they be dry deer meat upon a frame of poplar pole over a open fire he tell I that the smoky smell of the indian tan buckskin parched wild rice and the like be odour that carry far and could not be mistaken my father have a big hooked nose with long narrow nostril i suppose that this have really nothing to do with the matter although i have come after these many year to look with a curious interest upon people 's nose since i know what a vehicle of delight they often be my own nose be nothing to speak of good enough as nose go -- but i think i inherit from my father something of the power of enjoyment he have from that sense though i can never hope to become the accomplished smeller he be i be move to begin this chronicle because of my joy this morning early -- a may morning -- just after sunrise when the shadow lay long and blue to the west and the dew be still on the grass and i walk in the pleasant space of my garden it be so stillso stillthat bird afar off could be hear singing and once through the crystal air come the voice of a neighbor call he cow but the sound and the silence the fair sight of meadow and hill i soon put aside for the lilac be in bloom and the bush-honeysuckle and the strawberry though no movement of the air be perceptible the lilac well know the way of the wind for if i stand to the north of they the odour be less rich and free than to the south and i think i might pose as a prophet of wind and weather upon the basis of this easy magic and predict that the breeze of the day would be from the north -- as indeed they later appear to be i go from clump to clump of the lilac testing and compare they with great joy and satisfaction they vary noticeably in odour the white variety be the most delicate while those tend to deep purple be the richest some of the newer double variety seem less fragrant -- and i have test they now many time -- than the old-fashioned single variety which be nearer the native stock here i fancy we smooth jacob have be at work and in the lucrative process of selection for the eye alone the cunning horticulturist have cheat we of we rightful heritage of fragrance i have a mind some time to practice the art of burbankry or other kind of wizardy upon the old lilac stock and select for odour alone secure ravishing original variety -- indeed whole new gamut of fragrance i should devise the most animating name for my creation such as the double delicious the air of arcady the sweet zephyr and other even more invite which i should enjoy invent though i think surely i could make my fortune out of this interesting idea i present it freely to a scent-hungry world -- here it be grati -- for i have my time so fully occupy during all of this and my next two or three life that i can not attend to it i have feel the same defect in the cultivate rose while the odour be rich often of cloying sweetness or even as in certain white rose have a languor as of death they never for I equal the fragrance of the wild sweet rise that grow all about these hill in old tangled fence row in the lee of meadow boulder or by some unfrequented roadside no other odour i know awaken quite such a feeling -- light like a cloud suggest free hill open country sunny air and none surely have for I such a after-call a whiff of the wild rose will bring back in all the poignancy of sad happiness a train of ancient memory old face old scene old love -- and the wild thought i have when a boy the first week of the wild-rose bloom beginning here about the twenty-fifth of June be always to I a memorable time i be a long time learn how to take hold of nature and think now with some sadness of all the life i lose in former year the impression the earth give I be confuse : i be as one only half awake a fine morning make I dumbly glad a cool evening after the heat of the day and the work of it touch my spirit restfully but i could have explain neither the one nor the other gradually as i look about I i begin to ask myself why be it that the sight of these common hill and field give I such exquisite delight and if it be beauty why be it beautiful and if i be so richly reward by mere glimpse can i not increase my pleasure with longer look i try longer look both at nature and at the friendly human creature all about I i stop often in the garden where i be work or loiter a moment in the field or sit down by the roadside and think intently what it be that so perfectly and wonderfully surround I and thus i come to have some knowledge of the great secret it be after all a simple matter as such matter usually be when we penetrate they and consist merely in shut out all other impression feeling thought and concentrate the full energy of the attention upon what it be that i saw or hear at that instant at one moment i would let in all the sound of the earth at another all the sight so we practice the hand at one time the foot at another or learn how to sit or to walk and so acquire new grace for the whole body should we do less in acquire grace for the spirit it will astonish one who have not try it how full the world be of sound commonly unheard and of sight commonly unseen but in they nature like the smallest blossom of a curious perfection and beauty out of this practice grow presently and as it seem to I instinctively for i can not now remember the exact time of its begin a habit of repeat under my breath or even aloud and in a kind of singsong voice fragmentary word and sentence describe what it be that i see or feel at the moment as for example : the pink blossom of the wild crab-apple tree i see from the hill the reedy song of the wood thrush among the thicket of the wild cherry the scent of peach leave the odour of new-turned soil in the black field the red of the maple in the marsh the white of apple tree in bloom i can not find he out -- nor know why i be here some form of expression however crude seem to reenforce and intensify the gathering of the sens and these word afterward remember or even write down in the little book i sometimes carry in my pocket seem to awaken echo however faint of the exaltation of that moment in the wood or field and enable I to live twice where formerly i have be able to live but once it be by this simple process of concentrate upon what i see or hear that i increase immeasurably my own joy of my garden and field and the hill and marsh all about a little later for i be a slow learner i begin to practice the same method with the sense of smell and still later with the sense of taste i say to myself i will no longer permit the avid and eager eye to steal away my whole attention i will learn to enjoy more completely all the varied wonder of the earth so i try deliberately shut the doorway of both sight and hearing and centre the industry of my spirit upon the flavor of the earth i test each odour narrowly compare it well with remembered odour and often turn the impression i have into such poor word as i could command what a new and wonderful world open to I then my takings of nature increase tenfold a hundredfold and i come to a new acquaintance with my own garden my own hill and all the road and field around about -- and even the town take on strange new meaning for I i can not explain it rightly but it be as though i have find a new earth here within the old one but more spacious and beautiful than any i have know before i have think often and often that this world we live in so dumbly so carelessly would be more glorious than the tinsel heaven of the poet if only we know how to lay hold upon it if only we could win that complete command of we own life which be the end of we be at first as i say i stop my work or loiter as i walk in order to see or hear or smell -- and do so still for i have enter only the antechamber of the treasure-house but as i learn better the modest technic of these art i find that the practice of they go well with the common task of the garden or farm especially with those that be more or less monotonous like cultivate corn hoeing potato and the like the air be just as full of good sight and good odour for the worker as for the idler and it depend only upon the awareness the aliveness of we own spirit whether we toil like dumb animal or bless we labor hour with the beauty of life such enjoyment and a grow command of we surroundings be possible after a little practice without take much of that time we call so valuable and waste so sinfully i have not time say the farmer the banker the professor with a kind of disdain for the spirit of life when as a matter of fact he have all the time there be all that anybody have -- to wit _ this _ moment this great and golden moment -- but know not how to employ it he creep when he might walk walk when he might run run when he might fly -- and live like a woodchuck in the dark body of himself why there be man in this valley who scout the idea that farm carpentry merchantry be anything but drudgery defend all the evil know to humankind with the argument that a man must live and laugh at any one who see beauty or charm in be here in work with the hand or indeed in just live while they think of themselves cannily as practical man i think they the most impractical man i know for in a world full of boundless riches they remain obstinately poor they be unwilling to invest even a few of they dollar unearned in the real wealth of the earth for it be only the sense of the spirit of life whether in nature or in other human being that lift man above the beast and curiously lead they to god who be the spirit both of beauty and of friendliness i say truly have now reach the point in my life where it seem to I i care only for write that which be most deeply true for I that i rarely walk in my garden or upon the hill of a evening without thinking of god it be in my garden that all thing become clearer to I even that miracle whereby one who have offend may still see god and this i think a wonderful thing in my garden i understand dimly why evil be in the world and in my garden learn how transitory it be just now i have come in from work and will note freshly one of the best odour i have have to-day as i be work in the corn a lazy breeze blow across the meadow from the west and after loitering a moment among the blackberry bush seek I out where i be busiest do you know the scent of the blackberry almost all the year round it be a treasure-house of odour even when the leaf first come out but it reach crescendo in blossom time when indeed i like it least for be too strong it have a curious fragrance once well call by a poet the hot scent of the brier and aromatically hot it be and sharp like the brier themselves at time i do not like it at all for it give I a kind of faintness while at other time as to-day it fill I with a strange sense of pleasure as though it be the very breath of the spicy earth it be also a rare friend of the sun for the hotter and brighter the day the hotter and sharper the scent of the brier many of the commonest and least notice of plant flower tree possess a truly fragrant personality if once we begin to know they i have a adventure in my own orchard only this spring and make a fine new acquaintance in a quarter least of all expect i have start down the lane through the garden one morning in the most ordinary way with no thought of any special experience when i suddenly catch a whiff of pure delight that stop I short what now can _ that _ be and i think to myself that nature have play some new prank on I i turn into the orchard follow my nose it be not the peach bud nor the plum nor the cherry nor yet the beautiful new color leaf of the grape nor anything i could see along the grassy margin of the pasture there be other odour all about old friend of mine but this be some shy and please stranger come venture upon my land a moment later i discover a patch of low green verdure upon the ground and dismiss it scornfully as one of my ancient enemy but it be this way with enemy once we come to know they they often turn out to have a fragrance that be kindly well this particular fierce enemy be a patch of chickweed chickweed invader of the garden cossack of the orchard i discover however that it be in full bloom and cover with small star-like white blossom well now say i be you the guilty rascal so i knelt there and take my delight of it and a rare delicate good odour it be for several day afterward i would not dig out the patch for i say to myself what a cheerful claim it make these early day when most of the earth be still cold and dead for a bit of immortality the bee know the secret already and the hen and the blackbird and i think it no loss but really a new and valuable pleasure to divert my path down the lane for several day that i might enjoy more fully this new odour and make a clear acquaintance with something fine upon the earth i have not know before chapter ii of good and evil odour of all time of the day for good odour i think the early morning the very best although the evening just after sunset if the air fall still and cool be often as good certain quality or state of the atmosphere seem to favor the distillation of good odour and i have know time even at midday when the earth be very wonderful to smell there be a curious fainting fragrance that come only with sunshine and still heat not long ago i be cut away a thicket of wild spiraea which be crowd in upon the cultivate land it be a hot day and the leaf wilt quickly give off such a penetrate fainting fragrance that i let the branch lie where they fall the afternoon through and come often back to smell of they for it be a fine thing thus to discover a odour wholly new to I i like also the first wild sweet smell of new-cut meadow grass not the familiar odour of new-mown hay which come a little later and be worthy of its good report but the brief despairing odour of grass just cut down its juice freshly expose to the sun one as it richly in the field at the mowing i like also the midday smell of peach leave and peach-tree bark at the summer priming : and have never let any one else cut out the old cane from the blackberry row in my garden for the goodness of the scent which wait upon that work another odour i have find animating be the odour of burn wastage in new clearing or in old field especially in the evening when the smoke drift low along the land and take to itself by some strange chemical process the tang of earthy thing it be a true say that nothing will so bring back the emotion of a past time as a remembered odour i have have from a whiff of fragrance catch in a city street such a vivid return of a old time and a old sad scene that i have stop tremble there with a emotion long spend and i think forget once in a foreign city pass a latticed gateway that close in a narrow court i catch the odour of wild sweet balsam i do not know now where it come from or what could have cause it -- but it stop I short where i stand and the solid brick wall of that city roll aside like paint curtain and the iron street dissolve before my eye and with the curious dizziness of nostalgia i be myself upon the hill of my youth -- with the gleaming river in the valley and a hawk sailing majestically in the high blue of the sky and all about and everywhere the balsam -- and the balsam -- full of the sweet wild odour of the north and of dream boyhood and there while my body the shell of I loiter in that strange city i be myself four thousand mile and a quarter of a century away relive with a conscious passion that boyhood never know a moment catch up like a torch out of the smoulder wreckage of the past do not tell I that such thing die they all remain with us-all the sight and sound and thought of by-gone time await only the whiff from some latticed gateway some closed-in court to spring again into exuberant life if only we be ready for the great moment as for the odour of the burning wastage of the field at evening i scarcely know if i dare say it i find it produce in the blood of I a kind of primitive emotion as though it stir memory older than my present life some drowsy cell of the brain awaken to a familiar stimulus -- the odour of the lodge-fire of the savage the wigwam of the indian racial memory but it be not the time of the day nor the turn of the season nor yet the way of the wind that matter most but the ardor and glow we ourselves bring to the fragrant earth it be a sad thing to reflect that in a world so overflow with goodness of smell of fine sight and sweet sound we pass by hastily and take so little of they day pass when we see no beautiful sight hear no sweet sound smell no memorable odour : when we exchange no single word of deeper understanding with a friend we have live a day and add nothing to we life a blind grub senseless life -- that it be a strange thing also that instead of sharpen the tool by which we take hold of life we make study effort to dull they we seem to fear life and early begin to stop we ear and close we eye lest we hear and see too much : we clog we sens and cloud we mind we seek dull security and ease and cease longer to desire adventure and struggle and then -- the tragedy of it -- the poet we all have in we in youth begin to die the philosopher in we die the martyr in we die so that the long long time beyond youth with so many of we become a busy death and this i think truer of man than of woman : beyond forty many woman just begin to awaken to power and beauty but most man beyond that age go on die the task of the artist whether poet or musician or painter be to keep alive the perish spirit of free adventure in man : to nourish the poet the prophet the martyr we all have in we one 's sense of smell like the sense of taste be sharpest when he be hungry and i be convinced also that one see and hear best when unclogged with food undulled with drink undrugged with smoke for I also weariness though not exhaustion seem to sharpen all the sens keenness go with leanness when i have be work hard or tramp the country road in the open air and come in weary and hungry at night and catch the fragrance of the evening along the road or upon the hill or at barn-door smell the unmilked cow or at the doorway the comfortable odour of cooking supper how good that all be at such time i know esau to the core : the forthright nature-loving simple man he be come in dabble with the blood of hunt animal and hungry for the steam pottage it follow that if we take excessive joy of one sense as of taste nature ever seek just balance deprive we of the full enjoyment of the other i be stuff cousin cry beatrice in the play i can not smell i have drunk remark the clown in arcady what be rose to I we forget that there be five chord in the great scale of life -- sight hearing smell taste touch and -- few of we ever master the chord well enough to get the full symphony of life but be something like little pig-tailed girl play peter piper with one finger while all the music of the universe be in the great instrument and all to be have for the taking of most evil odour it can be say that they be temporary or unnecessary : and any unpleasant odour such as that of fruit spray in spring or fertilizer newly spread on the land can be bear and even welcome if it be appropriate to the time and place some smell evil at first become through usage not unpleasant i once stop with a wolf-trapper in the north country who set he bottle of bait outside when i come in he say it be good and strong and sniff it with appreciation i agree with he that it be strong to he it be not unpleasant though make of the rancid fat of the muscallonge all nature seem to strive against evil odour for when she warn we of decay she be speed decay : and a manured field produce later the best of all odour almost all shut-in place sooner or later acquire a evil odour : and it seem a requisite for good smell that there be plenty of sunshine and air and so it be with the heart and soul of man if they be long shut in upon themselves they grow rancid chapter iii follow you nose listen to the exhortation of the dawn -- look to this day for it be life the very life of life on a spring morning one have only to step out into the open country lift he head to the sky -- and follow he nose it be a big and golden morning and Sunday to boot and i walk down the lane to the lower edge of the field where the wood and the marsh begin the sun be just come up over the hill and all the air be fresh and clear and cool high in the heaven a few fleecy cloud be drift and the air be just enough astir to waken the hemlock into faint and sleepy exchange of confidence it seem to I that morning that the world be never before so high so airy so golden all fill to the brim with the essence of sunshine and spring morning -- so that one 's spirit dissolve in it become a part of it such a morning such a morning from that place and just as i be i set off across the open land it be the time of all time for good odour -- soon after sunrise -- before the heat of the day have draw off the rich distillation of the night in that keen moment i catch drift a faint but wild fragrance upon the air and veer northward full into the way of the wind i could not at first tell what this particular odour be nor separate it from the general good odour of the earth but i follow it intently across the moor-like open land once i think i have lose it entirely or that the faint northern air have shift but i soon catch it clearly again and just as i be say to myself i have get it i have get it -- for it be a great pleasure to identify a friendly odour in the field -- i see near the bank of the brook among fern and raspberry bush a thorn-apple tree in full bloom so there you be i say i hasten toward it now in the full current and glory of its fragrance the sun look over the taller tree to the east have crown the top of it with gold so that it be beautiful to see and it be full of honey bee as excite as i a score of foot onward toward the wind beyond the thorn-apple tree i pass wholly out of the range of its fragrance into another world and begin try for some new odour after one or two false scent for this pursuit have all the hazard know to the hunter i catch a odour long know to I not strong nor yet very wonderful but distinctive it lead I still a little distance northward to a sunny slope just beyond a bit of marsh and sure enough i find a old friend the wild sweet geranium a world of it in full bloom and i sit down there for some time to enjoy it fully beyond that and across a field wild with tangle of huckleberry bush and sheep laurel where the bluet and buttercup be bloom and in shady spot the shy white violet i search for the odour of a certain clump of pine tree i discover long ago i know that i must come upon it soon but could not tell just when or where i hold up a moistened finger to make sure of the exact direction of the wind and bearing then a little eastward soon come full upon it -- as a hunter might surprise a deer in the forest i cross the brook a second time and through a little marsh make it the rule of the game never to lose for a instant the scent i be follow -- even though i stop in a low spot to admire a mass of thrifty blue flag now begin to bloom -- and come thus to the pine i be seek they be not great tree nor noble but gnarled and angular and stunt for the soil in that place be poor and thin and the wind in winter keen but the brown blanket of needle they spread and the shade they offer the traveller be not less hospitable nor the fragrance they give off less enchant the odour of the pine be one i love i sit down there in a place i choose long ago -- a place already as familiar with please memory as a favorite room -- so that i wonder that some of the note i have write there do not of themselves exhale the very odour of the pine and all about be hang a fair tapestry of green and the earthy floor be cleanly carpet with brown and the roof above be in arched mosaic the deep deep blue of the sky see through the gnarled and knotted branch of the pine through a little opening among the tree as through a window i could see the cattle feed in the wide meadow all head alike and yellow butterfly drift across the open space and there be bumblebee and dragonfly and presently i hear some one tap tap at the door of the wood and glance up quickly i see my early visitor there he be as neighbourly as you please and not in the least awed by my intrusion there he be far out on the limb of a dead tree step energetically up and down like a sailor reef a sail and rapping and tap as he work -- a downy woodpecker good morning sir i say he stop for scarcely a second cock one eye at I and go back to he work again who be i that i should interrupt he breakfast and i be glad i be there and i begin enumerate as though i be the accredit reporter for the _ woodland gazette _ all the good news of the day the beech tree say aloud have come at last to full leafage the wild blackberry be ready to bloom the swamp rose be bud brown plant field i see and droop elm and the young crow cry from they nest on the knoll i know now that whoever i be whatever i do i be welcome here the meadow be as green this spring for tom the drunkard and for jim the thief as for jonathan the parson or for walt the poet : the wild cherry bloom as richly and the odour of the pine be as sweet -- at that moment like a flame for clearness i understand some of the deep and simple thing of life as that we be to be like the friendly pine and the elm tree and the open field and reject no man and judge no man once a long time ago i read a sober treatise by one who try to prove with elaborate knowledge that upon the whole good be triumphant in this world and that probably there be a god and i remember go out dully afterward upon the hill for i be weigh down with a strange depression and the world seem to I a hard cold narrow place where good must be heavily demonstrate in book and as i sit there the evening fall a star or two come out in the clear blue of the sky and suddenly it become all simple to I so that i laugh aloud at that laborious big-wig for spending so many futile year in seek doubtful proof of what he might have learn in one rare home upon my hill and far more than he could prove far more as i come away from that place i know i should never again be quite the same person i be before -lrb- illustration : and as i sit there the evening fall a star or two come out in the clear blue of the sky -rrb- well we can not remain steadily upon the height at least i can not and would not if i could after i have be out about so long on such a adventure as this something let go inside of I and i come down out of the mountain -- and yet know deeply that i have be where the bush be burn and have hear the voice in the fire so it be yesterday morning i realize suddenly that i be hungry -- commonly coarsely hungry my whole attention i be go to say my whole soul shift to the thought of ham and egg this may seem a tremendous anti-climax but it be nevertheless a sober report of what happen at the first onset of this new mood the ham-and-egg mood let we call it i be a little ashamed or abashed at the remembrance of my wild flight and have a laugh at the thought of myself flounder around in the marsh and field a mile from home when harriet no doubt have breakfast wait for I what absurd contradictory inconsistent cowardly creature we be anyway the house seem a inconceivable distance away and the only real thing in the world the gnawing emptiness under my belt and i be wet to my knee and the tangled huckleberry bash and sheep laurel and hardback i have pass through so joyously a short time before now cling heavily about my leg as i struggle through they and the sun be hot and high -- and there be innumerable small black buzz fly to cap the climax whom should i meet as i be cross the fence into the lower land but my friend horace he have be out early look for a cow that have drop she calf in the wood and be now drive they slowly up the lane the cow a true pattern of solicitous motherhood the calf a true pattern of youth dash about upon uncertain leg takin ' the air david i amuse horace horace be a important man in this community he have big solid barn and money in the bank and a reputation for hardheadedness he be also know as a driver and have have sore trouble with a favorite son he believe in goin ' it slow and playin ' safe and he be convince that ye can not change human nature he question come to I with a kind of shock i imagine with a vividness impossible to describe what horace would think if i answer he squarely and honestly if i be to say : i have be down in the marsh follow my nose -- enjoy the thorn apple and the wild geranium talk with a woodpecker and report the morning news of the wood for a imaginary newspaper i be hungry and in a mood to smile at myself anyway -lrb- good-humouredly and forgivingly as we always smile at ourselves -rrb- before i meet horace and the flash vision i have of horace 's dry superior smile finish I be there really anything in this world but cow and calf and great solid barn and oatcrop and cash in the bank be in the brook ask horace observe my wet leg talk about the courage to face cannon and cossack it be nothing to the courage require to speak aloud in broad daylight of the finest thing we have in we i be not equal to it oh i have be down for a tramp in the marsh i say try to put he off but horace be a yankee of the yankee and love nothing better than to chase he friend into corner with question and leave they ultimately with the impression that they be somehow less sound sensible practical than he be and he usually prove it not because he be right but because he be sure and in a world of shadowy halt-belief and half-believer he be without doubt what ye find down there ask horace oh i be just look around to see how the spring be come on hm-m say horace eloquently and when i do not reply he continue often git out in the morning as early as this yes i say often and do you find thing any different now from what they would be later in the day at this the humor of the whole situation dawn on I and i begin to revive when thing grow hopelessly complicate and we can not laugh we do either one of two thing : we lie or we die but if we can laugh we can fight and be honest horace i say i know what you be think about horace 's face remain perfectly impassive but there be a glint of curiosity in he eye you have be think i have be waste my time beat around down there in the swamp just to look at thing and smell of thing -- which you would not do you think i be a kind of impractical dreamer now do not you horace i 'll warrant you have tell you wife just that more than once come now i think i make a rather shrewd hit for horace look uncomfortable and a little foolish come now honest i laugh and look he in the eye waal now ye see -- of course you do and i do not mind it in the least a little dry gleam of humor come in he eye be not ye it be a fine thing to have it straight out with a friend no i say i be the practical man and you be the dreamer i have rarely know in all my life horace such a confirm dreamer as you be nor a more impractical one horace laugh how do ye make that out with this my spirit return to I and i counter with a question as good as he it be as valuable in argument as in war to secure the offensive horace what be you work for anyhow this be always a devastating shot ninety-nine out of every hundred human being be desperately at work grub sweating worry think sorrowing enjoy without in the least know why why to make a living -- same as you say horace oh come now if i be to spread the report in town that a poor neighbor of mine that be you horace be just make he living that he himself have tell I so what would you say horace what be you work for it be something more than a mere living waal now i 'll tell ye if ye want it straight i be layin ' aside a little something for a rainy day a little something this in the exact inflection of irony by which here in the country we express we opinion that a friend have really a good deal more lay aside than anybody know about horace smile also in the exact manner of one so complimented horace what be you go to do with that thirty thousand dollar thirty thousand horace look at I and smile and i look at horace and smile honest now waal i 'll tell ye -- a little peace and comfort for I and josie in we old age and a little something to make the child remember we when we be go be not that worth work for he say this with downright seriousness i do not press he further but if i have try i could probably have get the even deeper admission of that faith that lie like bed rock in the thought of most man -- that honesty and decency here will not be without its reward there however they may define the there some prophet 's paradise to come i know it i say horace you be a dreamer too you be dream of peace and comfort in you old age a little quiet house in town where you will not have to labor as hard as you do now where you will not be worry by crop and weather and where mr horace will be able to rest after so many year of care and work and sorrow -- a kind of earthly heaven and you be dream of leave a bit to you child and grandchild and dream of the gratitude they will express all dream horace oh waal -- the fact be you be work for a dream and living on dream -- be not that true waal now if you mean it that way -- i see i have not get you beaten yet horace he smile broadly we be all amiable enough with we own dream you think that what you be work for -- you dream -- be somehow sounder and more practical than what i be work for horace start to reply but have scarcely debouch from he trench when i open on he with one of my twenty-fours how do you know that you be ever go to be old it hit and if you do grow old how do you know that thirty thousand dollar -- oh we 'll call it that -- be really enough provide you do not lose it before to buy peace and comfort for you or that what you leave you child will make either you or they any happier peace and comfort and happiness be terribly expensive horace -- and price have be go up fast since this war begin horace look at I uncomfortably as man do in the world when you shake the foundation of the tabernacle i have think since that i probably press he too far but these thing go deep with I no horace i say you be the dreamer -- and the impractical dreamer at that for a moment horace answer nothing and we both stand still there in the soft morning sunshine with the peaceful field and wood all about we two human atom struggle hotly with question too large for we the cow and the new calf be long out of sight horace make a motion as if to follow they up the lane but i hold he with my glittering eye -- as i think of it since not without a kind of amusement at my own seriousness i be the practical man horace for i want my peace now and my happiness now and my god now i can not wait my barn may burn or my cattle die or the solid bank where i keep my defer joy may fail or i myself by to-morrow be no longer here so powerfully and vividly do this thought take possession of I that i can not now remember to have say a decent good-bye to horace -lrb- never mind he know I -rrb- at least when i be halfway up the hill i find myself gesticulate with one clenched fist and say to myself with a kind of passion : why wait to be peaceful why not he peaceful now why not be happy now why not be rich now for i think it truth that a life uncommanded now be uncommanded a life unenjoyed now be unenjoyed a life not live wisely now be not live wisely : for the past be go and no one know the future as for horace be he convince that he be a impractical dreamer not a bit of it he be merely flurry for a moment in he mind and probably think I now more than ever before just what i think he absurd place be not it this world so i reach home at last you have no idea unless you have try it yourself how good breakfast taste alter a three-mile tramp in the sharp morning air the odour of ham and egg and new muffin and coffee as you come up the hill there be a odour for you and it be good to see harriet harriet i say you be a sight for tired eye chapter iv the green people i have always have a fondness when upon my travels about the world of the near-by wood and field for nip a bit of a twig here and there and tasting the tart or bitter quality of it i suppose the instinct descend to I from the herbivorous side of my distant ancestry i love a spray of white cedar especially the spicy sweet inside bark or a pine needle or the tender sweet juicy end of a spike of timothy grass draw slowly from its close-fitting sheath or a twig of the birch that taste like wintergreen i think this no strange or unusual instinct for i have see many other people do it especially farmer around here who go through the field nip the new oats test the red-top or chew a bit of sassafras bark i have in mind a clump of shrubbery in the town road where a old house once stand of the kind call here by some the sweet-scented shrub and the brandy of it nearest the road be quite clip and stunt i be be nip at by old lady who pass that way and take to it like cat to catnip for a long time this be a wholly unorganized indeed all but unconscious pleasure a true pattern of the childish way we take hold of the earth but when i begin to come newly alive to all thing as i have already relate -- i chance upon this curious undeveloped instinct what be it i have here i ask myself for i think this might be a new handle for get hold of nature along one edge of my field be a natural hedge of wild cherry young elm and ash dogwood black raspberry bush and the like which have long be a pleasure to the eye especially in the early morning when the shadow of it lie long and cool upon the meadow many time i have walk that way to admire it or to listen for the catbird that nest there or to steal upon a certain gray squirrel who come out from he home in the chestnut tree on a fine morning to inspect he premise it occur to I one day that i would make the acquaintance of this hedge in a new way so i pass slowly along it where the branch of the tree brush my shoulder and pick a twig here and there and bit it through this be cherry i say this be elm this be dogwood and it be a fine adventure to know old friend in new way for i have never think before to test the tree and shrub by they taste and smell after that whenever i pass that way i close my eye and try for further identification by taste and be soon able to tell quickly half a dozen other variety of tree shrub and smaller plant along that bit of meadow presently as one who learn to navigate still water near shore long for more thrilling voyage i try the grassy old road in the wood where young tree and other growth be to be find in great variety : and have a joy of it i can not describe for old and familiar place be thus make new and wonderful to I and when i think of those place now say in winter i grasp they more vividly and strongly than ever i do before for i think not only how they look but how they taste and smell and i even know many of the grow thing by the touch of they it be certain that we grasp of life be in direct proportion to the variety and warmth of the way in which we lay hold of it no think no beauty and no joy on these excursion i have often reflect that if i be blind i should still find here unexplored joy of life and should make it a point to know all the friendly tree and shrub around about by the taste or smell or touch of they i think seriously that this method of widen the world of the blind and increase they narrower joy might well be develop though it would be wise for such as do take it to borrow first the eye of a friend to see that no poison ivy which certain rascally bird plant along we fence and hedge be lurk about save for this precaution i know of nothing that will injure the taster though he must be prepare here and there for shock and thrill of bitterness a lilac leaf for example and to a scarcely lesser degree the willow and the poplar be when bite through of a penetrate and intense bitterness but do no harm and will daunt no one who be really adventurous there be yet to be write a botany or better yet a book of nature for the blind it be by know human being that we come to understand they and by understand they come to love they and so it be with the green people when i be a boy in the wild north country tree be enemy to be ruthlessly fight -- to be cut down sawed split burn -- anything to be rid of they the ideal in make a home place be to push the forest as far away from it as possible but now when i go to the wood it be like go among old and treasured friend and with riper acquaintance the tree come to take on curiously a kind of personality so that i be much fonder of some tree than of other and instinctively seek out the companionship of certain tree in certain mood as one will he friend i love the unfold beech in spring and the pine in winter the elm i care for afar off like great aloof man whom i can admire but for friendly confidence give I a apple tree in a old green meadow -lrb- illustration : for friendly confidence give I a apple tree in a old green meadow -rrb- in this more complete understanding i have be much aid by get hold of my friend of the hedge and hill in the new way i have describe at time i even feel that i have become a fully accept member of the fraternity of the living earth for i have already receive many of the benefit which go with that association and i know now for a certainty that it make no objection to its member because they be old or sad or have sin but welcome they all alike the essential taste of the cherry and peach and all they numerous relative be in variation that of the peach pit so that the whole tribe may be easily recognize though it be some time before i could tell with certainty the peach from the cherry the oak shoot when chew a little taste exactly like the smell of new oak lumber the maple have a peculiar taste and smell of its own that i can find no comparison for and the poplar be one of the bitterest tree that ever i have taste the tree -- pine spruce hemlock balsam cedar -- be to I about the pleasantest of all both in taste and odour and though the spruce and pine taste and smell much alike at first one soon learn to distinguish they the elm have a rather agreeable nondescript bitterish taste but the linden be gummy and of a mediocre quality like the tree itself which i dislike some of the sweetest flowering shrub such as the lilac have the bitterest of leaf and twig or like certain kind of clemati have a seed that when green be sharper than cayenne pepper while other like the rose be pleasanter in flavor the ash tree be not too bitter and a little sour i give here only a few of the commoner example for i wish to make this no tedious catalogue of the flavor of the green people i be not a scientist nor would wish to be take for one only last winter i have my pretension sadly shock when i taste twig cut from various tree and shrub and try to identify they by taste or by smell and while it be a please experiment i find i could not certainly place above half of they partly no doubt because many grow thing keep they flavor well wrap up in winter no i have not go far upon this pleasant road but neither be i in any great hurry for there yet remain much time in this and my future life to conquer the secret of the earth i plan to devote at least one entire life to science and may find i need several one great reason why the sense of taste and the sense of smell have not the same honor as the sense of sight or of hearing be that no way have yet be find to make a true art of either for sight we have painting sculpture photography architecture and the like and for hear music and for both poetry and the drama but the other sens be more purely personal and have not only be little study or think about but be the one least develop and most dim and clog by the custom of we life for the sense of smell we have indeed the perfumer 's art but a poor rudimentary art it be give little freedom for the artist who would draw he inspiration freshly from nature i can indeed describe poorly in word the odour of this June morning -- the mingled lilac late wild cherry new-broken soil and the fragrance of the sun on green verdure for there be here both lyrical and symphonic odour -- but how inadequate it be i can tell you what i feel and smell and taste and give you perhaps a desire another spring to spend the month of may and June in the country but i can scarcely make you live again the very moment of life i have live which be the magic quality of the best art the art of the perfumer which like all crude art thrive upon blatancy do not make we go to garden or love the rose but often instil in we a kind of artificiality so that perfume so far from be a inspiration to we increase we life become often the badge of the abnormal use by those unsatisfied with simple clean natural thing and as a people deficient in musical art delight in ragtime tune so a people deficient in the true art of tasting and smell delight in ragtime odour and ragtime taste i do not know that the three so-called lesser sens will ever be organize to the point where they be serve by well-established art but this i do know -- that there be three great way of enter upon a better understanding of this magic earth which be now neglect i think we have come upon hasty and heated day and be too much master by the god of hurry and the swift and greedy eye we accept flash picture of life for life itself we rush here and rush there and have arrive rush away again -- to what sensible purpose be still a little be still i do not mean by stillness stagnation not yet lazy contentment but life more deeply think about more intensely realize a activity so concentrate that it be quiet be still then so it be that though i be no worshipper of the old i think the older gardener have in some way a better practice of the art than we have for they plant not for the eye alone but for the nose and the sense of taste and even in grow such plant as the lamb 's tongue to gratify curiously the sense of touch they love the scented herb and appropriately call they simple some of these old simple i be greatly fond of and like to snip a leaf as i go by to smell or taste but many of they i here confess have for I a rank and culinary odour -- as sage and thyme and the bold scarlet monarda sometimes call bergamot but if they actual fragrance be not always please and they use be now grow obscure i love well the name of many of they -- whether from ancient association or because the word themselves fall pleasantly upon the ear as for example sweet marjoram and dill anise and summer savoury lavender and sweet basil coriander caraway cumin and there be rosemary that be for remembrance pray you love remember there be fennel for you and columbine : there be rue for you : and here be some for I -- all sweet name that one love to roll under he tongue i have not any great number of these herb in my own garden but when i go among those i do have i like to call they by they familiar name as i would a dignified doctor or professor if ever i know he well enough it be in this want of balance and quietude that the age fail most we be all for action not at all for reflection we think there be easy way to knowledge and shortcut to perfection we be for law rather than for life and this remind I inevitably of a mellow-spirited old friend who live not a thousand mile from here -- i must not tell he name -- whose greatest word be proportion at this moment as i write i can hear the roll of he resonant old voice on the syllable p-o-r -- prop-o-rtion he be the kind of man good to know and to trust if ever i bring he a hard problem as indeed i delight to do it be a fine thing to see he square himself to meet it a light come in he eye he draw back he chin a little and exclaim occasionally : well -- well he will have all the fact and circumstance fully mobilize stand up side by side before he like a awkward squad and there be nothing more awkward than some fact that have to stand out squarely in daylight and he inquire into they ancestry make they run out they tongue and poke they once or twice in the rib to make sure that they be lively and robust fact capable of make a good fight for they life he never like to see any one thing too large as a church a party a reform a new book or a new fashion lest he see something else too small but will have everything as he say in true proportion if he occasionally favor a little that which be old solid well-placed it be scarcely to be measure to he as a fault in a age so overwhelmed with the shiny new he be a fine up-standing hearty old gentleman with white hair and rosy cheek and the bright eye of one who have live all he life with temperance one incident i can not resist tell though it have nothing directly to do with this story but it will let you know what kind of a man my old friend be and when all be say it would be a fine thing to know about any man not long ago he be afflict with a serious loss a loss that would have crush some man but when i meet he not long afterward though the line around he eye be grow deeper he greet I in he old serene courtly manner when i would have comfort he with my sympathy for i feel myself near enough to speak of he loss he reply calmly : how can we know whether a thing be evil until we reach the end of it it may be good one of the event i esteem among the finest of the whole year be my old friend 's birthday party every winter on the twenty-sixth of February a party of he friend drop in to see he some of we go out of habit draw by we affection for the old gentleman other i think he invite for he know to perfection the delicate shading of companionship which divide those who come unbidden from those not less loved but shyer who must be summon now this birthday gathering have one historic ceremony which none of we would miss because it express so completely the essence of we friend 's generous and tolerant but just nature he be as i have say a temperate man and dislike as much as any one i know the whole alcohol business but live in a community where the struggle for temperance have often be wage intemperately and where there be a lurk belief that cudgel law can make man virtuous he publish abroad once a year he declaration of independence after we have be with we friend for a hour or so and be well warm and happy with the occasion he rise solemnly and go to the toby-closet at the end of he generous fireplace where the apple-log specially cut for the occasion be burn merrily and as we all fall silent know well what be come he unlock the door and take from the shelf a bottle of old peach brandy which have uncork he gravely smell of and possibly let he nearest neighbor smell of too then he bring from the sideboard a server set with diminutive glass that have be polish until they shine for the great occasion and have fill they all with the ripe liquor he pass they around to each of we we have all rise and be becomingly solemn as he now propose the toast of the year -- and it be always the same toast : here be to moderation -- in all thing he take a sip or two and continue : here be to temperance -- the queen of the virtue so we all drink off we glass we mellow old friend smack he lip cork the tall bottle and return it to he toby-closet where it repose undisturbed for another year and now gentleman he say heartily let we go in to dinner as i think of it now that it be write this story bear no very close relationship to my original subject and yet it seem to follow naturally enough as i set it down and to belong with the simple and well-flavoured thing of the garden and field and recall the advice of cobbett to he nephew on the art of write never to alter a thought for that which have come of itself into you mind be likely to pass into that of another more readily and with more effect than anything which you can by reflection invent i leave it here just as i write it hope that the kinship of my genial old friend with simple and natural and temperate thing may plainly appear chapter v place of retirement good god how sweet be all thing here how beautiful the field appear how cleanly do we feed and lie lord what good hour do we keep how quietly we sleep charle cotton -lrb- a friend of izaak walton -rrb- _ April 29th _ i have be spend a Sunday of retirement in the wood i come out with a strange deep sense of depression and though i know it be myself and not the world that be sad yet i could not put it away from I as i write the wood seem full of voice the little rustling of leave the minute sound of twig chafe together the cry of frog from the swamp so steady and monotonous that it scarcely arrest attention of odour a-plenty just behind I so that by turn my head i can see into they cool green depths be a number of hemlock tree the breath of which be incalculably sweet all the earth the very earth itself have a good rich grow odour pleasant to smell these thing have be here a thousand year a million year and yet they be not stale but be ever fresh ever serene ever here to loosen one 's crabbed spirit and make one quietly happy it seem to I i could not live if it be not possible often to come thus alone to the wood on later walk i discover that here and there on warm southern slope the dog-tooth violet be really in bloom and world of hepatica both lavender and white among the brown leave one of the notable sight of the hillside at this time of the year be the striped maple the long wand rise straight and chaste among thicket of less-striking young birch and chestnut and have a bud of a delicate pink -- a marvel of minute beauty a little trail arbutus i find and renew my joy with one of the most exquisite odour of all the spring solomon 's seal thrust up vivid green cornucopia from the lifeless earth and often near a root or stone the red partridge berry among they bright leave the laurel on the hill be sharply visible especially when among deciduous tree and along the old brown road be patch of fresh wintergreen in a cleft of the hill near the top of norwottuck though the day be warm i find a huge snowbank -- the last held trench of old winter the last guerilla of the cold drive to the fastness of the hill i have enjoy this day without try after the first hour or so of it all the worry drop away all the ambition all the twisted thought -- it be strange how much thrilling joy there be in the discovery of the ages-old miracle of return life in the wood : each green adventurer each fragrant joy each bird-call -- and the feel of the soft warm sunshine upon one 's back after month of winter on any term life be good the only woe the only great woe be the woe of never have be bear sorrow yes failure yes weakness yes the sad loss of dear friend -- yes but oh the good god : i still live be alone without feeling alone be one of the great experience of life and he who practise it have acquire a infinitely valuable possession people fly to crowd for happinesss not know that all the happiness they find there they must take with they thus they divert and distract that within they which create power and joy until by fly always away from themselves seek satisfaction from without rather than from within they become infinitely boresome to themselves so that they can scarcely bear a moment of they own society but if once a man have a taste of true and happy retirement though it be but a short hour or day now and then he have find or be begin to find a sure place of refuge of bless renewal toward which in the busiest hour he will find he thought wistfully steal how stoutly will he meet the buffet of the world if he know he have such a place of retirement where all be well-ordered and full of beauty and right counsel prevail and true thing be note as a man grow older if he cultivate the art of retirement not indeed as a end in itself but as a means of develop a richer and freer life he will find he reward grow surer and greater until in time none of the storm or shock of life any longer disturb he he might in time even reach the height attain by diogene of whom epictetus say it be not possible for any man to approach he nor have any man the means of lay hold upon he to enslave he he have everything easily loose everything only hang to he if you lay hold of he property he would rather have let it go and be yours than he would have follow you for it if you lay hold of he leg he would have let go he leg : if all of he body all he poor body he intimate friend country just the same for he know from whence he have they and from whom and on what condition the best partner of solitude be book i like to take a book with I in my pocket although i find the world so full of interesting thing -- sight sound odours -- that often i never read a word in it it be like have a value friend with you though you walk for mile without say a word to he or he to you : but if you really know you friend it be a curious thing how subconsciously you be aware of what he be think and feel about this hillside or that distant view and so it be with book it be enough to have this writer in you pocket for the very think of he and what he would say to these old field and pleasant tree be ever freshly delightful and he never interrupt at inconvenient moment nor intrude he thought upon yours unless you desire it i do not want long book and least of all story book in the wood -- these be for the library -- but rather scrap and extract and condensation from which thought can be pluck like flower and carry for a while in the buttonhole so it be that i be fond of all kind of anthology i have one entitle traveller 's joy another song of nature and i have lately find the best one i know call the spirit of man by robert bridge the english laureate other little book that fit well in the pocket on a tramp because they be truly companionable be ben jonson 's timber one of the very best and william penn 's fruit of solitude a anthology of elizabethan verse give I by a friend be also a good companion it be not a discourse or a narrative we want as we walk abroad but conversation neither do we want people or fact or story but a person so i open one of these little book and read therein the thoughtful remark of a wise companion this i may reply to or merely enjoy as i please i be in no hurry as i might be with a living companion for my book friend be long dead be not impatient and give I time to reply and be not resentful if i make no reply at all submit to such a test as this few writer old or new give continued profit or delight to be consider in the presence of the great and simple thing of nature or worn long in the warm place of the spirit a writer must have supreme quality of sense or humor a great sensitiveness to beauty or a genuine love of goodness -- but above all he must somehow give we the flavor of personality he must be a true companion of the spirit \* \* \* \* \* there be a exercise give to young soldier which consist in raise the hand slowly above the head take in a full breath at the same time and then let they down in such a way as to square the shoulder this leave the body erect the head high the eye straight ahead the lung full of good air it be the attitude that every man at arm should wish to take after a day in the wood i feel some such erectness of spirit a life of the head and a clearer and calmer vision for i have raise up my hand to the heaven and draw in the odour and sight and sound of the good earth \* \* \* \* \* one of the great joy of such time of retirement perhaps the greatest of the joy be the return freshen and sweeten to the common life how good then appear the thing of the garden and farm the house and shop that weariness have stale how good the face of friend chapter vi + no trespass + i live in a country of beautiful hill and in the last few year since i have be here with harriet i have make familiar and pleasant acquaintance with several of they one hill i know be precious to I for a peculiar reason upon the side of it along the town road be two or three old farm with lilac like tree about they doorway and ancient apple orchard with great gnarly branch and one have a old garden of hollyhock larkspur zinnia mignonette and i know not how many other old-fashioned flower wild grape there be along the neglect wall and in a corner of one of they by a brook a mass of sweet currant which in blossom time make all that bit of valley a bower of fragrance i have go that way often in spring for the sheer joy of the friendly odour i have across the ancient stone fence the largest and stoniest of the farm be own by a old man name howieson a strange brown-clad crooked crabbed old man i have see he often creep across he field with he horse a ineffective worker all he life long he have scarcely make a living from he stony acre he farm be tip up behind upon the hill and run below to the brook and the building be old and worn and a rocky road go by to the town once in more prosperous day before the factory take over the winter work of these hill farm the busy family finish shoe and weave cloth and plaited straw hat -- and one i know be famous for wooden bowl craftily hollow out of maple knot -- and the hill people rely upon they stony field for little more than they food but in these later day the farm industry be go the house be no longer overflow with child for there be nothing for child to do and those who remain be old or discourage some home have entirely disappear so that all that remain be a clump of lilac or a wild tangle of rise bush about a grass-covered or bush-grown cellar wall the last thing to disappear be not that which the old farmer most set they heart upon they fine house and barn or they cultivate field but the one touch of beauty they leave -- lilac clump or rose-tangle old howieson with that passion for the sense of possession which thrive best when the reality of possession be slip away have post all he field with warning against intrusion you may not enter this old field nor walk by this brook nor climb this hill for all this belong in fee simple to jame howieson -lrb- illustration : no trespass + jame howieson + -rrb- for a long time i do not meet jame howieson face to face though i have often see he sign and always with a curious sense of the futility of they i do not need to enter he field nor climb he hill nor walk by he brook but as the spring pass and the autumn whiten into winter i come into more and more complete possession of all those field that he so jealously post i look with strange joy upon he hill see April blossom in he orchard and may color the wild grape leave along he wall June i smell in the sweet vernal of he hay field and from the October of he maple and beech i gather rich crop and put up no hostile sign of ownership pay no tax worry over no mortgage and often marvel that he should be so poor within he post domain and i so rich without one who love a hill or a bit of valley will experiment long until he find the best spot to take he joy of it and this be no more than the farmer himself do when he experiment year after year to find the best acre for he potato he corn he oats he hay intensive cultivation be as important in these wider field of the spirit as in any other if i consider the thing that i hear and see and smell and the thought that go with they or grow out of they as really valuable possession contribute to the wealth of life i can not see why i should not willingly give to they a tenth or a hundredth part of the energy and think i give to my potato or my blackberry or to the write i do i choose a place in a field just below old howieson 's farm where there be a thorn-apple tree to sit or lie under from the thorn-apple tree by turn my head in one direction i can look up at the crown of the hill with its green hood of oak and maple and chestnut and high above it i can see the cloud float in the deep sky or if i turn my head the other way for i be a kind of monarch there on the hill and command the world to delight I i can look off across the pleasant valley with its spreading field and farmstead set about with tree and the town slumbering by the riverside i come often with a little book in one pocket to read from and a little book in the other to write in but i rarely use either the one or the other for there be far too much to see and think about from this spot i make excursion round about and have have many strange and interesting adventure : and now find thought of mine like lichen upon all the boulder and old wall and oak tree of that hillside sometimes i climb to the top of the hill if i be in a leisurely mood i walk lawfully around old howieson 's farm by a kind of wood lane that lead to the summit but often i cross he wall all regardless of he trespass sign and go that way to the top -lrb- illustration : it be on one of these lawless excursion in old howieson 's field that i first saw that strange old fellow -rrb- it be on one of these lawless excursion in old howieson 's field that i first saw that strange old fellow who be know hereabout as the herbman i come upon he so suddenly that i stop short curiously startle as one be startle at find anything human that seem less than human he be kneel there among the low verdure of a shallow valley and look like a old gray rock or some prehistoric animal i stop to look at he but he pay no heed and seem only to shrink into himself as though if he keep silent he might be take for stock or stone i address he but he make no answer i go nearer with a sensation of uncanny wonder but he do not so much as glance up at I though he know i be there he old brown basket be near he and the cane beside it he be gather pennyroyal another man who be take a unexpected crop from old howieson 's acre i think to myself i watch he for some moment quite still as one might watch a turtle or a woodchuck -- and leave he there since then i have hear something about he and see he once or twice a strange old man a wanderer upon the face of the fragrant earth spring and summer he wear always a old overcoat and carry a basket with double cover very much worn and brown with usage he cane be of hickory with a crooked root for a handle this also shiny with age he gather bitter-bark tansy ginseng calamus smartweed and slippery elm and from along old fence and barnyard catnip and boneset i suppose he live somewhere a hole in a log or the limb of a tree but no one know where it be or how he dry or cure he finding no one know he name : perhaps he have forget it himself a name be no great matter anyway he be call simply the herbman he drift into we valley in the spring be see here and there on the hill or in the field like the crow or the blackbird and disappear in the fall with the robin and the maple leave perhaps he be one of those favor soul to whom life be all spring and summer the age have pass he by and except for certain furtive old woman few care now for he sovereign remedy i meet he once in the town road and he stop humbly without lift he eye and open he basket let out into the air such a fragrance of ancient simple as i never smell before he say nothing at all but take out dry bundle of catnip sassafras slippery elm to show I he have also pennyroyal for healing tea and calamus and bitter-bark for misery i select a choice assortment of he wares to take home to harriet but could get he to name no price he take what i give without objection and without thanks and go he way a true man of the hill as i say i come often to the field below old howieson 's farm i think the old man see I come and go for the road wind along the side of the hill within sight of he house skirt a bit of wood and with a unexpected turn come out triumphantly to the top of the ridge beyond at the turn of the road i always disappear for i cross the wall into the field below old howieson 's farm and mysteriously fail to appear to the watchful eye upon the ridge beyond what could be more provoke or suspicious to go in at one end of a well-travelled road and not to come out in the regular and expected way at the other or to be suspect of not be deferential toward trespass sign or observant of closed way how disturbing to all those who dwell tremulously within post enclosure of whatever sort or those who base they sense of possession upon stumped paper or take they god from a book man have be crucify for less sooner or later those who cross boundary clash with those who defend boundary : and those who adventure offend those who seek security but it be a long time before i come face to face with old man howieson this be the way of it : well back of howieson 's building and reach upward upon the face of the hill stretch a long and narrow field a kind of barren back pasture with boulder in it and gnarly hawthorn tree and a stunt wild apple or so a stone fence run down one side of the clear land and above it rise the hill it be like a great trough or ravine which upon still spring evening gather in all the varied odour of old howieson 's farm and orchard and bring they down to I as i sit in the field below i need no book then nor sight of the distant town nor song of bird for i have a singular and incomparable album of the good odour of the hill this be one reason why i choose this particular spot in the field for my own and it have give I a secret name for the place which i will not here disclose if ever you should come this way in may my friend i might take you there of a evening but could warrant you no joy of it that you yourself could not take but you need not come here or go there but stop where you be at this moment and i here assure you that if you look up and look in you also will see something of the glory of the world one evening i have be upon the hill to seek again the pattern and dimension of my tabernacle and to receive anew the table of the jaw i have cross old howieson 's field so often that i have almost forget it be not my own it be indeed mine by the same inalienable right that it belong to the crow that fly across it or to the partridge that nested in its covert or the woodchuck that live in its wall or the squirrel in its chestnut tree it be mine by the final test of all possession -- that i could use it he come out of a thicket of hemlock like a wraith of the past a gray and crabbed figure and confront I there in the wide field i suppose he think he have catch I at last i be not at all startle or even surprise for as i look back upon it now i know that i have always be expect he indeed i feel a lift of the spirit the kind of jauntiness with which one meet a crucial adventure he stand there for a moment quite silent a grim figure of denial and i face he you be on my land sir he say i answer he instantly and in a way wholly unexpected to myself : you be breathe my air sir he look at I dully but with a curious glint of fear in he eye fear and anger too do you see the sign down there this land be post yes i say i have see you sign but let I ask you : if i be not here would you own this land any more than you do now would it yield you any better crop it be never the way of those who live in post enclosure of whatever sort to reason they assert this land be post say the old man doggedly be you sure you own it i ask be it really yours my father own this farm before I he say and my grandfather clear this field and build these wall i be bear in that house and have live there all my life well then i must be go -- and i will not come here again i say i be sorry i walk on you land -- i start to go down the hill but stop and say as though it be a afterthought : i have make some wonderful discovery upon you land and that hill there you do not seem to know how valuable this field be good-bye with that i take two or three step down the hill -- but feel the old man 's hand on my arm say mister he ask be you one of the electric company man be that high-tension line comin ' across here no i say it be something more valuable than that i walk onward a few step as though i be quite determine to get out of he field but he follow close behind I it be not the new trolley line be it no i say it be not the trolley line what be it then in that question eager and shrill speak the dry soul of the old man the lifelong hope that he clinging ownership of those barren acre would bring he from the outside some miraculous profit he whole bearing have change he have cease to be truculent or even fearful but be now shrilly beseech a great wave of compassion come over I i be sorry for he imprison there within the wall of he own making and expect wealth from the outside when there be wealth in plenty within and everywhere about he but how could i help he you can give no valuable thing to any man who have not the vision to take it if i have tell he what i find upon he hill or in he field he would have think I -- well crazy or he would have suspect that under cover of such a quest i hide some evil design as well talk adventure to a old party man or growth to a set churchman so i leave he there within he wall so often when we think we be bar other people out we be only bar ourselves in the last i saw of he as i turn into the road be a gray and crabbed figure standing alone look after I and not far off he own sign : -lrb- illustration : no trespass jame howieson -rrb- sometime i think this old farm will be own by a man who be also capable of possess it more than one such place i know already have be take by those who value the beauty of the hill and the old wall and the boulder-strewn field one i know be really possess by a man who long ago have a vision of sheep feeding on field too infertile to produce profitable crop and many other have be take by man who see forest grow where forest ought to grow for real possession be not a thing of inheritance or of document but of the spirit and pass by vision and imagination sometimes indeed the trespass sign stand long -- so long that we grow impatient -- but nature be in no hurry nature wait and presently the trespass sign rot away one arm fall off and lo where the adventurer find only denial before he be now invite to -- pass the old wall be conquer by the wild cherry and purple ivy and blackberry bush and the old howieson sleep in calm forgetfulness of they rights upon the hill they think they possess and all that be leave be a touch of beauty -- lilac clump and wild-rose tangle chapter vii look at the world give I to struggle with weather and wind give I to stride through the snow give I the feel of the chill on my cheek and the glow and the glory within _ march 17th _ the joy of winter : the downright joy of winter i tramped to-day through mile of open snow-clad country i slip in the rut of the road or plough through the drift in the field with such a sense of adventure as i can not describe day before yesterday we have a heavy north wind with stinging gust of snow yesterday fall bright and cold with snow lie fine and crumbly like sugar to the east of the house where i shovel a path the heap be nearly as high as my shoulder this perfect morning a faint purplish haze be upon all the hill with bright sunshine and still cold air through which the chimney smoke rise straight upward hungry crow flap across the field or with unaccustomed daring settle close in upon the manure heap around the barn all the hillside glisten and sparkle like cloth of gold each glass knob on the telephone pole be like a resplendent jewel and the long morning shadow of the tree lie blue upon the snow horse ' foot crunch upon the road as the early farmer go by with milk for the creamery -- the frosty breath of each driver flutter aside like a white scarf through the still air ordinary voice cut sharply and clearly and a laugh bound out across the open country with a kind of superabundance of joy i see two man beat they arm as they follow they wood sled they be banter one another noisily i see a man shovel snow from he barn door as each shovelful rise and scatter the sun catch it for a instant and it fall a silvery shower i tramped to-day through mile of it : and whether in broken road or spotless field have great joy of it it be good to stride through oppose drift and to catch the tingling air upon one 's face the spring be beautiful indeed and one be happy at autumn but of all the year no other morning set the blood to race like these none give a greater sense of youth strength or of the general goodness of the earth give I the winter : give I the winter not all winter but just winter enough just what nature send dry air in the throat so cold at first as to make one cough and dry sharp tingling air in the nostril frost on beard and eyebrow cheek red and crusty so that to wrinkle they hurt : but all the body within aglow with warmth and health twice the ordinary ozone in the air so that one wish to whistle or sing and if the finger grow chill what be shoulder for but to beat they around \* \* \* \* \* it be a strange and yet familiar experience how all thing present they opposite do you enjoy the winter you neighbor loathe or fear it do you enjoy life to you friend it be a sorrow and a heaviness even to you it be not always alike though the world itself be the same to-day as it be yesterday and will be to-morrow -- the same snowy field and polar hill the same wintry star the same infinitely alluring variety of people -- yet to-day you that be a god have become a grieving child even at moment when we be well please with the earth we often have a wistful feeling that we should conceal it lest it hurt those bear down by circumstance too great or too sad for they what be there to offer one who can not respond gladly to the beauty of the field or open he heart widely to the beckoning of friend and we ask ourselves : have i be try as this man have would i be happy then have i be wring with sorrow wear down by ill-health buffet with injustice as this man have would i be happy then i see on my walk to-day a old woman with a cross shawl upon she breast creep out painfully to feed she hen she live on a small ill-kept farm i have know for year she be old and poor and asthmatic and the cold bite through she with the sharpness of knife the path to the hen-house be a kind of via dolorosa a terror of slipperiness and cold she might avoid it : she son worthless as he be might do it for she but she cling to it as she cling to she life it be the last reason for stay here but the white field and drift road be never joyfully meet never desire she spend half the summer dread the return of winter from the severity of which she can not escape nor be it all mere poverty though she be poor for there be those who would help to send she away but she will not go she be wrap about with old terror ancient tyranny -- that terror of the unknown which be more painful even than the terror of the know : those tyranny of habit and of place which so often and so ruthlessly rule the life of the old she cling desperately to the few people she know -lrb- ` tis hard to die among stranger -rrb- and the custom she have follow all she life against the stark power of she tragic helplessness neither the good nor the great of the earth may prevail this reality too i have a curious experience not long ago : one of those experience which light up as in a flash some of the fundamental thing of life i meet a man in the town road whom i have come to know rather more than slightly he be a man of education and have be well-off in the country sense be still so far as i know but he have a sardonic outlook upon life he be discourage about human nature think that politics be rotten and that the price of potato and bread be disgraceful the state of the nation and of the world be quite beyond temperate expression few ray of joy seem to illuminate he pathway as we approach in the town road i call out to he : good morning he pause and to my surprise respond : be you happy it have not occur to I for some time whether i be happy or not so i reply : i do not know why do you ask he look at I in a question and i think rather indignant way why should not a man be happy i press he why _ should _ he be answer I that he respond why should he be look at the world with that he pass onward with a kind of crush dignity i have laugh since when i have recall the tone of he voice as he say look at the world gloomy and black it be it evidently make he indignant to be here but at the moment he bitter query the essential attitude of spirit which lay behind it strike into I with a poignancy that stop I where i stand be i then all wrong about the world i actually have a kind of fear lest when i should look up again i should find the earth grow wan and bleak and unfriendly so that i should no longer desire it look at the world i say aloud and with that i suddenly look all around I and it be a strange deep thing as i have think of it since how the world come back upon I with a kind of infinite calm assurance as beautiful as ever it be there be the hill and the field and the great still tree -- and the open sky above and even as i look down the road and see my sardonic old friend plod through the snow -- he very back frown -- i have a sense that he belong in the picture too -- and could not help himself that he even have a kind of grace and give a human touch to that wintry scene he have probably say a great deal more than he mean _ look at the world _ well look at it chapter viii a good apple i be make immortal by apprehend my possession of incorruptible goods i have just have one of the pleasant experience of life from time to time these brisk winter day i like to walk across the field to horace 's farm i take a new way each time and make nothing of the snow in the field or the drift along the fence why ask harriet do you insist on struggle through the snow when there be a good beaten road around harriet i say why should any one take a beaten road when there be new and adventurous way to travel when i cross the field i never know at what moment i may come upon some strange or surprising experience what new sight i may see what new sound i may hear and i have the further great advantage of appear unexpectedly at horace 's farm sometimes i enter by the cow lane sometimes by way of the old road through the wood-lot or i appear casually like a gust of wind around the corner of the barn or i let horace discover I lean with fold arm upon he cattle fence i have come to love do this for unexpectedness in visitor as in religion and politics be disturb to horace and as sand-grits in oyster produce pearl my unexpected appearance have more than once astonished new thought in horace or yield pearly bit of native humor ever since i have know he horace have be rather high-and-mighty with I but i know he enjoy my visit for i give he always i think a pleasantly renew sense of he own superiority when he see I he eye light up with the comfortable knowledge that he can plough so much better than i can that he corn grow taller than mine and he hen lay more egg he be a wonderfully practical man be horace hard-headed they call it here and he never feel so superior i think as when he find I sometimes of a Sunday or a evening walk across the field where my land join he or sit on a stone fence or lie on my back in the pasture under a certain friendly thorn-apple tree this he find it difficult to understand and think it highly undisciplined impractical no doubt reprehensible one incident of the sort i shall never forget it be on a June day only a year or so after i come here and before horace know I as well as he do now i have climb the hill to look off across he own high-field pasture where the white daisy the purple fleabane and the buttercup make a wild tangle of beauty among the tall herd 's grass light air move billow across the field bobolink and meadow lark be singing and all about be the old fence each with its wild hedgerow of choke cherry young elm and black raspberry bush and beyond across mile and mile of sunny green countryside the mysterious blue of the ever-changing hill it be a spot i love then and have love more deeply every year since horace find I sit on the stone fence which there divide we possession i think he have be observe I with amusement for some time before i see he for when i look around he face wear a comfortably superior half-disdainful smile david say he what ye doin ' here harvest my crop i say he look at I sharply to see if i be joke but i be perfectly sober harvestin ' yer crop yes i say the fancy grow suddenly upon I and just now i have be take a crop from the field you think you own i wave my hand to indicate he high-field pasture do not i own it no horace i be sorry to say not all of it to be frank with you since i come here i have quietly acquire a undivided interest in that land i may as well tell you first as last i be like you horace i be reach out in all direction i speak in as serious a voice as i could command : the tone i use when i sell potato horace 's smile wholly disappear a city feller like I be capable of anything how 's that he exclaim sharply what do you mean that field come down to I from my grandfather jamieson i continue to look at horace with great calmness and gravity judge from what i now know of you title horace say i neither you grandfather jamieson nor you father ever own all of that field and i have now acquire that part of it in fee simple that neither they nor you ever really have at this horace begin to look seriously worried the idea that any one could get away from he anything that he possess especially without he knowledge be terrible to he what do you mean mr grayson he have be call I david but he now return sharply to mister in we country when we mister a friend something serious be about to happen it be the signal for general mobilization i continue to look horace rather coldly and severely in the eye yes say i i have acquire a share in that field which i shall not soon surrender a unmistakable dogged look come into horace 's face the look inherit from generation of land-owning home-defending fighting ancestor horace be new england of new england yes i say i have already have two or three crop from that field huh say horace i have cut the grass and i have cut the rowen every year since you bin here what be more i have get the money fer it in the bank he tap he finger on the top of the wall nevertheless horace say i i have get my crop also from that field and a steady income too what crop well eve just now be gather in one of they what do you think of the value of the fleabane and the daisy and the yellow five-finger in that field huh say horace well i have just be crop they and have you observe the wind in the grass -- and those shadow along the southern wall be not they valuable huh say horace i have rarely see anything more beautiful i say than this field and the view across it -- i be take that crop now and later i shall gather in the rowen of goldenrod and aster and the red and yellow of the maple tree -- and store it all away in _ my _ bank -- to live on next winter it be some time before either of we speak again but i could see from the corner of my eye that mighty thing be go on inside of horace and suddenly he break out into a big laugh and clap he knee with he hand in a way he have be that all say horace i think it only confirm he in the light esteem in which he hold I though i show he unmeasured wealth in he own field ungathered crop of new enjoyment he be unwilling to take they but be content with hay it be a strange thing to I and a sad one how many of we farmer -lrb- and be it say in a whisper other people too -rrb- own they land without ever really possess they : and let the most precious crop of the good earth go to waste after that for a long time horace love to joke I about my crop and he a joke with horace be a durable possession s ` pose you think that be you field he would say the best part of it i would return but you can have all i have take and there 'll still be enough for both of we you be a queer one he would say and then add sometimes dryly but there be one crop ye do not git david and he would tap he pocket where he carry he fat worn leather pocket-book and as fer feelin 's it can not be beat so many people have the curious idea that the only thing the world desire enough to pay its hard money for be that which can be see or eat or worn but there never be a greater mistake while man will haggle to the penny over the price of hay or fight for a cent more to the bushel of oats they will turn out they very pocket for strange intangible joy hope thought or for a moment of peace in a feverish world the unknown great possession so it be that one day some month afterward when we have be thus banter each other with great good humor i say to he : horace how much do you get for you hay this year off that one little piece he reply i figger fifty-two dollar well horace say i i have beat you i get more out of it this year than you do oh i know what you mean -- no horace you do not this time i mean just what you do : money cash dollar how 's that now well i write a little piece about you field and the wind in the grass and the hedge along the fence and the weed among the timothy and the fragrance of it all in June and sell it last week -- i lean over toward horace and whisper behind my hand -- in just the way he tell I the price he get for he pig what he exclaim horace have long know that i be a kind of literary feller but he face be now a study in astonishment _ what _ horace scratch he head as he be accustom to do when puzzle with one finger just under the rim of he hat well i vum say he here i have be wander all around horace 's barn -- in the snow -- get at the story i really start to tell which probably support horace 's conviction that i be a impractical and unsubstantial person if i have the true business spirit i should have go by the beaten road from my house to horace 's borrow the singletree i go for and hurry straight home life be so short when one be after dollar i should not have wallow through the snow nor stop at the top of the hill to look for a moment across the beautiful wintry earth -- gray sky and bare wild tree and frosted farmstead with homely smoke rise from the chimney -- i should merely have bring home a singletree -- and miss the glory of life as i reflect upon it now i believe it take I no longer to go by the field than by the road and i have get the singletree as securely with I as though i have not look upon the beauty of the eternal hill nor reflect as i tramped upon the strange way of man oh my friend be it the settle rule of life that we be to accept nothing not expensive it be not so settle for I that which be freest cheapest seem somehow more valuable than anything i pay for that which be give better than that which be buy that which pass between you and I in the glance of a eye a touch of the hand be better than mint money i find horace upon the march day i speak of just come out of he new fruit cellar horace be a progressive and energetic man a leader in this community and the first to have a modern fruit cellar by this mean he minister profitably to that appetite of man which crave most sharply that which be hardest to obtain : he supply the world with apple in march it be a mild and sunny day the door of the fruit cellar be open and as i come around the corner i have such of whiff of fragrance as i can not describe it seem as though the vial of the earth 's most precious odour have be break there in horace 's yard the smell of ripe apple in the dusky depths of the cellar down three step i could see horace 's ruddy face how be ye david say he will ye have a good apple so he give I a good apple it be a yellow bellflower without a blemish and very large and smooth the body of it be waxy yellow but on the side where the sun have touch it it blush a delicious deep red since October it have be in the dark cool storage-room and horace like some old monkish connoisseur of wine who know just when to bring up the bottle of a certain vintage have choose the exact moment in all the year when the vintage of the bellflower be at its best as he pass it to I i catch a scent as of old crushed apple blossom or fancy i do or it may have be the still finer aroma of friendship which pass at the touch of we finger it be a hand-filling apple and likewise good for tired eye a antidote for winter a remedy for sick soul a wonderful apple i say to horace hold it off at arm 's length no better grow anywhere say he with scarcely restrained pride i take my delight of it more nearly and the odour be like new-cut clover in a old orchard or strawberry leave freshly tread upon or the smell of peach wood at the summer pruning -- how shall one describe it at least a compound or essence of all the good odour of summer shall i eat it i ask myself for i think such a perfection of nature should be preserve for the blessing of mankind as i hesitate horace remark : it be grow to be eat so i bit into it a big liberal mouthful which come away with a rend sound such as one hear sometimes in a winter 's ice-pond the flesh within all dewy with moisture be like new cream except a rim near the surface where the skin have be break here it be of a clear deep yellow new odour come forth and i know for the first time how perfect in deliciousness such a apple could be a mild serene ripe rich bouquet compound essence of the sunshine from these old massachusett hill of moisture draw from we grudging soil of all the peculiar virtue of a land where the summer make up in the passion of growth for the long violence of winter the compensatory aroma of a life triumphant though hedge about by severity be in the bouquet of this perfect bellflower like some of the finest of wine and the warmest of friend it be of two flavor and be not to be eat for mere nourishment but be to be taste and enjoy the first of the flavor come readily in a sweetness richness a slight acidity that it might not cloy but the deeper more delicate flavor come later -- if one be not crudely impatient -- and be indeed the very soul of the fruit one do not quickly arrive at soul either in apple or in friend and i say to horace with solemnity for this be a occasion not to be lightly treat : i have never in my life taste a fine apple there be no finer apple say horace with conviction with that we fall to discuss the kind and quality of all the apple grow this side china and give we more or less slighting opinion of ben davise and greening and russet and especially of trivial summer apple of all sort and come to the conclusion at last that it must have be just after god create this particular tree yield fruit that he desist from he day 's work and remark that what he see be good the record be silent upon the point and mose be not give to adjective but i have often wonder what he would have say if he have not only see the product of he creation but _ taste _ it i forget to say that when i would have slur the excellence of the baldwin in comparison with the bellflower horace begin at once to interpose objection and defend the excellence and perfection of that variety he have fifty barrel of baldwin in he cellar while we talk with much enjoyment of the lore of apple and apple-growing i finish the bellflower to the very core and say to horace as i reluctantly toss aside the stem and three seed : surely this have be one of the rare moment of life chapter ix i go to the city surely man be a wonderfull vaine diver and waver subject : it be very hard to \* ground and directly constant and uniforme judgement upon he though i live most of the time in the country as i love best to do sometimes i go to the city and find there much that be strange and amusing i like to watch the inward flow of the human tide in the morning and the ebb at evening and sometimes in the slack tide of noon i drift in one of the eddy where the restless life of the city pause a moment to refresh itself one of the eddy i like best of all be near the corner of madison square where the flood of twenty-third street swirl around the bulkhead of the metropolitan tower to meet the transverse current of madison avenue here of a bright morning when down-at-heel be generously warm himself on the park bench and old defeat watch young hurry stride by one have a royal choice of refreshment : a red-hot enfold in a bun from the dingy sausage wagon at the curb or a plum for a penny from the italian with the trundle cart or news of the world in lurid gulp from the noon edition of the paper -- or else a curious idea or so fling out stridently over the head of the crowd by a man on a soap box i love this corner of the great city i love the sense of the warm human tide flow all about I i love to look into the strange dark eager sensitive blunt face the other noon drift there in that human eddy i stop to listen to a small shabby man who stand in transitory eminence upon he soap box half he body reach above the knobby black soil of human head around he -- black knobby soil that he be seek there in the spring sunshine to plough with strange idea he have ruddy cheek and a tuft of curly hair set like a upholstery button on each side of he bald head the front tooth in he upper jaw be miss and as he open he mouth one could see the ample lining of red flannel he raise he voice penetratingly to overcome the noise of the world strain until the dark-corded vein of he throat stand out sharply and perspiration gleam on he bald forehead as though he life depend upon the delivery of he great message he be explain to that close-packed crowd that there be no god from time to time he offer for sale pamphlet by rg ingersoll and frederic harrison with grimy back number of a journal call the truth-seeker by the slant and timbre of he speech he be a englishman he have a gift of vigorous statement and meet questioner like a intellectual pugilist with skilful blow between the eye : and he grammar be bad i stand for some time listen to he while he prove with excellent logic base he reasoning on many learn authority that there be no god he audience cheer with glee he clever hit and hold up they hand for the book he have for sale who be this speaker i ask the elbow helper who come through the crowd to deliver the speaker 's wares and collect the silver for they who be this speaker who say there be no god henry moore he respond and who i ask be henry moore he be a englishman and be bring up a presbyterian -- but he see the light and no longer think there be any god nope and these book prove the same thing yep so i buy one of they think it wonderful that proof of so momentous a conclusion could be have for so small a sum this henry moore could fling argument like thunderbolt he could marshall he authority like a army he could talk against the roar of the city and keep he restless audience about he and if he do not believe in god he have complete faith in haeckel and jacque loeb and take at face value the lightest utterance of john stuart mill i enjoy listen to henry moore i enjoy look into the face all around I -- mostly keen foreign or half-foreign face and young face and idle face and curious face and face that drink in and face that disdainfully reject after a time however i grow unaccountably weary of the vehemence of henry moore and of the adroit helper who hawk he book and suddenly i look up into the clear noon blue of the ancient sky a pigeon be fly across the wide open space of the square the sunlight glint on its wing i see the quiet green top of the tree in the park and the statue of roscoe conkling turn a nonchalant shoulder toward the heated speaker who say there be no god how many strange idea contradictory argument curious logic have fall this last quarter century upon the stony ear of roscoe conkling far above I the metropolitan tower that wonder work of man lift itself grandly to the heaven and all about i suddenly hear and feel the roar and surge of the mighty city the mighty careless busy city thousand of people stir about I soul full of hot hope and mad desire unsatisfied longing unrealized ideal and i step out of the group who be gather around the man who say there be no god but i still drift in the eddy think how wonderful and strange all these thing be and come thus to another group close gather at the curb it be much smaller than the other and at the center stand a patriarchal man with a white beard and with he two woman he be lean against the iron railing of the park and several of the free-thinker 's audience freshly stuff with argument have engage he hotly just as i approach he draw from he pocket a worn leather-covered bible and say tap it with one finger : for forty year i have carry this book with I it contain more wisdom than any other book in the world you friend there can talk until he be hoarse -- it will do no harm -- but the world will continue to follow the wisdom of this book a kind of exaltation gleam in he eye and he speak with a earnestness equal to that of henry moore he too be a street speaker wait with he box at he side to begin he would soon be stand up there to prove also with logic and authority that there be a god he also would plough that knobby black soil of human head with the share of he vehement faith the two woman be with he to sing they belief and one have a basket to take up a collection and the other single I out as i listen with eagerness give I a print tract a kind of advertisement of god i look at the title of it it be call : god in he world do this prove that god be really in the world i ask yes she say will you read it yes i say i be glad to get it it be wonderful that so great a truth can he establish in so small a pamphlet and all for nothing she look at I curiously i think and i put the tract by the side of the pamphlet i have buy from the freethinker and drift again in the eddy the largest crowd of all be close pack about a swarthy young chap whose bushy hair wave in response to the violence of he oratory he too be perspire with he idea he have a marvellous staccato method of question and answer he would shoot a question like a rifle bullet at the head of he audience and then stiffen back like a wary boxer both clenched hand poise in a tremulous gesticulation and before any one could answer he bullet-like question he be answer it himself as i edge my way nearer to he i discover that he also have a little pile of book at he foot which a keen-eyed assistant be busily sell how well-established the technic of this art of the city eddy how well-studied the psychology i think this example the most perfect of they all and watch with eagerness the play of the argument as it be mirror in the intent face all about I and gradually i grow interested in what the man be say and thought of many good answer i could give to he questioning if he be not so cunning with answer of he own finally in the midst of one of he loftiest flight he demand hotly : be you not every one of you a slave of the capitalist class it be perfectly still for a second after he speak and before i know what i be do i respond : why no i be not it seem to astonish the group around I : white face turn my way but it would have be difficult to dash that swarthy young man he be as full of question as a porcupine be full of quill well sir say he if i can prove to you that you be a slave will you believe it no i say unless you make I feel like a slave too no man be a slave who do not feel slavish but i be no match for that astonishing young orator and he have the advantage over I of a soap box moreover at that moment the keen-eyed assistant never miss a opportunity offer I one of he little red book if you can read this without feel a slave he remark you be john d himself in disguise i buy he little red book and put it with the pamphlet of the freethinker and the tract of the god-fearing man and step out of that group feeling no more servile than when i go in and i say to myself : this surely be a curious place to be in for i be now strangely interested in these man of the eddy there be more god preach here i say than ever be know on the acropoli up the square a few pace i see a covered wagon with a dense crowd around it and in front of it upon a little platform which raise the speaker high above the head of the audience stand a woman speak with shrill ardor most of the hearer be man and she be tell they with logic and authority that the progress of civilization wait upon the vote of woman the army of the world stand still until the rear rank of its woman could be bring into line moral languish religion fade industry be brutalize home life destroy if only woman have they rights the world would at once become a beautiful and charming place oh she be a powerful and earnest speaker she make I desire above everything at the first opportunity to use my share of the power in this government to provide each woman with a vote and just as i have reach this compliant stage there come a girl smile and pass she little basket the sheer art of it so i drop in my coin and take the little leaflet she give I and put it side by side with the other literature of my accumulate library and so i come away from those hot little group with they perspire orator and feel again the charm of the tall building and the wide sunny square and the park with down-at-heel warm he ragged shank and the great city clang heedlessly by how serious they all be there in they eddy be there no god will woman suffrage or socialism cure all the evil of this mad world which ill as it be we would not be without be a belief for forty year in the complete wisdom of the book the final solution why do not all of the seek and suffer thousand flow by in twenty-third street stop here in the eddy to seek the solution of they woe the response to they hot desire so i come home to the country thinking of what i have see and hear ask myself what be the truth after all what _ be _ real and i be unaccountably glad to be at home again as i come down the hill through the town road the valley have a quiet welcome for I and the tree i know best and the pleasant field of corn and tobacco and the meadow ripe with hay i know of nothing more comforting to the question spirit than the sight of distant hill i find that bill have begin the hay cut i see he in the lower field as i come by in the road there he be station high on the load and john the pole be pitch on when he see I he lift one arm high in the air and wave he hand -- and i in return give he the sign of the free field harriet i say it seem to I i be never so glad before to get home it be what you always say she remark placidly this time it be true and i put the pamphlet i have accumulate in the city eddy upon the pile of document which i fully intend to read but rarely get to the heavenly comfort of a old shirt the joy of a old hat as i walk down quickly into the field with my pitchfork on my shoulder to help bill with the hay i be startle to see hang upon a peach tree at the corner of the orchard a complete suit of black clothes near it with the arm wave gently in the breeze be a white shirt and a black tie and at the foot of the tree a respectable black hat it be as though the peach tree have suddenly on that bright day go into mourning i laugh to myself bill i say what do this mean bill be a stout jolly chap with cheek that look after half a day 's haying like raw beef-steak he pause on he load smile broadly he straw hat set like a halo on the back of he head expect a funeral he say cheerfully bill be the undertaker 's assistant and be always on call in case of emergency what happen bill they think they would bury ` im this afternoon but they take a ' kep ' ` im over till to-morrow but you come prepared ya no time to go home in hayin ' the pump fer I and the black tog bill call the first raking of the hay tumble and the scatter re-raking which he despise he call scratching i take one side of the load and john the pole the other and we put on great forkful from the tumble which bill place skilfully at the corner and side of the load use the scratching for the center john the pole watch the load from below tank he too big here he would say or tank you put more there but bill tell mostly by the feel of the load under he foot or by the squareness of he eye john the pole be a big powerful fellow and after smooth down the load with he fork he do not bother to rake up the combing but gather a bunch of loose hay with he fork he push it by main strength and very quickly around the load and run he fork through the heap throw it upon the mountain-high load in a twinkling -- a admirable deft performance hay-making be a really beautiful process : the click mower cut its clean wide swath a man step after where the hay be very heavy to throw the windrow back a little then after lie to wilt and dry in the burning sun -- all full of good odour -- the horse-rake draw it neatly into wide billow and after that john the pole and i roll the billow into tumble or if the hay be slow in dry as it be not this year the kick tedder go over it spread it widely then the team and rack on the smooth-cut meadow and bill on the load and john and i pitch on and the talk and badinage that go on the excitement over disturbed field mouse the discussion of the best method of kill woodchuck tale of marvellous exploit of loader and stacker thrilling incident of the wet year of '98 when two man and one team save four acre of hay by work all night -- with lantern i jing -- much talk of how she go on she be the hay and no end of observation upon the character accomplishment fault and excess of the sedate old horse wait comfortably out in front half hide by the mountain of hay above they and nibble at the tumble as they go by then the proud moment when bill the driver with leg apart almost push on the rein drive he horse up the hill go it dick let ` er out daisy stiddy ol' boy whoa there ease down now hey there john block the wheel -- block the wheel i tell ye ah-h now je ' breathe a bit i jing it be hot and then the barn the cavernous dark door the hoof of the horse thunder on the floor the smell of cattle from below the pigeon in the loft whir startle from they perch then the hot scented dusty pitching off and mowing in -- a fine process a _ honest _ process : man sweating for what they get as i come in from the field that night the sun be low in the hill and a faint breeze have begin to blow sweetly cool after the burning heat of the day and i feel again that curious deep sense i have so often here in the country of the soundness and reality of the plain thing of life chapter x the old stone mason of well-flavoured man i know none better than those who live close to the soil or work in common thing man be like rose and lilac which too carefully cultivate to please the eye lose something of they native fragrance one of the best-flavoured man i know be my friend the old stone mason to-day i ride over with the old stone mason to select some wide stone for step in my new build the old man love stone all he life long -- he be now beyond seventy year old -- he have live among stone lift stone fit stone he know all the various kind shape size and where they will go best in a wall he can tell at a glance where to strike a stone to make it fit a particular place and out of a great pile he can select with a shrewd eye the stone for the exact opening he have to fill he will run he stubby rough hand over a stone and remark : fine face that ye do not see many such stone these day as though he be speak of the countenance of a friend i veritably believe there be stone that smile at he stone that frown at he stone that appear good or ill-humoured to he as he bend he stocky strong body to lift or lay they he be a slow man a slow steady geologic man as befit one who work with the elemental stuff of nature he arm be short and he hand powerful he have be a servant of stone in this neighborhood alone for upward of fifty year he love stone and can no more resist a good stone than i a good book when go about the country if he see comely stone in a wayside pile or in a fine-featured old fence he will have they whether or no and dicker for they with all the eagerness sly pride and half-concealed cunning with which a lover of old print chaffer for a seymor haden in a second-hand book shop and when he have buy they he take the first idle day he have and with he team of old horse go into the hill or wherever it may be and bring they down he have they pile about he barn and even in he yard as another man might have flower bed and he can tell you as he tell I to-day just where a stone of such a size and such a face can be find though it be at the bottom of a pile no book lover with a feeling sense for the place in he case where each of he book may be find have a sharper instinct than he in he pocket he carry a lump of red chalk and when we have make we selection he mark each stone with a broad red cross i think it good fortune that i secure the old stone mason to do my work and take to myself some credit for skill in entice he he be past seventy year old though of a ruddy fresh countenance and a clear bright eye and take no more contract and be even reluctantly persuade to do the ordinary stone work of the neighborhood he be well enough off as the say go to rest during the remainder of he year for he have live a temperate and frugal life own he own home with the little garden behind it and have money in the bank but he can be prevail upon like a old artist who have reach the time of life when it seem as important to enjoy as to create he can sometimes be prevail upon to lay a wall for the joy of do it so i have the stone haul onto the ground the best old field stone i could find and i have a clean straight foundation dig and when all be ready i bring the old man over to look at it i say i want he advice no sooner do he glance light upon the stone no sooner do he see the open and ready earth than a new light come in he eye he step quicken and as he go about he begin to hum a old tune under he breath i know then that i have he he have take fire i could see that he eye be already select the stone that should go down the fine square stone to make the corner or cap the wall and measure with a true eye the number of little stone for the filler in no time at all he have agree to do my work indeed would have feel aggrieved if i have not employ he i enjoy the building of the wall i think as much as he do and help he what i could by roll the larger stone close down to the edge of the wall as the old man work he talk if any one care to listen or if one do not care to listen he be well content to remain silent among he stone but i enjoy listen for nothing in this world be so fascinating to I as the story of how a man have come to be what he be when we think of it there be no abstract adventure in this world but only you adventure and my adventure and it be only as we come to know a man that we can see how wonderful he life have be he tell I all about the great wall and the little wall -- mile and mile of they -- he have build in the course of fifty year he tell of crude boyhood wall when he be a worker for wages only he tell of proud manhood wall when he take contract for foundation retain wall and even for whole building such as church where the work be mostly of stone he tell I of thrilling gain and profit and of depressing loss and he tell I of he calm later work again on wages for which he be choose as a master of he craft a whole long lifetime of it -- and the last year the best of all as we drive up yesterday to select the step from he pile of old field stone ride behind he great slow hairy-hoofed horse in the batter and ancient wagon he point with he stubby whip to this or that foundation the work of he hand fine job that say he and i look for the first time in my life at the beautiful stonework beneath the familiar home of a friend i have see the house a thousand time and know well the people in it but my unobservant eye have never before rest consciously upon that bit of basement wall how we go through life lose most of the beauty of it from sheer inability to see but the old man as he drive about rarely see house at all especially wooden house and for all modern stucco and cement work he entertain a kind of lofty contempt sham work of a hasty and unskilled age he never i think put in a shovelful of cement except in the place where it belong as a mortar for good wall and never will do so as long as he live so long as he live the standard of high art will never be debase he build that foundation and this chimney he work on the tower of the baptist church in the town and never yet have there be a crack in she winter or summer and more than forty year ago he lay the cornerstone of the old schoolhouse the foundation wall of which stand to-day as sound and strong as they be when they be put down in dry wall i think the old stone mason take the greatest pride of all : for it be in the dry wall -- i mean by that a wall lay without mortar -- that the sheer art of the mason come most into play any one can throw a wall together if he have mortar to make it stick but a dry wall must stand out for what it be build solid from the bottom up each stone rest securely upon those below it and brace and nested in by the sheer skill of the mason the art of the dry wall be the ancient heritage of new england and speak not only of the sincerity and the conscientiousness of the old puritan spirit but strike the higher note of beauty many of the older wall i know be worth go far to see for they exhibit a rare sense of form and proportion and be sometimes set in the landscape with a skill that only the master-artist himself could exceed those old hard-wrought stone fence of the burnham hill and crewsbury the best of they be honestly build and build to last a thousand year a beautiful art -- and one that be pass away it be the dry wall that stand of itself that the old stone mason love best of all as we drive along the road the old man point out to I with he stubby whip so many example of he work that it seem finally as if he have bear a hand in nearly everything do in this neighborhood in the last half-century he have literally build himself into the country and into the town and at seventy year of age he can look back upon it all with honest pride it stand no jerry-work anywhere no crack it stand i never realize before how completely the neighborhood rest upon the work of this simple old man he _ found _ most of the home here and upon he secure wall rest many of the store the church and the school of the countryside i see again how important each man be to the complete fabric of civilization and know that we be to leave no one out despise no one look down upon no one he tell I story of this ancient settler and of that he be a powerful queer man -- he want the moss leave on he stone when i put 'em in never a hammer touch the facing of _ he _ wall that be properly a woman 's wall she be the boss you might call it and want stone but _ he _ want brick so you see the front where people can see it be of stone but the side be all brick thus like the true artist that he be he have not only build himself he own honesty truth skill into the town but he have build in the inexhaustible peculiarity the radiant charm the hate and the love of the people of this place he have mirror he own little age in stone he know the town indeed better than most of we have a kind of stone-age knowledge of it -- the fundamental thing man build in when they set about build permanently and that be what you might call a spite-wall say he show I a long wall lead between two shady home make one of they a prison on the south and the other a prison on the north he tell I the story of a ancient and bitter quarrel between two old friend a story which sound to-day among spring blossom like the account of some ancient baronial feud but if the old stone mason have build wall to keep enemy apart how many more wall have he build to keep friend together how many time have he be consult by shy lover seek a foundation for a new home a new family how many time by darby and joan plan a rest place for the sunny closing year of they life he could point indeed to one wall that symbolize hatred all the other mean home roof-tree family or they be the foundation for the work place of man or else like the tower of the church they point heavenward and be build to the glory of god the old stone mason have not the slightest idea that he have do anything unusual or wonderful he be as simple and honest a man as ever i know and if he have pride simple and honest also in that he be anxious not to charge I too much for the stone i buy -- in a age like this i have never talk with he about god or about religion : i have no need to -lrb- illustration : all the other mean home roof-tree family or else like the tower of the church they point heavenward and be build to the glory of god -rrb- he have do he duty in other way by he time and he place he have bring up a large family of child and have know sorrow and loss as well as happiness and contentment two of he child be take in one day with pneumonia he tell I about it with a quaver in he old voice how long ago be it i ask twenty-seven year he have son and daughter leave and two of the son he have well train as stone mason after he they be good as young man go in a degenerate age they insist on work in cement he have grandchild in school and spoil they he be also a man of public interest and upon town-meeting day put on he good clothes and sit modestly toward the back of the hall though he rarely say anything he always have a strong opinion a opinion as sound and hard as stone and as simple upon most of the question that come up and he vote as he think though the only man in meeting who vote that way for when a man work in the open lay wall true to line and measurement be honest with natural thing he come clear sane strong upon many thing i would sooner trust he judgment upon matter that be really important as between man and man and man and god than i would trust the town lawyer and if he have grow a little testy with some of the innovation of modern life and think they do everything better forty year ago -- and say so -- he speak at least he honest conviction if i can lay my wall as true as he do if i can build myself a third part as firmly into any neighborhood as he have into this if at seventy year of age -- if ever i live to lay wall with joy at that time of life -- if i can look back upon _ my _ foundation _ my _ heaven-pointing tower and find no crack or strain in they i shall feel that i have make a great success of my life i go out just now : the old man be stoop to lift a heavy stone he hat be off and the full spring sunshine strike down warmly upon the ruddy bald spot on the top of he head the white hair around about it look silvery in that light as he place the stone in the wall he straighten up and rub he stubby hand along it a fine stone that say he chapter xi a auction of antique i would not paint a face or rock or stream or tree mere semblance of thing -- but something more than these i would not play a tune upon the sheng or lute which do not also sing meaning that else be mute john templeton die on the last day of August but it be not until some week later that he daughter julida that hard-favoured woman set a time for the auction it fall happily upon a mellow autumn day and as i drive out i see the apple ripen in all the orchard along the road and the corn be begin to look brown and the meadow by the brook be green with rowen it be a ideal day for a auction and farmer and townsman come troop from all part of the country for the templeton antique be to be sell john templeton live in one house for seventy-eight year he be bear there and you will find the like of that in few place in america it be a fine house for its time for any time and not new when john templeton be bear a great solid square structure such as they build when the puritan spirit be virile in new england with a almost greek beauty of measure line it have a fanlight over the front door window exquisitely proportion and in the center a vast brick chimney even now though weathered and unpainted it stand four-square upon the earth with a kind of natural dignity a majestic chestnut tree grow near it and a large old barn and generous shed now somewhat dilapidated ramble away to the rear enclose the field around about be stone fence represent the infinite labor of john templeton 's forebear more toil have go into the stone fence of new england free labor of a free people than ever go into the slave-driven building of the pyramid of egypt i know john templeton in he old age -- a stiff weather-beaten old man drive to town in a one-horse buggy how be you mr templeton comin ' on comin ' on this be he invariable reply he have the old new england pronunciation now disappear he say rud for road daown for down and give a indescribable twist to the word garden best spell gardin he have also the old new england way he be forehand with he winter woodpile immaculately neat with he dooryard determine in he Sunday observance and if he put the small apple in the middle of the barrel he refuse to raise tobacco lest it become a cause of stumble to he neighbor he pay he debt discipline he child and in a age which have come to look chummily upon god he dread he wrath he grow a peculiar very fine variety of sweet apple which i have never see anywhere else he call it the pumpkin sweet for it be of a rich yellow i can see he yet drive into town with a shallow wagon box half full of this gold of the orchard can see he turn stiffly to get one of the apple for I can hear he say in the squeaky voice of age : ye will not find no sweeter apple hereabout i can tell ye that he be a dyed-in-the-wool abolition republican and take the boston _ transcript _ for forty-six year he leave two cord of they pile up in a back storeroom he love to talk about napoleon bonaparte and the battle of waterloo and how if there have not be that delay of half a hour the history of the world might have be different i can see he say with the word puff out he loose cheek : and then blooker kem up -- to the very last even when he eye be too dim to read and he voice be crack he would start up like some old machine set a-whirring when you touch the rusty lever and talk about the battle of waterloo no one so far as i know ever hear he complain or bemoan he age or regret the change in the time and when he day come he lay down upon he bed and die positively nothing will be reserve be the familiar word of the poster and they have a larger meaning in a old country neighborhood than the mere sale of the last pan and jug and pig and highboy though we live with we neighbor for fifty year we still secretly wonder about they we still suspect that something remain covered something keep in and hide away some bit of beauty unappreciated -- as they be indeed with ourselves but death snatch away the last friendly garment of concealment and after the funeral the auction we may enter now the door stand at last flung widely open all the attic have be ransack all the chest have be turn out a thousand privacy stand glaringly reveal in the sunny open space of the yard positively nothing will be reserve everything will be knock down to the highest bidder what wonder that the neighborhood gather what wonder that it nod its head leave sentence half utter smile enigmatically nearly all the contents of the house have be remove to the yard under the great chesnut tree a crowd of people mostly woman be move about among the old furniture the old furniture that have be in john templeton 's family for no one know how long -- old highboy and lowboy a beautifully simple old table or so and bed with carve post and hand-wrought brass and a odd tall clock that strike with sonorous dignity these thing which have be temptingly advertise as antique a word john templeton never know be only the common serviceable thing of uncounted year of family life nothing about the place be of any great value except the antique and it be these that draw the well-dressed woman in automobile from as far away as hempfield and nortontown and yet there be man in plenty to poke the pig look sarcastically at the tooth of the two old horse and examine with calculate and rather jeer eye john templeton 's ancient buggy and the harness and the worn plough and cultivator and mow machine everything seem so cheap so poor so unprotected when the spirit have depart under the chestnut tree the swarthy auctioneer with he amiable countenance and ironical smile acquire through year of dispassionate observation of the folly of human emotion the mutability of human affair the brevity of human endeavor that bring everything at last under he hammer -- there by the chestnut tree the auctioneer have take he stand in temporary eminence upon a old chest with a ancient kitchen cupboard near he which serve at once as a pulpit for exhortation and a block for execution already the well-worn smile have come pat to he countenance and the well-worn witticism be ready to he tongue now gentleman if you 'll give I such attention as you can spare from the lady we have here to-day -- but i could not somehow listen to he : the whole scene the whole deep event have take hold upon I strangely it be so full of human meaning human emotion human pathos i drift away from the crowd and step in at the open door of the old house and walk through the empty resounding room with they curious old wallpaper and low ceiling and dusty window and there be the old fireplace where the heavy brick have be eat away by the poking and scrapings of a century and the threshold worn by the passage of many foot the romp foot of child the happy foot of youth the bride pass here on she wedding night with she arm link in the arm of the groom the sturdy determined foot of maturity the stumbling foot of old age creep in the slow push foot of the bearer with the last burden crowd out -- the air of the house have a musty shut-in odour ironically cut through as all old thing be by the stinging odour of the new : the boil of the auction coffee in the half-dismantled kitchen the epochal moment in the life of julium templeton i could hear occasionally she high strident worried voice order a helper about such a hard-favoured woman it be the study and profitable psychology of the auction that the rubbish must be sell first -- pot and bottle and jug at five-cent bid and hoe at ten -- and after that the friction of the contest have warm in the bidder a amiable desire to purchase goods they do not want and can not use the auctioneer gradually put forth the treasure of the day as i come out of the old house i could see that the mystic web have be spin that the great moment of the sale be arrive the auctioneer be lean forward now upon the tall cupboard with a air of command and survey the assemble crowd with a lordly eye now jake careful there -- pass it along -- steady we come now to the cheff doove of the day the creem delly creem of this sale gentleman _ and _ lady it be a great moment in the life of a auctioneer when he can offer for sale free and without reservation such treasure as these i could feel the warming interest of the crowd gathering in more closely about mr harpworth the furtive silence of shrewd bargainer eagerness mask as indifference and covetousness cloak itself with smile irony it be in the auction that trade glorify itself finally as a art here gentleman _ and _ lady be a genuine antique hand-wrought and solid all the way through just enough worn to give the flavor and distinction of age well build in the first place plain simple line but lady _ beautiful _ it be the tall four-post bed he be sell and he now put he hand upon this object -- a hardy service with a cunningly simulated air of deference it be to be profane by no irreverent handle what be i offer for this heirloom of the templeton family ten ten fifteen over there thank you mr cody why gentleman that bed can not be duplicate in america a real product of colonial art look at the color of it where will you find such

and a spider-legged table and a brass warming-pan and a banjo clock i scarcely know how to explain it but the sale of these inanimate antique so charge with the restrained grace the reticent beauty the serviceable strength of a pass age take hold upon I with strange intensity in time of high emotion the veil between sight and insight slip aside and that which lie about we suddenly achieve a higher reality we be conscious of something beside the form something beyond the sound it come to I with a thrill that this be no mere sale of antique wood and brass and iron but a veritable auction here symbolize of the decaying fragment of a sternly beautiful civilization i look off across the stony field now softly green in the sunlight from which three generation of the templeton family have wring a heroic living i look up at the majestic old house where they have live and marry and die as my eye come back to the busy scene beneath the chestnut tree it seem to I how vividly i can not describe -- that beside or behind the energetic and perspire mr harpworth there stand another auctioneer and i think he have flow lock and a patriarchal beard and a scythe for a sign of the uncertainty of life and a glass to mark the swiftness of its passage he be that great auctioneer who bring all thing at last under he inexorable hammer after that though mr harpworth do he best he claim my attention only intermittently from that greater sale which be go on at he side from that greater auctioneer who be conduct it with such consummate skill -- for _ he _ know that nothing be for

with julium templeton : only she could use they chapter xii a woman of forty-five we have a astonishing woman in this community she act in a way that no one expect and while we be intensely interested in everything she do and desire to know about it to the uttermost detail we be incline to speak of she in bated breath some woman to talk about in a country neighborhood be a kind of public necessity she fill one of the state function like the town assessor or the president of the dorca society and if ever the office fall vacant we have immediate resort to one of those silent election at which we choose we town celebrity there be usually several candidate and the campaign be accompany by much heated argument and exemplification we have we staunch party man and we irresponsible independent on whom you can never put you finger and if we be sometimes a little vague in we discussion of principle and issue we share with we national political leader a intense interest in personality prominent citizen come out for this candidate or that we spring surprise and launch new boom and often at the last moment we be take off we foot by the circulation of comeback i take a pardonable pride however in say to the credit of we democratic institution that most of the candidate elect be choose strictly upon merit i shall never forget the afternoon now more than a year ago that harriet come up the road bear the news which beyond a doubt place the present incumbent in office and have serve to keep she there despite the effort in certain quarter which shall be nameless to use that pernicious instrument of radicalism the recall i can always tell when harriet bring important news she have a slightly quicker step carry she head a little more firmly and when she speak impress she message upon I with a lowered voice when harriet look at I severely and drop down a octave i prepare for the worst david she say mary starkweather have go to live in the barn in the _ barn _ in the barn i do not know quite why it be but i dislike be surprise and do my best to cover it up and besides i have always like mary starkweather so i remark as casually as i could : why not it be a perfectly good barn david grayson well it be it be a better building to-day than many of the people of this town live in why should not mary starkweather live in the barn if she want to it be she barn but _ david _ -- there be she child -- and she husband there always be when anybody want to live in a barn i shall not talk with you any more say harriet until you can be serious i have my punishment as i richly deserve to have in the gnawing of unsatisfied curiosity which be almost as distressing as a troubled conscience within the next few day i remember i hear the great news buzz everywhere i go we have conjecture that the barn be be refit for the family of a caretaker and it be mary starkweather herself we sole dependable representative of the rich who be move in mary starkweather who have she house in town and she home in the country and she automobile and she servant and she picture and she book to say nothing of she husband and she child and she child 's maid go to live in she barn i leave it to you if there be not a valid reason for we commotion it must have be two week later that i go to town by the upper hill road in order to pass the starkweather place it be a fine old estate the building except the barn set well back from the road with a spacious garden near they and pleasant field stretch away on every hand as i skirt the shoulder of the hill i look eagerly for the first glimpse of the barn i confess that i have weave a thousand story to explain the mystery and have reach the point where i could no longer resist see if i could solve it well the barn be transform two or three new window a door with a little porch a lattice or so for vine a gable upon the roof lift a inquire eyebrow -- and what be once a barn have become a charming cottage it seem curiously to have come alive to have acquire a personality of its own a corner of the great garden have be cut off and include in the miniature grounds of the cottage and a simple arbor have be build against a background of wonderful beech tree you feel at once a kind of fondness for it i see mary starkweather in she garden in a large straw hat with a trowel in she hand how be you david grayson she call out when i stop i have be plan for several day i say to happen casually by you new house have you you do not know how you have stir we curiosity we have not have a good night 's rest since you move in i have no doubt of it she laugh will not you come in i would like to tell you all about it i also prepare to make excuse for not stop i say and think up various kind of urgent business such as buy a new snow shovel to use next winter but after make these excuse i intend to stop -- if i be sufficiently urge you be more than urge : you be command as i follow she up the walk she say earnestly : will you do I a favor when you come in will you tell I the first impression my living-room give you no second thought tell I instantly i 'll do it i say my mind leap eagerly to all manner of mysterious surprise at the center of the room she turn toward I and with a sweeping backward motion of the arm make I a bow -- a strong figure instinct with confident grace : a touch of gray in the hair a fleeting look of old sadness about the eye now david grayson she say quick it be not that the room itself be so remarkable as that it strike I as be confusingly different from the heavily comfortable room of the old starkweather house with they crowded furnishings they overloaded mantel they plethoric bookcase i can not think of you yet i stumble as be here be not it _ like _ I it be a beautiful room -- i groped lamely i be afraid you would say that but it be it really be then i have fail after all she say it lightly enough but there be a undertone of real disappointment in she voice i be in rather the predicament i say of old abner coate you probably do not know abner he sell nursery stock and each spring when he come around and i tell he that the peach tree or the raspberry bush i buy of he the year before have not do well he say with the greatest astonishment ` wal now ye be not say what i hope ye would ' i see that i have not say what you hope i would it be too serious a matter however for mary starkweather to joke about but david grayson she say be not it _ simple _ i glance around I with swift new comprehension why yes it _ be _ simple i see that my friend be undergo some deep inner change of which this room this renovate barn be mere symbol tell I i say how you come to such a right-about-face it be just that she return earnestly it _ be _ a right-about-face i think i be really in earnest for the first time in my life i have a moment of flash wonder if she marriage have not be in earnest a flash picture of richard starkweather with he rather tired good-humoured face and i wonder if she child be not earnest reality to she if she busy social life have mean nothing then i reflect that we all have such moment when the richest experience of the past seem as nothing in comparison with the fervor of this glowing moment everything in my life in the past she be say seem to have happen to I life have do thing _ for _ I i have have so few chance of do anything for myself and now you be express yourself almost for the first time in my life she pause all my life it seem to I i have be smother with thing just thing too much of everything all my time have be take up in care for thing and none in enjoy they i understand i say with a warm sense of corroboration and sympathy i have so many picture on my wall that i never see really see any of they i see the dust on they i see the crack in the frame that need repair i even see better way of arrange they but i very rarely see with the inner eye what the artist be try to tell I and how much time i have waste on mere food and clothing -- it be appalling i have become nothing short of a slave to my house and my thing i see now i say why you have just one rise on you table yes -- she return eagerly -- be not it a beauty i spend half a hour this morning look for the best and most perfect rise in the garden and there it be she be now all alight with she idea and i see she as we sometimes see we oldest friend as though i have not see she before she be that phenomenon of the modern world -- the free woman of forty-five when a woman reach the old age of youth the year between forty and forty-five she either surrender or revolt in the older day in america it be nearly always surrender those woman of a past generation bear many child : how many grave there be in we hill cemetery of woman of forty to fifty who die lead family of five or eight or ten child how many second and third wife there be often with second and third family or if they do not die how terribly they toil keep the house clothing the child cook the food or if they bear no child yet they be bind down by a thousand chain of convention and formality but in these day we have a woman of forty-five who have not surrender she be a vigorous experienced active-minded human be just begin to look restlessly around she and take a new interest in the world such a woman be mary starkweather and this be she first revolt you can not imagine she be say what a joy it have be to unaccumulate to get rid of thing to select to become a artist in life yes at last what a lot of perfectly worthless trash accumulate around we not beautiful not even useful and it be not only the life of the well-to-do that be choke and clutter with thing i wish you could see the house of we polish farmer he be be save money and fill up he house with perfectly worthless ornament -- ornate clock gorgeous plush furniture impossible rug -- and yet he be only do what we be all do on a more elaborate scale i laugh that remind I of a family of squirrel that live in a oak tree on my hill i say i be never tire of watch they in the fall they work desperately steal all the hickory nut and chestnut on my neighbor horace 's back pasture five time as many as they need and then they forget half the time where they have hide they we be all more or less in the squirrel stage of civilization yes she respond there be my book i gather up book for year just squirrel fashion until i forget what i have or where i put they you can not know what joy i be go to have in select just the essential book the one i want by I for daily companion all the other i see now be temporary rubbish and you have make you selection no but i be make they you 'll laugh when you come next time and i show they to you oh i be go to be stern with myself i be not go to put a single book in that case for show nor a single one to give the impression that i be profoundly interested in egypt or maeterlinck or woman suffrage when i be positively not it be terribly risky i say and i be terribly reckless she respond as i go onward toward the town i look back from the hilltop beyond the big house for a last glimpse of the reconstructed barn and with a curious warm sense of have be admit to a new adventure here be life change under my eye here be a human be struggle with one of the deep common problem that come to all of we the revolt from thing the struggle with superfluity and yet as i walk along the cool aisle of the wood with the quiet field open here and there to the low hill ridge and see the cattle feed and hear a thrush singing in a thicket i find myself let go -- how can i explain it -- relaxing i have be key up to a high pitch there in that extraordinary room yes it _ be _ beautiful -- and yet as i thought of the sharp little green gate the new gable the hard clean mantel with the cloisonne vase it want something as i be gather the rowen crop of after-enjoyment which reward we when we reflect freshly upon we adventure whom should i meet but richard starkweather himself in he battered machine the two boy one of whom be drive and the little girl be with he how be you david he call out whoa there draw up jamie we look at each other for a moment with that quizzical half-humorous look that so often convey better than any speak word the sympathetic greet of friend i like richard starkweather he have come up from the city look rather wear for the weather have be try he have blue honest direct-gazing eye with small humor wrinkle at the corner i never know a man with fewer theory or with a simpler devotion to the thing at hand whatever it may be at everything else he smile not cynically for he be too modest in he regard for he own knowledge he smile at everything else because it do not seem quite real to he be up to see mary 's new house he ask yes and for the life of I i could not help smile in response it be a wonder be not it he think he wife a very extraordinary woman i remember he say to I once david she be get the soul of a poet and the brain of a general it _ be _ a wonder i respond i can not decide yet what chair to sit in nor just what she want the kid to do i still smile i expect she have not determine yet he go drawl on in what chair i will look most decorative he ruminate you know she be get the idea that there be too much of everything i guess there be too -- and that she ought to select only those thing that a essential i have be wonder if she have more than one husband whether or not she would select I -- the restless young jamie be now start the machine and richard starkweather lean out and say to I in parting : be not she a wonder do all the planning herself -- would not have a architect -- would not have a decorator -- all i could do -- as he turn around i see he throw one arm carelessly about the shoulder of the sturdy younger boy who sit next he when i get home i tell harriet all about what i have see and hear i think i must feel when i be retail such fascinating neighborhood event to harriet -- how she _ do _ enjoy they -- i must feel very much as she do when she be urge I to have just a little more of the new gingerbread in the next few month i watch with indescribable interest the unfold of the drama of mary starkweather i see she from time to time that summer and she seem and i think she be happier than ever she have be before in she whole life make over she garden select the essential book choose the best picture for she room even reform the clothing of the boy all with a emphasis upon perfect simplicity -- she mind be completely absorb occasionally richard appear upon the stage a kind of absurd greek chorus of one who remark what a wonderful woman this be and poke fun at himself and at the new house and assert that mary could be as simple as ever she like he insist on thick soup for dinner and would not sacrifice he beloved old smoking jacket upon the altar of any new idea she be a wonder david he would wind up : but this simple life be get more complicated every day it be in December about the middle of the month as i remember that i have a note one day from mary starkweather the next time you go to town it run stop in and see I i have make a discovery with such a note as that we my hand it appear imperative that i go to town at once i discover to harriet 's astonishment that we be run out of all sort of necessaries now david she say you know perfectly well that you be just make up to call on mary starkweather that i say relieve my conscience of a great burden as i go out of the door i hear she saying : why mary starkweather should _ care _ to live in she barn it be a sparkling cold day sun on the snow and the track crunch under one 's foot and i walk swiftly and with a warm sense of come adventure to my surprise there be no smoke in the cottage chimney and when i reach the door i find a card pin upon it : please call at the house mary starkweather herself open the door -- she have see I come -- and take I into the big comfortable old living-room the big cluttered overfurnish living-room with the two worn upholstered chair at the fireplace in which a bright log fire be now burn there be a pleasant litter of book and magazine and a work basket on the table and in the bay window a ugly but cheerful green rubber plant in a tub well i exclaimed do not smile -- not yet as i look at she i feel not at all like smile i know she be say it do have a humorous side i can see that dick have see it all along do you know although dick pretend to pooh-pooh everything intellectual he have a really penetrate mind i have a sudden vision of dick in he old smoking jacket standing in the midst of the immaculate cottage that be once a barn hold he pipe with one finger crooked around the stem just in front of he nose in the way he have and smile across at I have you desert the cottage entirely oh we may possibly go back in the spring ----- she pause and look into the fire she fine strong face a little sad in composure full of thought i be try to be honest with myself david honest above everything else that be fundamental it seem to I i have want most of all to learn how to live my life more freely and finely i think i be get myself free of thing when as a matter of fact i be devote more time to they than ever before-and besides that make life more or less uncomfortable for dick and the child so i have take my courage squarely in my hand and come back here into this bless old home this bless ugly stuffy old home -- i have learn _ that _ lesson at this she glance up at I with that rare smile which sometimes shine out of she very nature : the smile that be herself i find she say that when i have finish the work of become simple -- there be nothing else leave to do i laugh outright for i could not help it and she join I how we do like people who can laugh at themselves but i say there be sound sense in a great deal that you be try to do the fireplace smoke and the kitchen sink freeze up and the cook leave because we could not keep she room warm but you be right i interrupted and i be not go to be put off by smoking fireplace or chilly cook you be right we do have too much we be smother in thing we do not enjoy what we do have -- i pause and you be make a beautiful thing a beautiful house the trouble with make a beautiful thing she reply be that when you have get it do you must straightway make another now i do not want to keep on building house or furnish room i be not after beauty -- i mean primarily -- what i want be to _ live _ live simply live greatly she be desperately in earnest perhaps i say feeling as though i be tread on dangerous ground you be try to be simple for the sake of be simple i wonder if true simplicity be ever any thing but a by-product if we aim directly for it it elude we : but if we be on fire with some great interest that absorb on life to the uttermost we forget ourselves into simplicity everything fall into simple line around we like a worn garment i have the rather uncomfortable feeling on the way home that i have be preachy and the moment you become preachy begin to build up barrier between yourself and you friend : but that be a defect of character i have never be able quite to overcome i keep think i have get the better of it but along will come a beautiful temptation and down i go -- and come out as remorseful as i be that afternoon on the way home from mary starkweather 's a week or two later i happen to meet richard starkweather on the street in hempfield he be on he way home yes he say we be in the old house again until spring anyway i have not be so comfortable in a year and say here he look at I quizzically mary have join the new cemetery association you know they be try to improve the rest place of the forefather and by george if they do not elect she chairman at the first meeting she be a wonder chapter xiii he majesty -- bill richard well i have just be have a amusing and delightful adventure and have come to know a great common person he name be bill richard and he be one of the hereditary monarch of america he belong to we ruling dynasty i first saw bill about two week ago and while i be strongly interested in he i have no idea at the time that i should ever come to know he well it be a fine June day and i be ride on the new trolley line that cross the hill to hewlett -- a charming trip through a charming country -- and there in the open car just in front of I sit bill himself one huge bare forearm rest on the back of the seat the rich red blood show through the weathered brown of the skin he clean brown neck rise strongly from the loose collar of he shirt which cover but could not hide the powerful line of he shoulder he wear blue denim and khaki and a small round feel hat tip up jauntily at the back he have crisp coarse light hair rather thin -- not by age but by nature -- so that the ruddy scalp could be see through it and strong jaw and large firm feature and if the beard be two day old he face be so brown so full of youthful health that it give no ill impression he could not sit still for the very life that be in he he seem to have some grand secret with the conductor and frequently look around at he he eye full of careless laughter and once or twice he call out -- some jocose remark he help the conductor in pantomime to pull the cord and stop or start the car and he watch with the liveliest interest each passenger get on or get off a rather mince young girl with a flare red ribbon at she throat be to he the finest comedy in the world so that he have to wink a telegram to the conductor about she a old woman with a basket of vegetable who delay the car be exquisitely funny i set he down as be about twenty-two year old and some kind of outdoor workman not a farmer when he get off which be before the car stop so that he have to jump and run with it he give a wild flourish with both arm grimace at the conductor and go off down the road whistle for all he be worth how i enjoy the sight of he he be so charge with youthful energy so overflow with the joy of life that he could scarcely contain himself what a fine place the world be to he and what comical and interesting people it contain i be sorry when he get off two or three day later i be on my way up the town road north of my farm when i be astonished and delighted to see bill for the second time he be come down the road pull a wire over the crosspiece of a tall telephone pole -lrb- the company be rebuild and enlarge its system through we town -rrb- he be hold the wire close draw over he right shoulder he strong hand grip and press upon he breast the vein stand out in he brown neck where the burlap shoulder pad he wear be draw aside by the wire he lean forward step first on he toe which he dig into the earth and then heavily let down he heel he draw the other foot forward somewhat stiffly the muscle stand out in he powerful shoulder and thigh he leg be double-strapped with climb spur he be a master lineman as i come alongside he turn a good-humoured sweaty face toward I it be dang hot say he it be say i there be something indescribably fascinating about the sight of a strong workman in the full swing of he work something -- yes beautiful a hard pull of a job with a strong man do it joyfully what could be finer to see and he give such a jaunty sense of youth and easy strength i watch he for some time curiously interested and think i should like well to know he but could not see just how to go about it the man astride the cross-arm who be heave the wire forward from the spool on the distant truck suddenly cry out : ease up there bill she be catch so bill ease up and draw he arm across he drip face how many wire be you put up i ask fencing for some opening three say bill before i could get in another stroke the man on the pole shout : let ` er go bill and bill let ` er go and buckle down again to he job gee but it be hot say he in the country there be not so many people pass we way that we can not be interested in all of they that evening i could not help think about bill the lineman wonder where he come from how he happen to be what he be who and what sort be the friend he make and the nature of he ambition if he have any talk about go to the north pole it be not to be compare for downright fascination with the exploration of a undiscovered human be with that i begin to think how i might get at bill the lineman and not merely weather talk or wages talk or work talk but at bill himself he be a character quite unusual in we daily life here in the country i wonder what he interest could be surely not mine nor horace 's nor the starkweather ' as soon as i begin try to visualize what he life might be i warm up to a grand scheme of capture he if by chance he be to be find the next day upon the town road all this may seem rather absurd in the tell but i find it a downright good adventure for a quiet evening and fully believe i feel for the moment like general joffre plan to meet the german on the marne i have it i say aloud you have what ask harriet somewhat startle the grandest piece of strategy ever devise in this town say i with that i go delving in a volume of universal information i keep near I one of those know book that tell you how tall the great pryamid be and why a hen cackle after lay a egg and have find what i want i ask harriet if she could find a tape measure around the place she be a wonderful person and know where everything be when she hand I the tape measure she ask I what in the world i be so mysterious about harriet i say i be go on a great adventure i 'll tell you all about it to-morrow nonsense say harriet it be this way with the fancy of the evening -- they often look flat and flabby and gray the next morning quite impossible but if i would act on half the good and grand scheme i have have o ' night i might now be quite a remarkable person i go about my work the next morning just as usual i even avoid look at the little roll of tape on the corner of the mantel as i go out it seem a kind of badge of my absurdity but about the middle of the fore-noon while i be in my garden i hear a tremendous racket up the road rattle -- bang zip toot as i look up i see the boss lineman and he crew career up the road in they truck and the bold driver be drive like jehu the son of nimshus and there be ladder and pole clatter out behind and roll of wire on upright spool rattle and flash in the sunshine and the man of the crew be sit along the side of the truck with hat off and hair fly as they come bump and bound up the road it be a brave thing to see go by on a spring morning as they pass whom should i see but bill himself at the top of the load with a broad smile on he face when he eye fall on I he throw up one arm and give I the railroad salute hey there he shout hey there yourself i shout in return -- and could not help it i have a curious warm feeling of be take along with that jolly crowd of workman with bill on the top of the load it be this that finish I i hurry through a early dinner and take the tape measure off the mantel i put it in my pocket as though it be a revolver or a bomb and go off up the road feeling as adventurous as ever i feel in my life i never say a word to harriet but disappear quietly around the lilac bush i be go to waylay that crew and especially bill i hope to catch they at they nooning well i be lucky about a quarter of a mile up the road in a little valley near the far corner of horace 's farm i find the truck and bill just get out he dinner pail it seem they have flip penny and bill hod be leave behind with the truck and the tool while the other go down to the mill pond in the valley below how be you say i how be _ you _ say he i could see that he be rather cross over have be leave behind fine day say i you bet say he he get out he pail which be a big one and seat himself on the roadside a grassy comfortable spot near the brook which run below into the pond there be white birch and hemlock on the hill and somewhere in the thicket i hear a wood thrush singing do you ever see john l sullivan i ask he glance up at I quickly but with new interest no do you or bob fitzsimmon nope -- but i be mighty near it once i have see 'em both in the movie well sir say i that be interesting i should like to see they myself do you know what make I speak of they he have spread down a newspaper and be take the luncheon out of he bucket as he call it include a large bottle of coffee but he pause and look at I with keen interest well say i when i see you drag that wire yesterday i take you to be a pretty husky citizen yourself he grin and take a big mouthful from one of he sandwich i could see that my shot have go home so when i get back last night i say i look up the arm measurement of sullivan and fitzsimmon in a book i have and get to wonder how they compare with mine and yours they be considerably larger than mine -- bill think this a fine joke and laugh out in great good humor but i imagine you would not be far behind either of they he look at I a little suspiciously as if doubtful what i be drive at or whether or not i be joke he but i be as serious as the face of nature and proceed at once to get out my tape measure i get very much interested in such thing i say and i have enough curiosity to want to see how big you arm really be he smile broadly you be a queer one say he but he take another bite of sandwich and clench he great fist draw up he forearm until the biceps muscle look like a roll of vienna bread -- except that they have the velvety gleam of life so i measure first one arm then the other by george say i you be ahead of fitzsimmon but not quite up to sullivan fitz be not a heavy man say bill but a dead game fighter i see then that i have he so i sit down on the grass near by and we have great talk about the comparative merit of fitzsimmon and sullivan and corbett and jack johnson a department of knowledge in which he out-distance I he even tell I of a exploit or two of he own which show that he be able to take care of himself while we talk he eat he luncheon and a downright gargantuan luncheon it be back by a appetite which if it be offer to the highest bidder on the new york stock exchange would i be convinced bring at least ten thousand dollar in cash it even make I envious there be three huge corned-beef sandwich three hard-boiled egg a pickle six inch long and fat to boot four doughnut so big that they resemble pitch quoit a bottle of coffee and milk a quarter of a pie and to cap the climax a immense raw onion it be worth a long journey to see bill eat that onion he take out he clasp knife and after strip off the papery outer shell cut the onion into thick dewy slice then he open one of the sandwich and place several of they on the beef afterward sprinkle they with salt from a small paper parcel have restore the top slice of bread he take a moon-shaped bite out of one end of this glorified sandwich i like onion say he when we first sit down he have offer to share he luncheon with I but i tell he i have just be to dinner and i observe that he have no difficulty in take care of every crumb in he bucket it be wonderful to see have finish he luncheon he go down to the brook and get a drink and then sit down comfortably with he back among the fern of the roadside cross he leg and light he pipe there be a healthy and wholesome flush in he face and as he blow off the first cloud of smoke he draw a sigh of complete comfort and look around at I with a lordly air such as few monarch no matter how well feed could have better he have work and sweat for what he get and be now take he ease in he roadside inn i wonder sometimes if anybody in the world experience keener joy than unwatched common people how we talk from pugilist we proceed to telephone and from that to wages hour and strike and from that we leap easily to alaska and gold-mining and touch in pass upon theodore roosevelt i be just think i say that you and i can enjoy some thing that be beyond the reach of the greatest king of the world how 's that say he why napoleon never see a telephone nor talk through one that be so he laugh and caesar could not have dream that such a thing as you be do now be a possibility -- nor george washington either say that be so i never think o ' that why i say the world be only half as big as it be before you fellow come along string you wire i can get to town now from my farm in two minute when it use to take I a hour i really believe i give he more of he own business than ever he have before for he listen so intently that he pipe go out i find that bill be from ohio and that he have be as far south as atlanta and as far west as denver he get he three dollar and a half a day rain or shine and think it wonderful pay and besides he be seein ' the country free grati fer nothing he get he coat out of the truck and take from the pocket a many-coloured folder say mister have you ever be to the northwest no say i well it be a great country and i be goin ' up there he spread out the glittering folder and place he big forefinger on a spot about the size of rhode island somewhere this side of the rocky how 'll you do it i ask oh a lineman can go anywhere say he with a flourish a lineman do not have to beg a job besides i get eighty dollar sew up talk about freedom never have i get a clearer impression of it than bill give I that day no millionaire no potentate could touch he the crew come back all too soon for I bill knock the ash out of he pipe on he boot heel and put he bucket back in the truck five minute later he be climb a tall pole with leg bow out striking in he spike at

translate by arthur guiterman _ it be astonishing how many people there be in city and town who have a secret longing to get back into quiet country place to own a bit of the soil of the earth and to cultivate it to some it appear as a troublesome malady only in spring and will be relieve by a whirl or two in country road by a glimpse of the hill or a day by the sea but to other the homesickness be deeper seat and will be quiet by no hasty visit these must actually go home i have have in recent year many letter from friend ask about life in the country but the longer i remain here the more i know about it the less able i be to answer they -- at least briefly it be as though one should come and ask : be love worth try or how about religion for country life be to each human be a fresh strange original adventure we enjoy it or we do not enjoy it or more probably we do both it be packed and crowd with the zest of adventure or it be dull and miserable we may if we be skilled enough make we whole living from the land or only a part of it or we may find in a few cherish acre the inspiration and power for other work whatever it may be there be many a man whose strength be renew like that of the wrestler of irassa every time he foot touch the earth of all place in the world where life can be live to its fullest and freest where it can be meet in its greatest variety and beauty i be convince that there be none to equal the open country or the country town for all country people in these day may have the city -- some city or town not too far away : but there be million of man and woman in america who have no country and no sense of the country what do they not lose out of life i know well the disadvantage charge against country life at its worst at its worst there be long hour and much lonely labor and a income pitifully small drudgery yes especially for the woman and loneliness but where be there not drudgery when man be poor -- where life be at its worst i have never see drudgery in the country comparable for a moment to the dreary and lonely drudgery of city tenement city mill factory and sweat shop and in recent year both the drudgery and loneliness of country life have be disappear before the motor and trolley car the telephone the rural post the gasoline engine i have see a machine plant as many potato in one day as a man at hand work could have plant in a week while there be indeed real drudgery in the country much that be look upon as drudgery by people who long for easy way and a soft life be only good honest wholesome hard work -- the kind of work that make for fiber in a man or in a nation the kind that most city life in no wise provide there be a thousand nuisance and annoyance that man must meet who come face to face with nature itself you have set out you upper acre to peach tree : and the deer come down from the hill at night and strip the young foliage or the field mouse in winter work under the snow girdle and kill they the season bring too much rain and the potato rot in the ground the crow steal the corn the bee swarm when no out be watch the cow smother she calf the hen ' egg prove infertile and a storm in a day ravages a crop that have be grow all summer a constant warfare with insect and blight and fungus -- a real bitter warfare which can cease neither summer nor winter it be something to meet year after year the quiet implacability of the land while it be patient it never wait long for you there be a choose time for plant a time for cultivate a time for harvest you accept the gauge throw down -- well and good you shall have a chance to fight you do not accept it there be no complaint the land cheerfully spring up to wild yellow mustard and dandelion and pig-weed -- and will be productive and beautiful in spite of you nor can you enter upon the full satisfaction of cultivate even a small piece of land at second hand to be accept as one who belong there must be sweat and weariness the other day i be digging with dick in a ditch that be to run down through the orchard and connect finally with the land drain we put in four year ago we lay the tile just in the gravel below the silt about two foot deep cover the opening with tar paper and then throw in gravel it be a bright cool afternoon in the field below a ploughman be at work : i could see the furrow of the dark earth glisten as he turn it over the grass in the meadow be a full rich green the new chicken be active in they yard run to the cluck of the hen already the leaf of the orchard tree show green and as i work there with dick i have the curious deep feeling of come somehow into a new and more intimate possession of my own land for title do not really pass with signature and red seal nor with money change from one hand to another but for true possession one must work and serve accord to the most ancient law there be no mitigation and no haggle of price those who think they can win the greatest joy of country life on any easier term be mistaken but if one have drain he land and plough it and fertilize it and plant it and harvest it -- even though it be only a few acre -- how he come to know and to love every rod of it he know the wet spot and the stony spot and the warmest and most fertile spot -- until he acre have all the quality of a personality whose every characteristic he know it be so also that he come to know he horse and cattle and pig and hen it be a fine thing on a warm day in early spring to bring out the bee-hive and let the bee have they first flight in the sunshine what cleanly folk they be and later to see they come in yellow all over with pollen from the willow it be a fine thing to watch the cherry and plum tree come into blossom with we about the first of may while all the remainder of the orchard seem still sleep it be a fine thing to see the cattle turn for the first time in spring into the green meadow it be a fine thing -- one of the finest of all -- to see and smell the rain in a corn-field after week of drought how it come softly out of gray sky the first drop throw up spatter of dust and lose themselves in the dry soil then the cloud sweep forward up the valley darken the meadow and blot out the hill and then there be the whispering of the rain as it first sweep across the corn-field at once what a stir of life what rustling of the long green leaf what joyful shake and sway of the tassel and have you watch how eagerly the groove leave catch the early drop and lest there be too little rain after all conduct they jealously down the stalk where they will soonest reach the thirsty root what a fine thing be this to see one who thus take part in the whole process of the year come soon to have a indescribable affection for he land he garden he animal there be thought of he in every tree : memory in every fence corner just now the fourth of June i walk down past my blackberry patch now come gorgeously into full white bloom -- and heavy with fragrance i set out these plant with my own hand i have feed they cultivate they mulch they prune they trellise they and help every year to pick the berry how could they be otherwise than full of association they bear a fruit more beautiful than can be find in any catalogue : and stranger and wilder than in any learn botany book why one who come thus to love a bit of countryside may enjoy it all the year round when he awaken in the middle of a long winter night he may send he mind out to the snowy field -- i have do it a thousand time -- and visit each part in turn stroll through the orchard and pay he respects to each tree -- in a small orchard one come to know familiarly every tree as he know he friend -- stop at the strawberry bed consider the grape trellis feel himself open the door of the warm dark stable and listen to the welcome whicker of he horse or visit he cow he pig he sheep he hen or so many of they as he may have so much of the best in the world seem to have come fragrant out of field garden and hillside so many truth speak by the master poet come to we exhale the odour of the open country he story be so often of sower husbandmen herdsman : he simile and illustration so often deal with the common and familiar beauty of the field consider the lily how they grow it be on a hillside that he preach he greatest sermon and when in the last agony he seek a place to meet he god where do he go but to a garden a carpenter you say yes but of this one may be sure : there be garden and field all about : he know garden and cattle and the simple process of the land : he must have work in a garden and love it well a country life rather spoil one for the so-called luxury a farmer or gardener may indeed have a small cash income but at least he eat at the first table he may have the sweetest of the milk there be thousand perhaps million of man and woman in america who have never in they life taste really sweet milk and the freshest of egg and the ripest of fruit one do not know how good strawberry or raspberry be when pick before breakfast and eat with the dew still on they and while he must work and sweat for what he get he may have all these thing in almost unmeasured abundance and without a thought of what they cost a man from the country be often make uncomfortable upon visit the city to find two can of sweet corn serve for twenty or thirty cent or a dish of raspberry at twenty-five or forty -- and neither even at they best equal in quality to those he may have fresh from the garden every day one need say this in no boastful spirit but as a simple statement of the fact : for fruit send to the city be nearly always pick before they be fully ripe -- and lose that last perfection of flavor which the sun and the open air impart : and both fruit and vegetable as well as milk and egg suffer more than most people think from handle and shipment these thing can be set down as one of the make-weight against the familiar presentation of the farmer 's life as a hard one one of the greatest curse of mill or factory work and with much city work of all kind be its interminable monotony : the same process repeat hour after hour and day after day in the country there be indeed monotonous work but rarely monotony no task continue very long : everything change infinitely with the season process be not repetitive but creative nature hate monotony be ever change and restless bring up a storm to drive the haymaker from they hurry work in the field send rain to stop the ploughing or a frost to hurry the apple harvest everything be full of adventure and vicissitude a man who have be a farmer for two hour at the mowing must suddenly turn blacksmith when he machine break down and tinker with wrench and hammer and later in the day he become dairyman farrier harness-maker merchant no kind of wheat but be grist to he mill no knowledge that he can not use and who be freer to be a citizen than he : freer to take he part in town meeting and serve he state in some one of the innumerable small office which form the solid block of organization beneath we commonwealth i think last fall that corn-husking come as near be monotonous work as any i have ever do in the country i presume in the great corn-field of the west where the husk go on for week at a time it probably do grow really monotonous but i soon find that there be a curious counter-reward attend even a process as repetitive as this i remember one afternoon in particular it be brisk and cool with ragged cloud like flung pennant in a poverty-stricken sky and the hill be a hazy brown rather sad to see and in one of the apple tree at the edge of the meadow the crow be hold they mournful autumn parliament at such work as this one 's mind often drop asleep or at least go dream except for the narrow margin of awareness require for the simple process of the hand its order have indeed be give : you must kneel here pull aside the stalk one by one rip down the husk and twist off the ear -- and there be the pile for the strip stalk and here the basket for the gather corn and these process infinitely repeat while all this be go on the mind itself wander off to its own far sweet pasture upon its own dear adventure -- or rest or play it be in these time that most of the airy fly thing of this beautiful world come home to we -- thing that heavy-footed reason never quite overtake nor stodgy knowledge ever know i think sometimes -lrb- as sterne say -rrb- we thus intercept thought never intend for we at all or uncover strange primitive memory of older time than these -- racial memory at any rate the hour pass and suddenly the mind come home again it come home from its wanderings refresh stimulate happy and nowhere whether in city or travel in train or sailing upon the sea have i so often feel this curious enrichment as i have upon this hillside working alone in field or garden or orchard it seem to come up out of the soil or respond to the touch of grow thing what make any work interesting be the fact that one can make experiment try new thing develop specialty and _ grow _ and where can he do this with such success as on the land and in direct contact with nature the possibility be here infinite new machinery spray seed testing fertilizer experimentation with new variety a thousand and one method all creative which may be try out in that great essential struggle of the farmer or gardener to command all the force of nature because there be farmer and many of they who do not experiment and do not grow but make they occupation a veritable black drudgery this be no reason for paint a sombre-hued picture of country life any call the law the ministry the medical profession can be blast by fix one 's eye only upon its ugliest aspect and farm at its best have become a highly scientific extraordinarily absorb and when all be say a profitable profession neighbor of mine have develop system of overhead irrigation to make rain when there be no rain and have cover whole field with cloth canopy to increase the warmth and to protect the crop from wind and hail and by the analysis of the soil and exact method of feed it with fertilizer have come as near a complete command of nature as any farmer in the world what independent resourceful man they be and many of they have also grow rich in money it be not what nature do with a man that matter but what he do with nature nor be it necessary in these day for the farmer or the country dweller to be uncultivated or uninterested in what be often call with no very clear definition the finer thing of life many educate man be now on the farm and have they book and magazine and they music and lecture and drama not too far off in the town a great change in this respect have come over american country life in twenty year the real hardship of pioneering have pass away and with good road and machinery and telephone and newspaper every day by rural post the farmer may maintain as close a touch with the best thing the world have to offer as any man and if he really have such broader interest the winter furnish he time and leisure that no other class of people can command i do not know truly what we be here for upon this wonderful and beautiful earth this incalculably interesting earth unless it be to crowd into a few short year -- when all be say terribly short year -- every possible fine experience and adventure : unless it be to live we life to the uttermost : unless it be to seize upon every fresh impression develop every latent capacity : to grow as much as ever we have it in we power to grow what else can there be if there be no life beyond this one we have live _ here _ to the uttermost we have have what we have have but if there be more life and still more life beyond this one and above and under this one and around and through this one we shall be well prepare for that whatever it may be the real advantage of country life have come to be a strong lure to many people in town and city : but no one should attempt to go back to the land with the idea that it be a easy way to escape the real problem and difficulty of life the fact be there be no escape the problem and the difficulty must be boldly meet whether in city or country farming in these day be not easy living but a highly skilled profession require much knowledge and actual manual labor and plenty of it so many come to the country too light-heartedly buy too much land attempt unfamiliar crop expect to hire the work do -- and soon find themselves face discouragement and failure any city man who would venture on this new way of life should try it first for a year or so before he commit himself -- try himself out against the actual problem or by move to the country still within reach of he accustomed work he can have a garden or even a small farm to experiment with the shorter work-day have make this possible for a multitude of wage-worker and i know many instance in which life because of this opportunity to get to the soil have become a very different and much finer thing for they it be easy also for many man who be engage in professional work to live where they can get they hand into the soil for part of the time at least : and this may be make as real a experience as far as it go as though they own wider acre and devote they whole time to the work a man who thus face the problem squarely will soon see whether country life be the thing for he if he find it truly so he can be as nearly assure of live happily ever after as any one outside of a story-book can ever be out of it all be likely to come some of the greatest reward that man can know a robust body a healthy appetite a serene and cheerful spirit and finally there be one advantage not so easy to express long ago i read a story of tolstous 's call the candle -- how a peasant russian force to plough on easter day light a candle to he lord and keep it burn on he plough as he work through the sacred day when i see a man plough in he field i often think of tolstous 's peasant and wonder if this be not as true a way as any of worship god i wonder if any one truly worship god who set about it with deliberation or know quite why he do it my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as shower upon the grass the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of great possession by david grayson
