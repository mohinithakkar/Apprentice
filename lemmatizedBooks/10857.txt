-- to congress on horseback -- the first 4th of July celebration it be not until April 19th 1775 that the shot be fire which be hear around the world but the struggle for american independence be really start nearly a quarter of a century earlier when on the afternoon of August 27th 1753 liberty bell be ring to call together the assembly of the province of pennsylvanium in the old day of town meeting training day town school and puritan bell take a more prominent part in public affair than they do to-day it be usual to call the people together for purpose of deliberation by means of a village or town bell and of these bell the one to which we refer be the most important and interesting liberty bell be well name it be order in the year 1751 and it be deliver a year later shortly afterwards it crack and have to be recast but in June 1753 it be finally hang in the pennsylvanium state house at philadelphium it have never be remove from the building except on two occasion the first of these be in 1777 when it be take to allentown for safety and the second in 1885 when it be exhibit at new orlean this bell which sound the death-blow to tyranny and oppression be first ring to call together the assembly which immediately resolve to insist upon certain rights which have be deny the colonist by the british crown eighteen month later it be again ring to announce the meeting at which the rights of the colonist be sternly define and insist upon in 1765 it convene the meeting of the assembly at which it be resolve to be represent at the congress of the colony in new york and a month later it be muffle and toll when the royal charlotte arrive bear the much hated stamp whose landing be not permit again it ring muffle when the stamp act go into operation and when the people publicly burn stamp papers in 1768 the liberty bell call a meeting of the man of philadelphium who protest once again against the oppression of government without representation in 1771 it call the assembly together to petition the king of england for the repeal of the duty on tea and two year later it summon together the largest crowd ever see in philadelphium up to that date at that meeting it be resolve that the ship polly load with tea should not be allow to land in 1774 the bell be muffle and toll on the closing of the port of boston and in the following year it convene the memorable meeting follow the battle of lexington on this occasion 8000 people assemble in the state house yard and unanimously agree to associate for the purpose of defend with arm they life liberty and property against all attempt to deprive they of they in June 1776 liberty bell announce the submission to congress of the draft of the declaration of independence and on July 4th of the same year the same bell announce the signing of the declaration on July 8th of the same year the bell be toll vigorously for the great proclamation of america 's independence the toll be suspend while the declaration be read and be once more ring when that immortal document have be thus formally promulgate in April 1783 liberty bell ring the proclamation of peace and on July 4th 1826 it usher in the year of jubilee the last toll of the bell be in July 1835 when while slowly toll and without any apparent reason the bell which have play such a important part in the war of independence and in the secure of liberty for the people of this great country part through its side make a large rent which can still be clearly see it be as though the bell realize that its great task be accomplish and that it could leave to other and younger bell the minor duty which remain to be perform this be not a history of the united state but be rather a description of some of the most interesting and remarkable feature to be find in various part of it it be difficult however to describe scene and building without at least brief historical reference and as we present a excellent illustration of the apartment in which the declaration of independence be sign we be compel to make a brief reference to the circumstance and event which precede that most important event in the world 's history as we have see the conflict between the home country and the colony commence long before there be any actual outbreak as mr thoma wentworth higginson so graphically express it the surrender of canada to england by france in 1763 suddenly open man 's eye to the fact that british america have become a country so large as to make england seem ridiculously small even the cool-headed dr franklin write that same year to mary stevenson in london speak of england as that stone in a brook scarce enough of it above water to keep one 's shoe dry a far-seeing french statesman of the period look at the matter in the same way choiseul the prime minister who cede canada claim afterwards that he have do it in order to destroy the british nation by create for it a rival this assertion be not make till ten year later and may very likely have be a afterthought but it be destine to be confirm by the fact we have now to deal with the outbreak of a contest which be accord to the greatest of the english statesman of the period a most accursed wicked barbarous cruel unnatural unjust and diabolical war no american writer ever employ to describe it a combination of adjective so vigorous as those bring together by the elder pitt afterwards lord chatham the rights for which american fight seem to he to be the common rights of englishman and many englishman think the same on the other hand we be now able to do justice to those american loyalist who honestly believe that the attempt at independence be a mad one and who sacrifice all they have rather than rebel against they king massachusettensis the well-known tory pamphleteer write that the annals of the world have not be deform with a single instance of so unnatural so causeless so wanton so wicked a rebellion these strong epithet use on both side show how strangely opinion be divide as to the rebellion and its cause some of the first statesman of england defend the colonist and some of the best know man in the colony defend england the city of boston at this time have a population of about seventeen thousand as compare with some half a million to-day in its garrison there be three thousand british troops and the law of parliament be enforce rigidly the city suffer temporary commercial death in consequence and there be the most vigorous effort make to prevent a open outbreak of hostility in January 1775 a conflict be barely avert at marshfield and in the follow month the situation be so strain at salem that nothing but great forbearance and presence of mind on the part of the colonist prevent bloodsh the boston massacre of less than five year before be still uppermost in man 's thought and it be determine that the responsibility of the first shot in the war if war there must be should rest with the royal troops accordingly the colonist accept insult and abuse until they be suspect by the british troops of cowardice one officer write home tell he friend that there be no danger of war because the colonist be bully but not fighter add that any two regiment ought to be decimate which could not beat the entire force array against they but the conflict could not be long delay it be on April 18th 1775 that paul revere ride he famous ride he have see the two light in a church steeple in boston which have be agree upon as a signal that the british troops be about to seize the supplies of the patriot at concord sergeant monroe 's caution against make unnecessary noise be meet by he rejoinder you will have noise enough here before long -- the regular be come out then he commence he ride for life or rather for the life of other we all know the result of he ride and how church bell be toll and signal shot fire to warn the people that the soldier be come it be a night of tumult and horror no one know what brutality they have to expect from the now enraged british soldier the woman of the town warn by the pre-arranged signal hurry they child from they home and flee to farm house and even barn in the vicinity before daybreak the british troops have reach lexington green here they find captain parker and 38 man stand up before twenty time that number of armed troops indifferent as to they fate but determine to protect they cause and they friend the captain 's word have pass into history they take the form of a order to the man : do not fire unless you be fire on but if they want a war let it begin here history tell we of few such unequal contest as this the troops fire on the gallant little band and seven of they number be kill the fight at concord follow when 450 american meet the british troops at the north bridge where once the embattled farmer stand and fire the shot hear around the world the british detachment be beat back in disorder but the main body be too strong to be attack the minute man however make a most magnificent fight and at the close of the day they have kill 273 british soldier only 93 of they own number be among the kill or miss thus commence the war of independence the event be describe by dr joseph warren in a document of sufficient interest to warrant its reproduction in full the barbarous murder commit on we innocent brethren write the doctor have make it absolutely necessary that we immediately raise a army to defend we wife and we child from the butcher hand of a inhuman soldiery who incense at the obstacle they meet with in they bloody progress and enrage at be repulse from the field of slaughter will without the least doubt take the first opportunity in they power to ravage this devoted country with fire and sword we conjure you therefore by all that be dear by all that be sacred that you give all assistance possible in form a army we all be at stake death and devastation be the instant consequence of delay every moment be infinitely precious a hour lose may deluge we country in blood and entail perpetual slavery upon the few of you posterity who may survive the carnage we beg and entreat as you will answer to you country to you own conscience and above all as you will answer to god himself that you will hasten and encourage by all possible mean the enlistment of man to form a army and send they forward to headquarters at cambridge with that expedition which the vast importance and instant urgency of the affair demand two day after the fight the massachusett committee of safety resolve to enlist 8000 man a event which we old friend liberty bell celebrate by a vigorous toll all over the colony a spirit of determination to resist spread like lightning and the shot that be hear around the world be certainly hear very distinctly in every nook and corner of new england and of the old atlantic state naturally there be at first a lack of concentration and even of discipline but what be lack in these feature be more than make up for by bravery and determination as john adams write in 1818 the army at cambridge at this time be not a national army for there be no nation it be not even a army of the unite colony because the congress at philadelphium have not adopt or acknowledge the army at cambridge it be not even the new england army for each state have its separate army which have unite to imprison the british army in boston there be not even the commander-in-chief of the ally army these anomaly of course right themselves rapidly gage 's proclamation of martial law expedite the battle at bunker hill which be bring about by the impatience of the british troops and by the increase confidence among the colonist result from the fight at lexington and concord it be true of course that the untrained american troops fail to vanquish the british army at bunker hill but the monument at that spot celebrate the fact that for two hour the attack of the regular be withstand a prominent english newspaper describe the battle as one of innumerable error on the part of the british as william tudor write so graphically the ministerial troops gain the hill but be victorious loser a few more such victory and they be undo many writer have be credit with the authorship of a similar sentiment write from the american standpoint it be true that we be beat but it will not take many such defeat to accomplish a magnificent victory what begin to be know as the great american army increase in strength it be adopt by congress and george washington place in command under the historic elm tree at cambridge mass which be the scene of so many important council in the first hour of the life of the united state he assume the authority bestow upon he with this office and a week later he hold a council with he officer he find some 17000 man at he command whom he describe as a mixed multitude of people under very little discipline william emerson grandfather of the great poet in a soliloquy on the strange turn event have take say who would have think twelve month past that all cambridge and charleston would be cover over with american camp and cut up into fort and entrenchment and all the land field and orchard lay common with horse and cattle feed on the choicest mowing land and large park of well-regulated locust cut down for firewood this i must say look a little melancholy it be very divert to walk among the camp they be as different in they look as the owner be in they dress and every tent be a portraiture of the temper and taste of the person who encamp in it some be make of board and some of sailcloth some partly of one and some partly of the other again other be make of stone and turf brick or brush some be throw up in a hurry other curiously work with door and window do with wreath and withe in the manner of a basket some be proper tent look like the regular camp of the enemy in these be the rhode islander who be furnish with tent equipage and everything in the most exact english style however i think this great variety be rather a beauty than a blemish in the army as be to be expect there be more or less of a lack of harmony and unity among the company of man collect together to form a army to fight for liberty history tell we that there be even a little jealousy between the four new england colony there be also a good deal of distrust of washington it be argue that at least one-third of the class from which he come have tory and royalist inclination and what guarantee have they that washington be not one of they number washington himself find that those who style themselves in old country parlance the gentry be loyal to king george rather than to the colony and while he own man be incline at time to doubt the sincerity of the father of he country the very man with whom he be suspect of be in sympathy be denounce he with vigor washington to he last credit be it say be indifferent both to praise and censure see that discipline be the one thing needful he commence to enforce it with a iron hand he decline any remuneration and give he service freely to the cause he find himself short of ammunition and several time he lose a number of he man in the spring of 1776 washington go to new york with he continental army here he find new difficulty and meet with a series of mishap the failure of the advance into canada during the winter have hurt materially but the bravery of the troops in the carolina come as a grand encouragement we need not trace further the progress of the war or note how through many discouragement and difficulty the cause of right be make to triumph over the cause of might we will pass on to note a few of the interesting fact in connection with the signing of the declaration of independence to-day we senator and congressman travel to the national capital in pullman car surround by every luxury that wealth and influence can bring they in the day of the continental congress it require a good deal more nerve to fulfill one 's duty the delegate have to journey to congress on horseback sometimes he could find a little country inn at which he could sleep at night but at other he have to camp in the open as best he could frequently a friendly warning would cause he to make a detour of several mile in order to escape some threaten danger and altogether he march to the capital be far from be triumphant at this particular period the difficulty be more than usually great the delegate arrive at philadelphium jade and tire they find stable room for they horse make the best toilet possible and find they way at once to independence hall where opinion be exchange on the 7th of June richard henry lee of virginium submit a series of resolution under the instruction of the virginium assembly -- resolution which it may be state pledge the colony to carry on the war until the english be entirely drive out of the country congress declare deliberately that the united state be absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and it then proceed to burn its bridge by declare the expediency of take effectual measure for form foreign alliance john adams second the resolution which be not pass without debate delegate from new york pennsylvanium and south carolina oppose the proposition very vigorously one member state that it require the impudence of a new englander for they in they disjointed state to propose a treaty to a nation now at peace that no reason could be assign for press this measure but the reason of every madman -- a show of spirit john adams defend the resolution claim that they proclaim object of the most stupendous magnitude in which the life and liberty of million yet unborn be infinitely interested finally the consideration be postpone to be pass almost unanimously on July 2d john adam be most enthusiastic over this result and write to he wife on the subject he say : the 2d day of July 1776 will be the most memorable epoch in the history of america i be apt to believe that it will be celebrate by succeed generation as the great anniversary festival it ought to be commemorate as a day of deliverance by solemn act of devotion to god almighty from one end of the continent to the other from this time forward forevermore but although the day refer to by john adam see the thirteen colony become independent state it be July the 4th that the country celebrate on that day the declaration of independence be promulgate this marvelous document be prepare by jefferson in a small brick house which then stand out in the field but which be now know as the southwest corner of market and seventh street philadelphia it be situate within about four hundred yard of independence square in he little room in this house on a very small write desk which be still in existence jefferson draft the title deed of we liberty he write without reference of any kind merely place upon paper the succession of thought which have be paramount in he mind for year in the original document as submit by jefferson there appear a stern condemnation of the piratical warfare against human nature itself as slavery be describe this be stricken out by congress and finally the document as amend be adopt by the vote of twelve colony new york decline to vote we give a illustration of the interior of independence hall here it be that the declaration be sign accord to some authority the signing do not take place on July 4th while accord to other it do some record seem to show that fifty-four of the fifty-six name be attach to the parchment on August 2d jefferson frequently state that the signing of the declaration be hasten by a very trivial circumstance near the hall there be a large stable where fly abound all the delegate wear silk stocking and be thus in a condition to be easily annoy by fly the heat be intolerable and a tremendous invasion by the little pest who be not retard by fly screen or mosquito bar drive the legislator almost frantic and cause they to append they signature to the document with almost indecent haste however this may be the declaration be finally sign and liberty bell proclaim the fact to all within hearing john hancock we be tell refer to he almost schoolboy signature with a smile say that john bull could read he name without spectacles franklin be say to have remark that they must all hang together or else most assuredly they would all hang separately -- a play upon word show that the patriot 's sense of humor be too admirably develop to be dim even by a event of this magnitude there be rejoicing on every hand that the great act have be accomplish a very please story tell of how a aged bell-ringer wait breathlessly to announce to wake thousand the vote of congress this story have since be deny and it seem evident that the vote be not announce until the follow day when circular be issue to the people on July 6th the declaration be print in a philadelphium newspaper and on the 8th john nixon read the declaration in the yard of independence hall on the same day the royal arm over the door of the supreme court room be tear down and the trophy thus secure burn the first 4th of July celebration of which we have any record take place two year after the signing general howe have leave the city shortly before and every one be feel bright and happy in the diary of one of the old patriot who take part in this unique celebration appear the follow quaint and even picturesque description of the event of the day : on the glorious 4th of July -lrb- 1778

independence hall on page 17 be furnish for use in this work by the national company of st loui publisher of we own country a large work descriptive of a tour throughout the most picturesque section of the united state the letter-press in we own country be write by the author of this work and it be one of the finest tribute to the picturesqueness of america that have ever be publish other illustration in this work be also kindly supply by the same publishing house chapter ii the witch of salem a relic of religious bigotry -- parson lawson 's tirade against witchcraft -- extraordinary court record of old puritan day -- alleged supernatural conjuring -- a man and he wife both put to death -- crushed for refuse to plead -- a romance of the old day of witch persecution among the curiosity of new england show to tourist and visitor be the original site of some of the extraordinary trial and execution for witchcraft in the town of salem now know as danver mass look back upon the event of two hundred year ago the prosecution of the alleged witch appear to we to have be persecution of the most infamous type the only justification for the stern puritan be the fact that they inherit they idea of witchcraft and its evil from they forefather and from the country whence most of they come one of the earliest precept of religious bigotry be thou shalt not allow a witch to live and from time immemorial witchcraft appear to have be a capital offense it be on record that thousand of people have from time to time be legally murder for alleged intercourse and league with the evil one the superstition seem to have gain force rather than lose it by the spread of early christianity as a rule the victim of the craze be woman and the percentage of aged and infirm woman be always very large one of the greatest jurist of england during the seventeenth century condemn two young girl to the gallows for no other offense than the alleged crime of have exert a baneful influence over certain victim and have what would be call in certain district hoodoo they in scotland the craze be carry to still further length to be accuse of witchcraft be to be condemn as a matter of course and the terrible death of burn at the stake be the invariable sentence most of the victim make imaginary confession prefer to die at once than to be tortured indefinitely in the year 1716 a wealthy lady and she nine-year-old daughter be hang for witchcraft and even thirty or forty year later the record of great britain be sully by another similar case of persecution these unsavory record be give in order to correct a misapprehension as to the part the old puritan take in the persecution many people seriously believe that the idea of witchcraft as a capital offense originate in salem and attribute to the original witch-house the reputation of have really give birth to a new superstition and a new persecution as we have see this be entirely erroneous the fact that the puritan copy a bad example instead of set a new one should at least be remember in palliation of the unfortunate blot upon they otherwise clean escutcheon in the year 1704 one deodat lawson minister at salem during the last sixteen or seventeen year of the seventeenth century publish a remarkable work entitle christ 's fidelity the only shield against satan 's malignity in this work appear a record of the so-called calamity at salem which the author tell we be afflict about the year 1692 with a very sore and grievous infliction in which they have reason to believe that the sovereign and holy god be please to permit satan and he instrument to affright and afflict those poor mortal in such a astonishing and unusual manner the record of parson lawson be so realistic and emblematic of the time in which he live that we reproduce some of he own expression thus he say now i have for some time before attend the work of the ministry in salem village the report of those great affliction come quickly to my notice the more so because the first person afflict be in the minister 's family who succeed I after i be remove from they in pity therefore to my christian friend and former acquaintance there i be much concerned about they frequently consult with they and -lrb- by divine assistance -rrb- pray for they but especially my concern be augment when it be report at a examination of a person suspect for witchcraft that my wife and daughter who die three year before be send out of the world under the malicious operation of the infernal power as be more fully represent in the follow remark i do then desire and be also desire by some concern in the court to be there present that i might hear what be allege in that respect observe therefore when i be amongst they that the case of the afflict be very amazing and deplorable and the charge bring against the accuse such as be grounds of suspicion yet very intricate and difficult to draw up right conclusion about they they affirm that they see the ghost of several depart person who at they appear do instigate they to discover such as -lrb- they say -rrb- be instrument to hasten they death threaten sorely to afflict they if they do not make it know to the magistrate they do affirm at the examination and again at the trial of a accuse person that they see the ghost of he two wife -lrb- to whom he have act very ill in they life as be prove by several testimony -rrb- and also that they see the ghost of my wife and daughter -lrb- who die above three year before -rrb- and they do affirm that when the very ghost look on the prisoner at the bar they look red as if the blood would fly out of they face with indignation at he the manner of it be thus : several afflict be before the prisoner at the bar on a sudden they fix all they eye together on a certain place on the floor before the prisoner neither move they eye nor body for some few minute nor answer to any question which be ask they so soon as that trance be over some be out of sight and hearing they be all one after another ask what they see and they do all agree that they see those ghost above mention i be present and hear and see the whole of what pass upon that account during the trial of that person who be accuse to be the instrument of satan 's malice therein sundry pin have be take out the wrist and arm of the afflict and one in time of examination of a suspect person have a pin run through both she upper and lower lip when she be call to speak yet no apparent festering follow thereupon after it be take out some of the afflict as they be strive in they fit in open court have -lrb- by invisible means -rrb- have they wrist bind together with a real cord so as it could hardly be take off without cut some afflict have be find with they arm tie and hang upon a hook from whence other have be force to take they down that they might not expire in that posture some afflict have be draw under table and bed by undiscerned force so as they could hardly be pull out and one be draw half way over the side of a well and with much difficulty recover back again when they be most grievously afflict if they be bring to the accuse and the suspect person 's hand but lay upon they they be immediately relieve out of they torture but if the accuse do but look on they they be immediately strike down again wherefore they use to cover the face of the accuse while they lay they hand on the afflict and then it obtain the desire issue for it have be experience -lrb- both in examination and trial -rrb- that so soon as the afflict come in sight of the accuse they be immediately cast into they fit yea though the accuse be among the crowd of people unknown to the sufferer yet on the first view they be strike down which be observe in a child of four or five year of age when it be apprehend that so many as she would look upon either directly or by turn she head be immediately strike into they fit a iron spindle of a woolen wheel be take very strangely out of a house at salem village be use by a spectre as a instrument of torture to a sufferer not be discernible to the stander by until it be by the say sufferer snatch out of the spectre 's hand and then it do immediately appear to the person present to be really the same iron spindle sometimes in they fit they have have they tongue draw out of they mouth to a fearful length they head turn very much over they shoulder and while they have be so strain in they fit and have they arm and leg etc wrest as if they be quite dislocate the blood have gush plentifully out of they mouth for a considerable time together which some that they might be satisfy that it be real blood take upon they finger and rub on they other hand i see several together thus violently strain and bleed in they fit to my very great astonishment that my fellow mortal should be so grievously distressed by the invisible power of darkness for certainly all considerate person who behold these thing must need be convince they motion in they fit be preternatural and involuntary both as to the manner which be so strange as a well person could not -lrb- at least without great pain -rrb- screw they body into and as to the violence also they be preternatural motion be much beyond the ordinary force of the same person when they be in they right mind so that be such grievous sufferer it would seem very hard and unjust to censure they of consent to or hold any voluntary converse or familiarity with the devil some of they be ask how it come to pass that they be not affright when they see the black-man they say they be at first but not so much afterwards some of they affirm they see the black-man sit on the gallows and that he whisper in the ear of some of the condemn person when they be just ready to be turn off -- even while they be make they last speech some of they have sundry time see a white-man appear among the spectre and as soon as he appear the black-witch vanish they say this white-man have often foretell they what respite they should have from they fit as sometimes a day or two or more which fall out accordingly one of the afflict say she see he in she fit and be with he in a glorious place which have no candle or sun yet be full of light and brightness where there be a multitude in ` white glittering robe ' and they sing the song in rev v 9 she be both to leave that place and say : ` how long shall i stay here let I be along with you ' she be grieve she could stay no longer in that place and company a young woman that be afflict at a fearful rate have a spectre appear to she with a white sheet wrap about it not visible to the stander by until this sufferer -lrb- violently strive in she fit -rrb- snatch at take hold and tear off the corner of that sheet she father be by she endeavored to lay hold of it with she that she might retain what she have get but at the pass away of the spectre he have such a violent twitch of he hand as it would have be tear off immediately thereupon appear in the sufferer 's hand the corner of a sheet a real cloth visible to the spectator which -lrb- as it be say -rrb- remain still to be see it be prove the record of the time continue by substantial evidence against one person accuse that he have such a unusual strength -lrb- though a very little man -rrb- that he could hold out a gun with one hand behind the lock which be near seven foot in the barrel be such as a lusty man could command with both hand after the usual manner of shoot it be also prove that he lift barrel of metal and barrel of molasses out of a canoe alone and that put he finger into a barrel of molasses full within a finger 's length accord to custom he carry it several pace and that he put he finger into the muzzle of a gun which be more than five foot in the barrel and lift up the butt end thereof lock stock and all without any visible help to raise it it be also testify that be abroad with he wife and he wife 's brother he occasionally stay behind let he wife and she brother walk forward but suddenly come up with they he be angry with he wife for what discourse have pass betwixt she and she brother they wonder how he should know it he say : i know you thought at which expression they be amaze ask he how he could do that he say : my god whom i serve make known you thought to I some affirm that there be some hundred of the society of witch considerable company of whom be affirm to muster in arm by beat of drum in time of examination and trial they declare that such a man be wont to call they together from all quarter to witch-meeting with the sound of a diabolical trumpet be bring to see the prisoner at the bar upon they trial they swear in open court that they have oftentimes see they at witch meeting where be feast dancing and jollity as also at devil sacrament and particularly that they see such a man amongst the accursed crew and affirm that he do minister the sacrament of satan to they encourage they to go on in they way and that they should certainly prevail they say also that such a woman be a deacon and serve in distribute the diabolical element they affirm that there be great number of the witch with such sentiment as these prevail it be not at all remarkable that the alleged witch be treat with continual and conspicuous-brutality one old lady of sixty name sarah osburn be hound to death for be a witch the poor old lady who be in fairly good circumstance and appear to have be of good character be put upon she trial for witchcraft for three day more or less ridiculous testimony be give against she and a number of little child who have evidently be carefully coach state upon the stand that mr osburn have bewitch they she be call upon by the court to confess which she decline to do state that she be rather a victim than a criminal she be send to jail and treat with so much brutality that she die before it be possible to execute she in the regulation manner bridget bishop be another of the numerous victim the usual charge be bring against she and she be speedily condemn to death before the sentence be execute the custom of take council with the local clergy be follow these good man while they counsel caution in accept testimony humbly recommend the government to the speedy and vigorous prosecution of such as have render themselves obnoxious by infringe the wholesome statute of the english nation for the detection of witchcraft follow this recommendation double and treble hanging take place and there be enough brutality to appease the appetite of the most vindictive and malicious perhaps the most extraordinary record of witchcraft persecution at the end of the seventeenth century be that of gile corey and he wife martha the singular feature of the case be that the husband have be one of the most enthusiastic declaimer against the unholy crime of witchcraft while he good wife have be rather dispose to ridicule the idea and to condemn the prosecution as persecution she do she best to prevent gile from attend trial and one of the most serious charge against she be that on one occasion she hide the family saddle so as to prevent she lord and master from ride to one of the examination this attempt to assert woman 's rights two hundred year ago be resent very bitterly and two enthusiastic witch-hunter be send to she house to entrap she into a confession on the way they make inquiry which result in they be able to patch up a charge against the woman for walk in ghostly attire during the night when the detective call at the house she tell they she know the object of they visit but that she be no witch and do not believe there be such a thing the mere fact of she know the object of they visit be regard as conclusive evidence against she although a fair-minded person would naturally suggest that in view of local sentiment she guess be a very easy one the poor woman be immediately arrest and place on trial several little child be examine and these shout out in the witness-stand that when the afflict woman bit she lip in she grief they be seize with bodily pain which continue until she loosen she tooth the chronicle of the court tell we with much solemnity that when the woman 's hand be tie she victim do not suffer but the moment the cord be remove they have fit even she husband be call as a witness against she he evidence do not appear to have be very important or relevant but another witness a mr pope who appear to have be a expert in these matter and to have be call at nearly every trial take off she shoe in court and throw it at the prisoner 's head a act of indecorum which be condone on the ground of the evident sincerity of the culprit the poor woman be condemn as a matter of course and when she be remove to jail a deputation from the church of which she be a member call upon she and excommunicate she she mount the ladder which lead to the gallows with much dignity and die without any attempt to prolong she life by a confession the fate of she husband be still more terrible notwithstanding he zeal and the fact that he have give evidence against he own wife he be arrest charge with a similar offense whether hypnotic influence be exert or whether the examine justice merely imagine thing against the prisoner can not be know at this time the court record however state that while the witness be on the stand they be so badly afflict with fit and hurt that the prisoner 's hand have to be tie before they could continue they testimony unlike he wife the poor man do not deny the existence of witchcraft and merely whine out in reply to the magistrate 's censure that he be a poor creature and could not help it the evidence against he be very slight indeed and he be remand to jail where he lay unmolested and apparently forget for five or six month he be then excommunicate by he church and bring before the court again sojourn in jail seem to have make the old man stubborn for when he be once more confront by he persecutor he decline to plead on the ground that there be no charge against he a old obsolete english law be revive against he and the terrible sentence be pronounced that for stand mute he be remand to the prison from whence he come and put into a low dark chamber there he be to be lay on he back on the bare floor without clothing as great a weight of iron as he could bear be to be place upon he body and there to remain the first day he be to have three morsel of bread and on the second day three draught of water to be select from the nearest pool that could be find thus be the diet to be alternate day by day until he either answer he accusation or die on September 19th 1692 death come as a happy relief to the miserable man who have beg the sheriff to add greater weight so as to expedite the end this be the only case on record of a man have be press to death in new england for refuse to plead or for any other offense there be a few case on record where this inhuman law be enforce previously in england but it be always regard as a relic of mediaeval barbarity and the fact that it be revive in the witch persecution be a very significant one after he death a attempt be make to justify the act by the statement that corey himself have press a man to death this justification appear feeble and to be without any corroborative testimony another very remarkable witch story have about it a tinge of romance although the main fact actually occur as state a sailor name orcutt leave he sweetheart on one of he regular voyage promise to return at a early date to claim he bride the girl he leave behind he whose name be margaret appear to have be a very attractive innocent young lady who suffer considerably from the jealousy of a rival soon after the departure of she lover the witch difficulty arise and the young girl be much worried and grieve at what happen on one occasion she happen to say to a friend that she be sorry for the unfortunate witch who be to be hang on the follow day the friend appear to have be a enemy in disguise and turn to margaret tell she that if she talk that way she would herself be try as a witch as a evidence of how vindictive justice be at this time the poor girl be arrest by the sheriff on the follow day in the name of the king and queen on a charge of witchcraft the young girl be lead through the street and jeer at by the crowd arrive at the court she alleged friend give a variety of testimony against she the usual story about ache and pain be of course tell some other detail be add thus margaret by look at a number of hen have kill they she have also be see run around at night in spectral attire the poor girl faint in the dock and this be regard as a chastisement from above and as direct evidence of she guilt she be remove to the jail where she have to lie on a hard bench only to be drag back into court the follow day to be ask a number of outrageous question with sob she protest she innocence but as she do so the witness against she call out that they be in torment and that the very motion of the girl 's lip cause they terrible pain she be sentence to be hang with eight other alleged witch two day later and be carry back faint to she cell in a few minute the girl be delirious and begin to talk about she lover and of she future prospects even she sister be not allow to remain with she during the night and the frail young creature be leave to the tender mercy of heartless jailor a few hour before the time set for execution young orcutt sail into the harbor and before daybreak he be at the house here he learn for the first time the awful calamity which have befall he sweetheart in he absence at 7 o'clock he be allow to enter the jail with the convict girl 's sister at the prison door they be inform that the wicked girl have die during the night know that there be no hope under any circumstance of the sentence be remit the bereaved one regard the news as good and although they break down with grief at the shipwreck of they life they both realize that to use the devout word of the victim 's sister the lord have deliver she from the hand of she enemy the record of brutality in connection with the witch agitation might be continue almost without limit for the number of victim be very great visitor to danvers to-day be often show by local guide where some of the tragedy of the persecution be commit the superstition be finally drive away by educational enlightenment and it seem astounding that it last as long as it do two hundred year have nearly elapse since the craze die out and it be but charitable to admit that although many of the witness must have be corrupt and perjure the majority of those connect with the case be thoroughly in earnest and that although they rejoice at the undoing of the ungodly they regret very much be make the instrument of that undoing chapter iii in picturesque new york some local error correct -- a trip down the hudson river -- the last of the mohican -- the home of rip van winkle -- the lady of vassar and they home -- west point and its history -- sing sing prison -- the fall of niagara -- indian in new york state resident in the older state of the east be frequently twit with they ignorance concern the newer state of the west and of the habit and custom of those who have take horace greeley 's advice at various time turn they face toward the setting sun determine to take advantage of the fertility of the soil and grow up with the country of which they know but little it need but a few day ' sojourn in a eastern city by a western man to realize how sublimely ignorant the new englander be concern at least three-fourth of he native land the writer be on a recent occasion ask in a eastern city how he manage to get along without any of the comfort of civilization and whether he do not find it necessary to order all of he clothing and comfort by mail from the east when he reply that in the larger city at any rate of the west there be retail emporium fully up to date in all matter of fashion and improvement and caterer who could supply the latest delicacy in season at reasonable price a incredulous smile be the result and regret be express that local prejudice and pride should so blind a man to the actual truth yet there be no exaggeration whatever in the reply as the experienced traveler know well neither chicago nor st loui be really in the west so far as point of the compass be concern both of these city be hundred of mile east of the geographical center of the united state but they be both speak of as out west and be include in the territory in which the extreme eastern man be apt to think people live on the coarsest fare and clothe themselves in the roughest possible manner yet the impartial and disinterested new york or boston man who visit either of these city speedily admit that he frequently find it difficult to believe that he be not in he own much loved city so close be the resemblance in many respects between the business house and the method of do business denver be look upon by the average easterner almost in the light of a frontier city away out in the rocky surround by awe-inspiring scenery no doubt but also by grizzly bear and ferocious indian san francisco be too far away to be think very intelligently but a great many people regard that home of wealth and elegance as another extreme western die-in-your-boot rough-and-tumble city this ignorance for it be ignorance rather than prejudice result from the mania for european travel which be formerly a characteristic of the atlantic state but which of recent year have like civilization travel west the eastern man who have make money be much more likely to take he family on a european tour than on a trip through he native country he incur more expense by cross the atlantic and although he add to he store of knowledge by travel he do not learn matter of equal importance to he as if he have cross the american continent and enlighten himself as to the man and manners in its different section and state nor be this sectional ignorance confine by any means to the east people in the west be apt to form a entirely erroneous impression of eastern state the word east to they convey a impression of dense population overcrowding and manufacturing activity that there be thousand and thousand of acre of scenic grandeur as well as farm land in some of the most crowded state be not realize and that this be the case will be news to many last year a party of western people be travel to new york and on they way run through pennsylvanium around the picturesque horse shoe curve in the allegheny and along the bank of the romantic and historic susquehanna a member of the party be see to be wrap in thought for a long time he be finally ask what be worry he i be think be he reply how singular it be that the republican party run up a majority of something like a hundred thousand at the election and i be wonder where all the folk come from who do the voting i have not see a dozen house in the last hour we friend be only put into expression the thought which be indulge in pretty generally by the entire crowd those who be make the transcontinental trip for the first time marvel at the expanse of open country and the exquisite scenery through which they pass and they be wonder how they ever come to think that the noise of the hammer and the smoke of the factory chimney be part and parcel of the east where they know the money as well as the wise man come from the object of this book be to present some of the prominent feature of all section of the united state it be necessary to remove as far as possible this false impression and in order to do so we propose to give a brief description of the romantic and historic river hudson this river run through the great state of new york concern which the greatest ignorance prevail the state itself be dwarf in common estimation by the magnitude of its metropolis and if the greater new york project be carry into execution and the limit of new york city extend so as to take in brooklyn and other adjoining city this feeling will be intensify rather than otherwise but above the harlem to use a expression so commonly use when a political contest be on there be thousand of square mile of what may be call country include picturesque mountain pine land which be not susceptible of cultivation and be preserve for recreation and pleasure purpose and fertile valley divide up into homestead and farm it be through country such as this that the river hudson flow it rise in the adirondack mountain some 300 mile from the sea and more than 4000 foot above its level it act as a feeder and outlet for numerous larger and smaller lake at first it be a pretty little brook almost dry in summer but noisy and turbulent in the rainy season from schroon lake near saratoga it receive such a large quantity of water that it begin to put on air it cease to be a country brook and become a small river a little farther down the bed of the river fall suddenly produce fall of much beauty which vary in intensity and volume with the season at glen fall the upper hudson pass through a long defile over a precipice some hundred foot long it be here that cooper receive much of he inspiration and one of the most startling incident in he the last of the mohican be suppose to have be enact at the fall when troy be reach the river take upon itself quite another aspect and run with singular straightness almost direct to new york harbor tourist delight to sail up the hudson and they find a immense quantity of scenery of the most delightful character with fresh discovery at every trip millionaire regard the bank of the hudson as the most suitable spot upon which to build country mansion and rural retreat many of these mansion be surround by exquisitely keep grounds and beautiful parterre which be in themselves well worth a long journey to see beacon island a few mile below albany be point out to the traveler as particularly interesting because four county corner upon the river just across from it the island have a history of more than ordinary interest it use to be preside over by a patroon who levy toll on all pass vessel right in the neighborhood be original dutch settlement and the descendant of the original immigrant hold themselves quite aloof from the english-speaking public they retain the language as well as the manners and custom of holland and the tourist who stray among they find himself for the moment distinctly a stranger in a strange land the country abound with legend and romance and be literally honeycomb with historic memory the town of hudson a little farther down the river be interesting because it be near here that henry hudson land in September 1609 he be immediately surround by indian who give he a immense amount of information and add to he store of experience quite a number of novel one here be the mouth of the catskill river with the wonderful catskill mountain in the rear it will be news indeed to many of we reader that in these wild -lrb- only partially explore -rrb- mountain there be forest where bear wild cat and snake abound in large number many people of comparative affluence reside in the hill where there be hotel and pleasure resort of the most costly character during the storm of winter these lover of the picturesque find themselves snow in for several day at the time and have a little experience in the way of frontier and exploration life the sunrise in the catskill be render uniquely beautiful by the peculiar formation of the ground and from the same reason the thunder storm be often thrilling in character and awful in they magnificence waterfall of all size and kind brook with scenery along the bank of every description forest meadow and lofty peak make monotony impossible and give to the catskill region a air of majesty which be not easy to describe on paper every visitor ask to be show the immortalize bridge at sleepy hollow and as he gaze upon it he think of washington irving 's unrivaled description of this country he speedily agree with irve that every change of weather and indeed every hour of the day produce some change in the magical hue and shape of these mountain and they be regard by all the good wife far and near as perfect barometer when the weather be fair and settle they be clothe in blue and purple and print they bold outline on the clear evening sky but sometimes when the rear of the landscape be clear and cloudless they will gather a hood of gray vapor which in the last ray of the setting sun will grow up like a crown of glory here it be that rip van winkle be suppose to have live and sleep and astonish he old friend and neighbor and they descendant the path along which rip van winkle march up the mountain prior to he prolonged sleep be show to the tourist who hear at he hotel in the conveyance he hire for the day and among the very mountain themselves countless local legend as to rip van winkle and as to the percentage of fact and fiction in washington irving 's masterly production if he be antiquarian enough to desire it he can be show the very spot upon which rip van winkle lay himself down to sleep local opinion differ as to the exact spot but there be so much faith display by the people that no one can doubt that they be genuine in they belief and sincere in they conviction the tourist can also be show the site of the old country inn upon the bench in front of which rip van winkle sit and astonish the native by he extraordinary conversation and he refusal to believe that a generation have elapse since he be in the town last the chair upon which dame van winkle be suppose to have sit while she be berate she idle and incorrigible lord and master be also show to the visitor and the more credulous one gaze with interest upon a flagon which they be assure be the very one out of which rip van winkle drink the only thing need to complete the illusion be the appearance of the old dog which the man who have so grievously oversleep himself be sure would have recognize he have he put in he appearance it be almost impossible to outlive one 's welcome in the catskill mountain or to wear one 's self out with sight see so many be the novelty which greet the gaze the catskill be abound with tradition quite as interesting and extraordinary as the rip van winkle story they be know originally as the mountain of the sky a name give they by the indian who for so many generation hold they in undisputed possession hyde peak the loftiest point in the catskill be regard by the indian as the throne of the great spirit and the dutch settler who crowd out the indian seem to have be almost as generous in they superstition and legend these settler drop the name mountain of the sky and adopt the to they more euphonic one of the katzberg mountain from which the more modern name have be adopt the village of catskill deserve more than a pass notice it be the home of a large number of well-known people include the widow of many man whose name be famous in history the old livingston manor be located near the village and a little farther down be barrytown where the wealthy astor have a palatial summer resort a little farther down the river be two town with a distinctly ancient and dutch aspect they be settle by the dutch over two hundred year ago and there be many house still stand which be build last century so strongly do we forefather construct they home and make they veritable castle and impregnable fortress another very old town on the hudson be the celebrated seat of learn poughkeepsie of this it have be say that there be more tuition to the square inch than in any other town in the world the most celebrated of the educational institution at this point be the vassar college the first lady ' seminary in the world and the butt of so many joke and sarcasm poughkeepsie be not quite as old as the hill above it but it be exceedingly ancient here be hold the celebrated state convention for the ratification of the federal constitution in which alexander hamilton governor clinton and john jay and other man of immortal name take part it be only comparatively recently that the first stone building erect in this town be tear down to make room for improvement after it have weather storm and time in the most perfect manner for more than a century and a quarter at newburgh a few mile farther south a old gray mansion be point out to the visitor as washington 's headquarters on several occasion during the revolution fortunately the state have secure possession of the house and protect it from the hand of the vandal this wonderful old house be build just a century and a half ago a hundred and twelve year ago washington 's army finally disband from this point and the visitor can see within the well-preserved wall of this house the historical room with its seven door within which washington and he general hold they numerous conference and in which there be still to be find almost countless relic of the revolutionary war while sailing on the hudson a glimpse be obtain of west point the great military school from which so many of america 's celebrated general have graduate west point command one of the finest river pass in the country the fort and chain stretch across the river be capture by the british in 1777 -lrb- two year after it be decide that west point should be establish a military post -rrb- but be abandon after burgoyne 's surrender the continental force then substitute stronger work west point thus have a history run right back to the revolutionary war and the ruin of fort clinton and montgomery which be erect in 1775 be in the immediate vicinity there be 176 room in the cadet barrack there be no attempt at ornamentation and the quarter be almost rigid in they simplicity and lack of home comfort not only be the embryo warrior teach the rudiment of drill and warfare but they be also give stern lesson in camp life each young man act as he own chambermaid and have to keep he little room absolutely neat and free from litter and dirt of any kind the west point chapel be of interest on account of the number of tablet to be find in it immortalize many of the revolutionary hero a wind road lead up to the cemetery where be rest the remains of many other celebrated general include winfield scott the state camp meet annually at peekskill another very ancient town replete with revolutionary war reminiscence it be settle in the year 1764 by a dutch navigator from whom it take its name another house use by general washington for headquarters be to be find near the town as well as st peter 's church in which the father of he country worship tarrytown be another of the famous spot on the hudson near here washington irving live and on the old sleepy hollow road be to be find the oldest religious structure in new york state the church be build by the dutch settler in the year 1699 and close to it be the cemetery in which washington irving be inter sunnyside irving 's home be a most interesting stone structure whose numerous gable be cover with ivy the immense mass of which have grow from a few slip present to irve by sir walter scott a sadder sight to the tourist on the hudson but one which be of necessity full of interest be the sing sing prison just below croton point in this great state jail a army of convict be keep busy manufacture various article of domestic use the prison itself take its name from the indian word ossining which mean stone upon stone the village of sing sing strange to say contain many charming residence and the proximity of the state 's prison do not seem to have any particular effect on the spirit and the idea of those live in it still further down the hudson be riverside park new york the scene of general grant 's tomb which overlook the lower section of the river concern which we have endeavor to impart some little information of a interesting character of the tomb we present a very accurate illustration while in new york state the tourist whether he be american or european be careful to pay a visit to the niagara fall which have be view by a greater number of people than any other scene or wonder on the american continent this fact be due in part to the admirable railroad facility which bring niagara within easy ride distance of the great city of the east it be also due very largely to the extraordinary nature of the fall themselves and to the grandeur of the scene which greet the eye of the spectator the river niagara be a little more than thirty-three mile long in its short course it take care of the overflow of lake superior michigan huron and erie and as it discharge the water of these lake into lake ontario it fall 334 foot or more than ten foot to the mile the rapid start some sixteen mile from lake erie as the river channel suddenly narrow the velocity of the current increase with great abruptness the rapid be but a third of a mile in length during which distance there be a fall of fifty-two foot the boat catch in these rapid stand but a poor chance as at the end of the torrent the water dash down a cataract over 150 foot deep the canadian fall pass over a rocky ledge of immense area and in the descent leave a space with a watery roof the space be know as the cave of the wind with a entrance from the canadian side the canadian fall have a sweep of 1100 foot and be considerably deeper than the other it be little more than a waste of word to endeavor to convey a impression of the grandeur and magnificence of niagara people have visit it from all part of the world monarch and prince have acknowledge that it exceed they wildest expectation and every one who have gaze upon it agree that it be almost impossible to exaggerate its grandeur or to say too much concern its magnitude even after the water have dash wildly 150 foot downward the descent continue the river bed contract in width gradually for seven mile below the fall where the whirlpool rapid be to be see after the second fall the river seem to have exhaust its vehemence and run more deliberately cut its channel deeper into the rocky bed and drop its sensational habit some writer have hazard a opinion that as time change all thing so the day may come when niagara fall shall cease to exist improbable as this idea naturally sound it have some foundation in fact for there have be marvelous change in the fall during the last few generation about two hundred and fifty year ago a sketch be take of niagara and a hundred year later another artist make a careful and apparently accurate picture these two differ from one another materially and they also differ greatly from the appearance of the fall at the present time both of the old picture show a third fall on the canadian side it be know that about a hundred year ago several immense fragment of rock be break off the rocky ledge on the american side and more recently a earthquake affect the appearance of the canadian fall certain it be that the immense corrosive action of the water and the gradual eat away of the rock on both the ledge and basin have have the effect of change the location of the fall and force up the river in the direction of lake erie time alone can decide the momentous question as to whether the fall will eventually be so change in appearance as to be beyond recognition the lover of the beautiful and grand and more especially the antiquarian sincerely trust that no such calamity will ever take place the history of the indian in new york state be a very interesting one prior to the discovery of america by columbus the section of country include a majority of new york state and the northern portion of pennsylvanium be occupy by the iroquois mohawk oneida onondaga cayuga and seneca these form the historical five nation of whom writer of the last century tell we so much that be of last importance these tribe be self-governed they ruler be select on the hereditary plan there be a federal union between they for purpose of offense and defense and they call themselves collectively the people of the long house this imaginary house have a eastern door at the mouth of the mohawk river and a western door at the fall of niagara bashfulness be not a characteristic of these old-time red man who have a special name of many letter for themselves which be interpret mean man surpass all other they trace they origin from the serpent-haired god atotarhon and other tradition attribute they power of confederation and alliance to the legendary hiawatha they build frame cabin and defend they home with much skill they dress be chiefly make out of deer and elk hide and relic still in existence show that they have good idea of agriculture tanning pottery and even carve they be about 12000 strong and they appear to have be the most powerful indian combination prior to the arrival of the white man they be powerful in war as well as comparatively sensible in peace they

white man be much more friendly than might have be expect and almost from the first they display a conciliatory attitude and enter into alliance with the newcomer they fight side by side with the new englander against the french and the hostile indian who ally with they and in the year 1710 five of they sachem or legislator cross the atlantic and be receive with honor by the queen of england in diplomacy they do not prove themselves in the long run as skillful as the newcomer who by degree secure from they the land over which they have previously exercise sovereign rights the survivor of these indian have not sink to as low a level as many other tribe have do it be not generally know in the west that there be on the new york reservation at the present time more than 5000 indian include about 2700 survivor of the once great seneca tribe the state of new york be about the same size as the kingdom of england it be the nineteenth state in the union in point of size possess area of more than 49000 square mile of which 1500 square mile be cover by water form portion of the lake its lake coast line extend 200 mile on lake ontario and 75 mile on lake erie lake champlain flow along the eastern frontier for more than 100 mile receive the water of lake george which have be describe as the como of america the lake have a singular history it be originally call by the french canadian who discover it the lake of the holy sacrament and it be the scene of battle and conflict for over a hundred year the capital of the empire state with its population of such magnitude that it exceed that of more than twenty important foreign nation be albany which be found by the dutch in 1623 and which have since earn for itself the title of the edinburgh of america compare with new york city it be dwarf in point of population and commercial importance of the actual metropolis of the great empire state it be impossible to speak at any length in the limited space at one 's command of new york itself mr chauncey depew say recently in he forcible manner to-day in the sisterhood of state she be a empire in all that constitute a great commonwealth a industrious intelligent and prosperous population of 5000000 of people live within she border in the value of she farm and farm product and in she manufacturing industry she be the first state in the union she sustain over 1000

penetrate and develop every accessible corner of the state and maintain against all rivalry and competition she commercial prestige chapter iv in the center of the country the geographical center of the united state and its location west of the mississippus river -- the center of population -- history of fort riley -- the gallant seventh -- early trouble of kansa -- extermination of the buffalo -- but a few survivor out of many million kansa be include by most people in the list of western state by many it be regard as in the extreme west if the pilgrim father have be tell that the haven of refuge they have select would within two or three hundred year be part of a great english-speaking nation with some 70000000 of inhabitant and with its center some 1500 mile westward they would have listen to the story with pardonable incredulity and would have feel like invoke condemnation upon the head of the reckless prophet who be address they yet kansa be to-day in the very center of the united state this be not a printer 's error nor a play upon word much as the new englander may suspect the one or the other there be a time when the word west be use to apply to any section of the country a day 's journey on horseback from the atlantic coast for year and even generation everything west of the allegheny mountain or of the ohio river be out west even to-day it be probable that a majority of the resident in the strictly eastern state regard anything west of the mississippus river as strictly western there be no doubt that when horace greeley tell the young man of the country to go west and grow up with the country he use the term in its common and not its strictly geographical sense and many thousand youth who take the advice of the philosopher and statesman stop close to the bank of the mississippus river and have grow rich in they new home it can not be too generally realize however that the mississippus river slowly wend its way down to the gulf of mexico well within the eastern half of the greatest nation in the world at several point in the circuitous course of the father of water the distance between the river and the atlantic ocean be about 1000 mile in a equal number of point the distance to the pacific ocean be 2000 mile show that whatever may be say of the tributary of the mississippus river and especially of its gigantic tributary the missourus the mississippus be a eastern and not a western river we give a illustration of the point which competent surveyor and engineer tell we be the exact geographical center of the united state proper the monument standing in the center of this great country be surround by a iron railing and be visit again and again by tourist who find it difficult to believe the fact that a point apparently so far western be really central the center of the united state have go west with the absorption of territory and the louisiana purchase the centenary of which we shall shortly celebrate have a great effect on the location the center of population have move less spasmodically but with great regularity a hundred year ago the city of baltimore be the center of population and it be not until the middle of the century that ohio boast of own the population center for some twenty year it remain near cincinnatus but during the '80 it go as far as columbus indiana where it be at the last government census at the present time it be probably twenty or thirty mile west of columbus and in the near future fort riley will be the population as well as the geographical center fort riley be a interesting spot for civilian and soldier alike have be select by the government as the permanent training school for the two mount branch of the service -- the cavalry and light artillery -- its 21000 acre have be improve at lavish expense it seem really remarkable that so metropolitan a bit of ground could be find out on the plain where though civilization be make rapid stride and the luxury of wealth be be acquire by the advance population it be unusual to find macadamized street and building that can harbor a regiment and still not be crowd yet such be some of the characteristic of fort riley reservation and the newness of it all be the best evidence of the interest the war department have take in its development many of the recently erect building would grace the capital itself nearly $ 1000000 have be expend in the past four year in new structure all of magnesia limestone and build along the line of the most approve modern architecture and of a character which insure score of year of usefulness the fort be situate on the left bank of the kansas river near the junction of the republican and smoky hill fork it be first lay out in 1852 and have ever since be one of the lead western post located though it be far out on the kansas prairie it have particularly in late year be fully in touch with the social life of the east through the addition of new officer and the interchange of post courtesy the post as it stand to-day consist of officer ' quarter artillery and cavalry barracks administration building shed hospital dispensary etc scatter over 150 acre of ground the kansa river be form just southwest of it by the union of the smoky hill and republican fork and the topography for practice and sightseeing could not be surpass in the state five mile of macadamized street 150000 foot of stone and gravel walk six mile of sewer four mile of water and steam heating pipe lead to every room of each of the sixty building make up the equipment which be of course of the highest quality throughout all the stone be quarry on the reservation and be of last variety and make building which bear a truly substantial appearance the government have a idea toward permanency in its improvement the history of fort riley have be one of vicissitude when it be lay out in 1852 it be at first call camp center but be change to its present name by order of the war department in honor of general b c riley in 1855 the fort suffer from asiatic cholera and major e a ogden one of the original commissioner who lay out the reservation who be stay there nurse the soldier with a heroic attachment to duty and himself fall a victim to the disease a handsome monument mark he rest place he be a true soldier hero and he name be still speak in reverence by the attach of the post another notable feature of the reservation be the dismantle rock wall to the east of the fort which be all that now remain of the once ambitious capitol building of the state of kansas it have a strange history be the pawnee house in which the territorial legislature meet in the early ante-bellum day confident of protection by the soldier from the roaming indian band infest the prairie a famous dweller at the fort for two decade be old comanche the only living creature to escape from the custer massacre on the side of the government he be the horse ridden by a officer in that memorable fight and by miracle escape after have seven ball fire into he he be find roaming over the prairie after the massacre and be order put on the retired list and station at fort riley where for twenty year he be pet and care for but never ride he only service be to be lead in procession of ceremony drape in mourn now that he be dead he body have be preserve with the taxidermist 's best skill and be one of the state 's most note relic the fort have be of unusual interest of late in addition to the maneuver of the school for mount service in which the soldier have be regularly drill engage in sham battle throw up mimic fortification ford the river etc the war signal service have be conduct some interesting experiment the signal service have have its huge balloon which be exhibit at the world 's fair at the post and its ascension and the operation put in practice have prove very attractive and instructive the new ride hall or cavalry practice building make it possible for the training school to go on the year round regardless of the weather it have a open floor space 300 foot long and 100 foot wide make it a admirable room for the purpose the fort riley troops be always call on when there be trouble in the west they have put down a dozen indian uprising on the plain and only a few month ago be send for to keep order in chicago during the railway strike from this trip four old member of the post be bring back dead have meet they fate in the bursting of a caisson while march along a paved street the fort be the great pleasure resort of kansas the late commanding officer colonel forsyth now general forsyth be much give to hospitality and the people of the state take great pride in the post 's advancement and its victory during the summer on several occasion the national holiday especially the soldier receive and excursion train bring hundred of visitor from every direction who be delighted to feast they eye on real cannon uniform and shoulder strap they be entertain royally drill salute sham battle and parade occupy every hour of the day and in the evening the drill floor become a dancing place for all who enjoy the delight of a military ball the history of the fort have be in a measure that of the seventh cavalry which for nearly two decade have have its residence there and become identify with the spot the seventh cavalry date its glory from before the day of the intrepid custer whose memory it cherish it have take part in score of indian battle -- indeed there have not for year be a uprising in the west in which it have not do duty its last considerable encounter be at wound knee and drexel mission where the custer massacre be in a degree avenge here it lose twenty-four of its member and a magnificent granite monument have be erect at the fort to they memory it bear the name of those who fall and tell briefly the story of they bravery in the wound knee battle on the plain of dakota during the closing day of 1891 the four troops of the regiment be treacherously surprise by the sioux and because after the attack colonel forsyth order a charge result in the killing of many of the savage he be suspend by he superior officer general mile for disobedience of order which be not to fire on the enemy a investigation however amply justified he action and he be reinstate in charge of he post as before early in November 1894 on the promotion of general mccook to be major general colonel forsyth step up to the brigadier generalship and he place at fort riley will be take by colonel sumner there be a rumor however in army circle that the old seventh will be station in the far northwest and the fifth cavalry will succeed it as resident regiment here the post have become so closely identify with the fortune of the former regiment that it will seem strange to have any other troops call it home there be usually at the fort three squadron of cavalry of four troops each and five battery of light artillery engage in the maneuver of the school for mount service which have its headquarters for the entire army here the principal object of this school be instruction in the combined operation of the cavalry and light artillery and this object be keep steadily in view the troops of each arm form a sub-school and be instruct nine month in the year in they own arm preparatory to the three month of combined operation thus the battery be frequently practice in road march in rapid gait the kansa river be often ford rough hill be climb at double quick and gun be bring to action on all sort of difficult ground with the result that when the combined operation begin the battery may be maneuver over all kind of obstacle among the plan of the future be one which be a favorite with general sheridan of make fort riley the horse-furnishing headquarters for the entire army the location be so central it insure the nearest approach to perfect acclimation of animal send to any part of the union two plan be be contemplate for the accomplishment of this object one be to make it a breed station the other be to simply make it a purchase station which shall buy of the farmer of the west the horse need by the army and train the animal for regular use before send they to the various post present plan also include a increase in the number of soldier station at fort riley to 3000 if the proposed increase in the standing army be carry out there may be more than that the government evidently have faith in the location of the fort while it have abandon and consolidate other station it have all the time be increase its expenditure here and the estimate for the next year aggregate expenditure of over $ 500000 provide the appropriation committee do its duty there be plan of still further beautify the grounds and the addition of more turnpike and macadamized road the state of kansa and especially geary and riley county in which the fort be situate reap a considerable benefit from its location the perishable produce of the commissary department come from the country around hundred of horse be buy at round price while the soldier trade have send junction city four mile west ahead of all competitor in central kansa for volume of business and population naturally kansa be glad to see fort riley a permanency and hope that it may be make the government 's chief western post kansa have be speak of as the most wonderful state in the union and in many respects it be fully entitle to its reputation in this respect it have have enough discouragement and drawback to ruin half a dozen state and nothing but the phenomenal fertility of the soil and the push and go of the pioneer who claim the state as they own have enable kansa to withstand difficulty and to sail buoyantly through wave of danger into harbor of refuge in its early day border warfare hinder development and drive many most desirable settler to more peaceful spot since then the prefix bleeding have again be use repeatedly in connection with the state because of the succession of drought and plague of grasshopper and chinch bug which have imperil its credit and fair name but kansa remain to-day a great state with a magnificent future before it the fertility of the soil be more than phenomenal kansa corn be know throughout the world for its excellency and at the world 's fair in 1893 it take highest award for both the white and yellow variety in addition to this it secure the gold medal for the best corn in the world as well as the highest award for red winter wheat flour sorghum sugar and apple indeed kansa soil produce almost anything to perfection and the state thanks largely to work of irrigation in the extreme western section be produce larger quantity of indispensable agricultural product every year the very motto of the state indicate the early trouble through which it go the literal interpretation be to the star -lrb- and stripe -rrb- through difficulty the state be generally know now as the sunflower state and for many year the sword have give place to the plowshare but the very existence of fort riley show that t he be not always the condition of affair early in the eighteenth century french fur-trader cross over into kansa and later on spanish explorer be strike with the possibility of the fertile plain local indian tribe be then at war but a sense of common danger cause the antagonistic red man to unite and the white immigrant be massacre in a body after the famous missourus compromise of 1820 and the kansas-nebraska act of thirty year later the slave issue become a very live one in kansa and for some time the state be in a condition border upon civil war the convention of 1859 at wyandotte settle this difficulty and place kansa in the list of anti-slavery state some ten year ago after kansa have enjoy a period of the most unique prosperity from a agricultural standpoint the general impression begin to prevail that the state be destine to become almost immediately the greatest in the nation corn field be platt out into town site and addition to exist city be arrange in every direction for a time it appear as though there be little exaggeration in the extravagant forecast of future greatness town lot sell in a most remarkable manner many valuable corner increase in value ten and twenty-fold in a single night the era of railroad building be coincident with the town boom craze and eastern people be so anxious to obtain a share of the enormous profit to be make by speculate in kansas town lot that money be telegraph to agent and bank all over the state and option on real estate be sell very much on the plan adopt by trader in stock and bond in wall street the greed of some if not most of the speculator soon kill the goose which lay the golden egg the boom burst in a most pronounced manner people who have lose they head find they again and many a farmer who have abandon agriculture in order to get rich by trading in lot go back to he plow and he chore a sadder and wiser although generally poorer man many hundred of thousand of dollar change hand during the boom exactly who beat the game to use the gambler 's expression have never be know certain it be that for every man in kansa who admit that he make money out of the excitement and inflation there be at least fifty who say that the boom well-nigh ruin they kansas be as large as great britain larger than the whole of new england combine and a veritable empire in itself it be a state of magnificent proportion and of the most unique and delightful history three and a half century ago coronado the great pioneer prospector and adventurer hunt kansa from end to end in search of the precious metal which he have be tell could be find there in abundance he wander over the immense stretch of prairie and search along the creek bottom without find what he seek he speak in he record of mighty plain and sandy heath smooth and wearisome and bare of wood all the way the plain be as full of crooked-back ox as the mountain serena in spain be of sheep these crooked-back ox be of course buffalo or more correctly speak species of the american bison no other continent be ever bless with a more magnificent and vary selection of beast and bird in forest and prairie than be north america kansa in particular be fortunate in the possession of thousand of herd of buffalo now it have none except a few in a domesticated state with they old regal glory depart forever when we read the report of traveler and trapper write little more than half a century ago and treat of the enormous buffalo herd that cover the prairie as far as the eye could reach we wonder whether these description can be real or whether they be not more in the line of fable and the outgrowth of a too vivid imagination if thirty year ago some wiseacre have come forward and predict that it would become necessary to devise means for the protection of this enormous amount of game he would have be laugh out of countenance yet this extraordinary condition of affair have actually come to pass entire species of animal which belong to the magnificent fauna of north america be already extinct or be rapidly become so the sea-cow be one of these animal the last specimen of which be see in 1767 and 1768 the californian sea-elephant and the sea-dog of the west indy have share a like fate not a trace of these animal have be find for a long time the extinction of the labrador duck and the great auk have often be deplore both of these bird may be regard as practically extinct the last skeleton of the great auk be sell for $ 600 the last skin for $ 650 and the last egg bring the fabulous sum of $ 1500 last not least the american bison be a thing of the past it have be historically prove that at the time of the discovery of america the buffalo herd cover the entire enormous territory from pennsylvanium to oregon and nevada and down to mexico and thirty year ago the large emigrant caravan which travel from the eastern state across the mississippus to the gold field of californium meet with herd of buffalo not numbering thousand but hundred of thousand the construction train of the first pacific railroad be frequently interrupted and delay by wander buffalo herd today the united state may be traverse from end to end and not a single buffalo will be see and nothing remain to even indicate they presence but the deep well-trodden path which they make year ago rain have not be able to wash away these trace and they be count among the feature of the prairie where the bison once roam in undisturbed glory it be a difficult task for the government to gather the last remnant about 150 to 200 head to stock yellowstone park with they and to prevent they complete extinction undoubtedly the buffalo be the most stupid animal of the prairie in small flock he elude the hunter well enough but in herd of thousand he care not a whit for the shooting at the flank of he army any indian or trapper station behind some shrub or earth hill could kill dozen of buffalo without disturb the herd by the swish of the arrow the report of the rifle or the die groan of the wounded animal a general stampede ensue at time which often lead the herd into morass or the quick-sand of the river where they perish miserably the destruction be still greater when the leader of the herd come upon some yawning abyss those behind drive he down into the deep and the entire herd follow blindly only to be dash to death the very stupidity of the bison help to exterminate the race where human agency would have seem well nigh inadequate among the large game of the continent the bison be the most important and furnish the numerous indian tribe not only with abundant food but other thing as well they cover they tent with the thick skin and make saddle boat lasso and shoe from they fold up they use they as bed and wear they around they shoulder as a protection against the winter 's cold spoon and other utensil for the household could be make from they hoof and horn and they bone be shape into all kind of arm and weapon the life and existence of the prairie indian depend almost entirely upon that of the buffalo there be no doubt that the indian kill many buffalo but while the damage may have be great there be not much of a reduction noticeable in they number for the buffalo cow be a enormous breeder condition be change however when the white man arrive with he rifle settle down on the shore of the atlantic ocean and begin to drive the aborigine of the american continent further and further west with this crowd back of the indian begin that also of the buffalo and the destruction of the latter be far more rapid than that of the former it be about the middle of the seventeenth century when the first english colonist climb the summit of the allegheny mountain enormous herd of buffalo graze then in western pennsylvanium ohio indiana illinoi tennessee and in the famous blue grass region of kentucky how fast the buffalo become exterminate may best be illustrate by the fact that at the beginning of the present century the bison have entirely disappear from the eastern bank of the mississippus a few isolate herd could be find in kentucky in 1792 in 1814 the animal have disappear in indiana and illinoi when the white settler cross the mississippus to seek connection with the territory on the pacific coast the buffalo dominion once so vast decrease from year to year and finally it be split in two and divide into a northern and southern strip the cause of this division be the californium overland emigration the route of which follow the kansa and platte river cut through the center of the buffalo region these emigrant kill hundred of thousand of animal and the division become still greater after the completion of the union pacific line and the settlement of the adjacent district the buffalo of the southern strip be the first to be exterminate particularly when the building of the atchison topeka & santa fe railroad facilitate entrance to the southern range aside from the pleasure and excitement from a buffalo hunt the yield be a rich one and troops of hunter swarm over the western prairie buffalo hunting become a industry which give employment to thousand of people but human avarice know no bound and massacre senselessly the finest game with which this continent be stock the dimension to which this industry grow may best be guess when it be state that in 1872 more than 100000 buffalo be kill near fort dodge in three month during the summer of 1874 a expedition compose of sixteen hunter kill 2800 buffalo and during that same season one young trapper boast of have kill 3000 animal the sight of such a slaughter scene be gruesome to behold colonel dodge write of it : during the fall of 1873 i ride across the prairie where a year ago i have hunt several herd at the time we enjoy the aspect of a myriad of buffalo which be grazing peacefully over the prairie now we ride past myriad of decay cadaver and skeleton which fill the air with a insufferable stench the broad plain which a year ago have teem with animal be nothing more than a dead foul desert mr blackmore another traveler who go through kansa at about the same time say that he count on four acre of ground no less than sixty-seven buffalo carcass as be to be expect this wholesale and indeed wanton slaughter bring its own reward and condemnation the price of buffalo skin drop to 50 cent although as much as $ 300 have be pay regularly for they moreover as the number of animal kill be greater than could be remove the decaying carcass attract wolf and even worse foe to the farmyard and terrible damage to cattle result the indian also be disturbed poor lo complain of the wanton and senseless killing of the principal means of he sustenance and when the white man with a laugh ignore these complaint the indian get on the war-path attack settlement kill cattle and steal provision thus give rise to conflict which devour not only enormous sum of money but cost the life of thousand of people when the locust plague sweep over the field of kansa and destroy the entire crop the settler themselves hunger for the buffalo meat of which they have rob themselves and vengeance come in more way than one the extermination of the buffalo of the southern range be complete about 1875 to the bison of the northern range be give a few year ' grace but the same scene which be enact in the south repeat themselves in the north and the white barbarian be not satisfy until they have kill the last of the noble game in 1885 when the massacre be nearly over a few isolate herd be collect and transport to yellowstone park where they have increase to about 400 during the last few year protect by the hunting law which be strictly enforce with the exception of a very few specimen tenderly nurse by some cattle raiser in kansa and texa and in some remote part of british america these be the last animal of a species which two decade ago wander in million over the vast prairie of the west chapter v the mormon and they wife the pilgrimage across the bad land to utah -- incident of the march -- success of the new colony -- religious persecution -- murder of a entire family -- the curse of polygamy -- a ideal city -- humor of bathing in great salt lake about half a century ago one of the most remarkable pilgrimage of modern time take place across what be then not inaptly describe by writer as a arid and repulsive desert there advance a procession of the most unique and awe-inspiring character history tell we of band of crusader who tramp across europe in order to rescue the holy land from tyrant and invader on that occasion all sort and condition of man be represent from the religious enthusiast to the ignorant bigot and from the rich man who be sacrifice he all in the cause that he believe to be right to the tramp and ne'er - do-well who have ally himself with that cause for revenue only but the distance traverse by the crusader six or seven hundred year ago be insignificant compare with the distance traverse by the pilgrim to whom we be refer in addition to this the country to be cross present difficulty of a far more startling and threatening character there be before they a promised land in the extreme distance but there intervene a tract of land which seem as impassable a barrier as the much talked-of but seldom inspect chinese wall of old there be a region of desolation and death extend from the sierra nevada to the border line of nebraska and from the yellowstone to the colorado river a profane writer once suggest that the same creator could hardly have bring into existence this arid barren and inhospitable region and the fertile plain and beautiful mountain which surround it on all side civilization and irrigation have destroy the most awful characteristic of this region but at the time to which we be refer it be about as bad from the standpoint of humanity and human need as could well be imagine here and there there be lofty mountain and deep cañons as there be now but the immense plain which occupy the bulk of the land be unwatered and uncared for give forth volume of a penetrate alkali dust almost as injurious to human flesh as to human attire here and there there be of course little oasis of comparative verdure which be regard by unfortunate traveler not only as haven of refuge but as little heaven in the midst of a sea of despair the trail across the desert naturally run through as many as possible of these successful effort of nature to resist decay and along the trail there be to be find skeleton and ghastly remains of man whose courage have exceed they ability and who have succumb to hunger and thirst in this great lonesome desert that no one live in this region it would seem superfluous to state occasionally a band of indian would traverse it in search of hunting grounds beyond though as a general rule the red man leave the country severely alone and make no effort to dispute the rights of the coyote and buzzard to sole possession along the trail mention there advance at the period to which we have refer a procession which we have liken in some respects to the advance of the crusader in mediaeval day those who happen to see it pass describe this cavalcade as almost beyond conception the first impression from a distance be that a immense herd of buffalo be advance and create the cloud of dust which seem to rise from the bare ground and mount to the cloud as it come nearer and the figure become more discernible it be see that the caravan be head by a band of armed horseman the animal be jade and fatigue and walk with they head low down and they knee bent out of shape and form they rider seem as exhaust as the animal themselves and they carry they dust-begrimed gun in anything but military fashion behind they come hundred nay thousand of wagon of all shape and build some of they entirely open and expose and other protect more or less by canvas tilt these wagon seem to stretch back indefinitely into space and even when there be no undulation of the surface to obstruct the view the naked eye could not determine to any degree the length of the procession near the front of the great cavalcade be a wagon different in build and appearance to any of the other it be handsomely and even gaudily decorate and it be cover in so carefully that its occupant could sleep and rest as secure from annoyance by the dust as though they be in bed at home instead of two broken-down horse six well-fed and well-watered steed be attach to the wagon and it be evident that no matter how short have be the supply of food and water the horse and occupant of this particular conveyance have have everything they desire the occupant of this wagon be a man who do not look to be more than thirty year of age but whose face and manner indicate that he be in the habit of be obey rather than obey a great portion of he time be occupy in reading from a large vellum-bound book but from time to time he lay it on one side to settle dispute which have arise among some of he ten thousand follower or to issue order of the most emphatic and dogmatic character this man be brigham young the successor of joseph smith and the choose prophet of the mormon who be march across the desert in search of the promised land which they be inform have be set aside for they purpose by the ruler of the universe we need not follow the fortune and misfortune of the zealous if misguided man and family who follow they leader across the great unwatered and almost unexplored desert no one know how many fall by the wayside and succumb to hunger exhaustion or disease the bulk of the column however persevere in the march and through much sadness and tribulation finally arrive at a country which while it be not then by any mean up to expectation or representation at least present facility and opportunity for live when the great valley of utah be reach man who a few month before have be strong and hardy but who now be lank and lean fall on they knee and offer up thanksgiving for they deliverance while the exhaust woman and child seek repose and rest which have be deny they for so many long wearisome day but there be no time to be waste in rejoicing over achievement or regret over loss the virgin acre before they be theirs for the ask or rather take and the mormon colony set to work at once to parcel out the land and to commence the building of home whatever may be say against the religious idea of these pilgrim too much credit can not be give they for the business-like energy which characterize they every movement a site be select for what be now know as salt lake city broad street be lay out building plan and rule adopt and every arrangement make for the construction of a handsome and symmetrical city house street and square appear almost by magic and in a very few week quite a healthy town be build up those who in more eastern region have learn different trade be set to work at calling of they choice and for those who be agriculturally disposed farm be map out and reserve fortunately for the newcomer industry be a watchword among they and a country which have be up to that time a stranger to the plow and shovel be drain and ditch and very speedily plant to corn and wheat so fertile do this so-called arid ground prove to be that one year 's crop throw aside all fear of further poverty and prosperity begin to reign supreme have the mormon confine themselves to work and have abandon extreme religious and social idea impossible in a enlighten age and country they would have rise long before this into a impregnable position in every respect but polygamy hitherto restrain and check by law of eastern state and territory be now indulge in indiscriminately the more wife a member of the mormon church possess the greater be he standing in the community the man who have but two or three wife be censure for he want of enthusiasm and he be frequently fine heavily by the church which be not above levy fine and thus licensing allege irregularity some of the elder have more than a hundred wife each and these be maintain under relation of a most peculiar character at first the polygamous tenent of the church do not cause much comment on the outside because the mormon be so shut off from civilization that they seem to occupy a little world of they own and no one claim the right to censure or interfere with they gradually however there become a shortage of marriageable woman and this result in mysterious raid be make on neighbor settlement wanderer upon the mountain speak with horror of mysterious tribe of man who wander around engage in act of plunder and from time to time strange woman appear in the town and settlement like so many other band of persecute man who have flee from they oppressor in search of liberty the early mormon soon adopt the tactic of which they have complain so bitterly the man who refuse to obey the order of the church or who be in any way rebellious be apt to disappear from he home without warn or explanation he be not arrest or try he be simply spirit away and no mark or sign proclaim he last rest place the danite band or the avenge angel come into existence and some of they terrible deed have contribute dark page to the history of we native land it be not to be suppose that act such as these be approve indiscriminately by the newcomer occasionally a mild protest would be utter but it seem as though the very wall have ear for even if a man in the bosom of he family criticise the conduct of the church he doom appear to be seal and he generally disappear within a few day occasionally a family would attempt to escape from utah in order to avoid compliance with law and order which they believe to be criminal in character as well as contrary to they preconceived notion of domestic happiness and right to make a attempt of this character be to invite death in the first place it be almost impossible to traverse the surround mountain and desert and even if these natural obstacle be overcome the hand of the avenger be constantly uplift against the fugitive who be blot off the face of the earth on the theory that dead man tell no tale on one occasion a man leave he home in utah in the way describe because he decline to bring home a second wife brigham young in the course of he pastoral call enter the comfortable house occupy by the family and call upon the man to introduce to he he wife he be one of the few man who while in every other respect a zealous mormon have decline to break up he family relation by bring a young wife into he home the mother of he child inform the prophet with much vehemence of this fact and in word more noble than discreet assure he that no effort of he could disturb the domestic relation of the house or make she husband untrue to vow he have take twenty year before the prophet be too astounded to lose he temper but turn to the happy husband and father he tell he in stentorian tone that unless within one month he comply with the order of the church it would have be better for he have he never be bear or have he die while on the terrible march across the bad land and the alkali desert that the prophet be in earnest be evidence by the arrival the follow day of some of he minion who bring with they more explicit direction as well as the name of certain young woman to whom the man must be seal or marry within the time mention by young no idea of comply with this order ever occur to the head of the house he know that he wife would far rather die than be dishonor and he himself be perfectly willing to sacrifice he life rather than he honor but for the sake of he four child he determine to make a attempt to escape and accordingly a few day later the family have collect together all they available and easily transport asset hitch up they wagon and drive away in the dead of night they departure in this manner be not expect and be not discover for nearly forty-eight hour during which time the refugee have make considerable progress over the surround mountain they maintain they march for nearly a week without incident and be congratulating themselves upon they escape when the disaster which they have fear overtake they they be camp by the side of a little stream in a fertile valley and all be sleep peacefully but the elder boy who be act as sentinel he attention be first call to danger by the uneasiness display by the horse which by they restless manner and sudden anxiety show that instinct warn they of a approach party without waste a moment 's time the young man hastily arouse the sleeper who prepare to abandon they camp and seek refuge in the adjoining timber they have barely reach cover when a party of mount armed man ride up find a desert camp they separate and commence to scour the surrounding country one of the number soon come upon the retreat family but before he could cover they with he rifle he have be shoot dead by the infuriate father who be determine to resist to the uttermost the horrible fate which now stare they in the face the noise be take by the other searcher as a signal to they that the hunt family have be find and know that this would be so the man and he son hurry the woman and younger child to a secluded spot at a little distance and seek convenient cover determine to make a desperate effort to protect those for whose safety they be responsible unfortunately for the successful carry out of this plan the helpless section of the party be discover first the avenge party then divide up into two section one of which drag away the woman and she young child and the other go in search of the man and he two son they speedily find they and in the fight which follow two life be lose on both side the oldest son of the escape party be wound and leave for dead several hour later consciousness return to he and the first sight that meet he gaze be the dead body of he father and brother a chance be offer he to escape but weak as he be from loss of blood he determine to follow up the kidnap party form the desperate resolve that if he could not rescue he mother and sister he would at least save they from the horrible fate that he know await they this resolve involve he death for he be no match for the man he be contend against no grave be ever dig for he remains and no headstone tell the story of he noble resolution and he intrepid effort to carry it into execution there be hundred and probably thousand of similar incident and mormonism prove a sad drawback to the happiness of a people who otherwise have before they prospects of a most delightful character brigham young prove a marvelous success as a ruler he have eighteen wife and a indefinite number of child estimate concern the number of which vary so much that it be best not to give any of they it be generally state and understand that the so-called revelation call upon the choose people to practice polygamy be a invention on the part of young design to cover up he own immorality and to obtain religious sanction for improper relationship he have already build up however this may be it be certain that polygamy have a serious blow deal at it by the death of its ardent champion since then stern federal legislation have result in the practical suppression of the crime and in recent year the present head of the church have officially declare the practice to be improper and the habit dead brigham young 's grave of which we give a illustration have be visit from time to time-by countless pleasure and sight-seeker like the man it be unique in every respect it be situate in the prophet 's private burial ground which be survey and lay out by he with special care he even go so far as to select the last rest place for each of he eighteen wife and so careful be he over these detail that the honor of rest near he be give to each wife in order of the date of she be seal to he in accordance with the rite and law of the church most of the mr young have be bury accord to arrangement make but all of the remarkable aggregation of wife have not yet be dispose of in the manner desire the prophet 's favorite wife concern whose relationship to mr grover cleveland there have be so much controversy be name amelia folsom for she special comfort the prophet build the amelium palace one of the most unique feature of salt lake city here the lady live for several year let we leave the unpleasant side of mormon history and see what the zealous if misguided people have succeed in accomplish salt lake city which be originally settle by brigham young and he follower in July 1847 be perhaps the most uniform city in the world so far as its plan be concern the original settler lay out the city in square ten acre large instead of street sixty and eighty foot wide as be too common in all we crowded city a uniform width of 130 foot be adopt with more satisfactory result in the original portion of the city these wide street be a permanent memorial to the forethought of the early mormon the shade tree they plant be now magnificent in they proportion and along each side of the street there run a stream of water of exquisite clearness there be very little crowding in the way of house-building each house in the city be surround by a green lawn a garden and a orchard so that poverty and squalor of the slum type be practically unknown the communistic idea of home in common which have receive so much attention of late year be not adopt by the founder of this city who however take excellent precaution to stamp out loaf beg and other accompaniment of what may be describe as professional pauperism within thirty year of the building of the first house in salt lake city which by the way be still stand the number of inhabitant run up to 20000 it be now probably more than 50000 and the city stand thirty-first in the order of those whose clearing-house return be report and compare weekly hotel abound on every side and benevolent institution and park be common church of course there be without number and now that the government have interfere in the protection of so-called gentile almost all religious sect be represent no description of the mormon temple can convey a reasonable idea of its grandeur six year after the arrival of the pilgrim at salt lake city or in 1853 work be commence on this immense structure upon which at least $ 7000000 have be expend its length be 200 foot its width 100 foot and its height the same at each corner there be a tower 220 foot high the thickness of the wall be 10 foot and these be build of snow-white granite so conspicuous and massive be this building that it can be see from the mountain fifty and even a hundred mile away the tabernacle which be in the same square as the temple and just west of it be aptly describe by mr p donan as one of the architectural curio of the world it look like a vast terrapin back or half of a prodigious egg-shell cut in two lengthwise and be build wholly of iron glass and stone it be 250 foot long 150 foot wide and 100 foot high in the center of the roof which be a single mighty arch unsupported by pillar or post and be say to have but one counterpart on the globe the wall be 12 foot thick and there be 20 huge double door for entrance and exit the tabernacle seat 13462 people and its acoustic property be so marvelously perfect that a whisper or the drop of a pin can be hear all over it the organ be one of the largest and grandest tone in existence and be build of native wood by mormon workman and artist at a cost of $ 100000 it be 58 foot high have 57 stop and contain 2648 pipe some of they nearly as large as the chimney of a mississippus river steamer the choir consist of from 200 to 500 trained voice and the music be glorious beyond description much of it be in minor key and a strain of plaintiveness mingle with all its majesty and power all the seat be free and tourist from all part of the world be to be find among the vast multitude that assemble at every service think of see the holy communion break bread and water from the jordan river instead of wine

assembly hall also of white granite and of gothic architecture it have seat for 2500 people and be most remarkable for the costly fresco work on the ceiling which illustrate scene from mormon history include the alleged discovery of the golden plate and they delivery to prophet smith by the angel moronus all around this remarkable city be sight of surpass beauty great salt lake itself ought to be regard as one of the wonder of the world although a inland sea with a immense area intervene between it and the nearest ocean its water be much more brackish and salty than those of either the atlantic or the pacific and its specific gravity be far greater expert tell we that the percentage of salt and soda be six time as great as in the water of the atlantic and one great advantage of living in its vicinity be the abundance of good pure salt which be produce by natural evaporation on its bank it would be interesting if it be possible to explain why it be that the water be so salty various reason have be advance from time to time for this phenomenon but none of they be sufficiently practical or tangible to be of great interest to the unscientific reader it be just possible that this wonderful lake may in course of time disappear entirely some year ago its width be over 40 mile on a average and its length be very much greater now it barely measure 100 mile from end to end and the width vary from 10 to 60 mile in the depth the gradual curtailment have be more apparent at one time the average depth be many hundred foot and several sounding of 1000 foot be take with the result report in sailor ' parlance of no bottom at the present time the depth vary from 40 to 100 foot and appear to be lessen steadily presumably because of the extraordinary deposit of solid matter from the very dense water with which it be fill the lake be a bather ' paradise and the arrangement for bathing from garfield beach be like everything else in the land of the mormon extraordinary to a degree in one year there be nearly half a million bather accommodate at the four principal resort and so rapidly be these bathing resort and establishment multiply that the day be not distant when every available site on the eastern shore of the lake will be appropriate for the purpose as a gentleman who have bath in this lake again and again say it seem preposterous to speak of the finest sea-bathing on earth a thousand mile from the ocean although the bathing in great salt lake infinitely surpass anything of the kind on either the atlantic or pacific coast the water contain many time more salt and much more soda sulphur magnesia chlorine bromine and potassium than any ocean water on the globe it be powerful in medicinal virtue cure or benefit many form of rheumatism rheumatic gout dyspepsia nervous disorder and cutaneous disease and it act like magic on the hair of those unfortunate whose tendency be to bald-headedness it be a prompt and potent tonic and invigorant of body and mind and then there be no end of fun in get acquaint with its peculiarity a first bath in it be always as good as a circus the bather be he or she own trick mule the specific gravity be but a trifle less than that of the holy land dead sea the human body will not and can not sink in it you can walk out in it where it be fifty foot deep and you body will stick up out of it like a fishing-cork from the shoulder upward you can sit down in it perfectly secure where it be fathoms deep man lie on top of it with they arm under they head and smoking cigar its buoyancy be indescribable and unimaginable any one can float upon it at the first trial there be nothing to do but lie down gently upon it and float but swimming be a entirely different matter the moment you begin to paddle you own canoe lively and -- to the lookers-on -- mirth-provoking exercise ensue when you stick you hand under to make a stroke you foot decline to stay anywhere but on top and when after a exciting tussle with you refractory pedal extremity you again get they beneath the surface you hand fly out with the splash and splutter of a half-dozen flutter wheel if on account of you brain be heavier than you heel you chance to turn a somersault and you head go under you heel will pop up like a pair of frisky dapper duck you can not keep more than one end of yourself under water at once but you soon learn how to wrestle with its novelty and then it become a thing of beauty and a joy for any summer day the water be delightful to the skin every sensation be exhilarating and one can not help feeling in it like a gilded cork adrift in a jewel-rimmed bowl of champagne punch in the sense of luxurious ease with which it envelop the bather it be unrivaled on earth the only approximation to it be in the phosphorescent water of the mosquito indian coast the water do not freeze until the thermometric mercury tumble down to eighteen degree above zero or fourteen below the ordinary freezing point it be clear as crystal with a bottom of snow-white sand and small object can be distinctly see at a depth of twenty foot there be not a fish or any other live thing in all the 2500 to 3000 square mile of beautiful and mysterious water except the yearly increase swarm of summer bather not a shark or a stingaree to scare the timid swimmer or floater not a minnow or a frog a tadpole or a pollywog -- nothing that live move swim crawl or wiggle it be the ideal sea-bathing place of the world chapter vi the invasion of oklahoma a history of the indian nation -- early struggle of oklahoma boomer -- fight between home-seeker and soldier -- scene at the opening of oklahoma proper -- a miserable night on the prairie -- a race for home -- lawlessness in the old indian territory oklahoma the youngest of we territory be in many respects also the most interesting many people confound oklahoma territory with the indian territory but the two be separate and distinct the former enjoy territorial government while the latter unfortunately be in a very anomalous condition so far as the making and enforce of law be concern up to within a few year oklahoma be a part of what be then the indian territory now it have be separate from what may be describe as its original parent and be entirely distinct it contain nearly 40000 square mile and have a population of about a quarter of a million exclusive of about 18000 indian it contain more than twice as many people to the square mile as many of the western state and territory and be in a condition of thrive prosperity which be extraordinary when its extreme youth as a territory be consider in 1888 oklahoma be the largest single body of unimproved land capable of cultivation in the southwest it be nominally farm by indian tribe but the natural productiveness of the soil and the immense amount of land at they disposal cultivate habit of indolence and there be a grievous and even sinful waste of fertility to the south be texa and on the north kansa both rich powerful and wealthy state the indian possession lie between disturbed the natural growth and trend of empire see from car window only the country appear invite to the eye it be know from report of trader to have all the element of agricultural wealth and this make the land-hungry man hungrier the era of the boomer begin and the boomer do not stop until he have insert a opening wedge in the shape of the purchase and open to settlement of a vast area right in the heart of the prairie wilderness when the first opening take place it seem as though the supply would be in excess of the demand not so every acre -- good bad or indifferent -- be gobble up and like as from a army of oliver twist the cry go up for more then the iowa and pottawatomie reservation be place on the market they last a day only and the still unsatisfied crowd begin another agitation resultant of this a third bargain-counter sale take place the big cheyenne and arapahoe country be open for settlement immigrant pour in and now every quarter-section that be tillable there have its individual occupant and owner but still on the south border of kansas there camp a landless and homeless multitude they look longingly over the fertile prairie of the cherokee strip country stir the camp-fire ember emphatically and send another dispatch to washington ask for a chance to get in congress hear at last and in the fall of 1893 the congestion be relieve the scene attend the wild scramble from all side of the strip be a matter of history and do not require repetition five million acre be quickly take by 30000 farmer the old proverb or adage which state that the man who make two blade of grass grow where one grow before be a public benefactor would seem to proclaim that oklahoma be people with philanthropist for the sturdy pioneer who brave hardship and ridicule in order to obtain a foothold in this promised land have in five or six year completely change the appearance of the country a larger proportion of ground in this youthful territory show that it be a sturdy infant and it be doubtful whether in any part of the united state there have be more economy in land or a more rapid use make of opportunity so bountifully provide by nature truth be often much stranger than fiction and the story of the invasion of oklahoma read like one long romance many man lose they life in the attempt some few die by violence and many other succumb to disease bring about by hardship many of the man who start the agitation to have oklahoma open for settlement by white citizen be still alive and some of they have have they heart 's desire fulfil and now occupy little home they have build in some favorite nook and corner of they much loved and at one time grievously coveted country oklahoma come into the possession of the seminole indian by the ordinary process and remain they allege home until about thirty year ago in 1866 the country be cede to the united state government for a consideration and in 1873 it be survey by federal officer and section line establish accord to law it be the natural presumption that this expense be incur with a view to the immediate opening of the territory for settlement for various reason more or less valid and more or less the result of influence and possible corruption the actual opening of the country be defer for more than twenty year after its cession to the united state government and in the meantime it occupy a peculiar condition immense herd of cattle be pasture on it and bad man and outlaw from various section of the country awake reminiscence of biblical story about city of refuge by squat upon it make a living by hunting and indifferent agriculture and rest secure from molestation from officer of the law to remedy this anomaly and to secure home for themselves and family in what be report to be one of the most fertile tract in the world captain payne and a number of determine man organize themselves into colony there have always be a mania for new land and many people be never happy unless they be keep pace with the invasion of civilization into hitherto unknown and unopened country many who join the payne movement be doubtless roving spirit of this character but the majority of they be bona fide home-seeker who believe as citizen of this country they have a right to quarter-section in the promised land and who be determine to enforce those rights no matter however what be the motive of the boomer as they be call from the first it be certain that they go to work in a business-like manner plan a regular invasion and form a number of colony or small army for the purpose we will follow the fortune of one of these colony in order to show what extraordinary difficulty they go through and how much more there be in heaven and earth than be dream of in we humdrum philosophy the town of caldwell on the southern line of kansa be the camp from which the first colonist start it consist of about forty man and about 100 woman and child each family provide itself with such equipment and convenience as the scanty means at disposal make possible a prairie schooner or a wagon with a cover to protect the inmate from the weather and secure a certain amount of privacy for the woman and child be a indispensable item when the advance be make there be forty such cover wagon each draw by a pair of horse or mule and each contain such furniture as the family possess the more fortunate one also have in the wagon certain material to be use in build the little hut which be to be they home until they could earn enough to build a more pretentious residence eye witness describe the starting of the colony as one of the most remarkable sight ever witness the wagon advance in single file and some few of the man ride on horseback in order to act as advance guide to seek suitable camping grounds and to protect the occupant of the wagon from attack in some case one or two cow be attach by halter to the rear of the wagon and there be several dog which evidently enter heartily into the spirit of the affair the utmost confidence prevail and hearty cheer be give as the cavalcade cross the kansas state line and commence its long and dreary march through the rich blue grass of the cherokee strip the journey before the home-seeker be about 100 mile and at the slow rate of progress they be compel to make it be necessarily a long and arduous task some few of the woman be a little nervous but the majority have thoroughly fall in with the general feeling and be enthusiastic in the extreme the food they have with they be sufficient for immediate need and when they camp for the night the younger member of the party generally succeed in add to the larder by hunting and fishing we have all hear of invade army be allow to proceed on they march unmolest only to be treat with additional severity on arrive at the enemy ' camp so it be with the colonist they get through with very little difficulty and no one take the trouble to interfere with they progress man who have be in the promised land for the purpose have locate a suitable spot for the formation of the proposed colony and here the people be direct one of the party have some knowledge of land law and after a long hunt he succeed in locate one of the section corner establish by the recent government survey this be do quarter-section be select by each of the newcomer and work commence with a will tent and hut be put up as rapidly as possible and before a week have pass the newcomer be fairly well settle they even select a town site and build castle in the air of a most remarkable character that they be monarch of all they survey seem to be obvious and for some week they right there be none to dispute then by degree the cowboy who be herd cattle in the neighborhood begin to drop hint of possible interference and while these suggestion be be discuss a company of united state troops suddenly appear with very little explanation they arrest every man in the colony for treason and conspiracy and proceed to drive the colonist out of the country the man be compel to hitch up they horse and succumb to force of number the colonist sadly and wearily advance to fort reno where they be turn over to the authority after be keep in confinement for five day they be release and tell to get back into kansa as rapidly as possible government official see that the order be carry out and then leave the colonist to themselves the man lose no time in make up they mind to organize a second attempt to establish home for they family and once more they make the march a bitter disappointment await they for they find that they cabin have all be destroy and they have to commence work over again this they do and they have scarcely get themselves comfortable when another small detachment of troops arrive to turn they out the man be tie by means of rope to the tail-end of wagon and drive like cattle across the prairie to the military fort for a third time they conduct a invasion and for the third time they be attack by government troops a spirit of determination have however come over the man in the interval and a attempt be make to resist the onslaught of the soldier the lieutenant in charge be astonish at the attitude assume and do not care to assume the responsibility of order he man to fire as many of the colonist be well armed and be undoubtedly crack shot he accordingly adopt more diplomatic measure and by establish somewhat friendly relation get into close quarter with the settler a rough and tumble fight with fist soon afterwards result and the hard fist and brawny arm of the settler prove too much for the regular who be for the time be drive off the result of the boomer ' victory be the send of 600 soldier to dislodge they and it be impossible to resist such a force as this the colonist yield with the best grace they could and sadly desert the home they have try so hard to build up some of the man be actually imprison for the action they have take and the colony for a time be completely break up the example set be follow by several other and for some year a conflict not particularly creditable to the government go on no law be discover to punish the boomer and thus put a final end to the invasion all that could be do be to drive the family out as fast as they go in a course of action far more calculate to excite disorder than to quell it sometimes the soldier display a great deal of forbearance and even go out of they way to help the woman and child and reduce they suffering to the smallest possible point again they be sometimes unduly harsh and more than one infant lose its life from the exposure the eviction bring about the soldier by no means relish the work give they and many of they complain bitterly that it be no part of they duty to fight woman and baby still they be compel to obey order and ask no question while the original colonist or boomer gain little or nothing for themselves by the hardship they insist on encounter they really bring about the opening for settlement of oklahoma about the year 1885 it begin to be generally understand that the necessary proclamation would be issue and from all part of the country home-hunter begin to set out on a journey vary in length from a few hundred to several thousand mile the kansas border town on the south be make the headquarters for the home-seeker and as they arrive at different point they be astonish to find that other have get there before they in the neighborhood of arkansa city particularly there be large settlement of boomer who from time to time make effort to enter the promised land in advance of the proclamation only to be turn back by the soldier who be guard every trail the majority of the newcomer think it better to obey the law and these settle down with they wagon for they home and seek work with which to maintain they family until the proclamation be issue and the country open to they it be a long and dreary wait the child be send to school the man obtain such employment as be possible and life go on peacefully in some of the most peculiar settlement ever see in this country finally the springer bill be pass and the speedy opening of at least a portion of oklahoma assure the news be telegraph to the four wind of heaven and where there have be one boomer before there be soon fifty or a hundred in the winter of 1888 various estimate be make as to the number of people await the president 's proclamation and the total could not have be less than 50000 or 60000 finally the long-looked-for document appear and easter Monday 1889 be name as the date on which the section of oklahoma include in the bill be to be declare open there be a special proviso that any one enter the promise and mysterious land prior to noon on the day name would be forever disqualify from hold land in it and accordingly the open resolve itself into a race to commence promptly at high noon on the day name seldom have such a remarkable race be witness in any part of the world the principal town site be on the line of the sante fe railroad and those who be seek town lot crowd the train which be not allow to enter oklahoma until noon all available rolling stock be bring into requisition for the occasion and provision be make for haul thousand of home-seeker to the town of guthrie and oklahoma city as well as to intervene point before daylight on the morning of the open the approach of the railway station at arkansa city be block with mass of humanity and every train be throng with town boomer or with people in search of free land or town lot the author be fortunate in secure a seat on the first train which cross the oklahoma border and which arrive at guthrie before 1 o'clock on the day of the open it be presume that the law have be enforce and that we should find nothing but a land-office and a few official on the town site but such be far from be the case hundred of people be already on the ground the town have be platt out street located and the best corner seize in advance of the law and of the regulation of the proclamation there be no time to argue with point of law or order those who get in in advance of the law be of a determine character and they number be so great that they rely on the confusion to evade detection one of they number tell a interesting story to the writer concern the experience he have go through he have slip into oklahoma prior to the opening carry with he enough food to last he for a few day he find a hiding place in the creek bank and there lay until a few minute before noon on the opening day when he watch and the sun both tell he that it lack but a few minute of noon he emerge from he hide place with a view to leisurely locate one of the best corner lot in the town to he chagrin he see man advance from every direction and he be make aware of the fact that he have no patent on he idea which have be adopt simultaneously by several hundred other he secure a good lot for himself and sell it before he disqualification on account of be too previous in he entry be discover as each train unloaded its immense throng of passenger the scene be one that must always baffle description the town site be on rise ground and man and even woman spring from the move train fall headlong over each other and then rush up hill as fast as they leg would carry they in the mad fight for town lot free of charge the town site be entirely occupy within half a hour and the surrounding country in every direction be appropriate for addition to the main city before night there be at least 10000 people on the ground many estimate place the number as high as 20000 some few have bring with they blanket and provision and these pass a comparatively comfortable night thousand however have no alternative but to sleep on the open prairie hungry as well as thirsty the water in the creek be scarcely fit to drink and the railroad company have to protect its water tank by force from the thirsty adventurer and speculator the night bring additional terror there be no danger of wild animal or of snake for the stampede of the previous day have probably drive every living thing mile away with the solitary exception of ant which in army ten thousand strong attack the trespasser by morning several house have be erect and the arrival of freight train load with provision not only enable thoughtful caterer to make small fortune but also relieve the newcomer of much of the distress they have be suffer within a week the street be well define and house be be build in every direction and within six month there be several brick building erect and occupy for business and banking purpose the process of build up be one of the quickest on record and guthrie like its neighbor on the south oklahoma city be to-day a large substantial business and financial center those of we reader who cross oklahoma by rail even as lately as the winter of 1888 will remember that they see nothing but open prairie with occasional belt of timber there be not so much as a post to mark the location of either of these two large city nor be there a plow line to define they limit in no other country in the world could result such as these have be accomplish the amount of courage require to invest time and money in a prospective town in a country hitherto close against white citizen be enormous and it take a american bear and breed to make the venture the oklahoma city be not boom town lay out on paper and advertise as future railroad and business center from the first moment of they existence they have be practical useful trading center and every particle of growth they have make have be of a permanent and lasting character but if the race to the oklahoma town site be interesting the race to the homestead be sensational and bewildering all around the coveted land anxious determine man be wait for the word go in order to rush forward and select a future home in some instance the race be make in the wagon but in many case a solitary horseman act as pioneer and gallop ahead in order to secure prior claim to a coveted well-watered quarter-section shortly before the hour of noon a number of boomer on the northern frontier make a effort to advance in spite of the protest of the soldier on guard these latter be outnumber ten to one and could not attempt to hold back the home-seeker by force see this fact the young lieutenant in charge address a few pointed sentence to the would-be violator of the law he know most of the man personally and be aware that several of they be old soldier address these especially he appeal to they patriotism and ask whether it be logical for man who have bear arm for they country to combine to break the law which they themselves have risk they life to uphold this appeal to the loyalty of the veteran have the desire effect and what threaten to be a dangerous conflict result in a series of hearty hand-shake a mighty shout go up at noon and the deer rabbit and bird which for year have hold undisputed possession of the promised land be treat to a surprise of the first water horse which have never be ask to run before be now compel to assume a gait hitherto unknown to they wagon be upset horse throw down and all sort of accident happen one man who have set he heart on locate on the canadian river near the old payne colony ride he horse in that direction and urge the beast on to further exertion until it could scarcely keep on its foot finally he reach one of the creek run into the river the jaded animal just manage to drag its rider up the steep bank of the creek and it then fall dead its rider have no time for regret he have still four or five mile to cover and he commence to run as fast as he leg would carry he he over-estimate of he horse 's power of endurance and he under-estimate of the distance to be cover lose he he coveted home for when he arrive a large colony have get in ahead of he from the western border and there be two or three claimant to every homestead in other case there be neck and neck race for favored location and sometimes it would have puzzle a experienced referee to have determine which be really the winner of the race compromise be occasionally agree to and although there be a good deal of bad temper and recrimination there be very little violence and the man whose patience have be sorely tax behave themselves admirably earn the respect of the soldier who be on guard to preserve order the excitement and uproar be keep up long after night-fall in they feverish anxiety to retain possession of the home for which they have wait and race hundred of man stay up all night to continue the work of hut building know that nothing would help they so much in press they claim for a title as evidence of work on bona fide improvement they keep on day after day and late in the season as it be many of the newcomer raise a good crop that year the opening of other section of the old indian territory now include in oklahoma take place two or three year later when the scene we have briefly describe be repeat to-day oklahoma extend right up to the southern kansa line and the cherokee strip on whose rich blue grass hundred of thousand of cattle have be fatten be now a settle country with at least four family to every square mile and with a number of thrive town and even large city at the present time the question of statehood for the youngest of we territory be be actively debate no one dispute the fact that the population and wealth be large enough to justify the step and the only question at issue be whether the whole of the indian territory should be include in the new state or whether the land of the so-called civilized tribe should be exclude the lawlessness which have prevail in some portion of the indian territory be hold to be a strong argument in favor of open up all the land for settlement at present the indian own immense tract of land under very peculiar condition a large number of white man many of they respectable citizen and many of they outlaw and refugee from justice have marry fair cherokee choctaw and creek girl and these man while not recognize by the head of the tribe be able to draw from the government in the name of they wife the large sum of money from time to time distribute advocate of statehood favor the allotment to each indian of he share of the land and the purchase by the government of the immense residue which could then be open for settlement until this question be settle the anomaly will continue of civilization and the reverse exist side by side some of the indian have assume the manners dress virtue and vice of they white neighbor in which case they have generally drop they old name and assume something reasonable in they place but many of the red man who adhere to tradition and who object to innovation still stick to the name give they in they boyhood thus in travel across the indian territory indian with such name as hears-something-everywhere knows-where-he-walk bear-in-the-cloud goose-over-the-hill shell-on-the-neck sorrel horse white fox strikes-on-the-top-of-the-head and other equally far-fetched and ridiculous term and cognomen every one have hear of chief rain-in-the-face a characteristic indian whose virtue and vice have both be greatly exaggerate from time to time a picture be give of this representative of a rapidly decay race and of the favorite pony upon which he have ride thousand of mile and which in its early year possess power of endurance far beyond what any one who have reside in country remove from indian settlement can have any idea or conception of chapter vii cowboy -- real and ideal a much maligned class -- the cowboy as he be and as he be suppose to be -- prairie fever and how it be cure -- life on the ranch thirty year ago and now -- singular fashion and change of costume -- trouble encounter by would-be bad man among the thoroughly american type of humanity none be more striking or unique than the cowboy this master of horsemanship and subduer of wild and even dangerous cattle have be describe in so many way that a great difference of opinion exist as to what he be and what he be we give a picture of a cowboy of to-day and will endeavor to show in what important respects he differ from the cowboy of fiction and even of history sensational writer have describe the cowboy as a thoroughly bad man and moreover as one who delight in the word bad and regard it as a sort of diploma or qualification traveler over the region in which the cowboy use to be predominant give he a very different character and speak of he as a hard-working honest citizen generous to a fault courteous to woman and aged or infirm man but inclined to be humorous at the expense of those who be strong and big enough to return a joke or resent it if they so prefer we have speak of the cowboy in two tense : the present and the past strictly speak we should perhaps have only use one for many of the best judge say that there be no such thing as a cowboy in this day and generation he flourish in all he glory in the day of immense range when there be a abundance of elbow room for both man and beast and when such modern interference with the cattle business as the barb-wire fence do not exist the work of cattle herd and feed to-day certainly differ in a most remarkable manner from that of thirty and even twenty year ago and the man have naturally change with he work now the cowboy be to all intent and purpose a farm hand he feed the stock drive it to water when necessary and go to the nearest market town to dispose of surplus product with all the system and method of a thoroughly domesticate man formerly he have charge of hundred and perhaps thousand of branded cattle which range at will over boundless prairie and the day 's work be frequently vary by a set-to with some unfriendly indian or some exceptionally daring cattle thief the very nature of he work use to make the cowboy somewhat desperate in he habit and apt to be suspicious of newcomer he be never such a terrible individual as have be frequently state in print he work confine he to a few frontier state and territory and hence he be a very convenient person to ridicule and decry the man who meet the average cowboy face to face generally learn to respect he and speedily appreciate the fact that it pay to be at least civil writer who never go within 500 mile of the nearest cattle ranch or cowboy 's home treat he with less courtesy and describe he in all sort of term dime literature with its yellow cover and sensational picture of stage robbery and the like have always libel the american cowboy to a most outrageous extent as a result of the misapprehension thus create what be know as cowboy or prairie fever be quite a common disease among youth who be try to raise a mustache for a first time the feat of recklessness the absolute disregard of conventionality and the general defiance attribute to the man who herd cattle on the prairie seem to create a longing on the part of sensationally inclined youth and many of these have cut they tooth and learn they lesson in a very different manner from what be expect let we imagine for a moment the experience of the young man from the east who have convince himself by careful reasoning and reading that nature intend he to shine in the west it be probable that he come to this most important conclusion many year before and it be not unlikely that he first cowboy enthusiasm be feed by attack upon the cat with the nearest approach he could obtain to a rawhide whip from this primitive experience sensational literature and five and ten-cent illustrated description of the adventure of bill the plunger and jack the indian slayer complete the education until the boy or young man as the case may be determine that the hour have arrive for he to cast away childish thing and become a genuine bad man of the west just how he get half way across the continent be a matter of detail sometimes the misguided youth be too proud to beg and too honest to steal in which case he probably save up he pocket money and buy a cheap ticket the more romantic and strictly correct course to adopt be to start out without a dollar and to beat one 's way across the continent so as to be thoroughly entitle to recognition on the prairie many a young man who have commence the pilgrimage towards glorified badness have have the fever knock out of he before advance 100 mile but other have succeed in get through and have arrive in texa wyome or montana as the case may have be thoroughly convince of they own ability to hold they own in all company the disappointment that await the adventurous one be almost too great to be express in word if the cowboy be one-half as bad as they be paint they would proceed to demonstrate they right to a evil reputation by murder the newcomer and steal he wear apparel and any money he might happen to have with he instead of do this the cowboy generally look with amusement on the individual who have come so many mile to join he the greet be not of the exuberant character expect and frequently the heart of the newcomer be break by be tell to go back to he mammy and spend a few year more in the nursery a runaway tenderfoot just fresh from school be not want on the cattle ranch and although western farmer be too good-natured to resent very severely the liberty take they never flatter the newcomer by hold out any inducement or make any prophecy as to he future the writer meet a runaway enthusiast of this character a few year ago he destination be the extreme west as he do not know himself the state to which he be bind he presume that no one else do when find he have get as far as kansa city and hunger and lack of a place where he could sleep in comfort have cool he ardor and inaugurate a vigorous attack of home-sickness as the ideal cowboy life do not provide for feather bed or meal serve in course it be suggest to the lad that possibly he be have a good experience in advance and get himself accustomed to the privation of the life he have decide to adopt this logic do not commend itself at all to the runaway whose sole ambition now be to borrow enough money to telegraph a message of penitence to he father a small sum necessary for the purpose be give he and the dispatch send within a hour a answer be receive and money transmit by wire to supply the lad with a ticket for he home where it be exceedingly probable what little cowboy fever he have leave in he be speedily remove in old-fashioned and regulation manner the cowboy must not be confound with the cattle baron ten or twelve year ago when a great deal of money be make out of raise cattle there be a invasion of the prairie state by man who know nothing whatever about cattle raise but who have make up they mind to secure a fortune by raise steer they take with they as inconsistent idea as do the youth in search of adventure often they carry large sum of money which they invest very lavishly in business and they also take with they ridiculously fine clothes patent leather boot velveteen jacket and other evidence of luxury which make they very unpopular and very ridiculous in they new home nine-tenth of these call themselves cattle baron and about the same proportion obtain a great deal of experience but very little money while try to revolutionize the cattle business it be not necessary to own cattle at all to be a cowboy although many member of this interesting profession own a few beast of they own and be allow to have they graze with the other stock on the ranch generally speak the term use to be apply to all those who be engage in handle the cattle and in get they together on the occasion of the annual round-up the old-time cowboy do not have a very high reputation nor be he always look upon quite as leniently as he surroundings demand about twenty year ago a well-known cattleman write the follow description of the cowboy and the life he lead : if any one imagine that the life of a cowboy or ranchman be one of ease and luxury or he diet a feast of fat thing a brief trial will dispel the illusion as be mist by the sunshine true he life be one of more or less excitement or adventure and much of it be spend in the saddle yet it be a hard life and he daily fare will never give the gout corn bread mast-fed bacon and coffee constitute nine-tenth of they diet occasionally they have fresh beef and less often they have vegetable of any description they do they own cooking in the rudest and fewest possible vessel often not have a single plate or knife and fork other than they pocket knife but gather around the camp-kettle in true indian style and with a piece of bread in one hand proceed to fish up a piece of ` sow belly ' and dine sumptuously not forget to stow away one or more quart of the strongest coffee imaginable without sugar or cream indeed you would hesitate if judge it from appearance whether to call it coffee or ink of all the vegetable onion and potato be the most desire and the oftenest use when anything more than the ` old regulation ' be have instead of a oven fireplace or cooking stove a rude hole be dig in the ground and a fire make therein and the coffee pot the camp kettle and the skillet be he only culinary article use the life of the cowboy be one of considerable daily danger and excitement it be hard and full of exposure but be wild and free and the young man who have long be a cowboy have but little taste for any other occupation he live hard work hard have but few comfort and fewer necessity he have but little if any taste for read he enjoy a coarse practical joke or a smutty story love danger but abhor labor of the common kind never tire of ride never want to walk no matter how short the distance he desire to go he would rather fight with pistol than pray love tobacco liquor and woman better than any other trinity he life border nearly upon that of a indian if he read anything it be in most case a blood and thunder story of the sensational style he enjoy he pipe and relish a practical joke on he comrade or a tale where abound animal propensity he clothes be few and substantial scarce in number and often of a gaudy pattern the ` sombrero ' and large spur be inevitable accompaniment every house have the appearance of lack of convenience and comfort but the most rude and primitive mode of life seem to be satisfactory to the cowboy he wages range from $ 1500 to $ 2000 a month in specie mexican can be employ for about $ 1200 per month the cowboy have few want and fewer necessity the principal one be a full supply of tobacco we will here say for the benefit of we northern reader that the term ` ranch ' be use in the southwest instead of ` farm ' the ordinary laborer be term a ` cowboy ' the horse use a ` cow horse ' and the herd of horse a ` cavvie yard ' the fame of texa as a stock-growing country go abroad in the land and soon after she admission to the union unto she be turn the eye of many young man bear and rear in the older southern state who be poor in this world 's goods but be ambitious to make for themselves a home and a fortune many of this class go to texa then a new and comparatively thin and unsettled country and begin in humblest manner perhaps for nominal wages to lay the foundation for future wealth and success this be a very severe description and relate to a class of man who be find in the wildest part of texa shortly after the war it certainly do not adequately describe the cowboy of the last twenty year another writer who be himself for more than a quarter of a century engage in the work of herd cattle give a much fairer description of the cowboy he divide those entitle to this name into three class and argue that there be something noble about the name he also claim that in view of the peculiar association privation surroundings and temptation of the cowboy he be entitle to much credit for the way in which he have retain the best characteristic of human nature in spite of he absence from the refining influence of civilization accord to this authority the first class of cowboy include the genuine honest worker on the prairie the man who have due respect for the rights of all he be scrupulously honest but yet charitable enough to look leniently on the fall away from grace of he less scrupulous brother and he be loyal to a remarkable extent to every one who have a right to claim he friendship in the second class be place the less careful cowboy who be not quite so strict in he moral view although no one would like to class he as a thief the story be tell of the irishman who find a blanket bearing upon it the government mark u s paddy examine the blanket carefully and on find the mark shout out : u for patrick and s for mccarty och but i be glad i have find I blanket I fayther tell I that eddication be a good thing and now i know it but for a eddication i never would have find the blanket reasoning of this kind be quite common among this second class or division of the cowboy it be not suggest that he be exactly a thief because he would scorn the act of the city light-fingered gentleman who ask you the time of day and then by a little sleight-of-hand succeed in introduce you watch to a too oblige and careless pawnbroker at the next corner but he be a little reckless in he idea of what lawyer call the rights of individual and he be a little too much incline at time to think that trifle that be not he own ought to be so the writer to whom we be refer include in class three the typical cowboy and the man use by the fiction writer as a basis for he exaggeration and romance into this class drift the cowboy who be absolutely indifferent as to the future and who be perfectly happy if he have enough money to enable he to buy a fancy bridle or a magnificent saddle these be about the beginning and the end of he idea of luxury although he enjoy a good time he look upon it rather as incidental and essential to pleasure a steady position at a small salary a reasonable amount to do and fairly good quarter constitute all he look for or expect he be perfectly honest with all he indifference he be often whole-souled and big-hearted constantly allow himself to be impose upon but have a inconvenient habit of occasionally stand up for he rights and resent too much oppression he be exceedingly good-natured and will often drive some stray cattle several mile for the convenience of a perfect stranger and a man to whom he owe no obligation whatever it be say that such a thing as distress among the relative or descendant of cowboy be impossible because of the delightful tenderheartedness of man with rough exterior and whose daily life make they appear harden the work cowboy be seldom rich even in the most generous acceptation of the term the small wages he earn be expend almost entirely on decoration for he horse or himself even when he succeed in save a few dollar the money seem to burn a hole in he pocket and he generally lend it to some one in greater need than himself but every man work on a ranch have something to spare for the widow or child of a deceased brother especially if he be kill in the course of he duty a instance of this generous-hearted disposition might well be give but it be sufficient to say that the rule be invariable and that a promise make to a die man in this respect be never forget leave for a moment the personal characteristic of the much-maligned cowboy who have be describe as everything from a stage-robber to a cutthroat we may with profit devote a little space to a consideration of he attire as it be and as it be in the picture of a cowboy in this work the modern dress be show very accurately it will be see that the man be dress conveniently for he work and that he have none of the extraordinary handicap to progress in the way of grotesque decoration which he have be think to believe be at least part and parcel of the cowboy 's wardrobe and get up certainly at the present time man engage in feeding and raise cattle be almost indifferent as to they attire wear anything suitable for they purpose and make they selection rather with a view to the durability than the handsomeness of the clothing but in year go by there be almost as much fashion change among the man on the prairie as among the woman in the drawing-room at the close of the war the first of the arbitrary dictate of fashion go out a special form of stirrup be introduce it be very narrow and exceedingly inconvenient but it be consider the right thing and so everybody use it rawhide be use in place of line and homespun garment be uniform calfskin leggings make on the prairie with the hair on the outside be first worn and large umbrella-like straw hat come into use a little later it be decide the straw hat be not durable enough for the purpose when excite a cowboy frequently start he horse with he hat and when he be wear a straw four or five sharp blow knock out of the hat any semblance it may ever have have to respectability and symmetry the wide brim woolen hat be declare to be the correct thing and every one be glad of the change the narrow stirrup give place to a wider one and the stirrup leather be shorten so as to compel the rider to keep he knee bent the whole time the most important change in fashion twenty year ago be the introduction of tan leather leggings and of handsome bridle many a man now pay two or three month ' wages for he bridle and since the fashion come in it be probable that many thousand dollar have be invest in ornamental headgear for prairie horse and pony a new saddle as well as bow and tassel decoration also come in at this period and it be to be admit that for a time exaggeration in clothing become general it be a old joke on the prairie that the average man 's hat cost he more than he clothes many a cowboy earn $ 3000 a month have spend three time that sum on he saddle alone more than one man earn $ 2500 a month have invest every cent of he salary in silver buckle for he strange look hat equally extravagant be the average man as to he saddle bridle and even spur and bit those who talk so much about the bad habit of these people will hardly credit the fact that many a cowboy abstain from liquor and tobacco for a entire year at a stretch simply because he want to purchase some article of attire which he think will make he the envy of the entire ranch the cow pony be worthy of as much attention and think as the cowboy it be often say that the latter be hard and cruel and that he use he pony roughly this be far from be correct between the cowboy and he pet pony there be generally a bond of sympathy and a thorough understanding without which the marvelous feat of horsemanship which be perform daily would be impossible perhaps in the preliminary breaking in of the pony there be more roughness than be quite necessary at the same time it should be remember that to subdue a animal which be bear on the prairie and have run wild to its heart 's content be not a very simple matter the habit of buck which a texa pony seem to inherit from its ancestor be a very inconvenient one and a expert rider from the east be perfectly helpless upon the back of a buck pony the way in which he mount assure the animal at once that he be a stranger in those part a natural desire to unseat the daring stranger become paramount and the pony proceed to carry out the idea at first it move quietly and the rider congratulate himself on have convince the animal that resistance will be ill vain but just as he begin to do this the animal get down its head arch up its back something after the manner of a angry cat leap into the air and come down on the ground with its four leg draw together under it perfectly stiff and straight the rider seldom know how it happen he only know that it feel as though a cannon ball have strike he and that he fall off most ungracefully a pony never buck viciously when a cowboy be ride it it have learn by long experience that the process be distinctly unprofitable breaking in a pony and convince it that the way of the transgressor be hard be one of the difficulty of prairie life when however it be once accomplish a almost invaluable assistant have be secure the stay power of the cow pony be almost without limit he will carry he master 100 mile in a day apparently with very little fatigue in point of speed he may not be able to compete with he better breed eastern cousin but in point of distance cover he entirely outclass he assume a easy gait within its power of endurance a pony of the prairie will keep it up almost indefinitely at the end of a very long ride the man be generally more fatigued than he steed the latter after be relieve of its saddle and bridle roll vigorously to get rid of the stiffness and after a hour or two be apparently in as good condition as ever the charm connect with cowboy life be find in the disregard of strict rule of etiquette and ceremony and in the amount of fun which be consider to be in place around the prairie fire we have already see that the wages pay to cowboy be and always have be very small the hour that have to be work and the hardship that have to be encounter seem to combine together to deter man from lead the life at all we know that it do neither and that it be seldom there be really any dearth of help on the prairie or among the cattle herd the greatest delight be derive from joke play at the expense of smart tenderfoot who approach the camp with too much confidence in themselves the commonest way of convince the newcomer that he have make a mistake be to persuade he to ride a exceptionally fractious pony the task be generally approach with much confidence and almost invariably end in grief if the stranger can retain he seat and thus upset the rehearsed program the delight of the onlooker be even greater than they disappointment and the newcomer be admit at once into the good fellowship of the crowd nothing aggravate a cowboy so much or make he more desperate in he selection of trick as the affectation of badness on the part of a newcomer a year or two ago a young man who have be save up he money for year in order to emulate the deed of some of the hero describe in the cheap book he have be read arrive in the southwest and proceed to introduce himself to a number of employe of a cattle ranch who a few year ago would have be know as regulation cowboy the unlimited impudence and the astounding mendacity of the youth amuse the cowboy very much and they allow he to narrate a whole list of terrible act he have commit in the east before he have be in he new company a hour he have talk of theft and even killing with the nonchalance of a man who have serve a dozen year in jail he listener enjoy the absurdity of the situation and allow he to talk at random without interruption the story tell be bring to a end in a very sensational manner indeed one of the listener know that a deputy sheriff be in the neighborhood look out for a dangerous character skip out from the party he hunt up the deputy and tell he that one of the hunt man 's confederate be in the camp the deputy who be new to the business and anxious to make a reputation for himself rush to the camp and arrest the storyteller in spite of he protest the young man who have be so brave a few minute before weep bitterly and beg that some one would telegraph he mother so as to have he character establish and he liberty assure the joke be keep up so long that the young man be actually place in safe keep all night the follow morning he be release as there be nothing whatever against he except artistic lie the speed that he manage to attain while hurry to the nearest railroad station show that with proper training he might have make a good athlete he wait around the station until the next train go east and no passenger be more delighted when the conductor say all aboard than be the youth who be go back home very much discourage but very considerably enlighten on another occasion a typical cowboy be travel on the car and as be quite common with member of he profession have be approach by a sickly look youth who ask he dozen of question and evince a great anxiety to embark upon prairie life there be very little to interest the cattle-worker and after awhile he determine to get rid of he not overwelcome self-introduced friend he accordingly point out a rough-looking man at the far end of the car and tell the questioner that he be the leader of a dangerous band of train robber the individual be probably some hard-working man of perfectly honest habit but the would-be brave young man who a few moment before have be a candidate for a life of danger and hardship be so horrify at the bare idea that he decide in a moment to emulate the irishman who say he have leave he future behind he and jump from the move train prefer a succession of knock and bruise to actual contact with a man of the character he have school himself into admire every man who create a disturbance defy the law and discharge fire-arm at random be speak of as a cowboy although in a majority of instance he have never do a day 's work to justify the name the tough man from the east who go west to play the bad cowboy be liable to find that he have be borrow trouble he find out that a altercation be likely to bring he up face the muzzle of a pistol in the hand of a man much more ready to pull the trigger off-hand than to waste time in preliminary talk he soon learn the lesson of circumspection and if he survive the process he behavior be usually modify to fit he new surroundings a tragic illustration of the result that may come from a tenderfoot 's attempt to masquerade as a bad man west of the mississippus river take place in the winter of 1881-82 in new mexico on a southward-bound atchison train one of the stranger be terrorize the other he be a tough-looking fellow from some eastern city he have be drink and he parade the car talk loudly and profanely try to pick quarrel with passenger and frequently flourish a revolver the train hand do not seem inclined to interfere with he and among the people aboard whom he directly insult he do not happen to hit upon any one who have the sand or the disposition to call he down toward the member of a theatrical company travel in one of the coach he particularly direct he violence and insult he conduct with they at last become unbearable and when after threaten two actor with he revolver and frightening the woman to the verge of hysteric he pass onward into another car a hurry council of war be hold in the coach be have just vacate and every man who have a pistol get it in readiness with the understanding that if he return he be to be shoot down at the first aggressive movement but that phase of trouble be avert for as it happen he remain in the car ahead until at dusk the train roll into albuquerque here the proprietor of the armijo house be at the station with he hackman await the train 's arrival he call out the name of he house at the door of one car and then turn to the hackman say : you take care of the passenger in this car and i will go to the next these inoffensive word catch the ear of the tough man from the east who be push he way to the car platform he draw he pistol and start for the nearest man on the station platform shouting : you 'll take care of we will you i 'll show you smart fellow out here that you be not able to take care of I he flourish he revolver as he speak and just as he foot strike the second step of the car he fire the ball pass over the head of the man on the station platform the sound of he pistol be quickly follow by two loud report and the tough man fall forward upon the platform dead the man at whom he have apparently fire have draw he revolver and shoot he twice through the heart a crowd gather as the train roll on leave the tough man where he have fall of course the man who kill he a gambler of the town be fully exonerate at the inquest and be never even indict for the killing chapter viii ward of we native land the indian ' admirer and critic -- at school and after -- indian courtship and marriage -- extraordinary dance -- gambling by instinct -- how cross-eye lose he pony -- pawn a baby -- amusing and degrading scene on annuity day opinion differ materially as to the rights and wrong privilege and grievance and worthiness and worthlessness of the north american indian some people think that the red man have be shamefully treat and betray by the white man and that the catalogue of he grievance be as long as the tale of woe the former be apt to tell whenever he can make himself understand by a sympathetic listener holder of this opinion live for the most part in district where there be no indian located there be other who think that the indian have be absurdly pampered by the government and that it would be as sensible to try to change the arrangement of season as to attempt to prevent the survival of the fittest or in other word to interfere with the gradual but in they opinion inevitable extermination of the indian those hold this extreme view be for the most part those who live near indian reservation and who have have opportunity of study the red man 's character both view be of course unduly severe as a useful citizen the indian vary considerably and it be rather as a interesting study that we approach the subject civilization have a very peculiar effect upon the american indian the school for indian child be well manage and the education impart should be sufficient to prevent the possibility of a relapse into the unsatisfactory habit and the traditional uncleanliness of the different tribe sometimes the effect of education be excellent there be many indian to be find who have adopt civilized mode of living and who have build up home and amass little fortune by farm raise cattle and trade some of the indian notably those of the five civilized tribe or nation in indian territory resemble white man in appearance very much they will sometimes work side by side with swarthy caucasian whose skin have be tan by exposure to the sun and except for the exceptionally high cheek bone and the peculiarly straight hair there be little to distinguish the indian from the white man but these case be exception to the general rule which be that education be look upon by indian as a degradation rather than otherwise great difficulty be often experience in persuade parent to allow they child to be take to the training school at all and so much compulsion be often necessary that a appearance of kidnaping be impart the first thing that be do with a indian boy or girl admit to one of these school be to wash the newcomer with considerable vigor from head to foot and to cut off the superfluous and generally speak thickly mat hair the comfort of short hair neatly comb and brush seldom impress itself upon the youthful brave for obvious reason this be however insist upon and while the boy be at school he be keep neat and clean directly however he return to he tribe he be in danger of relapse into the habit of he forefather too often he be sneer at for he neatness he short hair be look upon as a offense and he be generally willing to fall in with tribal fashion abandon he neat clothing and let he hair grow and he face accumulate the regulation amount of dust and dirt the indian trader and the pioneer generally will tell you that the only good indian be a dead indian he will repeat this adage until it become wearisome in its monotony then perhaps he will vary it by tell you that of all the mean indian the educate one be the meanest this be only true in some instance but it be a fact that education do not invariably benefit the indian at all almost all indian be passionately fond of dance several book have be write descriptive of the various dance of different tribe some of they have a hidden meaning and dangerous significance while other be merely for the purpose of amusement and recreation for these dance the indian generally put on the most fancy costume they have and they movement be sometimes graceful and sometimes grotesque the sign dance as see in some of the southwestern tribe be a curious one one of the belle of the tribe lead a man into the dancing apartment which consist of one of two tepee throw together in one be the tomtom beater in the other the dancer in this room the couple begin to dance make sign to each other the meaning of which may be : well what do you think of I do you like I do you think I pretty how do i affect you and so on the sign all be closely watch by the spectator who applaud giggle chuckle or laugh uproariously by turn as the case may be such a dance be a question bee a collision of wit on the part of two really facetious indian wit be a universal trait of the savage some white man draw all indian draw some white man be cunning all indian be cunning some white man be humorous all indian be witty dry wit with a proverbial philosophy in it which would have delight the soul of tupper be indigenous to the indian the

have they foe among indian woman but however cordially hate they never brawl or come to blow love-making be one of the interesting night scene in a indian camp when a young man want to court a pretty red couquette he stand at the door of he lodge on a bright day and flash a ray of light from he sun-glass on the face of he sweetheart far away she see the ray as it fall on she and follow in the direction whence it be throw right or left she understand the secret of these flash light soon the lover meet each under a blanket not a word not a salutation be exchange they stand near each other

more and more creep in with all its appalling degradation on special occasion a entire tribe be gather under a open space in the cottonwood to celebrate they principal dance hand be wildly wave above the head of the dancer around a central fire of log pile in a conical heap around this blaze pile run the dark circle which be build at sunset inclosing sacred ground which must not be trespass on the old chanter stand at the gate of the corral and sing the man build the dark circle in less than a hour when do the corral measure forty pace in diameter around it stand a fence eight foot high with a gate in the east ten foot wide at night-fall many of the navajo people move temporarily all they goods and property into the corral and abandon they hut or hogan those who do not move in be watcher to protect they property for there be thief among the navajo at 8 o'clock a band of musician enter and sit down begin a series of cacophonous sound on a drum as soon as the music begin the great wood pile be light the conflagration spread rapidly and light the whole landscape and the sky a storm of red whirling spark fly upward like bright golden bee from out a hive to a height of a hundred foot the descend ash fall in the corral like a light shower of snow the heat soon grow so intense that in the remotest part of the enclosure it be necessary for a person to screen he face when he look towards the fire suddenly a warning whistle be hear in the outer darkness and a dozen form lithe and lean dress only with the narrow white breech-clout and mocassin and daub with white earth until they seem a group of live marble come bound through the entrance yelp like wolf and slowly move round the fire as they advance in single file they throw they body into diverse attitude some graceful some strain some difficult some menacing and all grotesque now they face the east now the west now the south now the north bearing aloft they slender wand tip with eagle down holding and wave they with surprising effect they course around the fire be to the left east west south north a course invariably take by all the dancer of the night when they have circle the fire twice they begin to thrust they wand toward it they object be to try to burn off the tip of eagle down they dash up to the fire crawl up to it on they face run up hold they head sidewise dart up backward and approach it in all sort of attitude suddenly one approach the flaming pile throw himself on he back with he head to the fire and swiftly thrust he wand into the flame many be the unsuccessful attempt but at length one by one they all succeed in burn the downy ball from the end of they wand as each accomplish he feat it become necessary as the next duty to restore the ball of down which be do by refit the ring hold in the hand with down upon it and put it on the head of the aromatic sumac wand the dance custom and idea differ with the tribe and locality sometimes the dance be little more than a exhibition of power of endurance man or woman or both go through fatiguing motion for hour and even day in succession astounding spectator by they disregard of the tradition of they race so far as idleness be concerned other dance be grotesque and brutal on special occasion weird ceremony be indulge in and the proceedings be sensational in the extreme of the ghost dance and its serious import reader of the daily papers be familiar of the war dance of the different tribe a great deal have also be write and altogether the dance lore of the american indian be replete with singular incongruity and picturesque anomaly dance with the indian be often a religious exercise it involve hardship at time and occasionally the participant even mutilate themselves in they enthusiasm some of the tribe of the southwest dance as we shall see later with venomous snake in they hand allow themselves to be bite and rely on the power of the priest to save they from evil consequence the indian gamble as if by instinct on one occasion the writer be visit a frontier town just after its settlement indian be present in very large number and in a variety of way they get hold of a good deal of money the newcomer from the eastern state be absolutely unprepared for the necessary privation of frontier life hence they be willing to purchase necessary article at almost any price while they be easily delude into buy all sort of article for which they have no possible need the indian who be suppose to be civilized take full advantage of the situation and bring into town everything that be of a salable character frequently obtain three or four time the local cash value with the money thus obtain they gamble desperately one indian who boast of the terrible name of cross-eye bring in two pony to sell one of they be a exceptionally ancient-looking animal which have long since outlive its usefulness and which under ordinary local condition could certainly have be purchase for $ 400 or $ 500 a friendly indian meet mr cross-eye and a conversation ensue as to the value of the pony and the probable price that it would realize the two man soon get angry on the subject and finally the owner of the pony bet he animal 's critic the pony against $ 2000 that it would realize at least the last-named sum with this extra stimulus for drive a good bargain the man offer he pony to a number of white man and finally find one who need a animal at once and who be willing to pay $ 2000 for the antiquated quadruped cross-eye make a number of guttural noise indicative of he delight and promptly collect the second $ 2000 he have thus practically sell a worthless pony for $ 4000 and have it not be for he innate passion for gamble would have do a very good day 's business a few hour later however he be find look very disconsolate and try very hard to sell some suppose curiosity for a few dollar with which to buy a blanket he sorely need he impecuniosity be easily explain instead of proceed at once to sell he second pony he turn he attention first to gambling and in less than a hour he last dollar have go then with the gamester 's desperation he have put up he second pony as a final stake with the result that he lose he money and he stock in trade as well he take the situation philosophically and stoically but when he find it impossible in the busy pioneer town to get even the price of a drink of whisky for he curiosity he begin to get reckless and be finally escort out of the town by two or three of he friend to prevent he get mix up in a fight when the indian have enough energy they gamble almost day and night the woman themselves be generally keep under sufficient subjection by they husband to make gambling on they part impossible so far as the actual playing of game of chance be concerned but they stand by and watch the man they stake they necklace leggings ornament and in fact they all on the play which be do sometimes with blue wild plum-stone hieroglyphically character and sometimes with play bone but oftener with common card above the ground the tom-tom would be sound but below ground the tom-tom be bury a indian smoke incessantly while he gamble put the cigarette or cigar to he mouth he draw in the smoke in long deep breath until he have fill he lung completely when he begin slowly to emit the smoke from he nose little by little until it be all go the object of this with the indian be to steep he sens more deeply with the narcotize soporific the tobacco they smoke be generally they own raise the thing that move I most write a traveler describe a visit to a indian gambling den be the spectacle in the furthest corner of the ` shack ' of a indian mother with a pappoose in its baby-case peeping over she back there she stand behind a indian gambler to whom she have join she life paint and bead and half intoxicate the indian husband have already put he saddle in pawn to the white professional gambler for he $ 500 and it be not five minute before the white gambler have the saddle and $ 500 both then when they have nothing else leave to bet so intense be they love for gamble they begin to put themselves in pawn piecemeal say : ` i 'll bet you my whole body ' that mean ` i 'll put myself in pawn to you as you slave to serve you as you will for a specify time ' so it be that this indian mother stand lean back wearily against the wall half drunk and daze with smoke and heat when all at once the indian who live with she say to she in indian : ` put in the baby for a week then pay-day will come ' it be do the baby be hand over that be what civilization have do for the indian its virtue escape he its vice inoculate he one of these vice be gamble the indian be keep poor all the year round and pluck of every pinfeather that be the principal reason why he steal not only to reimburse himself for loss but also to avenge himself upon the white man who he know well enough have constantly rob he gamble as witness in the indian camp

indian themselves one from corn and the other from the maguay plant the plain indian drink whisky to gamble be to drink and to drink be to lose gambling be the hardest work that you can persuade a indian to do unless threaten by starvation different tribe gamble differently the comanch undoubtedly have by far the most exciting and fascinating gambling game the comanche puzzle trick and problem be also decidedly superior to those of any other nation the gambling bone be use by the comanch the leader of the game hold it up before the eye of all so that all can see it he then close he two hand over it and manipulate it so dexterously in he finger that it be simply impossible to tell which hand the bone be in in a moment he suddenly fling each close hand on either side of he down into the outreach hand of the player next to he the game commence at this point the whole line of player pass or pretend to pass this bone on from one to another until at last every hand be wave all this time the eye along the opposite line of gambler be eagerly watch each shift and movement of the hand in hope of discover the white flash of the bone at last some one descry the hand that hold the bone or think so he point out and call out for he side the hand must instantly be throw up if it be right the watch side score a point and take the bone the side change off in this way until the game be win the full score be twenty-one point the excitement produce by this game be at time simply indescribable the ute play with two bone in each hand one of which be wrap about with a string the game be to

play with bead little loop and long horn stick make of deer foot the child look on and learn to gamble from they earliest childhood and soon learn to cheat and impose on they junior they little juvenile gambling operation be do principally with arrow winter breed sloth and sloth beget gambling and gamble drink there be no conviviality in indian drinking bout the indian get drunk and dead drunk as soon as he possibly can and find he highest enjoyment in sleep it off he nature react viciously under drink however in many case and he be then a dangerous customer the woman of many tribe be a most pitiable lot of hard work ragged and dirty humanity upon they fall all the drudgery of the camp they be hewer of wood and drawer of water and bend under immense burden pile upon they back while thousand of pony browse undisturbed in every direction as the troops be withdraw the squaw swoop down upon the desert camp and rapidly glean they of all that be portable for use in they domestic economy a indian fire would be consider a very cheerless affair by the inmate of house heat by modern appliance but such as it be -- a few stick burn with feeble blaze and scarcely penetrate the dense smoke fill the tepee from the ground to the small opening at the top -- it consume fuel and the demand be always greater than the supply for the reason that a indian have no idea of preparation for future necessity if the fire burn all right when the last stick be lay on a squaw will start for a fresh supply no matter how cold and stormy the weather may be the poetical indian maiden may still exist in the vivid imagination of extreme youth but she be not common to-day the young girl affect gay attire and be exempt from the hardship of toil which be impose on they elder sister mother and grandam but they fate be infinitely worse little beauty be to be discern among they and in this regard time seem to have efface the type which be prevalent a few year ago annuity day be a great event in the life of every agency indian and if the reader would see indian life represent in some of its most interesting feature there be no more suitable time to select for a visit to any agency it be a grand opening attend by the whole tribe but the squaw do not enjoy quite the freedom of choice in the matter of dress goods or receive such prompt attention from the clerk as we city lady be accustom to even at 9 o'clock in the morning notwithstanding the fact that the actual distribution would not take place until noon the nation 's ward be there patiently wait for the business of the day to begin stake have be drive into the ground to mark the space to be occupy by each band and behind they arrange in a semicircle be the different family under the charge of a head man the band vary in number both of family and individual but they all look equally solemn as they sit on the ground with they knee draw up under they chin or cross-legged like turk and tailor the scene now become one of bustle and activity on the part of the agency people who begin rapidly fill wagon after wagon with goods from the store-house blanket of dark blue material cotton cloth calico of all color and pattern red flannel gay woolen shawl boot and shoe that make one 's foot ache to look at they coffee pot water bucket axis and numerous other article be pile into each wagon in the proportion previously determine by conference with the head man a ticket be then give to the driver bear the number of the stake and the name of the head man away go the wagon the goods be throw out on the ground in a pile at the proper stake and that complete the formal transfer to the head man who then take charge of they and with the assistance of a few of the buck designate by himself divide the various article accord to the want of the family and the amount of goods supply during the rush and fury of the issue and division of the goods the sombre figure in the background have scarcely move not one have venture to approach the center where the buck be at work measure off the cloth etc they be wait for the tap of the bell when they will receive just what the head man choose to give they there be no system of exchange there it be take what you get or get nothing in a great many case they do not use the goods at all but openly offer they for sale to the whites who no doubt find it profitable to purchase at indian price as soon as the issue be complete a crowd of indian gather in front of the trader 's store to indulge they passion for gambling and in a short space of time a number of blanket and other article change hand on the result of pony race foot race or any other species of excitement that can be invent there be a white man on the ground who be no doubt a professional runner and the indian back they favorite against he in a purse of over $ 3000 which the white man cover and win the race by a few inch the indian will not give up and make similar purse on the two succeed day

forget a single item or person ration day bring out the squaw and dog in full force the one to pack the ration to camp and the latter to pick up stray bit a few at a time the squaw enter the store-house and receive they week 's supply of flour coffee sugar salt etc for themselves and family the beef be issue directly from the slaughter-house and the proceeding be anything but appetizing to watch the beef to be kill be first drive into a corral where they be shoot by the indian butcher when the poor beast have be shoot to death they be drag to the door of the slaughter-house and pass through the hand of half-naked buck who seem to glory in the profusion of blood and eagerly seek the position on account of the perquisite attach to it in the way of tempting -lrb- -rrb- morsel which usually go to the dog or on the refuse heap the beef be issue as fast as it can be cut up at the rate of half a pound a day for each person regardless of age bacon be also issue as a part of the meat ration chapter ix civilization -- actual and alleged try in the balance and find want -- indian archer -- bow and arrow lore -- barbarous custom that die slowly -- great wolf the indian vanderbilt -- how the serus be teach a valuable lesson -- play with rattlesnake with impunity do prohibition prohibit be a question politician and social reformer ask again and again do civilization civilize be a question which be ask almost exclusively by person who be interested in the welfare of the american indian and who come in daily contact with he in the precede chapter we have see some little of the peculiar habit of the american indian civilized and otherwise and it will be interesting now to see to what extent the white man 's teaching have drive away primeval habit of live hunting and fight within the last few week evidence of a most valuable character on this question have be furnish by the report submit to the secretary of the interior by the commission send to investigate matter concern the five civilized tribe of indian in the indian territory this say that they have demonstrate they incapacity to govern themselves and recommend that the trust that have be repose in they by the government should be revoke the court of justice have become helpless and paralyzed murder violence and robbery be a every-day occurrence it be learn by the commission that fifty-three murder occur in the month of September and October in one tribe only and not one of the culprit be bring to justice the dawe commission recommend that a large portion of the indian reservation be annex to oklahoma this action to be follow by form that country into a territory but to accomplish this it would be necessary that the consent of the indian be obtain and this be doubtful the statement that the indian have cast aside they ancient weapon and adopt more modern one and that through the use of they they be gradually extend they hunting grounds beyond the line of they reservation be false the report of the commission make this clearly know throughout the west the indian still trust to they bow and arrow on the northwest coast most of the indian live by hunting and fishing they use principally the bow and arrow knife war club and lance in the north pacific ocean be several island inhabit only by indian in the queen charlotte and the prince of wale archipelago be find one of the most remarkable race of aborigine on the american continent these be the haida tribe and consist of strikingly intelligent indian they acquire knowledge readily learn trade and exhibit much ingenuity in follow the teaching of missionary and trader but for all that they still cling with something border upon affection to the primitive weapon of they race during the long winter night the old indian seat themselves before the fire and carve bow ornament club handle and feather and point arrow perhaps in some of the tepee hang polished gun furnish by the government but they be more for ornament than use this evening work be accompany by the low croaking of some old indian who tell over again the legend folk-lore and nursery tale of they grandfather and grandmother the haida tribe be more rapidly advance in civilization than any of its neighbor yet they still carve and paint bow arrow club handle and paddle the indian still cling to other rude implement and take not kindly to metal one rude knife be still use for skin deer especially by the old indian the axe of course be employ for cut tree and excavate canoe and mortar it have really take the place of the stone chisel yet many old man prefer burn the root of the tree until it can be make to fall by give it a few hack with the rude stone hatchet in archery the indian have scarcely be excel with a quick eye and a powerful muscle he send the arrow as unerringly as the archer of olden time the indian bow be usually from three and one-half to four foot in length with such a difficult spring that one with no experience can scarcely bend it sufficiently to set the string different tribe of course carry bow of different length the seneca have the longest the best of wood for make bow be osage orange hickory ash elm cedar plum and cherry some of these be strengthen with sinew and glue almost every tribe have three size the largest be use for war purpose and until a indian can handle this war bow he be not consider entitle to be call a warrior some claim the sioux and the crow make the best bow although the apach come close in the rank when the sioux bow be unstrung it be a straight piece of wood while the apach and the southern indian make a perfect cupid 's bow the crow often use elk horn as material and carve they beautifully the sioux to make the straight piece of wood more elastic string the back with sinew often these be beautifully bead and leather quite equal as a piece of art the elaborate elk horn bow make by the crow the comanch ' bow be cover with sinew much like those of the apach the object of practice be to enable the bowman to draw the bow with sudden and instant effect it be seldom that the indian have need of throw the arrow to a great distance the bow of the western indian be small and apparently insignificant though its owner make it very powerful indeed from he babyhood day he have habituate it to he use until it have become as it be a very part of he nature the indian study to get the greatest power out of the smallest possible compass and he find a short bow on horseback far more easily use and much more reliable in its execution in the far west bow be make largely of ash and be line with layer of buffalo or deer sinew on the back the blackfeet have in use very valuable bow of bone other tribe make use of the horn of mountain sheep sometimes the bone bow will fetch very large sum of money and deal have be notice in which the consideration for one of they be a pair of pony with five pound of butter throw in as make-weight a athletic indian on a fleet horse can do terrible execution with one of these bow which even in these day of repeat rifle be by no means to be despise as a weapon no one can estimate the force of a throw from one of they when a artistic archer be in charge the effect from a wound from a arrow be so distressing that it be quite common to accuse a indian of use poison arrow when possibly such a fiendish idea never enter he head only those who have ridden side by side with a indian hunter really know how much more powerful a arrow shot be than the average man suppose in war the indian would even now arm themselves in part with bow quiver lance war club and shield the northwestern tribe be partial to fight with the bow and lance protect with a shield this shield be worn outside of the left arm after the manner of the roman and grecian shield the western indian be fonder of horseback ride than the eastern tribe and have learn to wield they weapon while mount they be teach to kill game while run at full speed and prefer to fight on horseback some of they be great coward when dismount but seat on a indian pony they be undaunted it be a mistake to suppose that arrow-head be no longer manufacture the art of fashion they be not lose almost every tribe manufacture its own bowlder of flint be break with a sledge-hammer make of a round pebble of hornstone set in a twisted withe this bone be think to be the tooth of the sperm whale in oregon the indian arrow be still point with flint the iroquoi also use flint until they lay aside the arrow for the lack of anything to hunt the iroquois youth though the rifle have be introduce largely into he tribe will have none of it but take naturally to the bow and arrow steel for arrow-head be furnish by the fur-trader in the rocky mountain and iron head be often make from old barrel hoop fashion with a piece of sandstone in shooting with the bow and arrow on horseback the indian horse be teach to approach the animal attack on the right side enable its rider to throw the arrow to the left buffalo bill be a adept at slaughter game on horseback and he win he great bet at kill the greatest number of buffalo by follow the custom of the indian and shoot to the leave the horse approach the animal he halter hang loose upon he neck bring the rider within three or four pace of the game when the arrow or rifle ball be send with ease and certainty through the heart indian who have the opportunity to ride nowadays still exercise with a lance twelve or fifteen foot in length in they war game and dance they always appear with this lance and shield the spear be modern and have a blade of polish steel and the shield be make of skin those of old make be of buffalo neck the skin be soak and harden with a glue extract from the hoof the shield be arrow-proof and will throw off a rifle shot if hold obliquely and this the indian can do with great skill since there be no war or the occasion for the use of these arm except in game of practice many of the indian for a few bottle of fire water have sell they best shield and now they be see scatter over the country preserve as curio it be folly to assume that the indian have wholly or partly do away with they barbaric custom in they celebration it be they great joy to cast off they clothing and to paint they body all color of the rainbow wear horn on they head and make themselves look as hideous as possible the arrow game be introduce -- never be there demonstration with the modern weapon -- and the man be esteem above all other who can throw the greatest number of arrow in the sky before the first one fall in hunting the sioux kill muskrat with spear as they do in early day spear the buffalo manage to get close to they by be dress in wolf skin and go on all fours there be indian who would on horseback attack and kill a bear with a lance but be afraid to molest the animal unless they have the indian pony as a means of escape the arrow-head of chert use for hunting be peculiarly fasten in order to make the arrow revolve the indian feather the arrow for the same purpose and also carve the arrow shaft with a spiral groove this be not as have be suppose to let the blood out of the wound but to make the arrow carry every tribe have its own arrow it be claim that the pawnee be the best manufacturer the comanch feather they arrow with two feather the navajo ute and all apach except the tonto have three feather -- the tonto use four feather for each shaft the bird arrow be the very smallest make i have practice say one traveler for hour with the ute uselessly try to blame the twist of the feathered arrow for my bad shot the indian say the carve and feather be so arrange as to give the arrow the correct motion and one old chief on see the twist in the rifle barrel by which the ball be make to revolve in the same manner claim that the white man steal he idea from the indian stone with groove around they greatest circumference be secure to a handle by a withe or thong and become war club they be dangerous weapon in the hand of a indian tomahawk manufacture by white man have succeed the war club in a way as it be claim the rifle have the bow and arrow recent tomahawk take from the indian bear a english trade-mark they originally cost about 15 cent and be sell to the indian for nothing less than a horse and perhaps two chief wolf a indian croesus and the vanderbilt of the red man though he be worth over $ 500000 and drive at time in a elegant coach cling closely to he tepee ever demonstrate the savage part of he life he live at fishhook bay on the snake river in the state of washington he be of the palouse snake indian and though he have a comfortable house he never sleep there but go to the tepee no matter how inclement the weather in the day when the buffalo be plenty wolf be a great hunter he tell a tale of drive 3000 bison over a bluff near the snake where they be all kill by the fall this be suppose to be true because until late year the place be a mass of bone though he have he gun and all the modern fire-arm both he and he child cling to the primitive weapon of war the correspondence between the government of the united state and mexico over the brutal murder of two man by the serus indian seem to show that some at least of the north american indian have gain nothing at all from the civilizing influence which be suppose to have extend for so many year the deed have no other motive than pure fiendishness small as be the tribe of seri -- they number only about 200 soul -- these savage be the most blood-thirsty in north america for a long time they have terrorize sonora but the mexican government seem powerless to control they the tribe be visit recently by a expedition from the bureau of ethnology which have just return to washington with some very interesting information prof w j mcgee who lead the party say : it be understand that the seri be cannibal -- at all event they eat every white man they can slay they be cruel and treacherous beyond description toward the white man they attitude be exactly the same as that of a white man toward a rattlesnake -- they kill he as a matter of course unless restrain by fear never do they fight in open warfare but always lie in ambush they be copper-colored ishmaelite it be they custom to murder everybody white red or mexican who venture to enter the territory they call they own in many respects the seri be the most interesting tribe of savage in north america they be decidedly more primitive in they way than any other indian have scarcely any art worth mention in fact they have not yet advance as far as the stone age the only stone implement in common use among they be a rude hammer of that material which they employ for beat clay to make a fragile and peculiar kind of pottery when one of the squaw wish to make meal of mesquite bean and she have no utensil for the purpose she look about until she find a rock with a upper surface conveniently hollow and on this she place the bean pound they with a ordinary stone the seri live on the island of tiburon in the gulf of californium they also claim 5000 square mile of the mainland in sonora they dwelling be the rudest imaginable a chance rock commonly serve for one wall of the habitation stone be pile up so as to make a small enclosure and the shell of a single great turtle do for a roof the house be always open on one side and be not intend as a shelter from storm but chiefly to keep off the sun the man and woman wear a single garment like a petticoat make of pelican skin the child be naked not far from tiburon which be about thirty mile long by fifteen mile wide there be a smaller island where pelican roost in vast number the seri go at night and with stick knock over as many bird as they require these indian be fond of carrion it make no difference to they whether a horse have die a natural death a week or a month ago they devour the flesh greedily the foot of the animal they boil until those part be tender enough to bite the seri be among the very dirtiest of savage they habit in all respects be filthy they seem to have almost no amusement though the child play with the very rudest doll before the whites come they use piece of shell for cut instrument they be accustom to kill deer by run and surround the animal no tradition of sufficient interest to justify recording in print appear to exist among these people the most interesting ornament see on any member of the tribe be a necklace of human hair adorn with the rattle of rattlesnake which abound in the territory infested with these remnant of all that be most objectionable among the aboriginal red man of this continent physically speak the seri be most remarkable they be of great stature the man average nearly six foot in height with splendid chest but the most noticeable point about they be they leg which be very slender and sinewy resemble the leg of the deer since the first come of the spaniard they have be know to other tribe as the runner it be say that they can run from 150 to 200 mile per day not pause for rest the jack rabbit be consider a very fleet animal yet these indian be accustom to catch jack rabbit by outrun they for this purpose three man or boy go together if the rabbit run straight away from the pursuer it could not be take but its instinct be to make its flight by zigzag the hunter arrange themselves a short distance apart as quickly as one of they start a rabbit a second indian run as fast as he can along a line parallel with the course take by the animal presently the rabbit see the second indian and dash off at a tangent by this time the third hunter have come up and give the quarry another turn after the third or fourth zigzag the rabbit be surround and the hunter quickly close in upon he and grab he it be a odd fact that this method of catch jack rabbit be precisely the same as that adopt by coyote which work similarily by three by this strategy these wild dog capture the rabbit though the latter be more fleet by far it be believe that no other human be approach the seri in celerity of movement a favorite sport of the boy be lasso dog mongrel cur be the only animal domesticate by these wild people for amusement sake the boy take they dog to a clear place and drive they in all direction then they capture the frightened animal by run and throw the lasso which be make of human hair they have no difficulty in overtake the dog one day a party of boy return with they dog after a bout of this sport pass near a bush in which there be three or four blackbird on spy the bird they dash toward the bush and try to catch they with they hand they do not succeed though one of the bird only escape with the loss of several feather some woman of the tribe be watch and they actually jeer at the boy for they failure the boy be so mortified that they do not go into camp but go off and sit by themselves in the shade of a greasewood bush what white man or boy would think of catch blackbird in such a way yet non-success in a attempt of that kind be the exception and not the rule the seri often take bird in this fashion señor encina be the pioneer in that region he find good grazing country in the territory claim by the seri and so established he stock farm there he bring priest with he to convert the savage and catch a couple of the latter to educate as interpreter the plan for civilize the indian prove a failure they do not care to become christian and they kill the señor 's stock so finally the señor decide to adopt a new course of procedure he summon the indian to a council as many of they as would come and inform they that from that time on he and he vaquero would slay a indian for every head of cattle that be kill at the same time he send away the priest and engage a additional number of vaquero the indian pay no attention to the warning and a few day later they kill several head of cattle without delay the señor and he man coral and kill a corresponding number of the seri then there be war the savage make ambush but they have only bow and arrow and the vaquero fight bravely with they gun every ambush turn out disastrously for the indian finally the seri make a great ambush and there be a battle which result in the killing of sixty-five savage the lesson prove sufficient and the indian be glad to

half century of contact with european they manner of life have not materially change the indian tribe that roam over mountain and plain have become ward of the government debase and denude of whatever dignity they once possess ascribe what cause you will for they present condition but the pueblo indian have absolutely maintain the integrity of he individuality and be self-respecting and self-sufficient he accept the form of religion profess by he spanish conqueror but without abandon he own and that be practically the only concession he persistent conservatism have ever make to external influence laborious effort have be make to penetrate the reserve with which the involve inner life of this strange child of the desert be guard but it lie like a dark vast continent behind a

mexico the exterior of the house be absolutely plain it be sometimes seven story in height and contain over a thousand room in some instance it be build of adobe -- block of mud mix with straw and dry in the sun and in other of stone cover with mud cement the entrance be by means of a ladder and when that be pull up the latch-string be consider withdraw the pueblo of pueblo be acoma a city without a peer it be build upon the summit of a table-rock with overhang erode side 350 foot above the plain which be 7000 foot above the sea anciently accord to the tradition of the quere it stand upon the crest of the superb haunted mesa three mile away and some 300 foot higher but its only approach be one day destroy by the fall of a cliff and three unhappy woman who chance to be the only occupant -- the remainder of the population be at work in the field below -- die of starvation in view of the homeless hundred of they people who for many day surround the unscalable mesa with upturned agonize face the present acoma be the one discover by the spaniard the original pueblo on the mesa encantada be even then a ancient tradition it be 1000 foot in length and 40 foot high and there be besides a church of enormous proportion until lately it be reach only by a precipitous stairway in the rock up which the inhabitant carry upon they back every particle of the material of which the village be construct the graveyard consume forty year in building by reason of the necessity of bring earth from the plain below and the church must have cost the labor of many generation for its wall be 60 foot high and 10 foot thick and it have timber 40 foot long and 14 inch square the acoma welcome the soldier of coronado with deference ascribe to they celestial origin subsequently upon learn the distinctly human character of the spaniard they profess allegiance but afterwards wantonly slew a dozen of zaldibar 's man by way of reprisal zaldibar head three-score soldier and undertake to carry the sky-citadel by assault the incident have no parallel in american history short of the memorable and similar exploit of cortez on the great aztec pyramid after a three day ' hand to hand struggle the spaniard stand victor upon that seemingly impregnable fortress and receive the submission of the quere who for three-quarter of a century thereafter remain tractable in that interval the priest come to acoma and hold foot for fifty year until the bloody uprisal of 1680 occur in which priest soldier and settler be massacre or drive from the land and every vestige of they occupation be extirpate after the resubjection of the native by de vargas the present church be construct and the pueblo have not since rebel against the contiguity of the white man all the numerous mexican community in the territory contain representative of the penitente order which be peculiar by reason of the self-flagellation inflict by its member in excess of pietistic zeal unlike they ilk of indium they do not practice self-torture for long period but only upon a certain day in each year then strip to the waist these poor zealot go chant a dolorous strain and beat themselves unsparingly upon the back with the sharp-spined cactus or soap-weed until they be a revolting sight to look upon often they sink from the exhaustion of long-sustained suffering and loss of blood one of the ceremony among these peculiar people be the bearing of a huge cross of heavy timber for long distance martyr to conscience and religious devotee frequently carry cross of immense weight for mile and be watch eagerly by crowd of excited spectator the man who carry this fanatacism to the greatest length be the hero of the day and receive the appointment of chief of the ceremony for the following year ceremony such as these point to the extreme antiquity of the people and seem to indicate that they must have be descend from tribe which be prominent in biblical narrative accord to many able historian people have reside in this part of the world for at least twelve hundred year in other word when columbus and americus vespucius discover and explore the new world or portion of it these peculiar people have be live on the then mysterious continent for the greater part of a thousand year accord to some authority these people be aboriginal accord to other they migrate from some distant clime the antiquity of china be well know and there be good reason to believe that the moqui and zuni have spring from chinese voyager or perhaps pirate who hundred of year ago be wreck on the western shore of america another theory be that on the occasion of one of the numerous expulsion or emigration from china a band of mongolian turn northward and come into america by cross the behring strait other antiquarian think that morocco rather than china be the original home of these race the traveler be much strike with the resemblance between the habit and custom of the moor and of some of the old established tribe of new mexico in dress and architecture the moorish idea certainly prevail very prominently the white toga and the picturesque red turban be prominent in these resemblance the jug use for carry water be distinctly moorish in type and the woman carry they on they head in that peculiar manner which be so characteristic of moorish habit and custom one of the very earliest record of these people have be leave we by spanish explorer a writer who accompany one of the earliest expedition from spain say : we find a great town call acoma contain about 5000 people and situate upon a rock about fifty pace high with no other entrance but by a pair of stair hew in the rock whereat we people marvel not a little the chief man of this town come peaceably to visit we bring many mantle and chamoix skin excellently dress and great plenty of victuals they corn-field be two league distant and they fetch water out of a small river to water the same on the brink whereof there be great bank of rose like those of castile there be many mountain full of metal we man remain in the place three day upon one of which the inhabitant make before they a very solemn dance come forth in the same gallant apparel use very witty sport wherewith we man be exceedingly delighted among the ruin find here the early use of stone for architectural purpose be clearly manifest and there be innumerable relic of ingenuity in period upon which we be apt to look with great contempt arrow-head make of flint quartz agate and jaspar can easily be find by the relic hunter hatchet make of stone and sharpen in a most unique manner be also common and the ancestor of the pueblo undoubtedly use knife make of stone hundred of year ago one of the most interesting of the ancient house be in the chaco cañon this edifice be probably at one time 300 foot long about half as wide and three story high from the nature of the room it be evident that the wall be build in terrace-form out of sandstone there be about 150 room and judge from the present habit of the people at least 500 human being live in this mammoth boarding-house another very interesting structure of a similar character be find on the upper grande river about two hour ' drive from santa fe it be about 300 foot square originally and most of the foundation be still in fairly good condition though much of the expose portion of the stone have yield by degree to the friction cause by continual sandstorm it be believe that more than 1000 people live in this one house of recent year a good deal have be write concern the possibility of the future in regard to save expense by large number of family occupy one house most of these idea have be ridicule because experience have prove that family seldom reside comfortably in crowded quarter the tribe of which we be write while they destroy the originality of the communistic idea of the nineteenth century also disprove the argument which be principally bring against they in these singular house or colony several family live together in perfect harmony there be no instance on record of dispute such as be meet with in boarding-house patronize by white people and in this one respect at any rate quite a lesson be teach we by the pueblo tribe the people be quiet and peaceable in disposition and one secret of they peaceful dwelling together be find in the absence of jealousy a characteristic or vice which do not seem to have penetrate into the house on the cliff or to have sully the disposition of these people with such a remarkable and creditable history it require a good deal of dexterity and agility to enter or leave a communal house of this character and a door from what we be apt to term a civilized point of view be unknown the visitor be tell a number of legend and story about these house and the people who live in they the come of montezuma be the great idea which permeate all the legend and story accord to many of the people montezuma leave mexico during the remote age in a canoe build of serpent-skin he object be to civilize the east and to do away with human sacrifice he communicate with the people by means of cord in which knot be tie in the most ingenious manner the knot convey the meaning of the prophet and he peculiar message be carry from pueblo to pueblo by swift messenger who take great delight in execute they task a number of exceedingly romantic legend be center around the pueblo de tao which be about twenty mile from embudo taos be consider the most interesting and the most perfect specimen of a pueblo indian fortress it consist of two communistic house each five story high and a roman catholic church -lrb- now in a ruin condition -rrb- which stand near although apart from the dwelling around the fortress be seven circular mound which at first suggest the idea of be the work of mound-builder on further examination they prove to be the sweating chamber or turkish bath of this curious people of these chamber the largest appear also to serve the purpose of a council chamber and mystic hall where rite peculiar to the tribe -lrb- about which they be very reticent -rrb- be perform the pueblo indian delight to adorn themselves in gay color and form very interesting and picturesque subject for the artist especially when associate with they quaint surroundings they be skilled in the manufacture of pottery basket-making and bead work the grand annual festival of these indian occur on the 30th of September and the ceremony be of a peculiarly interesting character jesuitism have graft its faith upon the superstition of the montezuma and a curious fruitage be the result the mystic rite of the pueblo indian perform at pueblo de taos in honor of san geronimo -lrb- st jerome -rrb- upon each succeed 30th day of September attract large concourse of people and be of great interest to either the ethnologist ecclesiastic or tourist a brief description can give but a faint idea of these ceremony but may serve to arouse a interest in the matter in the early morning of st jerome 's day a black-robed indian make a recitation from the top of the pueblo to the assemble multitude below in the plaza stand a pine tree pole fifty foot in height and from a cross-piece at top dangle a live sheep with leg tie together and back down besides the sheep a garland of such fruit and vegetable as the valley produce together with a basket of bread and grain hang from the pole the bell in the little adobe chapel sound and a few of the indian go in to mass a curious service follow a rubicund mexican priest be the celebrant while two old mexican in modern dress and a pueblo indian in a red blanket be acolyte when the host be elevated a indian at the door beat a villainous drum and four musket shot be discharge after the service be conclude a procession be form and march to the race track which be three hundred yard in length the runner have prepare themselves in the estufa or underground council chamber and soon appear there be fifty of they and all be naked except a breech-clout and be paint no two alike fifty other runner to contest with these arrive from the other pueblo they form in line on either side of the course and a slow graceful dance ensue all at once three hundred mad young mexican rush through the throng on they wild pony the leader swinging by the neck the gallo or cock then the race begin two runner from each side dart down the track cheer by they companion no sooner do they reach the goal than two other start off and thus for two hour until the sum of victory gain by individual entitle one party or the other to claim success the race decide the runner range themselves in two face line and precede by the drum begin a slow zig-zag march excitement now run riot the dancer chant weird song break the rank and vie with each other in they antic and peculiarity a rush be make upon the crowd of spectator through whom the participant in the orgy force they way regardless of consequence the woman who hitherto have take but little part in the excitement now come forward and throw cake and roll of bread from the pueblo terrace everybody rush after these prize in a headlong manner and the confusion become still greater a adjournment be then take for dinner and in the afternoon six gorgeously paint and hideously decorate clown come forward and go through a series of antic calculate to disgust rather than amuse the spectator the unfortunate sheep which be still hang to the pole be finally throw to the ground after several attempt have be make to climb the pole the fruit and product be seize by the clown who rush off with they and every one connect with the tribe seem to be highly satisfy with the outcome of the day 's proceedings and the culmination of the spectacle chapter xi how custer live and die remember custer -- a eye witness of the massacre -- custer cody and alexi -- a ride over the scene of the unequal conflict -- major reno 's marked failure -- how sit bull run away and live to fight another day -- why a medicine man do not summon rain remember custer be the watchword and battle-cry of the small army of american soldier who early in the present decade advance against hostile indian in the northwest who after indulge for week in a series of fantastic dance and superstitious rite be finally call to time by the government and punish for they disregard of treaty rights and reasonable order every american child should know who custer be and why the trooper call upon each other to remember he on the occasion refer to it be less than twenty year since he die he name should be remember by civilian as well as soldier for almost as many century to come there be some man who seem to defy and even court death custer be one of these he be so recklessly brave that he often cause anxiety to he superior officer time and again he lead a handful of man apparently into the jaw of death and bring they out safely after have practically annihilate the foe as the pitcher which be carry safely to the well ninety-nine time sometimes get break at the hundredth attempt so be it with general custer in June 1876 he detachment be outnumber twenty to one at a little ford near crazy horse creek in dakota and he entire command be wipe out a adopted son of sit bull the famous indian state that he see custer die add that he twice witness the hero lie on he back fight he foe the third time he see he a blanket be draw over the hero who be apparently dead on another page be give a admirable illustration of the camp and ford as well as of the monument erect in custer 's memory with typical indian camp scene this picture be from photograph take specially for mr charle s fee general passenger agent of the northern pacific railroad whose track run close by this scene of such sad history a volume could be devote to the life of custer the adventure he encounter and the risk he run in the course of he eventful and useful career he work and he memoirs bristle with information concern the actual truth of border life and indian warfare bereft of romance and exaggeration like almost all indian fighter custer entertain a supreme contempt for the red man generally although he naturally kind disposition lead he to give credit to individual red man for bravery gratitude and other characteristic generally believe to be inconsistent with they character and nationality besides be a gallant fighter custer be also a great lover of recreation and fun while a genuine hunting expedition draw he out from he almost habitual quiet and make he the natural leader of the party among he friend be william cody better know to the amusement loving world as buffalo bill on account of he alleged excessive prowess in the shooting and destruction of buffalo if mr cody be consult he would probably prefer to be call indian bill as he hatred of the average red man be very largely in excess of he anxiety to kill the hump-backed ox which be at one time almost in sole possession of the western prairie on one occasion he and custer have a very delightful time together and cody have give a please description of what take place this be on the occasion of the visit to this country of the grand duke alexi some twenty-three year ago this european celebrity enjoy a tour through the united state and visit most of the grandest feature of we native land before come to the country he have hear of its great hunting facility and also of the sport to be obtain from shooting buffalo on the prairie he mention this fact to the officer of the government who be detail to complete arrangement for he benefit and accordingly it be arrange that the grand duke should be conduct into buffalo land and initiate into the mystery of buffalo hunting by the officer who have since be annihilate by the sioux and the irrepressible hunter who have since develop into a prince among showman these two somewhat rough but very kind chaperone take with they on this trip a party of indian include spotted tail with whose daughter custer carry on we be tell a mild flirtation on the march a great deal of amusement be derive from the trip as well as very much important information it be but four year later that custer be engage on a more serious and less entertaining mission the scene of the tragedy be visit some three year ago by mr l d wheeler to whom we be indebted for the follow very graphic and interesting description of the visit and of the thought it call forth : a rather lengthy ride find we at reno 's cross of the river the ford where he cross to make he attack ford the stream we dismount among the young timber and bush line the stream and eat lunch before lunch be finish two indian girl come down the river the younger tall slender and graceful dress in bright clean scarlet be a picture with she jet black hair hanging in shine plait she piercing eye and handsome face she be the most comely sylph-like indian maiden i have ever see mount we horse lunch over we canter back on the trail that custer and reno follow for a ride of several mile to lookout hill or point which we ascend this be the point where custer and he officer obtain they first view of the valley of the greasy grass as the sioux call the little horn after a survey of the region spur we horse forward we in time find ourselves climb the gentle acclivity which lead up to reno 's old rifle-pit now almost obliterate the most noticeable feature of the spot be the number of blanched bone of horse which lie scatter about a short distance from the pit -- which be rather round and follow the outline of the hill in shape -- and in a slight hollow below they be more bone of horse this be where the wound be take and the hospital establish and the horse keep from the wavy summit line of the bluff the ground slope in a irregular broken way back to the northeast and east into a coulee that form the passage to the ford which custer aim for and never reach the ground about the battle-field be now a national cemetery it be enclose by a wire fence and there be several hundred acre of it it might be care for in a manner somewhat better than it be during one of my visit there a crow indian ride up to the gate and deliberately turn he herd of horse into the inclosure to graze as i ride into the grounds after ford and recross the river where custer fail the first object to greet my sight be a small inclosure with large mound and headstone which mark the spot where lieutenant crittenden fall at one corner and outside of it stand the regulation marble slab which mark the place where each body on the field be find this one state that there lieutenant calhoun be kill at number of place down the western slope but near the ravine the surface be dot with the little gravestone in some place far down the descent and far from where custer van reilly tom custer and other fall they be see singly in other spot three or four or half a dozen at one point there be over thirty well mass together down in this part of the field in the ravine run towards the monument be the stone mark where dr lord 's body be find and with it be four other in the shallow coulee east of the ridge and almost at the bottom of the slope some distance northwest of where calhoun and crittenden be kill and on the main ridge slope of it be a large group of stone here be where captain mile keogh and thirty-eight man give up they life on this side of the ridge -- the eastern side -- between where keogh and he man die and where custer fall there be numerous stone on the opposite side of the custer ridge -- that which face the river -- and close to its crest there be very few stone and those be much scatter and not in group at the northern extremity of the ridge be a slight elevation which overtop everything else and slope away in all direction save where the ridge lie just below this knoll or hillock -- custer hill -- face southwest be where custer and the larger part of he man fall on the right bank of the missourus river -- the big muddy -- in north dakota almost within rifle shot of the town of mandan on the northern pacific railroad there exist in the '70s a military post name after the nation 's great martyr president fort abraham lincoln on the morning of the 17th of June 1876 there go forth from here among other with the pomp and ceremony for which they be distinguish a cavalry regiment famed in the army for dash bravery and endurance -- the note seventh cavalry at the head of the seventh cavalry be a man who be unquestionably the most picturesque character for long year and perhaps for all previous and present time in the army enter the army in active service during the civil war he career be a continual round of success and advance and at its close aside from the peerless sheridan no cavalryman have a greater reputation for magnificent dash than he transfer to the plain -- the war over -- he success as a indian campaigner naturally follow and at the time he move out upon he latest and fate expedition george custer have a reputation as a indian fighter second to none on June 22d custer and the seventh cavalry leave camp on the rosebud in compliance with they instruction on the 23d and 24th many of the camping place of the indian in they migration westward be pass by evening of June 24th the trail and sign have become so hot and fresh that a halt be order to await tiding from the scout they information prove that the indian be across the divide over in the valley of the little horn custer confident of he ability to whip the indian single-handed prepare for fight at once he push ahead on the trail and create the impression that it be he determination to get to the spot and have one battle royal with the indian in which he and the seventh should be the sole participant on we side and in consequence the sole hero the idea of defeat seem never to have occur to he early on the morning of June 25th custer resume he march up to that time the command be maneuver as a whole now however it be divide into four detachment one under major reno consist of three troops of cavalry and the indian scout forty in number hold the advance the second battalion compose also of three troops move off some mile to the left of reno scout the country to the southward a third detachment comprise the pack train which carry the reserve ammunition -- some 24000 round -- be under the command of captain mcdougall and have one troop as a escort the fourth battalion be that under custer himself and be the largest have five troops and it march parallel to reno and within easy support distance to the north the pack train follow the trail in rear of reno and custer reno advance from the ford across the valley in column of fours for some distance then form in line of battle and afterwards deploy the command as skirmisher the bulk of the indian and they camp be hide by a bend of the river and reno instead of charge round the bend and into the indian camp halted and dismount he command to fight on foot at this point two or three of the horse could not be control and carry they rider into the indian camp one account state that they plunge over the river bank injure the man who be afterwards kill by the indian here at ash point or hollow the command soon get sheltered in the timber and be on the defensive the indian now pour in from all side the indian scout with reno have before now be disperse and be make back track fast as they pony could carry they account differ as to how long they remain in this timber but it be probably not to exceed half a hour the charge out -- as reno term it -- be virtually a stampede and many do not know of the departure until too late to start no well-defined and well-understood order have be give to that effect there be no systematic attempt to check the pursuit of the indian who now direct by gall swarm down upon they and prevent they from reach the ford at which they have cross many be kill on this retreat and many other wound among the former be lieutenant donald mcintosh reno head the retreat and they tear pell mell across the valley and at the new ford they be lucky to strike there be great confusion it be every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost and as be usually the case the -lrb- red -rrb- devil get he clutch on more than one cross the stream as best they could lieutenant hodgson be kill after have cross man and horse climb the steep almost inaccessible bluff and ravine upon the top of which they have a chance to take account of stock many have attempt to scale the bluff at other point hard by the indian be up there in some force and by they when almost up the cliff dr dewolf be kill after remain on the bluff at least a hour probably longer a forward movement down stream be make for a mile or mile and a half previous to this heavy firing have be hear down the river in the direction custer have go two distinct volley be hear by the entire command follow by scatter shot and it be suppose custer be carry all before he when reno have reach the limit of this advance north toward custer they see large number of indian horseman scurry over what afterward prove to be custer 's battle-field soon these come tear up toward reno who hastily retreat from what would seem to have be a strong position back to near the point where he have originally reach the bluff here they sheltered themselves on the small hill by the shallow breastwork and place the wound and horse in a depression that night until between 9 and 10 o'clock they be subject to a heavy fire from the indian who entirely surround they the firing again begin at daylight of the 26th and last all day and as the indian have command of some high point near by there be many casualty reno 's total loss as give by godfrey be fifty kill include three officer and fifty-nine wound many of those leave in the river bottom when the retreat begin eventually reach the command again escape under cover of night of custer 's movement opinion of what he do or should have do be many and various the theory first entertain and hold for year but not now tenable nor indeed probably hold by many be that custer reach the ford and attempt to cross be meet by a fire so scorching that he draw back and retreat to the hill in the best form possible and there fight like a animal at bay hope that reno 's attack in the bottom and benton 's timely arrival would yet relieve he the indian however strenuously assert that custer never attempt the ford and never get anywhere near it no dead body be find any nearer than within half a mile of the ford and it seem undoubted that the indian tell the truth when custer ride out on the bluff and look over into the valley of the greasy grass he must have see at once that he have before utterly misapprehend the situation the natural thing to do would have be to retrace he trail join reno by the shortest route and then unite have push the attack in person or if then too late for successful attack he could in all likelihood have extricate the command and make junction with terry indian signal travel rapidly and as soon as reno be check and beat not only be this fact signal through the camp but every warrior tear away down stream to oppose custer join those already there and now at least alert it be probable then that before custer could reach the creek valley the indian have make sufficient demonstration to cause he to swerve from where he would otherwise and naturally strike it and work farther back toward the second line of bluff even perhaps as far back as captain godfrey give the trail the only thing to militate against this would be the element of time which seem hardly to oppose it however he get there custer be at last upon the eminence which be so soon to be consecret with he life 's blood what see he what do he the source of information be necessarily largely indian at the southeastern end of the custer ridge face apparently the draw or coulee of the branch of custer creek calhoun and crittenden be place some little distance back of they in a depression and down the northern slope of the custer ridge keogh stand stretch along the north slope of the ridge from keogh to custer hill be smith 's command and at the culminate point of the ridge or custer hill but on the opposite ridge from where the other be place be tom custer and yate and with they custer himself yate ' and custer 's man evidently face northwest it would appear from the indian ' statement that most of the command be dismount the line be about three-quarter of a mile in length and the attack be make by two strong body of indian one of these come up from the ford name after the hero and victim of the day it be lead by a daring indian with some knowledge of generalship and he follower be of a very superior class to the average red man this body of attacker do great execution and succeed in almost annihilate the white man against whom they be place and whom they outnumber so conspicuously from the meager information concern what take place that be accessible it appear as though the execution of these man be almost equal to that of skilled sharp-shooter a reckless indian name crazy horse be at the head of a number of cheyenne who form the principal part of the second attack body these encounter custer himself and the man immediately under he order outnumber the white man to a overwhelming extent they circle around and be reinforce by the first column which by this time be elate by victory and reckless as to its brutality it commence the work of blot out of existence the gallant cavalryman before they most of custer 's man know the nature of they destroyer too well to think of cry for quarter or make any effort to escape there be a blank space between the ridge on which the battle be fight and the river below some few man run down this spot in hope of ford the river and finding temporary hiding place they prolong they life but for a few minute only for some of the fleetest indian rush after they and kill they as they run the horse upon which captain keogh ride into the battle escape the general slaughter and find its way back once more to civilization of the way it spend its decline year we have already speak with this exception it be more than probable that no living creature which enter the fight with custer come out of it alive a crow scout name curley claim that he be in the fight and that after it be over he disguise himself as a sioux hold he blanket around he head and escape curley 's statement be never receive with much credence the evidence generally point to the fact that prior to the battle nearly all the indian scout who be with custer on the march run away when they see the overpowering nature of the foe sit bull who have since meet the fate many believe he deserve also claim to be in the fight on the other side he story of the prowess of custer and of he death be probably concoct with a view to currying favor with white man as it appear evident that sit bull show he usual cowardice and run away before there be a battle within twenty-four hour ' distance major jame mclaughlin during he experience as indian agent at stand rock agency north dakota have a opportunity of gather a great deal of important information with reference to the battle-field and incident connect with it at the request of mr wheeler whose research into the legend and history of interesting spot within easy access by means of the northern pacific railroad be most successful obtain from the major the follow valuable information concern many point of detail which have be the subject of debate and dispute : it be difficult say this undoubted authority to arrive at even approximately the number of indian who be encamp in the valley of the little big horn when custer 's command reach there on June 25th 1876 the indifference of the indian as to ascertain they strength by actual count and they idea at that time be too crude to know themselves i have be station at this agency since the surrender hostile be bring here in the summer of 1881 and have converse frequently with many of the indian who be engage in that fight and more particularly with ` gall ' ` crow king ' ` big road ' ` hump ' ` sit bull ' ` gray eagle ' ` spotted horn bull ' and other prominent man of the sioux regard the custer affair when question as to the number of indian engage the answer have invariably be ` none of we know nina wicotus ' which mean ` very many lodge ' from this source of information which be the best obtainable i place the number of male adult then in the camp at 3000 and that on June 25th 1876 the fighting strength of the indian be between 2500 and 3000 and more probably approximate the latter number ` sit bull ' be a recognize medicine man and of great repute among the sioux not so much for he power of healing and cure the sick -- which after he have regain such renown be beneath he dignity -- as for he prophecy and no matter how absurd he prophecy might be he find ready believer and willing follower and when he prophecy fail to come to pass he always succeed in satisfy he over-credulous follower by give some absurd reason for instance i be in he camp on grande river in the spring of 1888 sometime about the end of June there have be no rain for some week and crop be suffer from drouth and i remark to he who be in a assemblage of a large number of indian of that district that the crop needed rain badly and that if much longer without rain the crop would amount to nothing he ` sit bull ' reply : ` yes the crop need rain and my people have be importune I to have it rain i be consider the matter as to whether i will or not i can make it rain any time i wish but i fear hail i can not control hail and should i make it rain heavy hail might follow which would ruin the prairie grass as well as the crop and we horse and we cattle would thus be deprive of subsistence ' he make this statement with as much apparent candor as it be possible for a man to give expression to and there be not a indian among he hearer but appear to accept it as within he power ` sit bull ' be dull in intellect and not near as able a man as ` gall ' ` hump ' ` crow ' and many other who be regard as subordinate to he but he be a adept schemer and very cunning and could work upon the credulity of the indian to a wonderful degree and this together with great obstinacy and tenacity gain for he he world-wide reputation ` sit bull ' claim in he statement to I that he direct and lead in the custer fight but all the other indian with whom i have talk contradict it and say that ` sit bull ' flee with he family as soon as the village be attack by major reno 's command and that he be make he way to a place of safety several mile out in the hill when overtake by some of he friend with news of victory over the soldier whereupon he return and in he usual style take all the credit of victory to himself as have plan for the outcome and as have be on a bluff overlook the battlefield appease the evil spirit and invoke the great spirit for the result of the fight and when consider the ignorance and inherent superstition of the average sioux indian at that time it be not to be wonder at that the majority if not all be willing to accept it especially when unite in common cause and what they consider as they only safety from annihilation as a matter of fact there be no one man who lead or direct that fight it be a pell mell rush under a number of recognize warrior as leader with ` gall ' of the hunkpapa and ` crazy horse ' of the cheyenne the more prominent the indian with whom i have talk deny have mutilate any of the kill but admit that many dead body be mutilate by woman of the camp they also claim that the fight with custer be of short duration they have no knowledge as to hour and minute but have explain by the distance that could be walk while the fight last they vary from twenty minute to three-quarter of a hour none place it longer than forty-five minute this do not include the fight with reno before he retreat but from the time that custer 's command advance and the fight with he command commence the opinion of the indian regard reno 's first attack and short stand be that it be he retreat that give they the victory over custer 's command the helter skelter retreat of reno 's man enthuse the indian to such a extent that flush with excitement and this early success they be reckless in they charge upon custer 's command and with the slight number of indian thus fully enthuse that small command be but a slight check to they sweeping impetuosity the indian also state that the separated detachment make they victory over the troops more certain thus custer fall the mystery surround he death will probably never be solve in a satisfactory manner owe to the impossibility of place any reliance on statement make by the indian the way in which the command be annihilate and the soldier ' body mutilate should go a long way towards disprove many of the theory now in existence concern the alleged ill treatment of indian and they natural peacefulness and good disposition custer have so frequently befriend the very man who surround he command and annihilate it that the baseness of they ingratitude should be apparent even to those who be incline to sympathize with the red man and to denounce the alleged severity with which they have be treat traveler through the dakota region find few spot of more melancholy though marked interest than the one illustrate in connection with this chapter chapter xii among the creole meaning of the word creole -- a old aristocratic relic -- the venice of america -- origin of the creole carnival -- rex and he annual disguise -- creole ball -- the st loui veil prophet -- the french market and other landmark in new orlean -- a beautiful ceremony and a unfinished monument new orlean be know throughout the world for the splendor of its carnival as one of the great creole city of the world it have for more than half a century make merry once a year and give quite a business aspect to carnival festivity the creole be one of the interesting character to be meet with in a tour through the united state as a rule he or she be joyous in the extreme and believe most heartily in the wisdom of the command to laugh and grow fat the genuine creole scarcely know what it be to be sad for more than a few hour at a time a very little pleasure more than offset a very great deal of trouble and suffer a desire to move around and to enjoy change of scene be a special feature of the creole and hence the spectacular effect of the carnival procession appeal most eloquently to he many eastern and northern people confound the term creole and mulatto believe that the former name be give to the offspring of mixed marriage which take place in spite of the vigilance of the law of most of the southern state this be entirely a mistake for the genuine creole instead of be a object of contempt and pity be rather a aristocrat and of a higher caste than the average white man strictly speak the term imply birth in this country but foreign parentage or ancestry it be originally apply to the child of french and spanish settler in louisiana and in that application apply only to quite a handful of people as time have worn on and french emigration have cease and the spaniard have be gradually push south the number of actual creole have of course diminish rapidly the name however by common consent have be perpetuate and be retain by descendant in the third and fourth generation of original creole some of the creole of to-day be very wealthy and many of the other be comparatively poor change in mode and condition of life have affect they very much although the very name creole suggest spanish origin there be more french blood among the creole of to-day than that of any other nation the vivacious habit and general love of change so common among french people continue in they descendant the old plan of send the child over to france to be educate have be largely abandon in these later day but the influence of parisian life still have they effect on the race this be largely the reason why it be that new orlean have be often speak of as the american venice to that beautiful european city with its gondola and picturesque costume belong the honor of have originate high-class comedy to new orlean must be give the credit of planting or at any rate perpetuate the idea in a tangible shape in this country and of have for fully two generation keep up the annual celebration almost without a break masquerade come across the atlantic from venice by way of france where the idea take strong hold when emigration from france to the old territory of louisiana become general the idea come with it and the practice of send child to pari to be educate result in the latest idea of aristocratic festivity be bring over to the home which have since sheltered they history tell we that on new year 's eve of 1831 a number of pleasure-seeking man spend the entire night in a creole restaurant at mobile arrange for the first mystic order in that city and from this begin the long line of creole comedy spring up in 1857 the mystic krewe of comus make its first appearance upon the street of new orlean paradise lose be the subject select for illustration year after year the revelry be repeat on shrove Tuesday but the outbreak of the war naturally put a stop to the annual rejoice southern enthusiasm be however hard to down and directly the war be over comus reappear in all he glory a few year later the knight of momus be create and in 1876 the krewe of proteus have its first carnival many other order have follow but these be the more magnificent and important it be difficult to convey a adequate idea of the feeling which prevail in regard to these comedy the mystery which surround the order be extraordinary and the secret have be well keep a fact which cynic attribute to the exclusion of lady from the secret circle it be well know that on many occasion man have pretend to leave the city on the eve of the comedy and to have return to they home a day or two later not even they own family know that they take a leading part in the procession the carnival king issue royal edict prior to they arrival command all business to cease on the occasion of the rejoicing the command be obey literally bank court of justice and business house generally suspend operation and old and young alike turn out to do homage to the monarch of the day let we imagine for a moment we be privileged to see a creole carnival every inch of available space have be take up every balcony overlook the royal route be crowd with pleasure party include richly dress lady all the flower and beauty of the sunny south be represent the course be illuminate in the most attractive manner and every one be wait anxiously for the procession band of music playing sprightly tune finally reward the patience of the watcher then come herald bodyguard and marshal all gorgeously array for the occasion they horse like themselves be richly adorn for the occasion and the banner and flag be conspicuous for the artistic blending of color then ride in state come the lord high chamberlain bear the golden key of the city deliver over to he in state twenty-four hour previously by the mayor next come the hero of the parade the king himself all eye be rivet upon he thoroughly disguise himself he be able to recognize on the balcony and among the crowd he personal friend and most devoted admirer to these he bow with great solemnity mystify to a degree and often dispute among themselves as to the probable identity of the monarch the richly dress young lady and they cavalier bow in return and look as though they would fain hold the monarch among they much longer than the necessity of keep order make it possible follow the king be the bodyguard and crowd of holiday maker rex generally make a display now of some special theme appear this year as a crusader another year as the discoverer of america and a third year as some other mystic individual but no matter what the subject of the carnival may be the underlie principle be the same sometimes a great deal of instruction be impart with the mirth-making but in every case the procession be but a signal for general rejoice directly the procession be disband which always take place in military order the entire city give way to fun and mirth of every character liberty abound throughout the city without license by common consent every one be careful to prevent disturbance or trouble all be happy and every one seem to appreciate the fact that the very life of the comedy depend upon its respectability there be nothing vulgar or common about any of the proceedings or about the countless tableau which pass along the private street everything be what have be describe as orderly disorder everything be attractive and easy the ball which be a prominent feature of a creole carnival be a wonderful combination of nineteenth century aristocratic idea and of oriental humor the guest be in full dress and represent the highest element of southern society around the carpeted floor those who have take part in the pageant march in they grotesque costume a apparently blood-thirsty indian brandish a club over he head dart for a second from the line to go through the motion of dash out the brain of perhaps a most intimate friend who have no idea who have thus honor he by a recognition another man who in everyday life be perhaps a sedate banker or a prominent physician be masquerade in some extraordinary attire with a mask of extraordinary dimension and significance he see in the throng a young lady of he acquaintance and proceed to shake hand with she with great effusion so well be the secret keep that she have no idea that the apparently frolicsome youth be a middle-aged man of business and she spend perhaps half the night wonder which of she beau this fearfully and wonderfully disguised man be of the ball which succeed carnival in the city which delight in these temporary divorce from the care of business and finance page might be write one ball only need be mention in any detail this be the ball give by the knight of revelry in connection with and at the expense of the mobile club the entire theater be rearrange in illustration of the theme of the club 's pageant for the year all around the hall be hung tapestry and banner artistically decorate and arrange so as to convey the idea of forest and garden the very door be convert into mimic entrance to cave and parterre and the general effect be entrance as well as sentimental the band be hide from the guest in a most delightfully arrange little swiss chalet and refreshment be serve from miniature garden pavilion the very floor upon which the dancing be to take place be decorate so as to present the appearance of a newly mown lawn the height of realism be attain by means of a imitation moat over the orchestra well across this be a drawbridge which be raise and drop at fitting interval and the drop curtain be make to represent a massive castle door there be a banquet chamber with faultless reproduction of mediaeval grandeur and wonder stain glass window represent well-known and attractive lady and there be other marvelous and costly innovation which seem practically impossible within a theater at this ball as at all other the revelry proceed until midnight just as cinderellum leave the ball when the clock strike 12 so do the holder of the creole revel stop dance immediately that lend have commence the next day all be over man who the night before be the leader in the masquerade resume they commonplace existence and be see at the ordinary seat of custom buying and selling and conduct themselves like eastern rather than southern man the carnival idea have not be confine to strictly southern city st loui have for many year in succession enjoy the pageant and ball of its veil prophet a organization as secret and mysterious as any to be find in a creole section instead of be a mardi gra celebration the st loui pageant be give during the indian summer day of the first week of October the parade take place after night-fall and consist of very costly pageant and display it be no exaggeration to say that hundred of thousand of dollar have be spend in illuminate the street through which the procession have pass the money for this purpose be freely subscribe by business man and private citizen but in st loui as in new orlean no one know who find the money to pay for the preparation of the pageant the rich and vary costume the exquisite invitation and souvenir and the gorgeous ball reader of the pickwick papers will remember that when certain member of the club propose to make a tour of the country with a view to note matter of special interest it be unanimously resolve not to limit the scope of the investigation and to extend to the investigator the privilege of pay they own expense very much the same rule prevail in regard to the creole carnival and ball and the adaptation of the idea in other city the utmost secrecy be preserved and it be consider bad form in the extreme to even hint at belong to any of the secret order the member subscribe all expense themselves without a moment 's hesitation and there have never be such a thing see as a list of the amount donate there be not lack people who say that these celebration be childish and beneath the dignity of a business community the answer to criticism of this kind be that no one be ask to contribute to the expense of the revelry or be even ask or allow to purchase a ticket of admission to the ball any criticism be very much like look a gift horse in the mouth if it be agree that life be make up of something more than one stern continuous race for wealth then it must be concede that these carnival occupy a most important part in the routine of life the absolute unselfishness of the entire work commend it to the approval of the most indifferent those who raise the expense have to work so hard during the parade and ball that they get comparatively little pleasure from they while they be also prevent by the absolute secrecy which prevail from secure so much as a word of thanks or congratulation from the outside public in this material age there be a danger of celebration of this kind wear themselves out when they do so the world will be the poorer in consequence new orlean to which we have refer as the great home of the creole carnival be a city know the world over by reputation it be situate at the very mouth of the great mississippus river and its history date back to the year 1542 when a gallant band of adventurer float down the river into the gulf of mexico in 1682 la salle sail down the river and take possession of the country on both side of it in the name of france in the closing day of the seventeenth century a french expedition land not far from new orlean which be found in 1718 with a population of sixty-eight soul three year later the city which now contain a population of more than a quarter of a million be make the capital of the territory of louisiana and it at once become a place of considerable importance in 1764 it be cede to spain and this result in the people take possession of new orlean and resist the change in government five year later the new spanish governor arrive with ample troops suppress the rebellion and execute its leader from the place d'arme in 1804 the territory of orlean be establish and in 1814 a british army 15000 strong advance on the city after which the territory be name a great deal of confusion follow but the city hold its own and the invade army be repulse during the civil war new orlean again see active campaigning the occupancy of the city by general butler and the stern measure he adopt to suppress the loyalty even of the woman of the town have form the subject of much comment there be many interesting story concern this epoch in the city 's history which be tell with many variation to every one who sojourn for a while in the great port at the gate of the greatest river in the world to-day new orlean be perhaps best know as the second largest cotton mart in the world some 2000000 bale of the product of the southern plantation be receive and ship out every year more than 30000000 pound of wool and 12000000 pound of hide also pass through the city every year to say nothing of immense quantity of banana and costly transaction in sugar and lumber although new orlean be really some little distance from the ocean the river at this point be more than half a mile wide and the great ship of all nation be see load and unload at its levee new orlean naturally abound in ancient landmark and memorial the old spanish fort be one of the most interesting among these warfare of the most bitter character be see again and again at this place the fortification be keep up largely to afford protection against raid from mexican pirate and hostile indian though they be often useful against more civilized foe it be at this port that andrew jackson prepare to receive the british invader the magnificent use he make of the fortification should have give to the old place a lasting standing and a permanent preservation some forty year ago however the fort be purchase and turn into a kind of country resort and more lately it have become the home of a recreation club better preserved and a most interesting connect link between the past and the present be the world-renowned french market in new orlean a story be tell of a great novelist who travel several thousand mile in order to find representative of all nationality group together in one narrow space for a work he have in contemplation he be anxious to select for he character man of all nationality whom chance or destiny have throw together he spend several day in pari journey throughout sunny italy get lose in some of the labyrinth of the unexplored section of london and finally cross the atlantic without have find the group of which he be in search not even in the large city of america could he find he heart 's desire and it be not until he stray into the old french market of new orlean that he find that for which he search he spend several day and even week wander through the peculiar market and make friend with the man of all nationality who be work in different part of it he find the creole full of anecdote superstition and pride even when he be earn a occasional meal by help to unload banana or to carry away the refuse from the fish store the negro in every phase of development civilization and ignorance could and always can be find within the confines of the market the amount of folk-lore store up in the brain cover by mass of unkempt wool astounded the novelist who distribute dollar in return for information receive so lavishly that he begin to be look upon after a while as a capitalist whose wealth have drive he insane then again he meet disappointed emigrant from nearly all the european country man and even woman who have cross the atlantic full of great expectation but who have find a good many thorn among the looked-for rose the indian be not often see now around the french market although he use to be quite a feature of it some of the most exceptionally idle lounger however show evidence of indian blood in they vein in the shape of exceptionally high cheek-bone and abnormally straight and ungovernable hair almost every known language be speak here there be the purest french and the most atrocious patois there be polish english which seem to indicate high education and there be the most picturesque dialect variation that could be desire by the most ardent devotee of the everlasting dialect story spanish be of course speak by several of the market trader and worker while italian be quite common at time in the day when trade be very busy the visitor may hear choice expletive in three or four language at one time he may not be able to interpret the peculiar noise and stern rebuke administer to idle help and truant boy but he can generally guess pretty accurately the scope and object of the little speech which be scatter around so freely if it be ask what special function the market fulfil the answer be that it be a kind of inquire-within for everything many of the poorer people do all they trading here fruit be a great staple and on another page a picture be give of one of the fruit stand of the old market the picture be reproduce from a photograph take on the spot by a artist of the national company of st loui publisher of we own country and it show well the peculiar construction of the market the fruit section be probably the most attractive and the least objectionable of the entire market because here cleanliness be indispensable in the vegetable section which be also very large there be not always quite so much care display or so much cleanliness enforce refuse be sometimes allow to accumulate liberally fish can be obtain in this market for a almost nominal consideration be sometimes almost give away macaroni and other similar article of diet form the staple feature of the italian store of trade which be carry on on the second floor of the market the legitimate work call for alone provide excuse for the presence of many thousand people who run hither and thither at certain hour of the day as though time be the essence of the contract and no delay of any kind could be tolerate as soon however as the press need of the moment be satisfy a period of luxurious idleness follow and rest seem to be the chief desideratum of the average habitue or employe the child who be sit around in large number vie with they elder in matter of idleness though they be occasionally arouse to a condition of pernicious activity by the hope of secure donation or compensation of some kind from newcomer and guest structurally the french market be very well preserve there be evidence of antiquity and of the ravages of time and weather on every side but for all that the market seem to have as its special mission the remind of the people that when we ancestor build they build for age and not entirely for the immediate present as be too often the case nowadays the market also serve as a link between the present and the past it be only of late year that the bazaar which use to be so prominent a feature have fall into insignificance formerly it retain the importance of the extreme orient and afford infinite fund for reflection for the antiquarian and the lover of history the cemetery of new orlean be of exceptional interest and be visit every year by thousand of people owe to the proximity of the water mark to the surface of the ground the dead be not bury as in other city and the vault be above instead of under ground they be well arrange and the antiquity of the burial grounds and the historic memory connect with the tablet combine to make they of more than ordinary interest the local custom of suspend business on the first day of November of each year for the purpose of decorate grave in all the cemetery be also worthy of more than a pass notice not only do people decorate the last rest place of they friend and relative on this specially select day but even the grave of stranger be care for in a spirit of thankfulness that the angel of death have not enter the family circle and make inroad into bond of friendship a few year ago a young woman die on the car just as they be enter the world-renowned creole city there be nothing on the body to aid identification and a stranger 's grave have to be provide in the meantime the friend and relative of the miss girl have be make every effort to locate she no idea have occur to they that she be go south a loving brother finally get hold of a clew which he follow up so successfully that he at last solve the mystery he arrive in new orlean on November 1st and when take out to the grave that have be provide for the stranger who have die just outside the gate he be astounded to find several handsome bouquet of flower with wreath and cross lie upon it such a sight could hardly have be meet with in any other city in the world and too much can hardly be say in praise of the sentiment which suggest and encourage such disinterested kindness and think the cemetery which occupy a site close to the great battle-field be always specially decorate and crowd go out in thousand to pay tribute to honor memory close to this spot there be a monument to celebrate the great battle during which general pakingham be shoot and at which general jackson gallop excitedly up and down the line and almost force the man on to victory the monument have not receive the care which it deserve more than half a century ago work be commence on it and a great deal be accomplish but after a year or two of effort the project be abandon for the time and it have never be renew in the long interval that have ensue the roof have in a large measure disappear as well as several of the step lead up to the front hundred of people have cut they name in the stone work and the monument which ought to be preserve in perpetuity look so disreputable that little regret would be cause be the entire fragment to be sweep away by some unusually heavy gust of wind more than 1500 soldier be bury in the chalmette cemetery after the battle refer to since the war it have be well nigh forget but several duel and affaire d'honneur have be settle on the historic spot chapter xiii the heathen chinee in he element a trip to chinatown san francisco -- a house with a history -- narrow alley and secret door -- opium smoking and its effect -- the highbinder -- celestial theatricals -- chinese festival -- the brighter side of a great city -- a mammoth hotel and beautiful park chinatown san francisco be such a remarkable place and contrast so strangely with the wealth and civilization of the great city on the pacific coast of which it be a part that its peculiarity can not be ignore in a sketch of the most remarkable feature of we native land writer and artist have for year make this blot on san francisco 's splendor the subject for sarcasm and cartoon and indeed it be difficult to handle the subject without a considerable amount of severity californian be often blame for they harshness towards the chinese and the way in which they have clamor from time to time for more stringent exclusion law it take a trip to chinatown to make it clear to the average mortal why this feeling be so general in san francisco and why it extend throughout the entire pacific slope there be about 25000 chinese in and around san francisco a small proportion of these have abandon the worst feature of they race and make themselves comparatively useful as domestic servant in order to retain they position they have to assimilate themselves more or less to the manners and custom of the country and they be only objectionable in certain respects but the one-time dweller in the celestial empire who make they home in chinatown have very few redeeming quality and most of they seem to have no tangible excuse whatever for live they adhere to all the vice and uncivilized habit of they forefather and very frequently add to they equally objectionable vice of so-called civilization at one time all the street in chinatown be little more than elongate ash pit and garbage receptacle the public outcry at length become so vigorous that the strong hand of the law be bring to bear and now the principal through street be keep fairly clean the side street and alley be however still in a deplorable condition and no american or european could possibly live many day in such filth without be stricken with a terrible disease the mongolian however seem to thrive under condition which be fatal to civilized humanity they live to quite the average age and the child seem to be very healthy if not conspicuously happy chinatown cover a area of about eight large square in the very heart of san francisco again and again attempt have be make to get rid of the drawback and nuisance but the melica man have allow himself to be outwit by the heathen chinee who have secure property rights which can not be overcome without a measure of confiscation which would appear to be scarcely constitutional the area be probably one of the most densely populate in the world the chinese seem to sleep everywhere and anywhere and the house be overcrowded to a extent which pass all belief it be know as a actual fact that in room twelve foot square as many as twelve human being sleep and eat and even cook what pass with they for food the house themselves be so horrible in they condition and have be so remodel from time to time to meet celestial idea and fall in with notion which be but a relic of barbarism that not even a color man of the most degraded type can be persuade to live permanently in a house which have ever be occupy by a unregenerated denizen of chinatown at the entrance to this peculiar and indeed disreputable quarter there be a house with a peculiar history it be build more than a quarter of a century ago by a wealthy banker who select the site because of the admirable view that could be obtain from it of the lead feature of the city he spare no expense in its erection and when it be complete he be able to gaze from the upper window upon some of the most beautiful scenery in the world for a while the banker live in the most magnificent style and earn for himself a reputation as a prince of entertainer he spend thousand of dollar on entertainment and appear to have everything that a human being could desire he end be a tragic one and it have never be ascertain for certain whether he die by he own hand or by the hand of one of he alleged friend or avowed foe the house which be once he great pride be now occupy by the chinese consul it be still by far the finest house in the chinese quarter the moment it be pass the sight-seeker or slummer find himself in the midst of a horrible collection of oriental filth and squalor there be a number of store which excite he contempt the moment he eye light upon they they be chiefly devote to the retailing of such food as the occupant of chinatown delight in and over many of they the chinese national emblem can be see fly fish be on sale in large number and as they be keep until sell regardless of they condition the effluvium of some of the fish market can be very easily imagine vegetable also form a very large proportion of the daily bill of fare and these add materially to the malodorous condition of the neighborhood the street be all of they very narrow and there be also a number of exceptionally narrow and complicated passage and alley which have be the scene of crime innumerable in day go by some of these alley be but three or four foot wide and owe to they almost countless turn and angle they afford a easy means for the escape of a fugitive who be be hunt by the police or by one of those blood-thirsty chinese society of which the highbinder be a type one writer who have investigate the matter very thoroughly tell we that most of the house have secret door lead from one to the other in such a manner that if a fugitive should determine to make he escape he can always do so by means of these secret door and the underground passage to which they lead the store workshop and other apartment be generally exceedingly small and the proverbial economy of the chinaman be prove by the fact that every square foot of floor space and ground be put to some practical use and one find cobbler barber fortune-teller and a multitude of small tradesman carry on a business in a jog or niche in the wall not as large as a ordinary bootblack 's stand along the narrow sidewalk be see many of these curbstone merchant some have they goods display in glass show-case range along the wall where be exhibit queer-looking fancy article of chinese workmanship of a cheap grade all sort of inexpensive ornament for woman and child 's wear curiously fashion from ivory bone bead glass and brass water and opium pipe galore the opium pipe be something so unlike any european conception of a pipe that it be difficult to describe it it consist of a large bamboo tube or cylinder with a bowl about midway between the extremity the bowl be sometimes a very small brass plate and sometimes a earthen cup-shaped contrivance with the top close or deck over have only a tiny hole in the center into this little aperture the opium in a semi-liquid state after be well melt in a lamp flame be thrust by means of a fine wire or needle the drug be insert in infinitesimal quantity it be say that all the chinese smoke opium although all do not indulge to excess some seem to be able to use the drug without its gain the mastery over they there be more than a hundred opium den in the chinese quarter these place be use for no other purpose whatever at any time if it be the chinese alone who frequent they but little would be think of it hundred of white people man woman and the youth of both sex have however become victim to this loathsome habit so completely enslave be they that there be no escape from the tyrant for all the poverty and untold misery this have bring upon these unfortunate the chinese be responsible vice cluster around chinese social life and nearly every house have its opium-smoking apartment or room where the lottery or some kind of gambling be carry on the resident of chinatown have a government of they own with its social and economic regulation and its police and penal department and they even inflict the death penalty but in such a secret way that the outside world seldom hear of these act of high authority this social and commercial policy be control by six company to one of which every chinaman in the country owe allegiance and be tributary these company severally represent different province in the chinese empire and upon every arrival of a steamer from that country and before the passenger be land the chinese portion of they be visit by a official of the six company who ascertain what province each arrive coolie be from that decide as to which company he will belong every chinaman who come be assure of he return to china or if he be so unfortunate as to die while in exile that he bone will be send home this very important matter be one of the duty of the six company this comforting assurance however be not share in by the woman whom except those who be the wife of man of the better class be bring over by a vile class of trader and sell as chattel or slave have no relation to the six company there be in the chinese quarter a ghastly underground place where the bone of the depart be convey after they have remain a certain time in the ground here they be scrape clean and pack preparatory to they last journey back to the fatherland and they final rest place among the chinese resident of san francisco there be comparatively few of those of the higher class the difference between they and the mass be very pronounced and they appreciate the difference to the fullest extent they be educate well-bred gentleman the coolie and lower class be a ignorant repulsive and ill-mannered people they seem to be mere brute and not a gleam of intelligence be apparent in they dull expressionless face the highbinder be bind together by solemn obligation and be the instrument use by other chinaman to avenge they real or fancied wrong the highbinder be organize into lodge or tong which be engage in constant feud with each other they wage open warfare and so deadly be they mutual hatred that the war cease only when the last individual who have come under the ban of a rival tong have be sacrifice these feud resemble the vendetta in some of the southern state of europe and they defy all effort of the police to suppress they murder be consequently frequent but it be next to impossible to identify the murderer and if a chinaman be arrest on suspicion or even almost positive evidence of guilt the trial uniformly end in a failure to convict the theater be to the visitor probably the most interesting feature of the chinese quarter a few year ago there be several of these playhouse but the number be now reduce to two the charge of admission be 25 cent or 50 cent the white people who out of curiosity attend a performance generally pay more and be give more comfortable seat upon the stage the stage be a primitive affair it boast of no curtain footlights or scenery of any kind when during the progress of a play a man be kill he lie upon the stage until the scene be end and then get up and walk off sometimes a attendant will bring in and place under he head a small wooden pillow so that the dead man may rest more comfortably after a actor have be behead he have be know to pickup the false head and apostrophize it while make he exit from the stage the orchestra be at the back of the stage it usually consist of one or two ear-splitting flageolet and a system of gong and tom-tom which keep up a infernal din during the entire performance chinese play be usually historical and vary in length from a few hour to several month the costume be gorgeous after the chinese idea of splendor no female be allow on the stage at all young man with falsetto voice invariably impersonate the woman the restaurant of chinatown be a very unsatisfactory feature of the unsavory quarter many of the laborer board at they and the smaller one be nothing in the world but miserable little chop-house badly ventilate and exceedingly objectionable and indeed injurious to health and good moral there be larger restaurant which be more expensively equip shakespeare 's advice as to neatness without gaudiness be not follow there be always a profusion of color in decoration but there be never anything like symmetry or beauty there be a immense number of joss-house in chinatown each company have one of its own other belong to the society tong and to private party the appointment of these temple be gorgeous in they way one have recently be open on waverly place which far surpass all the other in the grandeur of its sacred equipment and decoration the idol bronze carving bell banner and the paraphernalia of the temple be say to have cost about $ 20000 and represent the highest degree of chinese art in front of the throne in each of these temple where the principal god be seat burn a sacred flame that be never extinguish in a cabinet at the right of the entrance be a small image call the doorkeeper who see that no harm befall the temple of those who enter the temple door be always open and those who be religiously incline can come in at any hour of the day prayer be write or print on red or blue paper these be light and deposit in a sort of furnace with a opening near the top and as the smoke ascend the bell near by be sound to attract the attention of the god the woman have a favorite method of tell they fortune they kneel before the altar holding in either hand a small wooden block about-five inch long which resemble a split banana these they raise to they closed eye bow the head and drop if they fall in a certain position it be a indication that the wish or prayer will be grant if they fall in a unfavorable position they continue the effort until the block fall as desire when business be dull and time hard with the chinaman they attribute it to the displeasure of they god they try to propitiate the offended deity by burn incense stick and offer fruit and other thing which have no christian equivalent and which be suppose to be grateful to the divine palate the chinese observe a great many holiday the most important be those of the new year this be a movable feast and occur between the 21st of January and the 19th of February the new year must fall on the first new moon after the sun have enter aquarius it be customary at this time to have all business straighten out and all debt contract during the year pay unless this be do they will have no credit during the year and consequently a great effort be make to pay they creditor there be some however who have be unfortunate and have lay by nothing for this day of settlement and know well that there be a number of those troublesome little bill that be liable to be present at any time they keep themselves out of sight until the sun have rise upon the new year they then reappear in they accustomed haunt feel safe for a few day at least for while the merry-making be go on there be no danger of be confront with a dun all gloomy subject be taboo and everybody devote himself to get all the enjoyment he possibly can out of this festal day to some this be the only holiday in the whole year and they be oblige to return to they labor the following day other will celebrate three or four day and so on up the scale the rich and the independent keep it up for fully two week and begin to settle down to everyday life about the sixteenth day the night precede new year 's day be spend in religious ceremony at the temple or at home out of door the air be fill with the smoke and roar of explode firecracker but when the clock have toll the death of the old and announce the birth of the new year one would think that pandemonium be let loose unless one have hear it no idea can be form as to what this unearthly noise really be we be tell it be to frighten away evil spirit to invoke the favor of the god to bid as they fondly hope a final farewell to ill-luck and again simply because they be happy and when in this frame of mind they love to manifest they joy in noisy demonstration a certain time in the early morning be spend in worship at the shrine at home and in the temple they place before they sacred image offering of tea wine rice fruit and flower the chinese lily be in full bloom at this season and it occupy a conspicuous place in the joss-house it be for sale on every street corner the day be spend in feasting pleasure seek and in make new year 's call the chinaman be always greatly pleased to receive call from white man with whom they have business dealings and they exhibit they card with much pride they be very punctilious and even rival the frenchman in politeness and it be consider a offense if any of they proffer hospitality be decline but while chinatown be the most extraordinary feature of san francisco and be visit by tourist who naturally look upon it somewhat in the light of forbid and hence exceptionally attractive fruit it be not by any mean the most interesting or most important feature of one of the finest city in the world san francisco be the metropolis of the pacific slope it occupy the point of a long peninsula between the bay and the ocean and so unique be its site that it include some magnificent hill and peak the history of san francisco bristle with border and gold mine story and tale of the early trouble of pioneer whole page could be write concern the adventure of the early day of this remarkable city the time be when a few frame building constitute the entire town the rush of speculator follow discovery after discovery of gold convert the quiet little port into a scene of turmoil and disturbance every ship bring with it a cargo of more or less desperate man who have come from various point of the compass determine to obtain a lion 's share of the gold which they have be tell could be have for the take the value of commodity go up like sky-rocket the man who have a few spare mule and wagon on hand be able to realize ten time the price that be tender for they before the boom many man who be thus situate do not consider it advisable to throw away they chance by accept grave risk in search of gold and many who stay at home and supply the want of those who go up country realize handsome competence and in some case small fortune that there be a good deal of lawlessness and violence be not to be wonder at it have be say that for every bona fide miner there be at least one hanger-on or camp follower who have no intention of do any digging or wash but who be smart enough to realize that a veritable thief 's paradise would be build up by the hard worker sometimes these man go to the trouble of digging tunnel under the ground and into the tent of successful miner frequently pass through rich deposit of gold on the way at other time they waylay wagon and coach come into san francisco from the mining camp history tell we of the fight which ensue and we have all hear of the successful miner who be murder while asleep at half-way house and the result of they hard toil turn to base use and vicious purpose in san francisco itself robbery and violence could not be suppress we have all hear of the way in which the decent element finally get together form special law and execute offender in short order no one of course approve lynch law in the abstract but when the circumstance of the case be take into consideration it be difficult to condemn very severely the man who make it possible for san francisco to become a great and honor city the population of san francisco to-day be about a third of a million a greater portion of its growth have be during the last quarter of a century and it be the first city in this country to lay cable conduit and adopt a system of cable car for several year it have practically a monopoly in this mode of street transportation and although electricity have since provide a even more convenient motive power san francisco will always be entitle to credit for the admirable missionary work it do in this direction at the present time almost every portion of the city and its beautiful park can be reach easily by a system of transportation as comfortable and rapid as it be inexpensive among the wonder of san francisco must be mention the palace hotel a structure of immense magnitude and probably two or three time as large as the average eastern man imagine the site of the hotel cover a space of more than a acre and a half and several million dollar be spend on this structure everything be magnificent expansive huge and massive the building itself be seven story high and in its center form what may be describe as the grandest enclosed court in the world be a circular space 144 foot across and roof in with glass at a great height carriage be drive into this enclosure and in the nearest approach to severe weather know in san francisco guest can alight practically indoors there be nearly 800 bed-room all of they large and lofty and the general style of architecture be more than massive the foundation wall be 12 foot thick and 31000000 brick be use above they the skeleton of work iron band upon which the brick and stone work be construct weigh more than 3000 ton four artesian well supply pure water to the house which be not only one of the largest hotel in the world but also one of the most complete and independent in its arrangement a pleasant ride of nearly four mile in length bring the rider to golden gate park the golden gate from which the park take its name be one of the world 's beauty spot and here some of the most exquisite sunset ever witness can be see the gate be the entrance from the pacific ocean to san francisco bay which vary in width from ten to fifteen mile at the gate the width be suddenly reduce to less than a mile and hence at ebb and flow the current be very swift near the gate sea lion can be see gambol in the surf and the wave can be observe striking on the rock and boulder and send up spray of foamy whiteness to a height of a hundred foot golden gate park be like everything else on the pacific coast immense and wonderful it be not the largest park in the world but it rank amongst the most extensive its acreage exceed a thousand and it be difficult to appreciate the fact that the richly cultivate ground through which the tourist be drive have be reclaim from the ocean and be but once little more than a succession of sand bar and dune when the reader go to san francisco as we hope he will go some day if he have not already visit it he will be tell within a few minute of he enter the city that he have at least reach what may be fairly term god 's country of the glorious climate of californium he will hear much at every step and before he have be in the city many day he will wonder how he be to get out of it alive if he be to see but a fraction of the wonderful sight to which he attention be call californium be frequently speak of as the golden state the name californium be give to the territory comprise the state and lower californium as long ago as 1510 when a spanish novelist either in fancy or prophecy write concern the great land of californium where a abundance of gold and precious stone be find in 1848 californium proper be cede to the united state and in the same year the discovery of gold at colomo put a stop to the peace and quiet which have prevail on the fertile plain the unexplored mountain and the attractive valley shortly after a hundred thousand man rush into the state and for the first few year as many as a hundred thousand miner be keep steadily at work it be in 1856 that the famous vigilance committee be form in the month of may of that year murderer be take from jail and execute the result be that the governor declare san francisco to be in a state of insurrection the vigilance committee gain almost sovereign power and before it disband in August it have a parade in which over 5000 armed disciplined man take part two year later the overland mail commence its journey and the celebrated pony express follow in 1860 railroad follow soon after and instead of be a practically unknown country several week ' journey from the old established city the lightning express have bring the pacific so near to the atlantic that time and space seem to have be almost annihilated chapter xiv before emancipation and after first importation of negro slave into america -- the original abolitionist -- a color enthusiast and a coward -- origin of the word secession -- john brown 's fanaticism -- uncle tom 's cabin -- faithful unto death -- george augustus salum on the negro who linger too long in the mill pond the american negro be such a distinct character that he can not be overlook in a work of this nature some people think he be wholly bad and that although he occasionally assume a virtue he be but play a part and play it but indifferently well at that other place he on a lofty pedestal and magnify he into a hero and a martyr but the afro-american commonly call a nigger in the south be neither the one nor the other he be often as worthless as the white trash he so scornfully despise and he be often all that the most exacting could expect when he surroundings and disadvantage be take into consideration physiologist tell we that man be very largely what other make he many go so far as to say that character and disposition be three part hereditary and one part environment if this be so a good deal of allowance should be make it be less than 300 year since the first negro be bring over to this country and it be but little more than thirty year since slavery be abolish hence from both the standpoint of descent and environment the negro be at a great disadvantage and he should hardly be judge by the common standard it be in the year 1619 that a dutch ship land a cargo of negro from guinea but that be not really the first case of slavery in this country prior to that time pauper and criminal from the old world have voluntarily sell themselves into a species of subjection in preference to starvation and detention in they own land but this landing in 1619 seem to have really introduce the color man into the labor world and market of america we need not trace the history of the negro as a slave at any length that he be occasionally abused go without say but that he condition be approximately as bad as a majority of writer have attempt to prove be not so certain it be the policy of the slave owner to get as much work out of he staff as he possibly could he know from experience that the power of human endurance be necessarily limited and that a man could not work satisfactorily when he be sick or hungry hence even on the supposition that all slave owner be without feel it be obvious that self-interest must have impel they to keep the negro in good health and to prevent he from lose strength from hardship and want on some plantation the lot of the slave be a hard one but on other there be very little complain or cause for complaint thousand of slave be better off by far than they have be subsequent to liberation and it be a fact that speak volume for the much discuss and criticize slaveholder that number of emancipated slave refuse to accept they freedom while many more who go away delighted at the removal of withstraint come back of they own option very soon after and beg to be allow to resume the old relation the average negro obey literally obey the divine instruction to take no thought for the morrow if he have a good dinner in the oven he be apt to forget for the time be that there be such a meal as supper and he certainly do not give even a pass thought to the fact that if he have no breakfast in the morning he will be powerfu ' hungry this indifference as to the future rob slavery of much of its hardship and although every one condemn the idea in the abstract there be many humane man and woman who do not think the color man suffer half as much as have so often and so emphatically be state abolition be advocate with much earnestness for many year prior to lincoln 's famous emancipation proclamation the agitation first take tangible shape during the administration of general jackson a man who receive more hero worship than have fall to the lot of any of he successor to a zealous if perhaps bigoted quaker belong the credit of have start the work by found a newspaper which he call the genius of universal emancipation william lloyd garrison subsequently with the liberator be connect with this journal and in the first issue he announce as he program war to the death against slavery in every form i will not equivocate i will not excuse i will not retreat a single inch and i will be hear be the announcement with which he open the campaign which he subsequently carry on with more conspicuous vigor than success garrison handle the question of the relation between the white and colored people of the country without glove and he very outspoken language occasionally get he into trouble the people who support he be know as abolitionist a name which even at that early date conjure up hard feeling and divide household against household and family against family among these garrison be regard as a hero and to some extent as a martyr while the bitterness of he invective earn for he the title of fanatic and crank from the thousand who disagree with he and who think he be advocate legislation in advance of public sentiment the debate of the day of which we be speak be full of interest many of the argument advance teem with force the abolitionist denounce the republic for inconsistency in declare that all man be equal and then keep 3000000 color people in enforced subjection in reply the bible be freely quote in defense of slavery and the fight be take up by minister of religion with much zeal it be not by any mean a sectional question at that time while the slave be own by southern planter and land proprietor they be purchase and keep on borrow capital and many of the man in the north who be suppose to sympathize with the abolitionist be as much interested in the perpetuation of slavery as those who actually own the slave themselves in the year 1831 a negro name turner support by six desperate and misguided fellow countryman start out on what they regard as a practical crusade against slavery turner profess to have see vision such as inspired joan of arc and he proceed to fulfill what he regard as he divine mission in a very fanatical manner first the white man who own turner be murder and then the band proceed to kill off all white man in sight or within convenient reach within two day nearly fifty white man be destroy by those avenge angel as they be call and then the insurrection or crusade be terminate by the organize of a handful of white man who do not propose to be sacrifice as have be they fellow turner 's bravery be great when there be no resistance but he recognize that discretion be the better part of valor the moment organize resistance be offer take to the wood he leave he follower to shift for themselves for more than a week he live on what he could find in the wheat field and then come in contact with a armed white man he speedily surrender a week later he be hang and seventeen other color man suffer a like penalty for connection with the conspiracy the murderous outbreak have other dire result for the negro and cause many innocent man to be suspect and punish a year later garrison start the new england anti-slavery society which be follow by many similar organization so intense do the feeling become that president jackson think it advisable to recommend legislation exclude abolition literature from the mail the measure be finally defeat but in the southern state particularly a great deal of mail be search and even condemn reward be offer in some of the slave-holding state for the apprehension of some of the lead abolitionist and feeling run very high every outbreak be lay at the door of the man who be preach the new gospel of equal rights regardless of color mob frequently take a hand in the proceedings and several man be attack and arrest on very flimsy pretext in 1836 the pennsylvanium hall in philadelphium be burn because it have be dedicate by a anti-slavery meeting so bitter do the feeling become that every attempt to open school for colored child be follow by disturbance the teacher be drive away and the book destroy numerous petition on the subject be send to congress and there be a uproar in the house when it be propose to refer a petition for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbium to a committee the southern congressman withdraw from the house as a formal protest and the word secession which be subsequently to acquire such a much more significant meaning be first apply to this action on they part a compromise however be effect and the secede member take they seat on the follow day feeling however run very high some people return fugitive slave to they owner while other establish what be then know as the underground railway this be a combination between abolitionist in various part and involve the feeding and housing of slave who be pass on from house to house and help on they road to canada much excitement be cause in 1841 by the ship creole which sail from richmond with a cargo of 135 slave from the virginia plantation near the bahama island one of the slave name washington as by the way a good many thousand slave be name from time to time head a rebellion the slave succeed in overpower the crew and in confine the captain and the white passenger they force the captain to take the boat to new providence where all except the actual member of the rebel crowd be declare free joshua gidding of ohio offer a resolution in the house of representative claim that every man who have be a slave in the united state be free the moment he cross the boundary of some other country the way in which this resolution be receive lead to the resignation of mr gidding he offer himself for re-election and be send back to congress by a enormous majority as ohio have be very bitter in its anti-negro demonstration the vote be regard as very significant the supreme court decide differently from the people and a ruling be hand down to the effect that fugitive slave be liable to re-capture the court hold that the law as to slavery be paramount in free as well as slave state and that every law-abiding citizen must recognize these rights and not interfere with they feel become very intense after this and for a time it threaten to extend far beyond rational limit in the church the controversy wax warm and in more than one instance division as well as dissension arise in 1858 a new phase be give to the controversy by john brown every one have hear of this remarkable man who be regard by some as a martyr and by other as a dangerous crank as one writer very aptly put it john brown be both the one and the other that he intention be in the main good few doubt but he method be open to the gravest censure and accord to some deep thinker he be in a large degree responsible for the bitter feeling which make war between the north and the south inevitable probably this be give undue importance to this much-discussed enthusiast who regard himself as a divine messenger send to liberate the slave and punish the slave-holder he conceive the idea of rally all the color people around he in the impregnable mountain of virginium and have draft a constitution he proceed to unfurl he flag and call out he supporter in October 1859 he take possession of the united state armory at harper 's ferry interfere with the running of train and practically hold the town with a force of some eighteen man of whom four be color colonel robert e lee quickly come on the scene with a detachment of troops and drive the brown follow into a engine-house they decline to surrender and thirteen be either kill or mortally wound two of brown 's son be among those who fall and the leader himself be capture he treat he trial with the utmost indifference and go to the scaffold erect and apparently unconcerned he body be take to he old home in new york state where it be bury abraham lincoln must not be include in the list of enthusiastic abolitionist although he eventually free the slave in speech make prior to the war he express the opinion that in slave state general emancipation would be ill-advised and although he election be look upon as dangerous to slave-holder ' interest the fear seem to have be prophetic in a large measure it be not until the war have last far longer than originally anticipate that lincoln definitely threaten to liberate the color slave that threat he carry into execution on January 1st 1863 when 3000000 slave become free the cause of the confederacy have not yet become the lose cause and the leader on the southern side be incline to ridicule the decree and to regard it rather as a bluff than anything of a serious order but it be emancipation in fact as well as in deed as the color orator never tire of explain such in outline be the history of the color man during the day of enforced servitude of he condition during that period volume have be write few work print in the english language have be more widely circulate than uncle tom 's cabin which have be read in every english-speaking country in the world and in many other country besides it have be dramatize and perform upon thousand of stage before audience of every rank and class as a descriptive work it rival in many passage the very best ever write much controversy have take place as to how much of the book be history -- how much of it be found upon fact and how much be pure fiction the ground be a rather dangerous one to touch it be safest to say that while the brutality hold up to scorn and contempt in this book be not general in the slave state or on plantation in the south what be depict might have take place under exist law and the book expose iniquity which be certainly perpetrate in isolate case that all negro be not treat badly or that slavery invariably mean misery can be easily prove by any one who take the trouble to investigate even in the most superficial manner when the news of emancipation gradually spread through the remote region of the south there be hundred and probably thousand of negro who decline absolutely to take advantage of the freedom give they many most pathetic case of devotion and love be make manifest even to-day there be number of aged color man and woman who be remain with they old-time owner and decline to regard emancipation as logical or reasonable not long ago a northern writer while travel through the south find a aged negro whom he approach with a view to get some interesting passage of local history to he surprise he find that the old man have but one idea that idea be that it be he duty to take care of and preserve he old master 's grave when the war break out the old hero be the body-servant or valet of a man who from the very first be in the thick of the fight against the north the color man follow he soldier-master from place to place and when a northern bullet put a end to the career of the master the servant reverently convey the body back to the old home superintend the interment and commence a daily routine of watch which for more than thirty year he have never vary all the relative of the decease have leave the neighborhood year before and the faithful old negro be the only one leave to watch over the grave and keep the flower that be grow on it in good condition as far as could be learn from local gossip the old fellow have no visible means of subsistence secure what little he need to eat in exchange for odd job around neighbor house no one seem to know where he sleep or seem to regard the matter as of any consequence there be about the jet black hero however a air of absolute happiness add to a obvious sense of pride at the performance of he self-imposed and very loving task instance of this kind could be multiply almost without end the negro as a free man and citizen retain many of the most prominent characteristic which mark he career in the day before the war now and again one hear of a negro commit suicide such a event however be almost as rare as resignation of a office-holder or the death of a annuitant indifference to suffer and a keen appreciation of pleasure make prolonged grief very unusual among afro-american and in consequence they life be comparatively joyous one have to go down south to appreciate the color man as he really be in the north he be apt to imitate the white man so much that he lose he unique personality in the southern state however he can be find in all he original glory here he can be regard as a survival of precede generation in the south before the war the truism that there be dignity in toil be scarcely appreciate at its full worth the negro understand as if by instinct that he ought to work for he white master and that duty of every kind in the field on the road and in the house should be perform by he for a white man who work he entertain feeling in which there be a little pity and a great deal of contempt he have never get over this feeling or the feeling which he father before he have down south to-day the expression po ' white trash be still full of meaning and the word be utter by the thick-lipped woolly-headed critic with a emphasis and expression the very best white mimic have never yet succeed in reproduce george augustus salum one of england 's oldest and most successful descriptive writer talk very entertainingly regard the emancipate slave the first trip make to this country by the versatile writer refer to be during the war he return home full of prejudice and write up the country in that supercilious manner european writer be too apt to adopt in regard to america several year later he make he second trip and he experience as record in america revisit be much better reading and much freer from prejudice for full five and thirty year he write have i be wait to see the negro ` standing in the mill pond ' i see he in all he glory and all he drive wretchedness at guinney in the state of virginium i own that for some day past the potential african ` standin ' in de mill pond longer than he oughter ' have be lie somewhat heavily on my conscience my acquaintance with we dark brethren since arrive in this country have not only be necessarily limited but scarcely of a nature to give I any practical insight into he real condition since he have be a free man -- free to work or starve free to become a good citizen or go to the devil as he have go mundanely speak in haytus and elsewhere color folk be few and far between in new york and they have never as a rule be slave and be not even generally of servile extraction in philadelphium they be much more numerous many of the mulatto waiter employ in the hotel be strikingly handsome man and on the whole the sable son of pennsylvanium strike I as be industrious well dress prosperous and a trifle haughty in they intercourse with white folk in baltimore where slavery exist until the promulgation of lincoln 's proclamation the color people be plentiful i meet a good many ragged shiftless and generally dejected negro of both sex who appear to be just the kind of waif and stray who would stand in a mill pond longer than they ought to in the event of there be any convenient mill pond at hand but the better class darkey who have be domestic slave in baltimore family seem to retain all they own affectionate obsequiousness of manner and respectful familiarity again in washington the black man and he congener seem to be do remarkably well at one of the quietest most elegant and most comfortable hotel in the federal capital i find the establishment conduct by a color man all of whose employe from the clerk in the office to the waiter and chambermaid be color we chambermaid be a delightful old lady and insist ere we leave that we should give she a receipt for a real old english christmas plum pudding but these be not the mill pond folk of whom i be in quest they be of the south as a irishman in london be of ireland but not in it i have a craving to see whether any of the social ash of slavery live they wonted fire away down south be the real object of my mission and in pursuit of that mission i go on to richmond mr salum proceed to give a most amusing account of he ride from new york to richmond with various criticism of sleeping-car accommodation heartily endorse by all american traveler who have read they arrive at richmond he ask the usual question : be not the negro idle thriftless and thievish from time immemorial it have be assert that the law of meum and tuum have no meaning for the color man it be a joke current in more than one american city that the police have stand order to arrest every negro see carry a turkey or a chicken along the street in other word the funny man would have we believe that the innate love of poultry in the ethiopian 's breast be so great that the chance be against he have be possess of sufficient force of character to pass a store or market where any bird be expose for sale and not watch it be doubtless a libel on the color race to state that even the majority of its member be chicken thief by descent rather than inclination just as it be a libel on they religion to insinuate that a color camp meeting be almost certain to involve severe inroad into the chicken coop and roost of the neighbor farmer certain it be however that chicken stealing be one of the most dangerous cause of backslide on the part of color convert and enthusiastic singer of hymn in negro church the case of the convert who be ask by he pastor a week after he admission to the church if he have steal a chicken since he conversion and who carefully conceal a steal duck under he coat while he assure the good man that he have not be a exaggerated one of course but it be quote as a good story in almost every state and city in the union mr salum object very much to judge a whole class of people by a few street-corner or cross-road lounger the negro he find to be superstitious just as we find they to-day even educate negro be apt to give credence to many story which on the face of they appear ridiculous the word hoodoo and mascot have a meaning among these people of which we have only a dim conception and when sickness enter a family the aid of a alleged doctor who be often a charlatan of the worst character be apt to be seek it will take several generation to work out this characteristic and perhaps the greatest complaint the color race have against those who formerly hold they in subjection be the way in which voodoo and supernatural story be tell ignorant slave with a view to frightening they into obedience and incite they to extra exertion for absolute ignorance and apparent lack of human understand the negro loafer to be find around some of we southern town and depot may be quote as a signal and quite amusing example the hat as mr salum humorously put it resemble a inverted coal scuttle or bucket without handle and pierce by many hole it be something like the bonnet of a brobdingnagian quakeress huge and flap and batter and fearful to look upon hang all this equipment this interesting writer go on to say on the limb of a tall negro of any age between sixteen and sixty and then let he stand close to the scaffold-like platform of the depot shanty and let he loaf he attitude be one of complete and apathetic immobility he do not grin he may be chew but he do not smoke he do not beg at least in so far as i observe he he stand in no posture and assume no gesture belong to the mendicant he loom at you with a dull stony preoccupy gaze as though he thought be a thousand mile away in the unknown land while once in every quarter of a hour or so he wake up to a momentary consciousness that he be a thing neither rich nor rare and so wonder how in thunder he get there he be a derelict a fragment of flotsam and jetsam cast upon the not too hospitable shore of civilization after the great storm have lash the southern sea to frenzy and the ship of slavery have go to piece forever possibly he be a good deal more human than he look and if he choose to bestir himself and to address himself to articulate discourse could tell you a great many thing about he want and wish he view and feeling on thing in general which to you might prove little more than amazing as thing go he prefer to do nothing and to proffer no kind of explanation as to why he be stand there in a metaphorical mill pond very much ` longer than he oughter ' one turn with pleasure from the severe but perhaps not overdrawn character sketch of the color loafer to the better side of the modern negro the intense desire for education and the keen recognition of the fact that knowledge be power point to a time when utter ignorance even among the negro will be a thing of the past prejudice be hard to fight against and the color man have often a considerable amount of handicap to overcome but just as mr salum find the typical negro standing in the mill pond longer than he oughter a sad memento of the past so the traveler can find many a intelligent and entertaining individual whose accent betray he color even in the darkest night but whose cute expression and pleasant reminiscence go a long way towards convince even the sternest critic that the future be full of hope for a race whose past have in it so little that be either pleasing or satisfactory chapter xv we national park a delightful rhapsody -- early history of yellowstone park -- a fish story which convulse congress -- the first white man to visit the park -- a race for life -- philosophy of the hot spring -- mount evert -- from the geyser to elk park -- some old friend and new one -- yellowstone lake -- the angler 's paradise yellowstone park be generally include in the list of the wonder of the world it be certainly unique in every respect and no other nation modern or ancient have ever be able to boast of a recreation ground and park provide by nature and supply with such magnificent and extraordinary attraction and peculiarity it be a park upon a mountain be more than 10000 foot above the level of the sea irregular in shape it may be say to be about sixty mile across on the average and it contain a area of 3500 square mile mr olin d wheeler in a admirable treatise on this park in which he describe some of the many wonder in the marvelous region traverse by the northern pacific railroad thus rhapsodize : the yellowstone park the gem of wonderland the land of mystic splendor region of bubble caldron and boil pool with fret rim rival the coral in delicacy of texture and the rainbow in variety of color of steam funnel exhale into the etherine atmosphere in calm unruffled monotone and paroxysmal ejection vast cloud of fleecy vapor from the underground furnace of the god of nature sylvan parkland where amidst the unsullied freshness of flower-strewn valley and bountiful woodland the native fauna of the land browse in fearless joy and wander wild and free unfretted by sound of huntsman 's horn the long-drawn bay of the hound and the sharp crack of the rifle land of beauteous vale and laugh water thundering cataract and wind ravine realm of the ice king and the fire king enchanted spot where mountain and sea meet and kiss each other where the murmur of the river as it meander through heaven-blest valley become harsh and sullen amid the pine-covered hill which darken and throttle its joyous song until uncontrollable it throw itself a magnificent sheet of diamond spray and plunge torrent over precipice and roll along a emerald flood betwixt cañon wall such as the eye of mortal have seldom see the history of this park be involve in a good deal of mystery about ninety year ago it be first discover but the information bring back to civilization by the explorer be apparently so exaggerated that it excite general ridicule no one believe that the wonder describe really exist even later when corroborative evidence be forthcoming skepticism continue it be almost as difficult then to make people believe the truth about the hot spring and geyser as it be now to make people believe that it be possible for a man to stand on the edge of a hot spring catch the choicest kind of fish in the cool water of the lake surround he and then cook he fish in the boiling water of the spring without take it off the hook or walk a single step this latter fish story have the peculiar feature of be true several reliable man include some who have not allow the ardent pursuit of isaac walton 's pet pastime to blunt they susceptibility of veracity have perform this apparently impossible feat or have see it done right before they very eye a year or so ago when a appropriation be ask for in congress for the further preservation of yellowstone park a member make this extraordinary possibility a argument in support of he plea a roar of laughter succeed he recital and when the orator stop to explain that he be merely record a actual fact and not tell a fish story there seem to be danger of wholesale convulsion within the legislative wall several of the amuse congressman subsequently make inquiry and ascertain to they astonishment that instead of exaggeration the half have not be tell and that if a full summary of the attraction of yellowstone park be to be write the immense shelf of the congressional library itself would scarcely hold the book that would have to be write to contain it this little divergence be to afford a excuse for the incredulity of we forefather who make sarcastic remark as to the power of wild western whisky when pioneer return from the rocky mountain and tell they that there exist away up in the cloud a immense natural park where beauty and weirdness could be find side by side john colter or coulter be say to have be the first white man who ever enter the natural portal of this glorious park it be in the early day of the century that this remarkable man have he adventure he be a member of the lewi and clark expedition which be send out to explore the source of the missourus and columbium river he be naturally a adventurer and a man who have no idea of the meaning of the word danger the party have a glimpse of yellowstone park and coulter be so enamored with the hunting prospects that he either desert from the expedition party or obtain permission to remain behind however this may have be it be certain that coulter remain with but one companion in the vicinity of the jefferson fork of the missourus river accord to fairly authentic record he and he companion be capture by hostile blackfeet who show they resentment at the intrusion upon the privacy of they domain by deprive coulter of he clothing and coulter 's companion of he life the chronic adventurer however spend four year among the more friendly bannock indian who probably for century have live in or near the park he have a very enjoyable time in the newly discover region and he adventure crowd upon each other one after the other with great rapidity when at last he decide to return to the abode of the white man he take with he a fund of recollection and incident of the most sensational character and before he have be at home with he own kindred a week he have earn the reputation of be a modern anania ten time more mendacious than the original article twenty or thirty year elapse before any reliable information be obtain about the park jame bridger the daring scout and mountaineer go through the park more than once and in he most exaggerated rhapsody tell of its beauty and of its marvel but bridger 's story have be try in the balance and find want before this and nobody worried very much over they in 1870 dr f v hayden and mr m p langford explore the park on a more rational basis and give to the world in reliable shape a resume of they discovery mr langford be himself a experienced western explorer for many year he have desire to either verify or disprove the so-called fairy tale which be go the round concern yellowstone park he find a number of equally adventurous gentleman include the surveyor-general of montana mr washburn after whom the expedition be generally know in 1871 dr hayden who be then connect with the united state geological survey department undertake a scientific exploration of the park he be accompany by mr langford and the two man together tear away the veil of mystery which have overhang the wonderful resort among the hill and give to the country for the first time a reliable description of one of the most magnificent of its possession the report be not confine to eulogy it include drawing photograph and geological summary and wind up with a earnest appeal to the national government to reserve the beauty spot as a national park forever several man arise to endorse the request and in march 1872 congress pass a act dedicate yellowstone park to the public for all time declare it to be a grand national playground and a museum of unparalleled and incomparable marvel since that time the park have gradually become better known and more highly appreciate the northern pacific railroad run a branch line to which the name of the park have be give and which connect livingston montana with cinnabar at the northern edge of the park the road be about fifty mile long and the scenery through which it pass be astounding in its nature from cinnabar the tourist be drive in large stage throughout the park if at all reminiscent by nature he think about the experience of coulter to whom we have already refer as the pioneer white man of yellowstone early in the century the park be occupy by indian who have scarcely come in contact with white man and who have not learn that in the unavoidable conflict between race the weaker must inevitably succumb to the stronger around the limpid stream and at the border of the virgin forest contain untold wealth tent make of skin draw over bough cut roughly from tree could be see in every direction all around there be rough-looking utterly uncivilized indian who be carry out they usual occupation of do nothing and do it with exceptional ability the woman or squaw be more active but frequently pause in they work to look at the unfortunate coulter who deprive of he clothing and absolutely naked be wait bind hand and foot for the fate that he have every reason to believe await he he only companion have be kill the day before and he expect every minute to meet the same fate accord to he own description of what follow strategy save he life a indian send for the purpose ask he if he could run fast know himself to be a athlete of no mean ability but guess the object of the question he assure the indian that he be not a speedy runner the answer have the effect he anticipate he thong be almost immediately cut and he be take out on the open prairie give a trifling start and then tell that he might save himself if he could coulter have run many a fast mile before but he never run as on this occasion he know that behind he there be among the indolent young indian many who could run with great speed and he only hope lay in get to cover ahead of these every long stride mean that much space between he and death and every stride he take be the longest in he power again and again he look around only to discover to he astonishment that he have but just hold he own at last however all he pursuer except one be tire of the pursuit and when he find this to be the case he turn like a stag at bay and overpower he then see that other of the indian be take up the chase after a brief rest coulter make another great run plunge into the river in front of he and finally enter the labyrinth of forest and crater now know to the world as yellowstone park here if he story be to be believe he succeed in make for himself clothing of some character out of the skin of beast that he shoot and finally he fall into the hand of less hostile red man so much of the early day of yellowstone and of the reminiscence which a first visit naturally conjure up the park as it exist to-day be overcrowded with modern interest and one only refer to these reminiscence by way of contrast there be in the park at least 100 geyser nearly 4000 spring and a immense number of miniature park large and small river and other marvel the park be about equi-distant from the city of portland and st paul and so many people have be attract to it in recent year that a large number of very fine hotel have be build at a great expense the hotel be open about four month a year and the help to run they be bring from different state the expense be naturally heavy and hence the hotel charge be not nominal although the tourist can generally limit the expense incur to the bulk of he pocket-book should he so desire if he include in he calculation the absolutely free sight that he witness the expense of a trip be certainly moderate and ought not to be take into much consideration the mammoth hot spring be one of the lead source of attraction of the park a tour of which be something no american of means can afford to miss the spring be very hard to describe they consist of a number of irregular terrace some as large as five acre in extent and other very small some be a few foot high and other stand forty or sixty foot above the one next below few people really understand what these spring be or how the terrace be form one authority of eminence say that the rock underlie the particular point be calcareous in character consist mainly of carbonated lime which be somewhat soluble in percolate earth water the hot subterranean water dissolve a large amount of mineral matter in pass through the earth which it deposit on the surface in pass through the air by this process wall embankment and terrace be build up and as the mineral through which the water pass be vary greatly in color so the deposit leave on the surface be some of they red other pink and other black with yellow green blues chocolate and mixed color abound in immense number sometimes harmonize beautifully and sometimes present the most astounding contrast the water in the spring be not warm but hot and hence the name frequently the temperature exceed 160 degree in which case the color matter seem to be wash out and the terrace present a white appearance on other occasion where the temperature be less severe the vary hue already refer to abound on every side sometimes this whiteness or bleached-out appearance be astounding in its effect the true artist will stand for hour gaze upon it and wish that he could reproduce ever so inaccurately the intense beauty which surround he behind the spring and block up the view on the south be the mountain know as bunsen peak the highest within the range of the eye just across the open space in front of the hotel at the spring be the quarter of the national soldier who patrol the park and to a certain extent at any rate protect it from the vandal and the purloiner in a admirable description of this scene contain in indian land and wonderland a very delightful story be tell of the long low flat and lava-capped mountain know as mount evert in honor of mr t c evert of helena few know the story upon which the mountain owe its name which be give as follow : among the member of the first party that ever explore yellowstone park be messr m p langford s t hauser and t c evert there be also a military escort under lieutenant doane the party proceed up the yellowstone river to the grand cañon thence across to yellowstone lake around its eastern edge to the southern end whence turn west they follow down the firehole river through the upper geyser basin to the madison river follow this river out from the park they return to western civilization -- all but one of they on the nineteenth day out September 9th when move across the country border the southern shore of the lake mr evert become lose the travel here be difficult owe to fall timber rugged height and no trail and he be not miss until camp be make at night mr evert be not see again for thirty-seven day when he be find by two mountaineer on the verge of what be now know as mount evert perfectly exhaust and partly derange through exposure and suffering on the very first day of he absence he horse leave standing and unfastened with all the man 's arm and camp equipment attach become frightened and run away evert be near-sighted have not even a knife for use or defense and only a field glass to assist he in escape he first manage to reach heart lake the source of snake river here he remain for twelve day sleep close by the hot spring to keep from freezing he food be thistle root boil in the spring one night he be force into a tree by a mountain lion and keep there all night finally he bethink himself of the lens of he field glass and thus be enable to kindle fire he wander all along the western side of the lake and down the yellowstone to where he be providentially find he give the story of he terrible experience in the old scribner 's magazine since become the century and a thrilling tale it make in a country fill with a network of stream abundantly supply with animal life for food gorge with timber for fuel the man nearly freeze and starve and perish from thirst twice he be five day without food once three day without water it be late in the season and the storm sweep down on he and chill he to the bone the snow keep he prisoner in camp or when on he painful march block he progress naturally he lose strength and become hourly in danger of succumb to the vast difficulty which confront he he suffering be increase by the fear which be create by a large mountain lion which get on he trail and follow he evidently with a view to make he a feature of the menu of he next meal it seem incredible that mr evert should ever have escape with he life fortune however come to he rescue at last he be rescue and nurse back to life by good friend to the plateau on which he be find he name be give although there be few who will remember the significance of the name norri geyser be another of the almost miraculous feature of the park the basin of the geyser have be describe as a weird uncanny place and the word seem well choose of vegetation there be practically none because the underground heat keep the ground always warm and steam break out into the atmosphere at several point the general aspect be drear and desolate gray and dull and yet there be something about it beautiful as well as uncanny a geyser be always a source of wonder the word be of icelandic derivation and signify gush as apply to phenomenon such as we be now describe its applicability be good for from the mouth of the geyser there rush from time to time a immense mass of boiling water and steam create a disturbance of no ordinary character it be assume that the water hurl into the air to a great height while at boiling point have rise to the surface through mass of lava which be reminiscent of volcanic age far beyond the memory of mankind the mystery of geological formation be too great to be go into in a work of this character but the bare contemplation of geyser such as be see at yellowstone park remind one of the wonder deeply hide in the bowels of the earth unappreciated and unknown by and to 99 per cent of the human race at the norris geyser basin the noise be extraordinary and people who be superstitiously incline be awed at the rumbling and grumbling which seem to issue from the bowels of the earth eruption of hot water and steam at irregular interval burst forth and the very road which cross the adjoining plain have be bleached to almost perfect whiteness by the vapor the crust of ground be very thin all around here and indiscriminate explore be dangerous to slip through the crust into the boiling water beneath would inevitably involve be scald to death and the man who allow the guide to show he where to tread exhibit the greater wisdom in direct contrast to this basin be the elk park yellowstone be celebrate among other thing for be the home of a immense number of the most remarkable specimen of north american animal the government herd of buffalo in the park be of countless value because it be really the only complete representation at the present time of the practically extinct species of flesh and hide produce animal which use to graze by the million on the prairie the buffalo be comparatively tame most of they be bear within the confines of the park and seem to have realize that the existence of they kind in perpetuity be one of the greatest desire of the government there be a number of bear around as well but they have lose they viciousness and enjoy life very hugely under somewhat changed condition they seldom hurt any one but prowl around the hotel at night and by eat up the scrap and leavings solve the garbage problem in a satisfactory manner deer elk antelope and mountain sheep climb the mountain and very frequently find they way into elk park or gibbon meadow this be a exceptionally desirable winter ground because it be surround by hill and mountain which keep off the worst of the wind and there be moreover a perpetual spring of pure water the meadow be probably the prettiest spot in the entire park there be less of the awful and more of the picturesque than can be find elsewhere and it be in many respects a oasis in a vast and somewhat dreary expanse of land golden gate be another of the exquisite spot every visitor to yellowstone park seek and find to reach the golden gate one must be a great climber for it be high up and the road to it be build along the edge of a cliff which in place seem to be absolutely perpendicular the gate be however worth reach and one be not surprise to hear that as much as $ 14000 be spend in cut out a single mile of the road to it through the rock leave the golden gate and continue the tour of inspection a valley of large dimension be see the contrast between the rich green of almost faultless verdure and the dreariness of the rock leave behind be strike it would seem as though nature have build up a immense barrier between the weird and the natural so that the one could not affect the other the bible speak of the intense comfort of the shade of a great rock in a dry and thirsty land a sensation of equal if not greater relief be experience in yellowstone park when one leave the grand death-like desolation around the hot spring and encounter the exquisite beauty of shrub land and timber but a few pace away the grove of tree be in themselves source of great delight and also of immense wealth fortunately they will be preserve in perpetuity for the american people the lumber king can not get here he ravages must be confine to other region the valley into which the tourist have enter take its name from the swan lake a very delightful inland mountain scene the lake be about two mile from golden gate it be not a very large body of water but its ripple surface extract expression of admiration from all who behold it it have be describe as a demure look sheet of water and there be something about the appearance of the lake which seem to justify the peculiar definition the cañon form the valley be like everything else in yellowstone park -- a little out of the ordinary on the one side there be lofty mountain with eminence and peak of various formation and height while in the distance the great electric peak can be easily see we have already speak of yellowstone park as be about 10000 foot above the sea level electric peak well describe as the sentinel of the park be more than 11000 foot high view from a distance or along the line of the valley it be calculate to excite both admiration and awe willow creek park or willow park as it be sometimes call lie due south it take its name from the immense growth of willow bush which hide the ground from view and monopolize the scenery and groundwork entirely none of these bush can claim the right to be call tree as the average height be inconsiderable but they make up in density what they lack in altitude the peculiar green of the willow be the predominate color without any variation of any kind the idea convey to the mind be of a huge green carpet or rug and when the wind blow freely across the valley it divide up the bush into little ridge or furrow which add to the uniqueness of the scene spring of remarkably pure water many of they possess of medicinal power abound in this neighborhood and tourist slake a imaginary thirst with much interest at different one of these the obsidian creek run slowly through this valley obsidian cliff be the next object of special interest which be witness it be half a mile long and from 150 to 200 foot high the southern end be form of volcanic glass or obsidian as true a glass as any artificially produce the roadway at its base be construct across the talus and be emphatically a glass road huge fragment of obsidian black and shine some of it streak with white seam line the road small piece be also plentiful this flow of glass come from a high plateau to the east-northeast numerous vent pit or apparent crater have be discover on this plateau mr j p idding of the unite state geological survey who have make a special study of obsidian cliff contribute to the survey report for 1885-86 a paper that have in it much that be of interest to the unscientific mind the lower geyser basin be in some respects more please than the norri although the desolation be perhaps even more apparent people who have see district in which salt be make out of brine extract from well state that the appearance in the lower geyser basin be very similar to what be see around manufacture district of that character this basin be in the valley of the firehole river a strangely name stream of a very beautiful character in the basin itself the branch of the firehole unite and with the gibbon river form one of the three source of the missourus call the madison after the president of that name the fountain geyser be the largest in the neighborhood and be one of the best in the park it be very regular in its eruption and seldom fail to perform on time for the benefit of the onlooker it send a immense volume of water into the air and resemble a fountain very closely its basin be very interesting and give a good example of the singular deposit leave by a geyser when the fountain be busy throw out its volume of water the appearance be very peculiar little notice be give of a eruption which take place suddenly although at state interval all at once the watcher be reward for he patience by have the stillness change into activity of the most boisterous character the water be hurl upward in a mass of frothing boil and foam crystal the actual height vary but frequently go as far as thirty foot in a moment the wall of water become compact oblong and irregular crystal effect be produce vary accord to the time of day and the amount of light but always delightful and peculiar close at hand be the mammoth paint pot in the center of the firehole geyser we can explain the appearance of the paint pot or mud bath much more easily than we can account for the phenomenon it be well name because it resemble a succession of paint pot of enormous size more than anything else that the imagination can liken it to the basin measure forty by sixty foot with a mud boundary three or four foot high on three side of it the contents of the basin have keep scientist wonder for year the substance be white look very much like ordinary paint but unlike paint it be constantly in motion and the agitation be so persistent that a idea be give that the paint pot 's basin be the bed of a crater the continual bubbling and vibration be very interesting in its effect and the noise it make be quite peculiar not unlike a subdue hiss or a badly execute stage-whisper mixed among the white substance be a quantity of silicious clay of all sort and condition of color this produce a variation in the appearance but be merely in addition to what be otherwise marvelous in the extreme pearl gray with terra cotta red and green tint be the basic color of this boil seething mass which seem to be continually at unrest and in a course of worry the excelsior geyser be the most conspicuous feature of the midway basin a collection of hot spring and pool they be situate in the midway basin and be originally call cliff caldron excelsior geyser be in a continual state of anarchy without law government or regulation it do just as it like and when it like it seldom perform when want to but when it do break out into a condition of fermentation the effect be very magnificent as one writer put it the beauty and exhibition of this geyser be as far superior to those of all the other as the light of the sun seem to that of the moon the geyser be for year regard as the grandest spring in the park before its exceptionally great feature prevail or become apparent in the year 1881-82 the eruption from this geyser become so terrific that it spout water as high as 250 foot and convert the generally inoffensive firehole river into a torrent of storm water rock of large size and heavy enough to be very dangerous be hurl headlong from within the mysterious confines of the earth and be dash around in all direction for mile the terrific noise could be hear and people who have be wait for a phenomenon of this character hurry across country to witness it it be only now and again that a phenomenon of this kind be repeat and the most skillful geologist be unable to give we any adequate forecast as to when the next performance will take place rehearsal seem always in progress vast mass of steam rise from the crater or hole many people crowd to the edge of the basin and strive to penetrate into the mystery of subterranean happening the day may come when some scientific method of see through smoke and steam and endure scalding heat without difficulty may be devise until then the mystery must remain unsolved in exact contrast with the irregular and spasmodic action of the excelsior be the methodical persevere action of old faithful this be another of the great and popular geyser of yellowstone park it be so uniform in its appearance that a man can keep he watch regulate by it every sixty-five minute the well-named geyser give forth a peculiar noise to warn the world that it be about to perform then for about five minute a vast stream of water and steam be hurl into the air to the height of about 150 foot the mass of boiling water measure six foot in diameter and the volume discharge exceed a hundred thousand gallon each hour day by day and hour for nearly twenty year this industrious geyser have regularly do its duty and afford entertainment for visitor no one know how long prior to that time it commence operation or for how long it will continue leave for the moment the consideration of geyser and hot spring and other wonder of this character the sightseer get a view of a very different nature at keppler 's cascade the stage coach generally stop to enable passenger to walk to the edge of the cliff and watch the cascade and foam river in the black cañon below then the journey proceed through the firehole valley and through leafy forest and open glade until the narrow and tortuous cañon of spring creek be reach the scenery here be decidedly unconventional and wild we soon reach the summit of the continental divide now the outlook be much expand and it become more majestic and dignified the mountain overhang the roadway on one side and drop far below on the other heavy shaggy forest cover the slope and peak while tiny island park as it be and cheerful opening be occasionally see the road wind about the mountain-flank now climb up now descend the whole aspect of nature grow more grand more austere the air grow more rarified and one become more and more exalt in spirit occasionally the mountain break away and you obtain a view far out beyond the narrow limit round about distant mountain be see and the feeling that there be nothing but mountain-wall about you impress itself strongly upon one and it be just about true after several mile of such ride and when you have begin to imagine that nothing finer can come the road lead up to a point that almost before you know it simply drive from you thought all else see on this ride it be a wonderful picture and produce a state of exultation that to some must seem almost too strong to endure the mountain which rise high above stretch also far below and in every direction be at they very best proud and regal in they strength and bear they be still from summit to the depths heavily cover with the primeval forest it would seem as if they really know what a view be here unfold and to rejoice in the grandeur of the scene like a thread you can trace the turn and line of the road along which the stage have come but that which add the softer more beautiful element to a picture otherwise almost overpower in its grandeur and withal stern and unyielding be see through a break or portal off to the south far away far below lie a portion of shoshone lake like a sleep babe in its mother 's lap nestle this tiny lakelet babe in the mountain it shine like a plate of silver or beautiful mirror it be a gem worth cross a continent to see especially as there run between the lake and the point of view a little valley dress in bright grassy green as a kind of foreground in the rear there be thus a silvered lake a lovely valley with bright and warm green shades and rich dark-black forest in the rear no one can gaze upon such a combination and contrast without be impressed and without recognize the sublime beauty and grandeur of the park and its surroundings yellowstone lake be another of the extraordinary attraction of we great national park it be describe as the highest inland sea in the world and more than 7000 foot above the sea level it be really nearly 8000 foot above the sea and its icy cold water cover a area some thirty mile in length and about half as wide or about 300 square mile this glorious inland ocean be perch up at the summit of the rocky mountain just where no one would expect to find it several island of vary size be dot over the surface of the water which at time be as smooth as a little mill pond and at other almost as turbulent as the sea the shore be entirely irregular in they formation and promontory point extend out into the water a great distance form one of the most peculiar inland peninsula in the entire world along the southern shore inlet and bay be very numerous some of they natural in character and other full of evidence of brisk and even terrific volcanic action from the peculiar rock and eminence along the shore reflection be cast into the water of a almost indescribable character they be vary in nature and color and like the lake itself differ from anything to be see elsewhere another unique feature of this lake and one that have to be see to be understand be the presence on the bank and even out in the lake itself of hot spring and geyser full of boiling water and steam some of these spring have wide and secure edge or bank on which a man can stand and fish then on he right hand he have the icy-cold water of the lake from which he can obtain trout and other fish until he begin to dream of a fisherman 's paradise dr hayden the explorer already refer to be the first man to take advantage of the opportunity and to cook he fish unhook in the boiling water to he left merely make a half turn in order to do so when the professor first mention this fact he be good humoredly laugh at but as state in a earlier part of this chapter the possibility have be so clearly demonstrate that people have long since admit as a possibility what they have first denounce as a utter absurdity chapter xvi the hero of the iron horse honor to whom honor be due -- a class of man not always thoroughly appreciate at they worth -- a amateur 's ride on a fly locomotive -- from twelve mile a hour to six time that speed -- the signal tower and the man who work in it -- steal a train -- a race with steam -- stone about bewitch locomotive and providential escape no one who have not give the matter special consideration have the remotest idea of the magnitude and importance of the railroad system of the united state nor have any one who have not study the statistics bear on the question the faintest conception of the cost of the road build and in operation the cost in dollar and cent for a mile of track have be ascertain to a fractional point expert accountant have figure out to a hundredth part of a cent the cost of haul a passenger or a ton of merchandise any give distance there be even table in existence show the actual expense incur in stop a train while such detail as the necessary outlay in wages fuel repair etc have receive the attention which the magnitude of the interest involve deserve but the cost in human life and suffering of the great railroad system of the united state be quite another matter and one that do not come within the scope of the calculation of accountant expert or otherwise it have be say repeatedly that a man be safer in a railroad train than on the street in other word the percentage of death and serious injury be say by statistician to be lower among man habitually travel than among people who be class as stay-at-home and who seldom take a railroad journey but while this be doubtless correct so far as passenger be concern the rule do not apply to railroad employe and those who by they never-wavering care and energy protect the life and limb of passenger and make railroad travel safe as well as comfortable a celebrated divine when preach on the subject of faith once take a railroad journey for a illustration as he point out with much eloquence and force there could be no more realistic personification of faith than the man who peacefully lay down to sleep at night in he berth of a pullman car rely implicitly upon the railroad man to avert the thousand of danger which have to be encounter during the still hour of the night whenever there be a strike a great deal be write about the man employ in various capacity by railroad and every misdeed be exaggerated and every indiscretion magnify into a crime but very little be say on the other side of the question the man to whom railroad traveler and especially those who ride at night commend they safety be work to the full extent of they power and be pay very small wages when the nature of they duty and the hour they have to make be take into consideration the commendation of these man take the form of deed rather than word and while so few have ever stop to consider the loyalty and devotion of the poorly pay and hard-worked railroad man every traveler who enter a railroad car pay silent tribute to they reliability the passenger as he lounge comfortably in a luxurious seat or sleep peacefully in he state-room think nothing of the anxiety and annoyance of the man in charge of the train or of those who be responsible for the track be keep clear and proper order be give to the engineer this official be a man of many hardship and danger to he be entrust daily the life of hundred of human being he know not how many but he know that the slightest error on he part will hurl perhaps ten perhaps twenty and perhaps fifty human being into eternity besides maim for life two or three time as many more he know too that not only be he responsible for the safety of the man woman and child who be ride behind he but also for the occupant of other train on the same track he know exactly where he must run on to a side track to allow the express in the other direction to pass and he know just where he must slacken speed in order to get safely around a dangerous curve or cross a bridge which be undergo repair or which be not quite as substantial as it would be if he instead of millionaire railroad director have the control of the bridge construction and repair fund to catch a idea of the responsibility of a locomotive engineer it be necessary to ride a hundred mile or so in a engine the author be give this privilege on a bleak frosty day early last winter he be tell by the official that he take the ride at he own risk and as a matter of personal favor and that he must not interfere with the engineer or fireman in the execution of they duty the guest be receive kindly by both engineer and fireman and be give a seat whence he could see along expanse of track over which the locomotive have to draw the train of car to a novice the sensation of a first ride on a locomotive be a very singular one and to say that there be no tinge of fear intermingle with the excitement and pleasure would be to make a statement not bear out by fact on the occasion refer to the train be a special one carry a delegation half way across the continent it be about fifteen minute late and in order to make the run to the next division point it be necessary to maintain a average speed of more than forty-five mile a hour as be almost always the case when there be need for exceptional hurry all sort of trifling delay occur and several precious minute be waste before a start could be make finally the conductor give the necessary word the engineer pull the lever and the irregular passenger find for the first time in he life how much more difficult it be to start a locomotive than he ever imagine first there be a distinct tremble on the huge locomotive then there come a loud hiss with a heavy escape of steam as the huge piston tug and pull at the heavy wheel which slip round and round and fail to grip the rail then as gradually scientific power overcome brute force there be a forward motion of a scarcely perceptible character then as the sand-box be bring into requisition the wheel distinctly bite the rail and in the word of the race-track they be off for a few seconds progress be very slow indeed then the good work of the trust locomotive become apparent and before we be well out of the yard quite a good speed be be obtain the fireman be busy ring the bell and the engineer from time to time add to the warning noise by one of those indescribable toot make only by a steam engine now we be outside the city limit and the train be make excellent time we take out we watch and carefully time the speed between two mile-post to ascertain that about seventy seconds be occupy in cover the distance regardless of we instruction we mention this fact to the fireman who have just commence to throw a fresh supply of coal on to the roar fire add a word of congratulation why that be nothing he reply laugh we be go up grade now wait until we get along the level or go down grade and we will show you a mile away inside of sixty we be not particularly glad to hear this already the locomotive be rock a good deal more than be quite pleasant to the uninitiated and the contrast between the hard seat and the pleasant one at we disposal in the pullman car be become more and more obvious just as we be wonder how it will be possible to preserve one 's equilibrium while go around a curve in the distance a cow stray sheepishly on to the track apparently some 200 yard ahead the engineer play a tune with he whistle and the cow proceed to trot down the track in front of we that singularly misnamed appendage the cow-catcher strike she amidship she be throw twenty foot in the air and all that be leave of she roll into the ditch by the side of the track for the moment we have forget george stephenson 's reply to the member of the british parliament who ask he what would happen in the event of a cow get in front of one of the train george be propose to run if necessary power could be obtain he reply which have long since become historical be that it would be very bad for the cow we remember this and agree with the pioneer railroad man when we see the unfortunate bovine turn a quadruple somersault and terminate she existence in less than a second but a moment previously we have be wonder what would happen when the inevitable collision take place the fireman observe that the occurrence have somewhat unnerved we and in a good-natured way assure we that a little thing of that kind do not amount to anything it be pretty bad he say when a bunch of cow get on a track and he remember once several year ago have a train stop out in the far west by a bunch of fat steer which block up the track but he add by way of parenthesis that be on a very poor road with a broken-down freight locomotive if we have have 87 with a full head of steam on we could have get through all right even if we have to overload the market with beef now the train rush around a curve in one direction and now in another the engineer never relax he vigilance and although he affect to make light of the responsibility and assure he somewhat nervous passenger that there be no danger of any kind he action do not bear out he word we be run special a little ahead of the mid-day express schedule and at every station there be wait passenger who herald we approach with delight and gathering together they package advance to the edge of the platform evidently suppose we be go to stop for they that we be to dash through the station at a speed of fifty or sixty mile a hour do not occur to they as a remote possibility and the look of astonishment which greet we as we rush past the platform be amusing finally we reach a long stretch of level track where the rail be lay as straight as a arrow for apparently several mile ahead now be you time if you want to take a good mile say the friendly fireman we take he advice and by aid of a stop watch especially borrow for the occasion we ascertain the fact that a mile be cover in fifty-two seconds the next mile be two seconds slower but the speed be more than maintain on the third mile reduce to ordinary speed figure this mean that we be make something like seventy mile a hour and do vastly better than be even anticipate we good work be however interfere with by the sudden application of the air brake and the shut off of steam as we approach a little station where the signal be against we a change in train order prove to be the cause of the hindrance to we progress and the engineer grumble somewhat as he find he will have to wait at a station some twenty mile further on provide a train come in the opposite direction be not on the side track before he get there the execution of this order involve a delay of five or ten minute but when we have the line clear again such good time be make that we accomplish we task and pull into the depot where locomotive be to be change on time to the second such be a ride on a locomotive in broad daylight at night of course the danger and risk be increase ten-fold the head-light pierce into the inky darkness and frequently exaggerate the size of object on and near the track the slightest misunderstanding the most trivial misinterpretation of a order the least negligence on the part of any one connect with or employ by the road may involve a wreck to the total destruction of the train and its passenger and the engineer feel every moment the full extent of he responsibility and the nature of the risk he run these responsibility be increase ten-fold by the great speed necessary in these day of haste and hurry few of we great-grandfather live to see steam apply as a motive power for locomotion most of we grandparent remember the first train be run in this country many of those who read these line can recollect when a philosopher place himself on record that a speed of twenty mile be impossible because even if machinery could be construct to stand the wear and tear the motion would be so rapid that the train man and passenger would succumb to apoplexy or some other terrible and fatal malady it be less than seventy year ago since the time that the so-called crank george stephenson venture modestly to assert that he little four-and-a-half-ton locomotive the rocket be actually capable of whirling along one to two light carriage at the astounding velocity of twelve mile a hour he be laugh to scorn by the highly intelligent british parliamentary committee engage in the investigation of he new method of land travel at the present day with regularly schedule train on many line thunder across wide continent tirelessly hour after hour at the rate of a mile a minute it be the deliberate judgment of the most conservative student of railway science that the ultimate limit of speed be still in the far distance and that 100 mile per hour will not be deem a extraordinary rate of travel by the time the first decade of the twentieth century shall have close it be true that railroad schedule seldom call for mile-a-minute travel but the engineer be call upon very frequently to go even faster the majority of people even the most intelligent among those who habitually travel obtain they conception of speed from the figure of the time-table forget that in nearly every instance considerable portion of the route must be traverse at much more than the average speed require to cover the total distance in the schedule time there be very few if any of the fast express train which do not on some part of each run reach or exceed a speed of a mile a minute yet by reason of superior roadway and well construct car the accelerate velocity be unnoticed while run at from sixty to seventy mile a hour the passenger calmly peruse he paper or book child play in the aisle and a glass brim full of water may be carry from one end to the other of the smoothly rolling coach without the spilling of a drop all the while the nerve of those in charge of the train be keep at high tension and oblivious as the passenger may be as to the danger actual and imaginary the risk incur be never for a moment lose sight of by the two man on the locomotive the man in the signal tower have a equal responsibility in some respects the burden upon he shoulder be even greater because he have the fate of perhaps a score of train in he hand with the life of hundred of passenger now and then when the wrong lever have be pull and a train be wreck we hear of a signal man sleep at he post but few of we stop to think how many thousand time a day the right lever be pull and how exceptional be the lapse from duty there be hero of the sea and there be hero of the battle-field but there be ten time as many hero who perform they deed of heroism on locomotive in switch and signal tower and in railroad yard it may not be fashionable to compare these saver of human life with those who destroy life on the battle-field but the valor and endurance of the former be at least as conspicuous and meritorious as the daring and suffering of the latter in scribner 's magazine there recently appear a most graphic description of a two-storied square signal tower at sumach junction this tower say the contributor to the magazine name have two row of window on all side and stand at the intersection of branch at this point the trunk line resolve itself from four track into two and here the gravel track which look as if it have be lay by a palsied contractor leave the main line and respectability behind and hobble out of sight behind the signal station with a intoxicate air beneath the tower to the right hand a double-tracked branch tap a fertile country beyond the sand hill and beneath the signal tower to the leave a single-tracked branch only a mile long bring south sumach one of those tiresome town that manufacture on water-power in touch with the middle man this petty branch -lrb- as if the case have be with petty people -rrb- make more trouble than all the rest of the line put together the signal man find this out so sumach junction have its place in the world and perhaps it be a more important one than that of many a complacent and opulent suburb the heart of this little community do not center as a thoughtless person might suppose in the church or the commandery or the grocery store or the school but in the signal tower it be the pulse of the section it be the life-blood of thousand of unconcerned traveler whose life and happiness depend on the intelligent vigilance of three man these three take turn up there in the tower lock and unlock switch and signal until one might expect they to faint for dizziness and confusion it be no uncommon thing in the signal tower when one of the three want a day off for the other two to double up on twelve-hour shift as long as the service be well perform the superintendent ask no question the story come to be write on account of the prolonged sickness of one of the three which compel the remain two to remain on duty until they eye be often dim and they brain power exhaust one of these finally work until nature overcome force of habit and reliability and a collision would have result but for the return consciousness of the overworked and thoroughly exhaust man while this hero of everyday life sleep or rather lose the power of think from extreme exhaustion the heavy snow storm which be make the night doubly dark have so block the machinery of the semaphore that it refuse to respond to the desperate effort of the weary signal man who hear a freight train approach and know that unless it be flag at once it would dash into the rear end of a passenger train which be stand in sight of the signal box with its locomotive disabled finally abandon the attempt to move the lever he rush out into the night and force he way through the snow in the direction of the approach train he be in time to avert the collision that appear inevitable but in he excitement overlook he own danger and be knock down and terribly injure by the train he flag within the last year the largest railroad station in the world in the yard of which there be a immense amount of traffic and from whose signal tower be work switch and signal innumerable have be open this immense station be situate at st loui it cover a area of about twelve acre and be larger than the two magnificent depot of philadelphium combine the second largest railroad station in the world be at frankfort germany the third in order of size be the reading station at philadelphium the four next largest be the pennsylvanium depot at philadelphium st pancra station in london england the pennsylvanium depot in jersey city and the grand central depot in new york city we have all hear of peculiar theft from time to time and the record of steal stove and other heavy article seem to show that few thing be sufficiently bulky to be absolutely secure from the peculator or kleptomaniac but to steal a train seem to the average mind a impossibility though under some condition it be even easy during the crusade of the commonwealer in 1894 more than one train be steal all that be require be a sufficient force to overcome the train crew at some small station or water tank and one or two man who know how to turn on steam and keep up a fire history tell of a much more remarkable case of train steal with event of startling bravery and hair-breadth escape connect with it we refer to the great railroad raid in georgium during the year 1862 when a handful of intrepid hero invade a hostile country deliberately steal a locomotive and come within a ace of get it safely deliver into the hand of they friend a monument surmount by the model of a locomotive be erect four or five year ago to commemorate a event without precedent and without imitation the story of the raid read like fiction but every incident we record be one of fact every danger narrate be run every difficulty be actually encounter and the ultimate failure come about exactly as state general grant and buell be at the time march towards corinth mississippus where a junction be to be make the confederate troops be concentrate at the same point and there be immediate trouble brewing general mitchell who be in command of one of buell 's division have advance as far as huntsville alabama and another detachment have get within thirty mile of chattanooga it be deem advisable and even necessary to cut off the railway communication between chattanooga and the east and south and jame j andrew be select by general buell for the task andrew pick out twenty-four spirit like unto himself who enter the enemy 's territory in ordinary southern dress and without any other arm than revolver they purpose be to capture a train burn the bridge on the northern part of the georgia state railroad and also on the east tennessee railroad where it approach the georgia state line thus completely isolate chattanooga which be then virtually ungarrisoned these man rendezvous at marietta georgium more than 200 mile from the point of departure have -lrb- with the exception of five who be capture en route or belated -rrb- make they way thither in small detachment of three and four the railroad at marietta be find to be crowd with train and many soldier be among the passenger after much reconnoiter it be determine to capture a train at big shanty a few mile north of marietta and purchase ticket for different station along the line in the direction of chattanooga the party which include two engineer reach big shanty while the conductor the engineer and most of the passenger be at breakfast the train be seize and be properly man after the uncoupling of the passenger car be start on its fierce race northward think of the exploit -- twenty man with a hostile army about they set out thus bravely on a long and difficult road crowd with enemy of course the theft of the train ` produce great consternation but the captor get away in safety stop frequently for the purpose of tear up the track cut telegraph wire etc andrews inform the people at the station that he be a agent of general beauregard run a impressed powder train through to corinth and generally this silence they doubt though some act suspiciously the first serious obstacle be meet at kingston thirty mile on the journey here the captor and they train be oblige to wait until three train south-bound pass by for a hour and five minute they remain in this most critical position sixteen man be shut up in the box-car personate beauregard 's ammunition just as the train get away from kingston two pursuer appear be captain w a fuller the conductor of the steal train and a officer who happen to be aboard of it at the time it be run out from big shanty find a hand-car they have man it and push forward until they have find a old locomotive standing with steam up on a side track which they immediately load with soldier and hurry forward with fly wheel in pursuit until kingston be reach where they take the engine and a car of one of the wait train and with forty armed confederate continue the journey it be now nip and tuck with one engine rush wildly after another to wreck the pursue train be the only tangible hope of the fugitive who stop again and again in order to loosen a rail have they be equip with proper tool they could have do this easily but as it be they simply lose precious time once they be almost overtake by the pursue engine and compel to set out again at a terrible speed at one point at adairsville they narrowly escape run into a express train fuller the conductor of the steal train and he companion be arrest by the obstruction of the track leave they engine behind and start on foot finally take possession of the express pass at adairsville and turn it back in pursuit when calhoun be pass the train be within sight of each other the track be believe to be clear to chattanooga and if only the pursue train could be wreck the end would be gain again the lack of tool hamper the daring little band they make desperate effort to break a rail but the pursuer be upon they before they have accomplish it and andrew hurry on he engine drop one car and then another which be pick up and push ahead by the pursuer to resaca station both engine be at the time at the highest rate of speed andrew at last break off the end of he last box car and drop crossty on the track as he run several time he almost lift a rail but each time the come of the confederate within rifle range compel he to desist a participant in the feat in he narrative of the affair publish in battle and leader of the civil war by the century company say : thus we speed on mile after mile in this fearful chase around curve and past station in seemingly endless perspective whenever we lose sight of the enemy beyond a curve we hope that some of we obstruction have be effective in throw he from the track and that we would see he no more but at each long reach backward the smoke be again see and the shrill whistle be like the scream of a bird of prey the time could not have be so very long for the terrible speed be rapidly devour the distance but with we nerve strain to the highest tension each minute seem a hour on several occasion the escape of the enemy from wreck seem little less than miraculous at one point a rail be place across the track so skillfully on the curve that it be not see till the train run upon it at full speed fuller say that they be terribly jolt and seem to bounce altogether from the track but light on the rail in safety some of the confederate wish to leave a train which be drive at such a reckless rate but they wish be not gratify at last when hope be well nigh exhaust a final attempt be make additional obstruction be throw on the track the side and end board of the last car be tear into shred all available fuel be pile upon it and blaze brand be bring back from the engine reach a long covered bridge the car which be now fairly ablaze be uncouple but before the bridge be fully on fire the pursuer come upon it push right into the smoke and run the burning car before they to the next side track so this expedient also fail with no car leave no fuel -- every scrap of it have be throw into the engine or upon the burning car -- and with no means of further obstruct the track the pursued party be reduce to desperation and as a last resource when within eighteen mile of chattanooga abandon the train and disperse to the wood each to save himself the good old locomotive now feeble and useless be leave accord to some account it be reverse in order to cause a collision with the on-coming train but accord to other the steam be exhaust and the engine just stop for want of power however this may have be the hunter of the train become at once hunter of the train stealer several of whom be capture the same day and all but two within a week two of those who have fail to connect with the party be also capture be in citizen 's dress within the enemy 's line the whole party be hold as spy a court-martial be form and the leader and seven out of the remain twenty-two be condemn and execute the other be never bring to trial of the remain fourteen eight succeed by a bold effort in make a escape from atlanta and ultimately reach the north the other six fail in this effort and remain prisoner until march 1863 when they be exchange all sort of story have be hear from time to time concern the supernatural side of railroading and the peculiar and apparently hide antic which locomotive occasionally be guilty of the follow story be well worth reproduce and may serve as a illustration of hundred of other it be tell by a engineer who work on the utah & northern railroad year ago before that road become part of the union pacific system the road be very rough and save for a long stretch of sage brush along the snake river north of pocatello it run in cañons over mountain and through heavy cut of clay which be often wash down on to the track by the spring rain it be as it be now a railroad rush with business it be the only line into butte city which have be strike a short time before and be then give promise of its future distinction as the greatest mining camp in the world the shipment of gold and bullion be very heavy and all the money for the bank in butte and helena be send over this road there be no town along the line the only stop be make at water-tank and such eating-house as the railroad company have build at long interval it be a rough hard run and be make especially lonely by the uninhabited stretch of sand and sage brush and the echo from the high granite wall of the narrow cañon it be a dangerous run besides the jame gang of train robber and the younger brother have be operate so successfully in missourus kansa and minnesota that other bandit have move west to attempt similar operation finally word come from the general office of well fargo & co that several train robber have be see in denver and might work they way north in the hope of either secure gold bullion from one of the down train from butte or money in exchange on a up train after detail these condition the engineer go on we get a new manager for the road a eastern man who have some high notion about conduct railroad travel on what he call a modern basis one of the first result of he management be a train which he call the ` mormon flyer ' run from butte to salt lake and schedule on the time card to run forty mile a hour we tell he he never could make that time on a rough mountain road where a train have to twist around cañon wall like a cow in the wood but he would not believe it he say that if a train could run forty-five mile a hour in the east it could run forty on that road the train be make up with a heavy ` hog ' engine a baggage car express car and two sleeper the first train down jump the track twice and the up train from salt lake be wreck and nearly throw into the snake river then the train run from four to six hour behind time and the people and the papers begin to jest about the ` mormon flyer ' and ask for a return of the old salisbury coach line the manager complain from time to time and say it be all the fault of the engineer say that we do not know we business and that he would get some man from the east who would make the ` mormon flyer ' fly on time well one evening in butte i have make up my train and be wait for order when the station-master hand two telegram to I one be from the manager at salt lake and read : ` you bring the ` flyer ' in on time to-morrow or take two week ' notice ' the other be from the well fargo & co agent at salt lake and read : ` no 3 -lrb- the north-bound ` flyer ' -rrb- hold up this afternoon near beaver cañon treasure box take and passenger rob ' the best description of the robber that could be have be give i show both telegram to the conductor who hold the train until he could get a dozen winchester from the town in the meantime i have put the fireman on and we put the finishing touch on the engine no 38 -- a big new machine with eight driver and in the pink of condition i tell my fireman that if we could not pull she through on time we would leave the train on the side of the road and thus teach a trick or two to the man who want to run a mountain road on eastern method i pull that train out of butte as though it have be shoot out of a gun and when we reach the flat below silver bar cañon i have she well set and fly like a scared wolf the train be shake from side to side like a ship at sea and we be skip past the foothill so fast that they look like fence post the cab shake so that my fireman could not stand to fill the fire-box so he dump the coal on the floor and get down on all fours and shovel it in no 38 seem to know that she be want to hold down my job and quiver like a race horse at the finish we make up the lose time in the first 100 mile and get to beaver cañon with a few minute to spare it be when i slow she up a bit in the cañon that i notice something the matter with she she drop she steady gait and begin to jerk and halt the fire-box clogged and the steam begin to drop and when i reach a fairly long piece of road in the dark and silent cañon she refuse to recover she spit out the steam and gurgle and cough and nothing that i could do would coax she along i tell the fireman that the old girl be quit we and that we might as well steer for new job he do he best to get she into action but she be bind to have she own way she keep lose speed every second and wheeze and puff like a freight engine on a mountain grade and move about as fast finally we come to a corner of a sharp turn almost at the mouth of the cañon and then no 38 give one loud defiant snort and stop ` she be do for now ' i say to the fireman and we get out of the cab with we lantern the cylinder-head be almost opposite a high rock at the turn well when we get there what do you think we see not a hundred yard ahead of the mouth of the cañon and as plain as day in the moonlight be a pile of rock on the track on either side be a bunch of half a dozen mask man with winchester rifle half raise ten rod further on be a dozen or more horse picket at a few cottonwood tree well you bet you life we could not get back to that train too quick it be not midnight and in two minute we have the crew and passenger out with enough gun and revolver to furnish the chinese army passenger in those day and in that country carry gun when the robber see that the train have stop they start forward to be meet by a rattle fire one of they drop but the rest run for they horse and get away now then you can not tell I that there be not something in a engine besides machinery conclude the engineer as he turn to the other member of the roundhouse club the man who say there be not be a fool be the answer from one and the other nod they head in approval chapter xvii a railroad to the cloud early history of manitou -- zebulon pike 's important discovery -- a young medicine man 's peril and final triumph -- a health resort in year go by -- the garden of the god -- the railroad up pike 's peak -- early failure and final success -- the most remarkable road in the world -- ride above the cloud manitou be a name which conjure up reminiscence of legend and history and it also remind the traveler of some of the most remarkable scene of the rocky mountain it have be say that the man who know how to appreciate natural grandeur and beauty can spend six month in the vicinity of manitou and then come back six month later to find undiscovered joy and treasure of beauty on every side the earliest reliable record concern this spot date back to the year 1806 when major zebulon pike discover what he call the great snow mountain this one of the loftiest of the rocky be now know as pike 's peak after its discoverer or at any rate after the man who first describe it for the benefit of the public it be on record that when major pike be cross colorado nearly a hundred year ago he see on the horizon what he regard as a misty cloud when he finally realize that there be a mountain in front of he he be at least a hundred mile away from it and there be two or three smaller hill to be cross before reach it after march for over a week the party reach the cheyenne mountain which they believe be the ascent of the great peak a theory which be soon disproved manitou be at the foot of this great mountain it be first describe at length by a english tourist who visit the manitou spring just half a century ago he travel alone and exhibit not only a immense amount of bravery but also unlimited judgment in evade the attack of wild beast and equally savage indian he description of the trip be full of great interest he describe how a band of mountain sheep advance to the edge of a overhang precipice to gaze upon the intruder and how a moment later a herd of black tail deer run in front of he with that contempt of danger see only in animal which have not come in contact with human being or modern weapon the bird he tell we be indifferent as to he presence they sing almost within arm 's reach and they rich plumage completely fascinate he he continue in he hunter 's paradise until he accidentally stumble upon a indian camp no indian be present but the smoulder camp-fire warn he that they be not far distant later he see two indian who be evidently arapahoes carry a deer between they and he know that the delightful hunting he have promise himself would not be forthcoming he be shortly afterwards capture in a prairie fire in which he be in great danger of be destroy nothing but the daring of he horse save he life he have hear from the friendly indian he have meet on he march that the great spirit have endow the water of the spring of manitou with miraculous healing power and he drink freely from the pure spring these spring make manitou a veritable mecca for indian of the west and southwest for many generation before the white man discover they pilgrimage be make across mountain and river of great magnitude and when a indian chief show sign of fail health and be not benefit by the machination of medicine man he be generally carry to manitou no matter how far the journey might be or how great be the obstacle to be overcome among the many story tell concern journey of week ' and even month ' duration one be exceptionally vivid and be evidently found on fact although superstition have surround the fact with so much color that they be hard to discover the story run that in day long go by a great chief who have conquer every tribe of whose existence he be aware fall sick and could not be benefit by the medicine man who be summon from every direction a number of these unfortunate physician be put to death as a penalty for they failure to restore health to the die chief finally there be very few medicine man remain in the vicinity those who have not be decapitate have prove they strong desire for further life by discreetly retire to part unknown one day tiding be bring the chief of a young medicine man in a neighbor tribe who have be overlook by the searcher but who have be phenomenally successful in woo back health and prolong life the tribe have long since be reduce to a condition of subjection and the say chief send a detachment of he brave with instruction to bring back the medicine man alive or dead the young man who have be expect a summons of this kind do not display the alarm anticipate even when he be tell that the old chief be certainly die and that it be impossible to help he in any way he maintain he stolid indifference and merely smile he carry with he a primitive vessel fill with some mysterious fluid upon the virtue of which he have implicit reliance when he reach the camp in which the sick chief lay he be summon immediately before the ail autocrat that individual state he symptom and then instead of ask as we be apt to ask we physician whether there be any medicine available for they he tell the young medicine man that if no improvement be effect within a few day there would be a funeral in the village and there would be one less medicine man in the vicinity this somewhat startling introduction do not disconcert the young man who pour out a liberal dose of the fluid he have bring with he and make the old chief drink it during the night he repeat the dose several time and on the follow day he keep up the treatment to every one 's astonishment the blood begin to flow again in the vein of the once invincible chief and those who have be pity the young medicine man begin to congratulate he on he triumph when after a few day the improvement become more marked the young doctor explain to the chief that the water he have give he have be bring from spring in the distant mountain and that if the chief desire to obtain another lease of life he must visit those spring and remain there for some week with the enthusiasm of renew vigor the old man promptly agree to the suggestion and in a few day arrangement be complete for a grand march over the rocky mountain to manitou tradition tell of the splendor of the march and of the way in which obstruction and hindrance be overcome finally the great mountain be see in the distance and a few day later a halt be make at the spring here the old chief be give a regular treatment and in a few day he be able to walk as vigorously as ever finally he return to he tribe not only renew in health but also renew in youth the record of he race state that he appearance be entirely change and that instead of look like a old man he feature be those of a youth in he twenty the chief live many year and finally die in battle the fame of he cure naturally spread abroad with great rapidity the old man be so well know that he become a walk testimonial of the merit of the spring and expedition without number be in consequence make to they white people as they come in contact with the indian of the far west hear of the spring from time to time and of this wonderful cure by many the story be confound with the legend concern the search of ponce de leon for the fountain of perpetual youth later however more thorough investigation be make and for more than a generation the truth as well as the legend of manitou have be generally know as a result a great watering place have spring up on the site of what be once a mysterious rest place of the indian and a retreat which it be dangerous to enter about 2000 people live here and during the season there be often 3000 or 4000 health-seeker in addition there be a grand avenue through the village eighty foot wide and well keep instead of be lay out in a mathematically straight line it follow the meanderings of the river fontaine-qui-bouille this feature give it a novel as well as a delightful appearance there be also a little park which possess feature not to be find in the recreation grounds of large city and there be a foot-path know as lover 's lane which be so romantic in its appearance that it be obviously well know the spring of manitou be naturally the most interesting feature of the place the shoshone spring in the center of the village be perhaps the best know the navajo spring be but a few yard distant and be considerably larger the manitou spring itself be on the other side of the river and be cover over with a very elegant spring-house the iron ute spring be in engelman 's cañon or glen and be regard by many as the best of all cave and cañons innumerable abound in every direction the manitou grand cañon be within two mile of the village it present the appearance of a natural mansion with room several hundred foot long and high the natural formation of the peculiar rock present bewildering combination of gallery column and fresco here be to be see the wonderful stalactite organ this accord to many be one of the wonder of the world it consist of a number of thin stalactite of vary power of reverberation and these play delightful tune or at least tone one of the great object of a trip to manitou be to gain a sight of the world-renowned but singularly name garden of the god the most direct road to reach it from the village be by way of manitou avenue and buena vista drive the latter be a well-traveled road which enter the avenue on the leave about a mile from the town as one advance towards colorado city the entrance to the garden be past balanced rock a immense boulder which stand directly to the left of the road poise on such a slender base that it suggest a irregular pyramid standing on its apex to the right as one pass this curious formation be a steep wall of stratified stone drape with clinging vine and overgrown with evergreen pause a moment on the brow of the elevation which be reach here one can look down into the valley below in which the garden lie to the west be the mountain to the east the plain the road which wind through the valley be a pleasant way one 's eye and mind be keep busy beholding and record the interesting view which here abound no one know why this valley be name the garden of the god there be nothing especially garden-like in its appearance but doubtless through apt alliteration 's artful aid the name have become greatly popular and it would be foolish to quarrel with it or make any attempt to change it there be however ample suggestion that titanic force have be at work here and it require but little imagination to ascribe these innumerable quaint sculpturing these magnificent architectural rock work these grand and impose temple not make with hand to the agency of the god here be to be find carve in the stone by those cunning instrument of the hand of nature -- the wind the rain the sunbeam and the frost -- curious often grotesque figure irresistibly suggestive of form of life here stand a statue of liberty lean on she shield with the conventional phrygian cap on she head there be a gigantic frog carve in sandstone yonder be a pilgrim staff in hand group of figure in curious attitude be to be see on every hand stone figure of the lion the seal and the elephant be all find indeed a lively imagination be not need to discover in this garden of the god a endless variety of imitative form of human being of bird and beast and reptile these figure possess a curious interest and attract wonder attention but the notable and majestic object here be the great gateway and the cathedral spire two lofty table of carnelian color sandstone set directly opposite each other about fifty foot apart and rise to a height of 330 foot form the portal of the far-famed gateway they rise from perfectly level ground and present a strangely impressive spectacle the cathedral spire be of a similar character to the gateway but they crest be sharply splintered into spire-like pinnacle the form assume by the rock here be remarkable indeed but they color be still more remarkable no sandstone of the east glow with such a splendor of carnelian hue the striking contrast form by these crimson crag outline against he deep blue sky and gilded by the high white light of the unclouded sun of colorado can not be describe one of the most visit prairie-dog town be close to the garden of the god it be interesting to the tourist and be generally visit on the return from the garden to manitou the town be situate on the road which pass through the great gateway to colorado city and may be see on a little plateau to the leave there be a great number of little hill of sand and gravel throw up by the dog around they burrow every fine day they can be see at work around they dwelling or sit on they haunch sun themselves and chatter gaily with some neighbor the burrow have a easy incline for about two foot then descend perpendicularly for five or six and after that branch off obliquely it be often as large as a foot in diameter it have be claim that the prairie-dog the owl and the rattlesnake live harmoniously together concern this mr william g smith the well-known naturalist say : impossible the burrow owl will generally be see where dog congregate and wherever the ground be undermine he snakeship be apt to be find but rest assure there be some lively ` scatter ' to get out of he way if he draw he slimy carcass into they burrow the dog have no desire to contest he right to it and give he all the room he want the dog at home be neat little fellow and allow no litter to accumulate around they door they go to bed early and never go around disturb they neighbor before daylight adjoining the garden be a region of ridge one ridge lead up to another and that to a third and so on this broken country cover with pine and cedar and clothe with bunch grass and grama make a capital tramping-ground especially in winter when rabbit mountain grouse and sage-hen be numerous enough to make it worth while to shoulder a gun the way to reach the ridge be to take the road to the garden of the god and follow it till the quarry road be reach pursue the latter up a gorge and then turn to the leave on a branch road which zigzag up the side of the gorge one soon find oneself on the top of a ridge the rule in ridge-climbing be never to cross a gully but always to keep on top all the ridge in this vicinity converge to the main ridge which overlook queen 's cañon this ridge bend to the northwest and in two or three mile join a still higher one which strange to say will be find to overlook the ute pass a thousand foot above the fontaine qui-bouille which flow in the bottom of the cañon below -- eyrie the site of a private residence -- a most interesting glen but not open to the public the character of the monolith in this cañon be more remarkable even than those of the garden of the god the major domo be a column of red sandstone rise to a height of 300 foot with a curious swell near the summit which far exceed in diameter the base of the shaft it look as though it might fall at any moment in obedience to the law of gravity and it be not exceed in this regard by the lean tower of pisa there be another glen of a similar character about two mile to the northwest which be know as blair athol it be a beautiful spot but lack water have never be use as a dwelling place it abound in wildly picturesque scenery and possess rock formation of strange shape and brilliant color there be grove of magnificent pine and the view of the distant plain stretch to the eastern horizon be unobstructed and of great interest we have already speak of the discovery of pike 's peak at the summit of this mountain 14147 foot above the sea level there be a little signal service station which can be reach by railway when the mountain be first discover several effort be make to reach the summit but without success major pike himself record he opinion that it would be impossible for any human be to ascend to the summit in these day of engineering progress there be however no such word as impossible several enthusiast talk as far back as twenty year ago of the possibility of a railroad to the very summit of the once inaccessible peak and fifteen year ago a survey be make with a view to build a railroad up the mountain by a series of curve and nook it be believe possible by the engineer that a railroad of standard gauge and equipment could be operate without special appliance and so strongly be this view hold that work be commence on the project eight mile of grade be complete but the project be then abandon in consequence of adverse report receive from expert send out for the purpose they statement be that no grade would be able to stand the force of the washout though strange to say all the grading that be accomplish stand to-day as firm as ever three or four year later another project destine to be more successful come into existence in 1889 grade commence and finally the work be complete and the summit of pike 's peak can now be reach by railroad the road itself be one of the most remarkable one in the united state and indeed in the world the road-bed be fifteen foot wide and there be not a single foot of trestle work in the entire construction there be three short bridge of iron and the precaution in the way of cross section of masonry be very elaborate the average ascent per mile be 1320 foot and the total ascent be nearly 8000 foot in the center of the track between the heavy steel rail be two cog rail of great strength these be provide to insure absolute safety for traveler one be for general use and the other as a kind of reserve special locomotive be use on the line these be construct by the baldwin company of philadelphium and include the latest patent in engine building when stand on a level track they appear to be at a slant of about 8 per cent when on a mountain road like that of pike 's peak they be approximately level there be three wheel on each side of the engine but these be not drive wheel be merely use to help sustain the weight the drive wheel operate on the cog rail in the center of the track the car also slope or slant like the engine no coupling be use so that one great element of danger be avoid the engine and the car have each independent cog brake of almost unlimited power when travel three or four mile a hour the little train with the locomotive push instead of pull it can be stop instantly when the speed reach eight or nine mile a hour stoppage can be effect in less than one revolution of a wheel not only be the ride up pike 's peak a wonderful sensation and a constant reminder of the triumph of engineering but it be also a source of continual delight to the lover of the beautiful and awful in nature about half way up the mountain be a most delightful little hillside retreat aptly name the half-way house it be a very comfortable establishment within rustic wall the pine and fir which surround it add a great charm to the outlook and the cool mountain breeze be charge with very please odor tourist frequently spend a night here and consider the sensation one of the most unique of a long trip a tourist describe a ride up pike 's peak by this singular railroad say : we be now far above timber line on all side can be see strange flower of lovely form and vary hue plant which attain considerable proportion on the plain be here reduce to they lowest form it be not a unusual thing to find a sunflower stalk in the prairie rise from a height of eight to ten foot here they grow like dandelion in the grass yet retain all they characteristic of form and color beyond this mountain meadow be great field of disintegrate granite broken cube of pink rock so vast in extent that they might well be the ruin of all the ancient city in the world far below flash the water of lake morain and beyond to the southward lie the seven lake another turn of the track to the northward and the shine rail stretch almost straight up what appear to be a inaccessible wall of almost peerless granite but no physical obstruction be formidable enough to stop the progress of this marvelous railway and pass the yawning abyss of the ` crater ' the line proceed direct to the summit the grade here be one of 25 per cent and timid passenger will not escape a thrill of fear as they gaze over the brink of this precipice although the danger be absolutely nothing at last the summit be reach and disembark the tourist can seek refreshment in the hotel which will cater to they want and then spend the time before the train return in enjoy the view and in ramble over the seventy acre of broken granite which form the summit the view from the peak once behold can never be forget the first sensation be that of complete isolation the silence be profound the cloud be below we and noiselessly break in foam billow against the face of the beetle cliff occasionally the silence be break by the deep roll of thunder from the depths beneath as though the voice of the creator be utter a stern edict of destruction the storm rise the mist envelop we there be a rush of wind a rattle of hail and we seek refuge in the hotel pause a moment before enter and hold up you hand you can feel the sharp tingle of the electric current as it escape from you finger-tip the storm be soon over and you can see the sunbeam gilding the upper surface of the white cloud that sway and swing below you half way down the mountain side and completely hide from view the world beneath the scenery shift like a draw curtain the cloud part and as from the height of another sphere we look forth upon the majesty of the mountain and the plain a ocean of inextricably entangled peak sweep into view forest dark and vast seem like vague shadow on distant mountain side a city be dwarf into the compass of a single block water course be mere thread of silver lay in graceful curve upon the green velvet mantle of the endless plain the red granite rock beneath we foot be star with tiny flower so minute that they be almost microscopic yet tint with the most delicate and tender color the majesty of greatness and the mystery of minuteness be here bring face to face what wonder of creation exist between these two extreme the thoughtful mind be awed by the contemplation of this scene and when the reflection come that these vast space be but grain of sand upon a infinite shore of creation and that there be world of beauty as far and vary between the tiny flower and the ultimate research of the microscope as those which exist on a ascend scale between the flower and the great globe itself the mind be overwhelm with wonder and admiration it be in vain that one strive to describe the scene only those who have behold it can realize its grandeur and magnificence lover of horseback ride regard the vicinity of pike 's peak and manitou almost in the light of a paradise a ride of a few mile in any direction lead to some specially attractive or historic spot crystal park be one of the popular resort of this kind it be enclose by high mountain on all side with a entrance which partake of the nature of a natural gateway in summer time this park be a profusion of bloom with wild flower and vine seldom see in any other part of the world in such splendor there be several elevated spot from which the surround country can be see for mile above the park be cameron 's cone this be a mountain of much interest although it can only be reach and climb by hardy athletic individual all around there be a profusion of cañons the red rock cañon be at one time a popular resort it take its name from the profusion of red sandstone on all side this natural wealth finally destroy the beauty of the cañon which be now a mass of stone quarry bear creek cañon have less of the practical and more of the picturesque about it a very charming brook run down the center and there be two or three small but very delightful fall the ridge road be a species of boulevard recently construct for the use of visitor to manitou at place the grade be so abrupt that timid lady do not care to drive down it otherwise it be a very please thoroughfare with fresh surprise and delight await the tourist every time he pass along it the view in every direction be most charming and extensive pike 's peak can be see to great advantage and in the forty mile of the road many different feature of this mountain can be observe the road also lead to william 's cañon cheyenne mountain although dwarf somewhat by pike 's peak be deserving of notice it be very massive in its form and its side be almost cover by cañons brooklet and waterfall two vast gorge know as the north and south cañons be especially ask for by visitor the wall of these gorge be of rich granite and stand perpendicular on each side a thousand foot high the effect be very wonderful in a variety of way in the south cañon be the celebrated seven fall which be immortalize by mr helen hunt jackson the well-known poetess whose remains be inter on cheyenne mountain by she own request the seven lake must also be see by all visitor to the manitou region and there be so many more special feature to be examine and treasure to be discover that no matter how long one stay in the neighborhood a pang of regret be feel when the visit be bring to a termination there be other spot in america where more awful scene can be encounter there be few however where the combination be so delightful or the general view so attractive and vary chapter xviii into the bowels of the earth the grand cañon of the colorado -- niagara outdo -- the course of the colorado river -- a survey party through the cañon -- experience of a terrible night -- wonderful contrast of color in the massive rock -- a natural wall a thousand foot high -- hieroglyphic which have never be decipher -- relic of a superior race -- conjecture as to the origin of the ancient bearded white man we have already speak of niagara as one of the wonder of the world and one of the most sought-after beauty spot of america we will now devote a few page to a description of a far more remarkable natural wonder and to a phenomenon which be it situate nearer the center of population would have long since outclass even niagara as a tourist 's mecca reference be make to the grand cañon of the colorado few people have the slightest conception of the magnitude or awfulness of this cañon it be clearly one of the wonder of the world and its vastness be such that to explore it from end to end be a work of the greatest possible difficulty even in area the cañon be extraordinary it be large enough to contain more than one old world country it be long enough to stretch across some of the largest state in the union some of the smaller new england state would be absolutely swallow up in the yawning abyss could they by any means be remove to it bodily a express train run at a high rate of speed without a single stop and on a first-class road-bed could hardly get from one end of the cañon to the other in less than five hour and a ordinary train with the usual percentage of stoppage would about make the distance between morning and evening reduce to the record of cold figure the grand cañon be make up of a series of chasm measure about 220 mile in length as much as 12 mile in width and frequently as much as 7000 foot in depth this marvelous feature of american scenery be very fully describe in we own country publish by the national publishing company in describe the cañon that profusely illustrate work say that the figure quote do not readily strike a responsive chord in the human mind for the simple reason that they involve something utterly different from anything that more than 99 per cent of the inhabitant of the world have ever see the man who gaze upon niagara for the first time be astounded at the depth of the gorge as well as at the force of the water and he who have see niagara can appreciate somewhat the marvel of the grand cañon when he bear in mind that the great wonder of the western world be for mile at a stretch more than fifty time as deep as the fall and the gorge generally admit to be the most awful scenic grandeur within reach of the ordinary traveler nor be this all visitor to paris who have enjoy a bird 's - eye view of the gay city from the summit of eifel tower have feel terribly impress with its immense altitude and have be astounded at the effect on the appearance of living and inanimate object so far below they how many of the american who have be thus impress by french enterprise have realize that in they own country there be a natural gorge at point of which the distance between the summit and the base be more than five time as great as the height of the eifel tower the colorado river rise in the rocky mountain cross the territory of utah and arizona and then run between the last name and the state of californium finally empty its water into the gulf bear the name of the golden state for more than two hundred mile of its course it run through the gorge know as the grand cañon and hence it have be a very difficult river to explore during the sixteenth century some of the spanish explorer to whom this country be indebted so much for early record and description cross the then undeveloped desert of the southwest and discover the grand cañon many of the report they make of the wonder of the new world read so much like fairy tale and seem so obviously exaggerate that little credence be give to they hence it be that they estimate concern the gorge through which the rio colorado grande flow be treat as fable and laugh at rather than believe major powell than whom few man have do more to enlighten the world concern the wonder of the far west describe the cañon very aptly and speak in a most attractive manner of the countless cañons and cavern whirlpool and eddy brooklet and river ford and waterfall that abound on every side in he first extended description of the cañon he state that every river enter it have cut another cañon every lateral creek have also cut another cañon every brook run in a cañon every rill bear of a shower and live only in the shower have cut for itself a cañon so that the whole upper portion of the basin of the colorado be traverse by a labyrinth of these deep gorge about the basin be mountain within the basin be cañon gorge the stretch of land from brink to brink be of naked rock or of drift sand with here and there line of volcanic cone and of black scorium and ash scatter about of late year thousand of people have be attract to this great cañon although but very few have succeed in explore its entire length few indeed have be able to pass along the balcony of the cañon and to gaze up at the countless wonder of nature pile one above the other apparently up to the very region of the cloud the common notion of a cañon as captain c e dutton tell we be that of a deep narrow gash in the earth with nearly vertical wall like a great and neatly cut trench there be hundred of chasm in the plateau country which answer very well to this notion it be however unfortunate that the stupendous passway for the colorado river through the kaibab be ever call a cañon for the name identify it with the baser conception at place the distance across the chasm to the nearest point on the summit of the opposite wall be about seven mile a more correct statement of the general width would be from eleven to twelve mile it be hence somewhat unfortunate that there be a prevalent idea in some way that a essential part of the grandeur of the grand cañon be the narrowness of its defile as major powell express it there be rather a series of cañons than one huge one wherever the river have cut its way through the sandstone marble and granite of the kaibab mountain beautiful and awe-inspiring picture be see while above there be dome and peak some of red sandstone and some of snowy whiteness cataract cañon alone be forty-one mile long and have seventy-five cataract and rapid of which fifty-seven be within a space of nineteen mile a journey along the bank of a river with a waterfall every twenty foot on the average be no joke and only the hardiest man have be able to accomplish it in the spring of 1889 the survey party of a project railroad from grand junction to the gulf of californium make this journey and from its publish description more actual information can be glean concern the cañon itself than almost any mere verbal description the surveyor have to carry with they on they back for a great portion of the way the limited supplies of food they take with they because it be frequently impossible to get the boat along at all when the boat be use several be upset and everything be uncertainty as to the bill of fare that would be present at the next meal even if there be to be a meal at all mr frank m brown president of the railroad company lose he life in one of the whirlpool he be in a boat a little ahead of the other and seem to be cheerful and hopeful he shout to he comrade in the rear to come on with they boat and that he be all right a moment later he friend be astonish to see the boat go and they leader swim around and around in a whirlpool try hard to reach smooth water he be a good swimmer and a brave man but he effort be futile and finally he sink the party wait and watch for hour but be finally compel to recognize the fact that they friend and leader be go forever it be determine almost immediately to beat a retreat while the party be hunting for a side cañon lead northward through which they could make they exit it become evident that a storm be brew rain commence to fall in a steady shower and to increase in quantity the surveyor have no dry clothing beyond what they stand up in and there be no shelter of any kind at hand they be near vassey 's paradise in the deepest part of the cañon they have yet reach a storm in such a location have its awfulness intensify beyond measure and the frightened man look in every direction for shelter finally about forty foot up the side of the marble cliff the open to a small cavern be see into this mr r b stanton one of the party climb there be not room enough for he body at full length but he crawl in as best he could curl himself up and try to sleep a terrible night follow at about midnight he be awaken by a terrific peal of thunder which re-echo and reverberate through the cañon in a most magnificently awful manner he have be catch in storm in mountain region and deep valley before but he have never feel so terribly alone or so superstitiously alarm as on this occasion every now and then a vivid flash of lightning would light up the dark recess of the gorge casting ghastly shadow upon the cliff hill side ravine and river then again there would be the darkness which as milton put it could be feel and the feeling of solitude be almost intolerable the river in the meantime have swollen into a torrent by the drenching rain which have convert every creek into a river and every feeder of the colorado into a magnificent if rage river itself the noise cause by the excited river as it leap over the massive rock along its bed vie with the thunder and the echo seem to extend hundred of mile in every direction what affect the stranded traveler the most be the noise overhead the reverberation induce a feeling of alarm that huge mass of rock be be displace from they lofty eminence thousand of foot above he head and be rush down upon he the night be pass finally and when the storm have spend itself the survivor of the party succeed in get out of the cañon and reach a plateau 2500 foot above they then take a brief rest but with that disregard for danger which be characteristic of the true american they at once organize another expedition and a few month later resume the task so tragically interrupted and mar with such a sad fatality the trip through glen cañon be like a pleasure trip on a smooth river in autumn with beautiful wild flower and fern at every camp at lee 's ferry they eat they christmas dinner with the table decorate with wild flower pick that day on December 28th they start to traverse once more that portion of marble cañon make tragic by the fatality of the summer before on the next Tuesday write mr stanton we reach the spot where president brown lose he life what a change in the water what be then a roar torrent now with the water some nine foot lower seem from the shore like the gentle ripple upon the quiet lake we find however in go through it with we boat there be the same swift current the same huge eddy and between they the same whirlpool with its ever-changing circle marble cañon seem destine to give we trouble on January 1st we photographer mr nim fall from a bench of the cliff some twenty-two foot on to the sand beach below receive a severe jar and break one of he leg just above the ankle have plenty of bandage and medicine we make nim as comfortable as possible till the next day when we load one of the boat to make he a level bed and construct a stretcher of two oar and a piece of canvas put he on board and float down river a couple of mile -- run two small rapid -- to a side cañon which lead out to the lee 's ferry road the next day after discover a way out of the deep ravine one of the party tramp thirty-five mile back to lee 's ferry where a wagon be obtain for the injured surveyor eight of the strongest man of the party then undertake the task of carry the injured man a distance of four mile and up a hill 1700 foot high it be indicative of the extraordinary formation of the grand cañon that the last half mile be a angle of 45 degree up a loose rock slide the stretcher have to be attach to rope and gently lift over perpendicular cliff from ten to twenty foot high the dangerous and tedious journey be at last accomplished and the trip continue finally the unexplored portion of the cañon be reach for thirty mile down marble cañon to the little colorado river the most beautiful scenery be encounter at point retreat the solid marble wall stand perpendicularly 300 foot high from the river edge behind these wall the sandstone lie in bench and slope to a aggregate height of 2500 foot above the narrow ravine of marble the color be mostly rich gray although the presence of mineral have in place impart so many tint that quite a rainbow appearance be present cave and cavern relieve the monotony of the solid wall here and there a most delightful grotto be see while the action of the water rush down the cliff side have leave little natural bridge in many place countless fountain of pure sparkling water adorn the smooth rock and here and there be little oasis of fern and flower which seem strangely out of place so far down into the very bowels of the earth below point hausbrough name in honor of peter m hausbrough who be drown during the first explore trip the cañon widen rapidly the marble bench be replace by stratum of limestone and between the river and the rock green field and grove of tree become common the view from the river look across this verdure with sandstone rock for the immediate background and snow-capped mountain in the distance be extraordinary in its magnificence and combination between the grand junction of the little colorado with the main cañon and the granite gorge there be about eight hundred mile of a very different section evidence of volcanic action abound rock and boulder seem to have be blow out of position and mix up all in a heap the rock be largely charge with mineral and as a result almost every know color be represent in the most remarkable purity the river run through a wide valley with the top wall several mile apart the granite gorge itself be entirely different here the great wall of granite start from the water 's edge the first few foot be usually vertical then for a thousand foot or more the rise be at a angle of about 45 degree while occasionally mass of rock stand out prominently and overhang the river above the granite come a mass of dark color sandstone with a vertical front in many place it be perfectly black the color be intensify by the brightness of the red below if a artist be to paint a cliff deep red with a jet black border along the top old world critic would be apt to declare he insane yet this be really the coloring of this section of the most wonderful cañon in the entire world although the cañon at this point vary in width at the top from six to twelve mile the river really run through a narrow gorge and partake very much of the nature of a long rapid or cataract for ten mile the fall average twenty-one foot per mile sufficient to make the current very dangerous even at low water and something terrible after heavy rain or much snow melting in one place the fall be eighty foot in about five hundred yard and here of course navigation be practically out of the question the explorer to whom we have refer be compel to proceed with great deliberation at this point occasionally they run the rapid but very often they be compel to lower they boat by means of line and even to lift they over exceptionally dangerous rock at the worst point of all one of the boat while be lower by line be strike by a eddy and run tightly in between two rock it become necessary for man to go into the water to liberate the boat with line tie securely to they body some of the boldest of the explorer venture into the water and try to loosen the boat or at least to secure the invaluable provision and blanket on board it be January and the water be so intensely cold that no man could endure it more than a few minute at a time so that the process be a long and tedious one finally the boat be get out but it take five day to repair it and even then it be a very poor means of navigation a few day later a still more powerful and dangerous rapid be encounter some idea of the force of the water can be glean from the precaution that be necessary a line 250 foot long be string out ahead and the boat be swing into the stream it go through apparently the most dangerous place without much difficulty the line be loosen slowly and the boat hold under control but when it reach the main eddy it begin to get contrary and finally swing round and seem to have strike a back current several hour ' work get the boat to shore but the next one be dash into a thousand piece while cross over some of the sharp-pointed rock the forty mile of the granite gorge be replete with wonder the strangely misnamed section the bright angel creek be absolutely dark even at midday it have be describe as a sentinel of the great cañon and few people have dare attempt to pass through it farther down the granite wall become less steep and black granite relieve the monotony of color here and there at side cañons and sudden bend the vast rear view of the gorge with its sandstone cliff be bring into view these be bench back several mile from the river with huge mountain here and there intervene above the dark sandstone there be flatten slope of yellow brown red green and white rock rich in mineral through these the force of water for age have cut narrow trench-like waterfall most remarkable in appearance and attractive in they variety of color it be difficult to imagine a upright wall a thousand foot high with red the predominate color and with brighter hue near the summit bench of marble with tuft of glass and bush appear here and there while occasionally there be a little tract of faultless green above all this there be something like two thousand foot of a lighter color sandstone this be beautify by spiral turret and dome and wherever the slope be gradual enough pine and cedar tree abound in large number behind all this there be the background of snow on the summit of the mountain and when a unexpected view can be obtain from the river below there be so great a profusion of color that the eye rebel and a feeling not unlike headache be produce further wonder be reveal every few thousand foot at the mouth of the next creek the coloring be different the stratum dip visibly and the marble which have hitherto be expose to view be now beneath the surface the sandstone form the river boundary and rise at a sharp angle from the water 's edge the river itself be narrow in consequence but the great valley be even wider at the top the wall vary in height from 2000 to 8000 foot and in rainy season the water rush down the side in great profusion thousand of little rivulet join the main stream and add greatly to the volume of water sometimes the river will rise four or five foot in a single night upset all calculation and make navigation risky in the extreme when by chance the sun be able to penetrate into the depths of this cañon the kaleidoscopic effect be exquisite and cause the most indifferent to pause and wonder the discovery of a extinct volcano explain a great deal of the wonder of the great cañon the volcano be examine by thousand of tourist this be one of the spot to reach which scientist be willing to incur countless hardship and risk no one can tell when the volcano be active but from the nature of the crater it be perfectly clear that at one time it belch forth volume of lava which have a marked effect on the formation of the rock and the lay of the land of the surrounding country past the volcano for many mile the bright color already refer to be supplant by more sombre hue occasionally there be a little scarlet and as a rule the sandstone be cover with the mysterious substance bring out of the bowels of the earth by the now silent but once magnificently awful mountain the explore party to which we have refer go through 600 mile of cañons and find that no two mile be really alike finally after three month of hardship they emerge into a open country and become almost frantic with joy never do country seem so beautiful or verdure so attractive and the panorama of beauty which be present to they view cause they to shout with delight and to offer up cry of thankfulness for they ultimate deliverance from a series of hardship and danger which at one time seem almost insurmountable the region also abound with archaeological curiosity and remarkable hieroglyphic many of these be find in close proximity to the grand cañon of the colorado and on the cliff in which the far-famed cliff dweller of old take up they abode hieroglyphic mark upon rock or other lasting substance have be use by nearly all ancient race to perpetuate the history of certain event among they especially true be this of the ancient people who live in arizona the remarkable picture rock and boulder with strange symbol upon they leave by the prehistoric race of arizona have be the cause of much discussion among those who have see they as to who these ancient hieroglyphic maker be these rock record may be divide into three different kind which it be think be make by two different race the first or very ancient race leave record on rock in some instance of symbol only and in other instance of picture and symbol combine the later race which come after the first race have vanish make only crude representation of animal bird or reptile not use symbol or combination of line the age of the most ancient pictograph and hieroglyphic can only be conjecture but all give certain indication that they be many century old and the difference between the work of the ancient and the later race lead the observer to believe that the older hieroglyphic be make by a people far superior to those who come after they and who leave no record in symbol as we have say with the exception of crude representation of animal and reptile in many instance it be quite evident that the same rock or cliff have be use by the two different race to put they marking upon the later or inferior race often make they pictograph over or across the hieroglyphic writings of the first race of the superiority of the first people who leave they writings on the rock and boulder find in the ancient mound ruin and grave there can be no doubt for they writings show order and a well define design in symbol which be evidently intend to convey they history to other and it be quite probable that those who make the great mound house and canal be the author of these writings it may be truthfully assert that the cliff dweller of the rock house in the deep cañons of the mountain be of the same race as the mound builder of the valley for exactly the same class of hieroglyphic find on boulder from the ancient ruin of the valley be find on the rock near the house of the cliff dweller if this superior race be so distinctive from all other ancient race of arizona -- in they work be so far advance as to solve what would be call even at the present day difficult engineering problem to dig great canal many mile in length the remains of which can be see at the present time and to bring they to such perfection for irrigate purpose to build such great house and to live in city -- may it not have be as many who have study this subject now contend that this superior race be white people instead of a copper color race as have generally be suppose the hieroglyphic of the more ancient race be often find on sheltered rock on the slope of the mountain lead up from the valley generally protect from the element by overhang cliff the dry climate have keep the writings from wear away and be in most instance pick into rock which have a black glistening surface but of a lighter color underneath the contrast be very noticeable and when in prominent place these hieroglyphic can be see several hundred foot away as no metal tool have ever be find in the mound ruin or cliff dwelling the hieroglyphic be probably pick into the rock with a sharp-pointed stone much harder than the rock upon which the work be do it be a singular fact that although iron copper gold and silver abound in the mountain in arizona no tool utensil or ornament of these metal be find in the mound or ruin yet furnace-like structure of ancient origin have be find which appear to have be use for reduce ore and in and around which can be find great quantity of a unknown kind of slag in many instance the hieroglyphic boulder have be find in great heap of several hundred in number as if many different person have contribute a piece of this strange write to the collection these etched boulder have be find bury in the ground with olla contain the char bone of human being and could the writings on the boulder be decipher we would undoubtedly learn of the virtue of the prehistoric deceased just as we do of a person who die in the present day when we read the epitaph on a tombstone of the one who be bury beneath in open some of the mound the investigator find they be make of the fall wall of great adobe building and as he dig deeper he find room of various dimension and which in many instance have cement wall and floor in one instance there be find the impression of a baby 's foot and hand make presumably as the child have crawl over the newly lay soft cement in another mound the cemented wall of a room be find cover with hieroglyphic and rude drawing which be think to represent stellar constellation to a certain extent some of the picture rock tell we of part of the daily life of this ancient race for in a number of instance the picture pick into the rock although rudely form be self-explanatory and the ancient artist tell plainly by he work what be mean on the edge of a little valley in the superstition mountain there be find a great rock on which have be etch many small animal apparently represent sheep and at one side be the figure of a man as if watch they it may be the ancient herder himself sit in the shadow of the great rock while he sheep be grazing in the valley below have pass away the time in make this rock picture the hardy wild sheep still find in the mountain of arizona may be the remnant of great band formerly domesticate by these people the skeleton of the prehistoric man dig from beneath the stalagmite in the cave of mentone france and which set all the scientific man of the world talk and think give proof of no greater age than many of the skeleton relic or bone of some of these ancient mound and canal builder a incident illustrate the great antiquity of prehistoric man in arizona be the following : in digging a well on the desert north of phoenix at the depth of 115 foot from the surface a stone mortar such as the ancient use be find standing upright and in it be find a stone pestle show the mortar have not be carry there by any underground current of water and that it have not be disturb from the position in which its ancient owner have leave it with the pestle in it there be only one way to account for this mortar and pestle they have originally be leave on what be at that time the surface of the ground and the slow wash from the mountain have gradually during unknown age raise the surface for mile on every side to the extent of 115 foot the question be often ask will this hieroglyphic writing ever be decipher the author of the most ancient hieroglyphic writings or marking seem to have have well-defined form or mark which be in common use for this class of write be it not most reasonable that a race so far advance in other way would have perfect a method of transmit by mark of some kind they record to those who might come after they again where so much system be show in the use of symbol it may be presume that the same mark wherever use in the same position carry with it a fix meaning alike at all time have such a settled system of mark there must be a key to the thought conceal in write and quite likely the key for decipher these hieroglyphic will sometime be find on one of the yet undiscovered hieroglyphic rock in the high mountain or in the mound not yet examine on the other hand there can be no key to the inferior class of pictograph make by the people who come after the mound canal and city builder have disappear for the crudely marked form of reptile animal or similar thing have a meaning if any vary with each individual maker who be these people who form a great nation here in the obscurity of the remote past be they the ancient phoenician who be not only a maritime but a colonize nation and who in they well-manned ship might have find they way to the southern coast of america age since and from thence journey north or be they some of the follower of votan or zamna who have wander north and found a colony of the aztec whoever these people be and whichever way they come from the evidence of the great work they leave behind they give ample proof that they be superior and different from other race around they and these particular people may have be the bearded white man whom the indian have tradition of when coronado 's follower first come through the gilum and salt river valley in 1526 chapter xix we great waterway importance of river to commerce a generation ago -- the ideal river man -- the great mississippus river and its importance to we native land -- the treacherous missourus -- a first mate who find a cook 's disguise very convenient -- how a second mate get over the inconvenience of temporary financial embarrassment during the last quarter of the century in which we write the figure 1 and 8 in every date line the steam railroad have to a very large extent put out of joint the nose of the steamboat just as at the present time we be threaten with so complete a revolution in travel and motive power as to warrant a prediction that long before another quarter of a century have pass electricity will take the place of steam almost entirely but even if this be so old acquaintance should not be forget and every citizen of the united state should feel that the prosperity of the country be due in very large measure to the country 's magnificent waterway and to the enterprise of the man who equip river fleet and operate they with vary degree of profit the true river man be not so conspicuous as he be in the day when st loui cincinnatus memphi and other important railroad center of to-day be exclusively river town the river man be a king in those day the captain walk the street with as much dignity as he walk he own deck and he be point to by landsman as a person of dignity and repute the mate be a great man in the estimation of all who know he and of a good many who do not know he rule he crew with a rod of iron and accustom to be obey with considerable and commendable promptness he adopt a tone of voice in general conversation considerably louder than the average and every one acquire a habit of make way for he the levee in a river town before the railroad come snort and puff across country and interfere with the monopoly so long enjoy by the steamboat be a scene of continuous turmoil and activity sometimes now one see on a levee a great deal of hurry and noise but the busiest scene of to-day sink into insignificance compare with those which be rapidly become little more than a indistinct memory the immense cargo of freight of every description would be range along the river front and little flag could be see in every direction these flag be not perhaps exactly evidence of the activity of the schoolmaster or of the prevalence of superior education they be rather reminder of the fact that a great majority of the rank and file of river worker could read little and write less to tell a color roustabout twenty or thirty year ago to fetch a certain cargo label with the name of a particular boat or consignee would have be to draw from the individual address a genuine old-time plantation grin with some caustic observation about lack of school facility in the day when the roustabout ought to have be study the three r but be not it be however comparatively easy to locate a cargo by means of a flag and identification seldom fail as the flag could be vary in color shape and size so as to provide distinction as well as difference those who remember the busy levee scene with the flag adornment refer to will agree that there be something picturesque as well as noisy about the old river day and will be incline to regret and almost deplore the fact that thing be not from a river man 's standpoint what they be in no country in the world have railroad building be carry on with so much enterprise as in we native land prior to the enormous expenditure on track building and railroad equipment advantage have to be take of the extraordinary opportunity for navigation and transportation afford by the great waterway of the country as railroad be naturally build in the east before the west the value of we middle and western waterway be naturally best understand by the average reader because they continue to play a indispensable part in the transaction of business of every character until quite a recent period the eastern river be less magnificent in extent and volume than those of the west though many of they be picturesque and attractive in the extreme the hudson have often be speak of as the thame of america not because there be any resemblance between the length of the two river upon which be situate the two greatest city of modern time the simile be the result rather of the immense number of costly family residence and summer resort build along the bank of both river in another chapter we say something of a trip down the picturesque hudson whose bank be line with historic landmark and point of press interest we give a illustration of a pleasure boat on the hudson which remind one of many delightful river trip take at various period and also of the event of national importance which center around the river that be crowded year after year with pleasure-seeker from the overcrowded metropolis at its mouth the mississippus river be the largest and grandest in north america a few mile above st loui it be join by the missourus river and if the distance from the source of the latter to the gulf of mexico be calculate the longest river in the world be find at a considerable distance from the source of the father of water be the fall of st anthony discover more than two hundred year ago by enterprising pioneer who think they have discover the headwater of the great river the scenery of the river at the fall and beyond they be very attractive and in many case so beautiful as to be beyond verbal description in many other part of the river the scenery be grand though occasionally there be long stretch of flat country which be incline to become monotonous and barren of poetic thought of the entire river mr l u reavi write enthusiastically : the more we consider the subject say this author the more we be compel to admit that the mississippus be a wonderful river and that no man can compute its importance to the american people what the nile be to egypt what the great euphrate be to ancient assyrium what the danube be to europe what the gange be to india what the amazon be to brazil -- all this and even more than this the mississippus river be to the north american continent in a earlier age man would have worship the mississippus but in this age we can do better we can improve it to this all we effort should be direct and we should continually bear in mind that no other improvement ancient or modern relate to the interest of commerce have ever command the attention of man equal in importance to that of the mississippus river so as to control its water and afford ample and free navigation from st paul to the gulf of mexico during the last few year the agitation in favor of river improvement have assume very definite shape and from time to time large appropriation have be make by congress for the purpose of keep the river navigable at all period of the year as long ago as 1873 the chairman of the senate committee on transportation route censure the government for neglect to thoroughly improve the big river a quarter of a century have nearly elapse since then and in the opinion of many competent river man there be still room for much improvement not only in the river but in the method of arrangement for design and carry out the improvement the missourus river the great tributary to the mississippus have often be describe as one of the most treacherous and aggressive river in the universe it seem to be actuate by a spirit of unrest and a desire for change so much so that the center of the river bed frequently move to the right or leave so rapidly as to wipe out of existence prosperous farm and home sometimes this erratic procedure threaten the very existence of city and bridge and ten of thousand of dollar have be spend from time to time in day and night work to check the aggression of the stream and to compel it to confine itself to its proper limit the mississippus proper bring down from the lake to its junction with the missourus river clear water in which the reflection be so vivid that the verdure on the bank give it quite a green appearance the missourus on the other hand be muddy and turbulent bring with it even at low water a large quantity of sand and sediment at high water it bring with it tree and anything else that happen to come within its reach but at all period of the year its water be more or less muddy at the junction of the two river the difference in color of the water be very apparent and strange to say there be not a complete intermingling until several mile have be cover by the current under ordinary condition the western portion of the current be very much darker in shade than the eastern even twenty mile from what be generally speak of as the mouth of the missourus the muddy missourus rise in the rocky mountain it be really form by the junction of three river -- the jefferson the gallatin and the madison by a strange incongruity the headwater of the missourus be within a mile of those of the columbium although the two river run in opposite direction the columbium enter the pacific ocean and the missourus find a inlet to the gulf of mexico via the mississippus at a distance of 441 mile from the extreme point of the navigation of the head branch of the missourus be what be denominate as the gate of the rocky mountain which present a exceedingly grand and picturesque appearance for a distance of about six mile the rock rise perpendicularly from the margin of the river to the height of 1200 foot the river itself be compress to the breadth of 150 yard and for the first three mile there be but one spot and that only of a few yard on which a man can stand between the water and the perpendicular ascent of the mountain at a distance of 110 mile below this point and 551 mile from the source be the great fall nearly 2600 mile from the egress of the missourus into the mississippus river at this place the river descend by a succession of rapid and fall a distance of 351 foot in sixteen and one-half mile the lower and greater fall have a perpendicular pitch of 98 foot the second of 19 the third of 47 and the fourth of 26 foot between and below these fall there be continuous rapid of from 3 to 18 foot descent the fall next to those of niagara be the grandest on the continent below the great fall there be no substantial obstruction to navigation except that during the midsummer and fall month after the July rise there be frequently insufficient water for steamboat this result from the fact that although the missourus river drain a large area of country and receive many tributary some of which be navigable for many hundred of mile it pass for a great portion of its course through a dry and open country where the process of evaporation be very rapid the channel be render intricate by the great number of island and sandbar and in many case it be make exceptionally hazardous by reason of countless snag volume have be write concern the adventure of pioneer and gold hunter who go up the missourus in advance of railroad and even civilization in order to trade with the indian or to search for yellow metal in the great hill in the unexplored country where so much in the way of easily acquire wealth be look for some of the wealthiest man in the west to-day have a vivid recollection of the danger they encounter on the voyage up this river and of the enemy they have to either meet or avoid sometimes hostile indian would attack a boat amid-stream from both side of the river and when a attempt be make to bring gold or costly merchandise down the river daring attack be often make by white robber whose ferocity and murderous design be quite as conspicuous as those of the aboriginal tribe many a murder be commit and the seed be sow for countless mystery and unexplained disappearance the ohio river be another of the great tributary of the mississippus in year go by the importance of this waterway be enormous the mississippus itself run through minnesota wisconsin illinoi iowa missourus arkansa kentucky tennessee mississippus and louisiana the ohio tap and drain a much older country than many of these state and hence its importance in the day when cincinnatus be the great gateway of the west and a manufacture city of first importance the ohio be a great river for more than a thousand mile and connect pittsburg with cairo run through such important town as louisville and cincinnatus on this river some of the most interesting event in river history have be enact in the past many a tragedy and many a comedy be include in its annals and even to-day although parallel cross and recross by railroad it be a most important highway of commerce the tennessee river be a tributary of the ohio which it enter so near the mississippus as to have a very close connection with that great river enter the ohio at paducah kentucky the tennessee be one of the largest and most important river east of the mississippus it be form by the union of two river which rise in the allegheny mountain and unite at kingston tennessee the river then run southwest through alabama and turn northward pass through portion of tennessee and kentucky in length the tennessee exceed 1200 mile and with the exception of very dangerous place here and there it be strictly a navigable river run as it do through a country not yet thoroughly supply with railroad accommodation the tennessee form a important connection between a number of small shipping point which would otherwise be cut off from commercial intercourse with large center hence the transportation facility be good and in many respects remind one of old day when river traffic be general boat run almost all the year around up this river as far as alabama point and not only be a large and lucrative freight business transact but pleasure and health-seeker be also carry in large number everything be not prosaic in river life in the old day all of we have hear of the great race on the mississippus river between magnificent steamer and of the excitement on deck as first one and then the other gain a slight advantage story more or less reliable have be tell again and again of the immense sum of money make and lose by speculator who back they own boat against all comer trick and joke also prevail and continue up to the present time the passenger on a tennessee river boat be almost sure to be tell how a very popular first mate escape arrest by disguise himself as a cook the story be amusing enough to bear repetition and bereft of corroborative detail evidently design to lend artistic verisimilitude to the narrative it be as follow : the boat be detain at a landing at a small kentucky town where the law against gambling be suppose to be very strict some of the officer of the boat be determine to kill time by stake a few dollar at poker faro or something worse and inquiry be make in consequence as to where a game could be find these result satisfactorily from the gambler ' standpoint and the crowd take themselves to the appoint spot take with they the very stout good-natured but not very speculative first mate the game be play in a small room at the rear of a almost equally small restaurant everything go well for awhile and those who be win think they have everything the heart could possibly desire all at once one of the color help come rush in with a notification that the place be be raid it be a case of every man for himself as be usual in case of this kind one or two get under the table where of course they be promptly find and arrest two other jump out of the window into the arm of two deputy who be stand there to receive they the mate catch for the first time in he life in a gambling resort thought of a very good plan of escape snatch up he hat and coat he walk into the kitchen where he find a good-natured color lady hard at work stir batter in anticipation of some table luxury for a come meal with admirable presence of mind the mate pick up a apron tie it around he and tell mammy to take a few minute ' rest as she be evidently overtire he seize she wooden spoon and go on stir the batter as though he have never do anything else in he life in the meantime every other member of the party have be catch and take to the little frame building which answer the purpose of jail and police-court combined various conjecture be exchange as to the fate of the mate whose ignorance of the event incidental to gamble raid be expect to prove very inconvenient to he in a variety of way all anxiety on this score be however throw away the old man act he part so well that when the raider see he laboriously at work with the wooden spoon they conclude that he be a member of the establishment in consequence of this they let he alone and when the raid be over he replace he hat and coat with the indifference and nonchalance of a experienced actor and go quietly back to the boat here he inform friend of the incarcerated individual of the fix they be in and advise they to go to they release prefer himself to keep as far as possible from the representative of the law liberty be obtain by the payment of considerable sum in the way of fine and cost and although the event take place some year ago the way in which the inexperienced gambler escape while he more hardened and experienced friend be catch be still a constant source of merriment among officer and passenger it be while enjoy a delightful and distinctly sensational trip on the columbium river that the passenger be enlighten as to a comparatively old trick which be execute with the utmost promptness and despatch by a young second mate this young man be never know to have any money generous in the extreme and heartily full of fun he manage to get rid of he salary as promptly as it be pay he and he impecuniosity be a standing joke among member of the crew and regular passenger on one occasion the boat meet with a accident and be tie up at a small town for four or five day the hero of the story with a number of other light-hearted individual naturally go ashore on pleasure bent they have what be generally call a good time but what little fund they have when they start be soon exhaust two or three council of war be hold as to how a supply of liquid refreshment of a character not include in the temperance man 's bill of fare could be obtain finally the second mate undertake to secure the needful without the expenditure of any money he borrow a heavy overcoat belong to one of the party and then hunt up two large wine bottle one of these he fill with water and securely cork the other he take empty and with these in he pocket enter the saloon produce the empty bottle he ask the bar-keeper how much he would charge for fill it and on hear the amount tell he to go ahead as soon as the bottle be fill and return to the second mate he slip it in he pocket and in a very matter-of-fact manner begin to make arrangement for the liquidation of the debt at a convenient period the saloon-man naturally resent any discussion of this character and tell he customer to either pay for the liquor or return it right away assume a air of injured innocence we friend take out the bottle of water hand it to the barkeeper and say he guess he would have to take it back the unsuspecting purveyor of liquor that both cheer and inebriate grumble considerably empty the bottle of water into the demijohn of whisky hand back the bottle to the apparently disconsolate seeker after credit and tell he to get out naturally no second order be necessary five minute later the entire party could have be see share the contents of the bottle which have not be empty but which they lose no time in empty the trick answer its purpose admirably when about two week later the man who have play it be again in the town he call at the saloon to pay for the whisky he be treat very kindly but hint be freely give as to the necessity of a keeper accompany he on he travels in other word the bar-keeper decline distinctly to believe that he have be hoodwink as state this feature of the joke be in the opinion of its perpetrator the most amusing feature of all and it need hardly be say that very little effort be make to disabuse the unbelieving but somewhat over-credulous bar-keeper the columbium river be one of the most interesting and remarkable on the continent rise as it do quite near the source of the missourus river it run by a very circuitous route to the pacific ocean be in place very narrow and in other abnormally wide the dalle of the columbium be know the world over they be situate some sixty or seventy mile west of the city of portland and be within easy distance of the american mount blanc they extend from dalle station a small town on the union pacific railroad to celilo another station about fifteen mile farther east between these two point the bed of the columbium be greatly reduce in width and its boundary be two huge wall of rock which rise almost perpendicularly from the water level the width of the chasm through which the water rush wildly vary considerably but at no point in the western section do it exceed 130 foot although on either side of the dalle the width of the river itself range from about 2000 to much more than 2500 foot as the volume of water be enormous at this point especially after rain and much melting of snow there be often a rise of fifty foot in a few hour in the narrow channel of the dalle sometimes the rise exceed seventy foot and a effect most extraordinary in character result from many point along the river bank mount hood can be see tower away up into the cloud the bluff themselves be marvel of formation very difficult to explain or account for when the water be low there be a exposure of almost vertical cliff the bluff vary in height to a remarkable extent and the lower the water the more grotesque the appearance of the figure along they when the water be very low there be a cascade or waterfall every few foot present a appearance of continuous uproar and froth very attractive to the sightseer but very objectionable from the standpoint of navigation when the water be high these cascade be lose sight of and the rock which form they be cover with one rage torrent which seem incline to dash everything to one side in its headlong course towards the pacific ocean log be a most important use to which the columbium river be put and when immense mass of timber come thunder down the dalle at a speed sometimes as great as fifty mile a hour all preconceived notion of order and safety be set at naught there be one timber shoot more than 3000 foot long down which the log rush so rapidly that scarcely twenty seconds be occupy in the entire trip the dalle generally may be describe as a marvelous trough and the name be a french word which well signify this feature farther down the river and near the city of portland there be some very delightful fall not exceptionally large or high but very delightful in character and full of contradiction and peculiarity steamboat on the columbium river in its navigable section be exceedingly pleasant and instructive the river be the largest in america which empty into the pacific ocean for more than 140 mile it be navigable by steamer of the largest kind while other vessel can get up very much higher and nearer the picturesque source on some section of it glacier of great magnitude can be see and there be also many point concern which legend and tradition have be very busy accord to one of these tradition the indian who formerly live on the bank of the river be as brave as the ancient spartan and greek though if this be approximately correct the law and argument of descent must be entirely erroneous for the indian of this section to-day rank among the meanest and most objectionable of the entire country a artistic illustration be give of the whaleback steamer use principally on we northern lake the whaleback vary from a somewhat clumsy look craft resemble in appearance very much the back of a whale to the much more attractive and navigable craft show in the illustration these whaleback have a very important part to play in internal navigation it seem able to withstand readily bad weather and rough water unlike most vessel which be safe under these condition it require very little water to be safely navigate and it can carry heavy load in six or eight foot of water the revival of the steamboat trade on we great river and the recover from the railroad of at least a portion of the trade steal away be a pet hobby among river man generally and especially among those whose parent teach they from the cradle up the true importance of the magnificent internal waterway bountifully provide for we native land by a all-wise providence it be seriously propose to attempt this revival by aid of whaleback steamer and if the project be carry out the success which will attend the effort be likely to agreeably surprise even the most enthusiastic among those who be now advocate it chapter xx through the great northwest the importance of some of we newest state -- romantic history of montana -- the bad land and they exact opposite -- civilization away up in the mountain -- indian who have never quarrel with white man -- tradition concern mount tacoma -- wonderful town of the extreme northwest -- a state shape like a large chair -- the fall of shoshone within the last few year new state have be admit into the union which in themselves form a magnificent empire we allude to the great northwestern territory which have become state within the last decade and which have add so much luster to the escutcheon of we native land the utmost ignorance prevail as to these state and as to the northwestern corner of the united state proper a term generally apply to this great republic with the exception of alaska every now and again the report come of a great forest fire in the northwest and occasionally the world be horrify by report of a terrible calamity of this character involve great loss of life and property owing to this fact there be a tendency to look on the northwestern tier of state as one huge forest ever offer a temptation to that terrible destructive agency -- fire people who profess to have make tour through the country add to the complication by enlarge on this one characteristic and omit all reference to the other feature in which the great northwest tower head and shoulder above competitor and teach the entire world a lesson in productiveness fertility and we may add industry the world 's fair serve to very largely disabuse the public mind concern what be destine to become one of the wealthiest section of the united state the elegant state building that be erect on the shore of lake michigan and the gorgeous display of fruit grain ore and different product must have convince the average visitor that there be a great deal more in the far west and northwest than he have dream of many be induce in consequence of the information they receive to blend they fortune with the young state and although the financial condition of the country have not be calculate to expedite the fulfillment of they aladdin-like hope most of they have do well enough to be able to congratulate themselves on the change in the location and occupation we can only speak of some of the most remarkable feature of this great section greater indeed than several old world nation combine helena be the capital of one of these new state to which be give the euphonic name of montana the name be very appropriate as it signify belong to the mountain the indian have a very similar name for the territory now include in the state and judge eddy call it the bonanza state because of its mining sensation a name which have cling to it with much fidelity ever since the arm of the state be significant and almost allegorical the present be link with the past by means of a retreat buffalo significant of the extermination of this interesting and valuable species the great mining resource of montana be show by a miner 's pick and shovel and in the rearground the sun be set behind eminence of the rocky mountain montana be first discover by canadian some two hundred year ago the first permanent settlement be early in the present century and until within the last fifty year all goods and utensil use in it be drag up the missourus river from st loui a distance of nearly 2000 mile when the war break out the territory be occupy almost entirely by indian with a few daring fur trader and a number of missionary who in exercise of they duty have no fear at all the discovery of gold which take place almost simultaneously with the firing of the first shot in the conflict between the north and the south bring thousand of adventurer from all part of the union and introduce million of capital some of the mine turn out phenomenally successful and although there be the usual heart-burning on account of failure the average of success be very great the state 's gold mine have yield fabulous sum and more recently step have be take to extract from the quartz and rock a full measure of wealth that be to be find there montana be a northwestern state in fact as well as name it be situate on the high plateau between the continental divide and the bitter root range fully one-fifth of its area lie beyond the rocky mountain and its northern boundary be the snow-covered region of canada and british columbium the eastern portion of the state border upon the dakota be for the most part prairie land rise rapidly in the direction of the west and form the approach to the mighty rocky the western portion border upon idaho be much more mountainous in character some 50000 square mile of hilly country be to be see here many of the peak rise to height exceed 10000 foot the state alone be larger in area than the entire british island and it be infinitely larger than the whole of new england that it be a country of magnificent distance be show from the fact that the northern frontier equal in length the distance between the great seat of learning and culture in massachusett and the capital city of the short-lived confederacy although most of montana be rich in either agriculture or mineral a considerable area be occupy by the notorious bad land general sully describe these land very accurately or at least aptly when he say that they remind he of the other place with the fire out so many description of the bad land have be give that we need scarcely refer to they at great length the clay rock and peculiar dust which lie all around this territory become on the slightest provocation the nastiest kind of quicksand nothing can thrive or prosper in the bad land which however be full of evidence of prehistoric life and which perhaps at one time be the scene of activity and even prosperity in exact contrast to the bad land be the gallatin valley about four hundred square mile in extent it be state to be one of the most fertile spot in the world and by common consent it have be call the egypt of montana a portion of it have be cultivate and its yield per acre have be find to be prodigious at no great distance from this fertile spot two of america 's most remarkable river have they rise the greatest of these be the missourus which measure from its source to final entrance into the gulf of mexico along the bed of the mississippus river be really the longest river in the world away up here in the mountain the missourus which subsequently become one of the most treacherous and destructive river in the universe run through picturesque cañons and over great gorge of rock finally leave the state a great river though still insignificant in comparison with the volume it be to assume and the drainage work it be to accomplish farther away from the mighty hill among which it have its source the northern pacific railroad run through this wonderful state with so great a future before it helena the capital city of montana be originally a mining camp and early prophecy be that it would not outlive the mining enthusiasm these prophecy however have prove entirely mistake it be no longer a mere mining town with rough busy uncultured man rush hither and thither in the eager pursuit of they daily avocation it be now not only the judicial capital of montana but it be also the great center of educational advance it have a number of very handsome public building and be the home of many man who have make they fortune in the mine of the new northwest have be so impressed with the beauty of scenery and climate that they have decide to abide where at first they merely intend to sojourn helena be more than 4000 foot above the sea level and its 20000 inhabitant be repute to be worth more than $ 100000000 the apostle of socialism or communism who suggest a equal division among the 60000000 of we people of all the wealth of the nation would find little encouragement in this great mountain city where poverty if not unknown be very scarce much more typical as a mining city be butte this be situate upon a hill quite peculiarly located and be reach by a ride along the silver bow valley close here be the wonderful anaconda mine the mine in the neighborhood have a reputation for immense yield the annual extract of gold silver and copper be value at more than $ 33000000 the anaconda smelter build some twelve year ago be say to be the largest in the world and the town itself seem to literally talk mining by its street its house its business its habit and its people missoulum be the third largest city of montana its site be a splendid one for a city the hell gate cañon and river merge into a magnificent plain the foot of the note bitter root valley the hell gate river break out from the cañon and mountain into the wide plain and sweep majestically across the extreme northern limit of it hug closely the mission range to the north at the western side of the valley the bitter root river combine with the hell gate and together and now under the name of the missoulum river they flow westward between high mountain the northern end of the valley be perhaps six mile or more wide the great opening in the mountain be rather triangular in shape with the apex of the triangle many mile up the valley to the south here be a city lay out and build up in perfect harmony with its location as be evidence by the tasteful manner in which the place be plan and the character of its business block and residence telephone electric light and water supply be find even in the remote suburb of missoulum the mountain literally hem they in immediately to the northeast be a bare hill that be startling in its resemblance to a animal it be like a huge recumbent elephant the hind quarter of which form the northern end of hell gate cañon around which the railroad curve as it issue from the cañon the mammoth jumbo as it be appropriately know recline with head to the north and trunk stretch out behind he one eye be plainly see and one huge shoulder be visible down in the south sharp decisive with a steep rocky escarpment face we and a long ridge descend from it be lolo peak of the bitter root range a note landmark this overhang lolo pass through which chief joseph come in he famous retreat from general howard in 1877 which terminate in the battle of the bear paw mountain October 5th where the brave and able chieftain be capture with the rest-of he tribe when almost within reach of freedom just across the canadian border at the southern extremity of the valley on the bank of the bitter root river and with the range serve as a effective background be fort missoulum a pleasantly located military post several interpretation of the meaning of the word missoulum be give father guidus a priest of long residence in the country give I what he consider the true one which also indicate the manner in which the hell gate cañon and river be christen the spot where missoulum be located be once the scene of conflict between the various tribe of indian the flathead and blackfeet be deadly enemy and presumably may have fight over this lovely spot at any rate the ground just at the mouth of the hell gate cañon be cover long ago with skull and human bone these flathead indian be note for the fact that they have never adopt a hostile attitude towards white people they be advance in civilization as reader of chapter ix and its accompany illustration will have note tradition state that they religion demand that the head of every infant must be flatten by means of a board before the bone harden sufficiently to assume a shape however this may be none of the survive member of the tribe have particularly flat head and all deny emphatically the statement that nature be ever interfere with in the manner state these indian call themselves selish a name apparently without reason or derivation the flathead reservation be form about forty year ago on three side it be wall in by high mountain and it consist of about 2240 square mile of territory the railway station arlee be so name after the last war chief of the flathead passenger be often amuse by the gaudily deck indian who be see at this station which be quite near the reservation a interesting story attach to the jocko river and reservation it be state that a irishman name jacob finley establish a ranch on the river early in the present century the french canadian who settle in the neighborhood and intermarry with the indian call finley by he christian name with a peculiar french pronunciation which make it sound very like much jaco or jocko -- the latter name gradually become generally adopt it be quite natural to call the river and the valley after the ranch owner and the name finally become generally accept as correct this man finley leave behind he a family of seventeen and before he have be dead many year he direct descendant number within three or four of a even century the indian call the stream the nlka a unpronounceable combination of letter result from a most interesting though variously describe event mr ronan the well-known writer tell a interesting story of how name be give by indian thus she own daughter 's name be isabel but the indian call she sunshine in February 1887 the little girl be bear for some day prior to she birth the weather have be gloomy in the extreme almost simultaneously with the child 's birth the sun so long hide under the cloud burst forth to gladden the heart of man with one accord the indian declare that the little one have bring sunshine with she and hence the name which as subsequent event have prove be exceptionally appropriate accompany this chapter be a illustration of mount tacoma this mountain be one of the most attractive as well as lofty in the northwest as can easily be suppose tradition without number be connect with it no greater mistake can be make than to imagine that the indian who be find in this region be naturally atheistic as well as ignorant to the student of religion there be rather a inherent belief in the supreme be among these people with very strong proof of the truth of the divine revelation one of the tradition tell with much fervor and earnestness about tacoma involve in it a savior of mankind with great reverence and awe the good listener among the band of tourist be tell that at one period -- legend be seldom very specific in the matter of time or space -- a savior arrive in a copper canoe he mission be to save the siwash indian who be speak of as the choose people of the great unseen that some prophet or missionary certainly come to this region and preach appear to be evident from the very definite survival of the doctrine teach by he he creed seem to have be a very apt blending of all that be best in the teaching of buddha with many of the precept of the sermon on the mount added love to mankind the evil of revenge and the glory of forgiveness form the principal feature of the doctrine the legend or tradition go on to say that so violent be the opposition to this crusader who attack local institution so bitterly that finally he be seize and nail to a tree this act of crucifixion result from a final sermon in which the wanton destruction of human being be denounce in term of great vehemence as nine instead of seven or three be the general number talk of in this section it be not surprising that the story should go on to state that after nine day the mysterious one be reanimate and once more commence he work of reformation and tuition nothing in connection with the story can be object to by some it be suppose to be the result of casual immigration from the region of palestine to which also be attribute the story of the flood among nearly all the indian of the northwest there be a flood story or legend and there must be hundred of noah in the mind of the story-teller we be tell for example that when the great spirit flood the entire earth there be not quite enough water to cover the summit of mount tacoma the man choose to prevent the human race from be entirely obliterate be warn in a dream or by some other means to climb to the summit of this great mountain where he remain until the wicked one below he be annihilate without a man woman or child escape after the flood be over and the water begin to recede the great spirit hypnotize or mesmerize this solitary human being and create for he a wife of exceptional beauty together these two recommence the battle of life and as the legend run every human be in existence can trace he lineage to they the mountain be surely worth all that have be say about it its great height have already be comment upon standing as it do with its summit 14444 foot above the sea level it be actually a sentinel for almost the entire state hazard steven the first man to climb tacoma report that it be so call by the indian because the word mean in they vocabulary mountain and be give to tacoma because it be a veritable prince among hill it be at one time call rainier after a british lord but the indian name have generally prevail tacoma have be describe by many tourist as a rival to the most vaunted peak of the swiss alp as will be see from the illustration which be remarkably good one there be a dim mistiness about the mountain when the light be poor there be a peculiar almost unnatural look about the cloud-topped peak when the cloud be very white the line of demarcation become faint in the extreme and it be very hard to distinguish one from the other sometimes for day together the mountain be literally cloud-capped and its peak hide from view those who be fortunate enough to be able to appreciate the awful and unique in history never tire of gaze upon tacoma they be glad to inspect it from every side some call it a white sepulchre there be a time when it be anything but the calm peaceful eminence of to-day every indication point to the fact that it be once among the most active volcano in existence there be a town or rather city of the same name as the mountain this be situate on commencement bay it be under the very shadow of the great mountain of which we have speak and which seem to guard it against foe from inland fifteen year ago it be a mere village of scarcely any importance it have rapidly grow into a town of great importance in 1873 the northern pacific railroad company decide to make it the western terminus of they important system this result in renew life or rather in a genuine birth to the place which now have a population of 40000 people and be a exceedingly wealthy and prosperous city the tacoma land company ably second by the railroad have foster enterprise in this place in the most hearty manner and now some of the large building of the town of the very existence of which many eastern people affect ignorance be more than magnificent -- they be majestic seattle be another and even more brilliant diamond in washington 's crown it be a great city with a magnificent harbor its name be that of a powerful indian chief who when the town be found forty year ago have thing practically he own way it grow in importance very rapidly but in 1889 one of the largest fire of modern time destroy $ 10000000 worth of property include the best block and commercial structure of the city people who have never see seattle at once assume that the city be dead and speculation be rife as to what place would secure its magnificent trade those who thus talk be entirely ignorant as to the nature of the man who have make seattle what it be within a very few day the work of reconstruction commence the fire hamper the city somewhat and check its progress but seattle be better for the disaster and stand to-day a monument to the nil desperandum policy of its leader spokane fall be another wonderful instance of northwestern push and energy it be a very young city the earliest record of its founding not go back farther than 1878 when the census of 1880 be take the place be of no importance and receive very little attention at the hand of the enumerator in 1890 it have a population of some 20000 and attract the admiration of the entire country by the progress it have make in the matter of electricity its water power be tremendous and take full advantage of this electricity be produce at low cost and use for every available and possible purpose the state of washington in which these three city be situate border upon the pacific ocean and be one of the greatest of we new state the first modern explorer of the territory be a spaniard follow a few year later by english sailor just at the end of the last century some boston capitalist for there be capitalist even in those day although they reckon they wealth by thousand rather than million send two ship to this section to trade with the indian for fur one of these ship be the columbium which give the name to the region part of which still retain it although the section we be now discuss now own and boast of the name of the father of he and we country washington become a state five year ago it be a great mining country but be still more note for its wonderful lumber resource the trade from puget sound be tremendous one company alone employ 1250 man in saw mill and log and it be responsible for have introduce improve machinery of every type into the section the early history of the great lumber business be full of interest and this be one point alone in which the advance have be tremendous another great company cut up 63000000 foot of lumber in one year and ship more than half of it out of the country white cedar of the most costly grade be very common in washington and it be use for the manufacture of shingle which sell for very high price and be regard as unusually and indeed abnormally good white pine of immense quantity and size be also find some of the log be so large that they be only excel by the phenomenal big tree of abnormal growth which be find some hundred of mile farther south on the great pacific slope idaho be another of the great state of the great northwest it lie largely between the two state just describe so briefly and its shape be so peculiar that it have be speak of as resemble a chair with the rocky mountain and the bitter root range as its front seat and back another simile liken it to a right-angled triangle with the bitter root range as its base it be a vast tableland wedge shape in character and may be say to consist of a mass of mountain range pack up fold upon fold one on top of the other three name be submit to congress when the territory be first name they be shoshone montana and idaho the last name be choose finally because it be suppose to mean the sight on the mountain the more exact derivation of the name seem to be a old shoshone legend involve the fall of some mysterious object from the heaven upon one of the mountain the scenery in this state be vary in everything save in beauty which be almost monotonous bear lake one of its great attraction be a fisherman 's paradise its water extend twenty mile in one direction and eight or nine mile in the other this vast expanse of water be one of the best trout fishing resort in the world although in a valley bear lake be so high up in the mountain that its water be freeze up for many month in the year the ice seldom break up until well into April at all time the water be cold and hence especially favorable for trout culture lake pen d'oreille be about thirty mile long and vary in width from a insignificant three mile to more than fifteen it be stud with island of great beauty and much verdure close by it be the granite mountain with other hill and peak average perhaps 10000 foot in height the lake have a immense shore line extend as much as 250 mile for fully a tenth of this distance the northern pacific track be close to the lake afford passenger a very delightful view of this inland scene which have be liken to the world-renowned bavarian lake königs see the state be also well know on account of the reputation for weird grandeur win by the snake river also know as the shoshone this be a very rapid stream of water by means of its wind course it measure fully a thousand mile in idaho alone and drain about two-third of the state near the headwater of the snake river in the proximity of yellowstone park there be very fertile bottom with long stretch of valley land the american fall plunge over a mass of lava about forty foot high with a railroad bridge so close that the roar of the water drown the noise of the locomotive for seventy mile the shoshone river run through a deep gloomy cañon with a mass of cascade and many volcanic island intervene then come the great shoshone fall themselves rival in many respects niagara and have at time even a greater volume of water the fall be nearly a thousand foot in width and the descent exceed two hundred foot many writer have claim that these fall have feature of beauty not equal in any part of the world accord to one description they resemble a cataract of snow with a avalanche of jewel amidst solid portal of lava bancroft in sum up the great feature of this state say very concisely that : it be the common judgment of the first explorer that there be more of the strange and awful in the scenery and topography of idaho than of the pleasing and attractive a more intimate acquaintance with the less conspicuous feature of the country reveal many beauty the climate of the valley be find to be far milder than from they elevation could have be expect picturesque lake be discover among the mountain furnish in some instance navigable water fish and game abound fine forest of pine and fir cover the mountain slope except in the lava region and nature even in this phenomenal part of she domain have not forget to prepare the earth for the occupation of man nor neglect to give he a wondrously warm and fertile soil to compensate for the labor of subdue the savagery of she apparently waste place chapter xxi in the warm southeast florida and its appropriate name -- the first portion of north america discover by white man -- early vicissitude of its explorer -- a enormous coast line -- how key west come to be a great cigar town -- the suwanee river -- st augustine and its world-renowned hotel -- old fort marion florida be the name give to one of the least known state in the union ponce de leon be the godfather of this southeastern corner of we native land its baptism take place in a remote period the day of the event be easter Sunday which in the spanish language be call pascua florium which be literally interpret the flowery festival almost by accident therefore florida receive a name which be singularly appropriate and well choose from end to end in either direction there be a profusion of semi-tropical beauty and of flower some of they entirely peculiar to the immediate vicinity there be a abundance of fruit as well and frequently the blossom on the fruit tree make a lovely flower show in themselves the state arm be very peculiar and appropriate the main figure be that of a indian lie upon a bank scatter flower around he in the distance the sun be set amid beautiful hill in the center there be a river with a steamboat upon it and with a large cocoanut tree grow by the side the state 's motto be one which have be adopt by many community but which be ever welcome for the purpose -- in god we trust in regard to its climate florida can offer a great deal of variety consumptive by the ten of thousand have seek a renew lease of life in the warmest section of the state and many have come back greatly benefit the winter be of the indian summer order be singularly dry healthy and free from dust the gulf stream add from five to ten degree to the temperature in cold weather and in the southern section the temperature rarely get below freezing point the exceptionally cold spell of 1894-95 may be quote as quite a exception to the general rule and the heavy loss to grow fruit be as great a surprise as it be a loss florida have the honor of be the first portion of north america to be discover by white people ponce de leon whose very name be suggestive of romance and poetry explore a section of the country in the year 1513 when he proclaim the sovereignty of spain over it in 1527 a spanish company of soldier attempt to drive out the native inhabitant the attempt fail but another one some fourteen year later be more successful spain be not give a clear title to the peninsula without protest french huguenot build fort caroline on st john 's river at about the middle of the century shortly after this enterprise a spanish fleet surprise and annihilate the pioneer upon whose grave they place the inscription not as frenchman but as lutheran this brutal attempt to give a religious aspect to the murder be resent very soon after a french expedition capture the fort hang the garrison one after the other announce that they do so and hang the ruffian not as spaniard but as traitor thief and murderer west florida be settle at the close of the seventeenth century and in 1763 the territory now include in the state be cede to great britain in return for cuba colonization follow and a very large number of british tory settle in the country in 1814 the united state seize portion of the country and four year later it become evident that european rule must cease in it when in 1821 spain cede this territory to the united state the number of white inhabitant be barely 600 although there be fully 4000 seminole reside in it the seminole war commence in 1835 and continue for seven year the war cost some $ 20000000 and over 1500 american soldier lose they life during the campaign over 30000 troops be engage in the conflict and the indian by take advantage of they knowledge of the country hold out against superior force for a extraordinary length of time gradually the savage be drive south and at last the seminole be overpower those who survive be for the most part send west of the mississippus river a few be still find however on a reservation some fifteen mile from fort pierce on indian river when the southern state secede florida go with they in 1864 general seymor lead 7000 troops nearly as far as lake city jacksonville remain under federal control but the state fortunately escape be make a battle-ground to any extent between the opposing force florida have a very interesting geological record it be evidently found on coral reef and the formation be so recent that few mineral be find phosphate rock be one of the most remarkable natural production of the state and the actual value of this have not yet be thoroughly ascertain the state itself be naturally divide into two section the east and the west east florida include a long peninsula and extend westward to the suwanee river concern which the negro melodist delight to sing western florida be more inland in character the measurement of the state be peculiar thus it be 700 mile from the perdido river to cape sable from the atlantic to the extreme west the distance be about 400 mile and from north to south the distance be slightly greater the peninsula itself average rather less than 100 mile in width throughout florida naturally possess a enormous coast line of this nearly 500 mile be on the atlantic seaboard with some 700 mile on the gulf of mexico harbor abound on every side and when florida become a manufacturing state as well as a fruit-growing one its resource for export will be a immense advantage to it in overcome competition and opposition this coast line make sea fishing one of the most profitable occupation in the state about 10000 man be keep constantly employ in this work some of the fish find here be choice and costly delicacy and include red snapper pompano spanish mackerel and sea trout of turtle there be a abundance and tarpon fishing provide amusement to those who be more strictly sportsmanlike in disposition fishing for sponge be also a fairly remunerative occupation which always excite much interest when watch by visitor from other state key west alone send away sponge worth $ 500000 every year two great capital of europe be the best customer key west be however better note for its cigar it be situate on what be originally call bone reef by the spaniard on account of great quantity of human bone be find on it by the early explorer eighty year ago a number of new england fisherman located at key west which be about sixty mile from florida proper and about ninety mile from havana the great revolution in the nature of the town 's business and habit be bring about by the settlement in it less than a quarter century ago of a large band of cuban exile these bring with they the secret of the manufacture of cigar of the highest grade they at once set about establish factory as large as they means allow and the business have grow so rapidly that there be now facility for manufacture nearly 150000000 cigar every year to the man who appreciate the difference between good and bad cigar it be hardly necessary to say that in quality as well as quantity the product of this spanish-american island have progress the harbor of key west be the ninth port of entry in the country it be so naturally impregnable that it escape capture during the civil war when the gulf coast port be a special source of attack and envy legend and history twine around the harbor story of thrilling interest many of which have form the plot for successful and celebrated novel the town have peculiar but attractive street with tropical tree on both side seven mile distant be key west the most extreme southern point of united state territory from the immense light-house pier the distance to the island of cuba be less than eighteen mile return to the inland we may spend a few minute ` way down ` pon de suwanee ribber far far away -- dare 's wha ' my heart be turnin ' ebber -- dare 's wha ' de ole folk stay this river as we have see form the western boundary of eastern florida it be a very romantic stream run through a country of surpass beauty with tropical tree and undergrowth come right to the water 's edge it enter florida from southern georgium and run through a country which vary from forest to plain and from upland to valley along its bank there be a number of little southern home few of they boast of the magnificence of which we often read but all of they peaceful
