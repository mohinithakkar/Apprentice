testimony of he brother -- first step toward perfection of the invention -- letter to fenimore cooper the history of every great invention be a record of struggle sometimes heart-breaking on the part of the inventor to secure and maintain he rights no sooner have the new step in progress prove itself to be a upward one than claimant arise on every side some honestly believe themselves to have solve the problem first other strive by dishonest means to appropriate to themselves the honor and the reward and these sometimes succeed and still other indifferent to fame thinking only of they own pecuniary gain and dishonorable in they method the electric telegraph be no exception to this rule on the contrary its history perhaps lead all the rest as a chronicle of envy hatred malice and all uncharitableness on the other hand it bring out in strong relief the oppose virtue of steadfastness perseverance integrity and loyalty many be the wordy battle wage in the scientific world over the question of priority exclusive discovery or invention indebtedness to other and conscious or unconscious plagiarism some of these question be in many mind not yet settle acrimonious be the legal struggle fight over infringement and rights of way and in the first year of the building of the line to all part of this country real warfare be wage by the worker of compete company it be not my purpose to treat exhaustively of any of these battle scientific legal or physical all this have already be write down by abler pen than mine and have now become history my aim in follow the career of morse the inventor be to shed a light -lrb- to some a new light -rrb- on he personality self-reveal by he correspondence try first by hardship poverty and deep discouragement and then by success calumny and fame like other man who have achieve greatness he be make the target for all manner of abuse accuse of misappropriate the idea of other of lie deceit and treachery and of unbounded conceit and vaingloriousness but a careful study of he note and correspondence and the testimony of other prove he to have be a pure-hearted christian gentleman earnestly desirous of give to every one he just due but jealous of he own good name and fame and fight valiantly when need must be to maintain he rights guilty sometimes of mistake and error of judgment occasionally quick-tempered and testy under the stress of discouragement and the pressure of poverty but frank to acknowledge he error and to make amends when convince of he fault and the calm verdict of posterity have award he the crown of greatness morse be now forty-one year old he have spend three delightful year in france and italy have mature he art by the intelligent study of the best of the old master have make new friend and cement more strongly the tie that bind he to old one and he be return to he dearly love native land and to he family with high hope of gain for himself and he three motherless child at least a competence and of continue he effort in behalf of the fine art from mr cooper 's and mr habersham 's reminiscence we must conclude that in the background of he mind there exist a plan unformed as yet for utilize electricity to convey intelligence he be familiar with much that have be discover with regard to that mysterious force through he study under professor day and silliman at yale and through the lecture and conversation of professor dana and renwick in new york so that the charge which be bring against he that he know absolutely nothing of the subject can be dismiss as simply prove the ignorance of he critic thus prepared unconsciously to himself to receive the inspiration which be to come to he like a flash of the subtle fluid which afterwards become he servant he go on board the good ship sully captain pell command on the 1st of October 1832 among the other passenger be the honorable william c rive of virginia we minister to france with he family mr jf fisher of philadelphium dr charle t jackson of boston who be destine to play a malign rôle in the subsequent history of the telegraph and other the following letter be write to he friend fenimore cooper from havre on the 2d of October : -- i have but a moment to write you one line as in a few hour i shall be under way for dear america i arrive from england by way of southampton a day or two since and have have every moment till now occupy in preparation for embark i receive yours from vevay yesterday and thank you for it yes mr rive and family mr fisher mr roger mr palmer and family and a full cabin beside accompany I what shall i do with such a _ antistatistical _ set i wish you be of the party to shut they mouth on some point i shall have good opportunity to talk with mr rive whom i like notwithstanding i think he have good american feeling in the main and mean well although i can not account for he permit you to suffer in the chamber -lrb- of the general -rrb- i will find out _ that _ if i can my journey to england change of scene and air have restore I wonderfully i know they would i like john 's country it be a garden beautifully in contrast with france and john 's people have excellent quality and he have many good people but i hate he aristocratic system and be more confirm in my view than ever of its oppressive and unjust character i see a great deal of leslie he be the same good fellow that he always be be tender of he my dear sir i could mention some thing which would soften you judgment of he political feeling one thing only i can now say -- remember he have marry a english wife whom he love and who have never know america he keep entirely aloof from politics and be wholly absorb in he art newton be marry to a miss sullivan daughter of general sullivan of boston a accomplished woman and a belle he be expect in england soon i find almost everybody out of town in london i call and leave a card at roger 's but he be in the country so be most of the artist of my acquaintance the fine engraver who have execute so many of leslie 's work danforth be a stanch american he would be a man after you heart he admire you for that very quality -- i must close in great haste the transatlantic traveller do not depart on schedule time in 1832 as we find from another letter write to mr cooper on October 5 : -- here i be yet wind-bound with a tremendous southwester directly in we tooth yesterday the formosa arrive and bring papers etc to the 10th September i have be look they over matter look serious at the south they be mad there great decision and prudence will be require to restore they to reason again but they be so hot-headed and be so far commit i know not what will be the issue yet i think we institution be equal to any crisis _ October 6 7 o'clock _ we be get under way good-bye it be greatly to be regret that morse do not on this voyage as on previous one keep a careful diary have he do so many point relate to the first conception of he invention would from the beginning have be make much clearer as it be however from he own account at a later date and from the deposition of the captain of the ship and some of the passenger the story can be tell the voyage be on the whole i believe a pleasant one and the company in the cabin congenial one night at the dinner-table the conversation chance upon the subject of electro-magnetism and dr jackson describe some of the more recent discovery of european scientist -- the length of wire in the coil of a magnet the fact that electricity pass instantaneously through any known length of wire and that its presence could be observe at any part of the line by break the circuit morse be naturally much interested and it be then that the inspiration which have lie dormant in he brain for many year suddenly come to he and he say : if the presence of electricity can be make visible in any part of the circuit i see no reason why intelligence may not be transmit instantaneously by electricity the company be not startle by this remark they soon turn to other subject and think no more of it little do they realize that this exclamation of morse 's be to mark a epoch in civilization that it be the germ of one of the greatest invention of any age a invention which not only revolutionize the method by which intelligence be convey from place to place but pave the way for the subjugation to the use of man in many other way of that mysterious fluid electricity which up to this time have remain but a plaything of the laboratory in short it usher in the age of electricity least of all perhaps do that dr jackson who afterwards claim to have give morse all he idea apprehend the tremendous importance of that chance remark the fix idea have however take root in morse 's brain and obsess he he withdraw from the cabin and pace the deck revolve in he mind the various means by which the object seek could be attain soon he idea be so far focus that he seek to give they expression on paper and he draw from he pocket one of the little sketch-book which he always carry with he and rapidly jot down in sketch and word the idea as they rush from he brain this original sketch-book be burn in a mysterious fire which some year later during one of the many telegraph suit destroy many valuable papers fortunately however a certify copy have wisely be make and this certified copy be now in the national museum in washington and the reproduction here give of some of its page will show that morse 's first conception of a recording electric magnetic telegraph be practically the telegraph in universal use to-day -lrb- illustration : drawing from 1832 sketch book show first conception of telegraph -rrb- he first thought be evidently of some system of sign which could be use to transmit intelligence and he at once realize that nothing could be simpler than a point or a dot a line or dash and a space and a combination of the three thus the first sketch show the embryo of the dot-and-dash alphabet apply only to number at first but afterwards elaborate by morse to represent all the letter of the alphabet next he suggest a method by which these sign may be record permanently evidently by chemical decomposition on a strip of paper pass along over two roller he then show a message which could be send by this mean intersperse with idea for insulate the wire in tube or pipe and here i want to call attention to a point which have never to my knowledge be notice before in the message which in pursuance of he first idea adhere to by he for several year be to be send by means of number every word be number conventionally except the proper name cuvier and for this he put a number for each letter how this be to be indicate be not make clear but it be evident that he see at once that all proper name could not be number that some other means must be employ to indicate they in other word that each letter of the alphabet must have its own sign whether at that early period he have actually devise any form of alphabet do not appear although some of the deposition of he fellow passenger would indicate that he have he himself put its invention at a date a few year after this and it have be bitterly contest that he do not invent it at all i shall prove in the proper place that he do but i think it be prove that it must have be think of even at the early date of 1832 and at all event the dot-and-dash as the basis of a conventional code be original with morse and be quite different from any other form of code devise by other the next drawing of a magnet lifting sixty pound show that morse be familiar with the discovery of arago davy and sturgeon in electro-magnetism but what application of they be to be make be not explain the last sketch be to I the most important of all for it embody the principle of the receive magnet which be universally use at the present day the weak permanent magnet have be replace by a spring but the electro-magnet still attract the lever and produce the dot and dash of the alphabet and this simple as it seem to we once find be original with morse be absolutely different from any other form of telegraph devise by other and improve and elaborate by he through year of struggle be now recognize throughout the world as the telegraph it be not yet in a shape to prove to a skeptical world its practical utility much have still to be do to bring it to perfection new discovery have still to be make by morse and by other which be essential to its success the skill the means and the faith of other have to be enlist in its behalf but the actual invention be there and morse be the inventor how simple it all seem to we now and yet its very simplicity be its sublimest feature for it be this which compel the admiration of scientist and practical man of affair alike and which gradually force into desuetude all other system of telegraphy until to-day the morse telegraph still stand unrivalled that many other mind have be occupy with the same problem be a fact unknown to the inventor at the time although a few year later he be rudely awaken a fugitive note write many year later in he handwriting although speaking of himself in the third person bear witness to this it be entitle good thought : -- a circumstance which tend to confuse in fairly ascertain priority of invention be that a subsequent state of knowledge be confound in the general mind with the state of knowledge when the invention be first announce as successful this be certainly very unfair when morse announce he invention what be the general state of knowledge in regard to the telegraph it should be bear in mind that a knowledge of the futile attempt at electric telegraph previous to he successful one have be bring out from the lumber garret of science by the research of eighteen year nothing be know of such telegraph to many scientific man of the highest attainment in the centre of civilization professor morse say himself -lrb- and certainly he have not give in any single instance a statement which have be falsify -rrb- that at the time he devise he system he suppose himself to be the first person that ever put the word ` electric telegraph ' together he suppose himself at the time the originator of the phrase as well as the thing but aside from he positive assertion the truth of this statement be not only possible but very probable the comparatively few -lrb- very few as compare with the mass who now be learn in the fact -rrb- who be in the habit of read the scientific journal may have read of the thought of a electric telegraph about the year 1832 and even of ronald 's and betancourt 's and salva 's and lomond 's impracticable scheme previously and have forget they again with thousand of other dream as the ingenious idea of visionary man idea so visionary as to be consider palpably impracticable declare to be so indeed by barlow a scientific man of high standing and character yet the mass of the scientific as well as the general public be ignorant even of the attempt that have be make the fact of any of they have be publish in some magazine at the time whose circulation may be two or three thousand and which be soon virtually lose amid the shelf of immense library do not militate against the assertion that the world be ignorant of the fact we can show conclusively the existence of this ignorance respect telegraph at the time of the invention of morse 's telegraph the rest of this note -lrb- evidently write for publication -rrb- be miss but enough remain to prove the point thus we have see that the idea of he telegraph come to morse as a sudden inspiration and that he be quite ignorant of the fact that other have think of use electricity to convey intelligence to a distance mr prime in he biography say : of all the great invention that have make they author immortal and confer endure benefit upon mankind no one be so completely grasp at its inception as this one of he fellow passenger j franci fisher esq counsellor-at-law of philadelphium give the follow testimony at morse 's request : -- in the fall of the year 1832 i return from europe as a passenger with mr morse in the ship sully captain pell master during the voyage the subject of a electric telegraph be one of frequent conversation mr morse be most constant in pursue it and _ alone _ the one who seem disposed to reduce it to a practical test and i recollect that for this purpose he devise a _ system of sign for letter _ to be indicate and mark by a quick succession of stroke or shock of the galvanic current and i be sure of the fact that it be deem by mr morse perfectly competent to effect the result state i do not suppose that any other person on board the ship claim any merit in the invention or be in fact interested to pursue it to maturity as mr morse then seem to be nor have i be able since that time to recall any fact or circumstance to justify the claim of any person other than mr morse to the invention this clear statement of mr fisher 's be cheerfully give in answer to a request for he recollection of the circumstance in order to combat the claim of dr charle t jackson that he have give morse all the idea of the telegraph and that he should be consider at least its joint inventor this be the first of the many claim which the inventor be force to meet it result in a lawsuit which settle conclusively that morse be the sole inventor and that jackson be the victim of a mania which impel he to claim the discovery and achievement of other as he own i shall have occasion to refer to this matter again it be to be note that mr fisher refer to sign for letter whether morse actually have devise or speak of a conventional alphabet at that time can not be prove conclusively but that it must have be in he mind the cuvier refer to before indicate other of he fellow-passenger give testimony to the same effect and captain pell state under oath that when he see the complete instrument in 1837 he recognize it as embody the principle which morse have explain to he on the sully and he add : before the vessel be in port mr morse address I in these word : ` well captain should you hear of the telegraph one of these day as the wonder of the world remember the discovery be make on board the good ship sully ' morse always cling tenaciously to the date of 1832 as that of he invention and i claim with perfect justice while it require much think and elaboration to bring it to perfection while he use the publish discovery of other in order to make it operate over long distance while other labor with he in order to produce a practical work apparatus and to force its recognition on a skeptical world the basic idea on which everything else depend be he it be original with he and he pursue it to a successful issue himself make certain new and essential discovery and invention while as i have say he make use of the discovery of other these man in turn be dependent on the earlier investigation of scientist who precede they and so the chain lengthen out there will always be a difference of opinion as to the comparative value of a new discovery and a new invention and the difference between these term should be clearly apprehend while they be to a certain extent interchangeable the word discovery in science be usually apply to the first enunciation of some property of nature till then unrecognized invention on the other hand be the application of this property to the use of mankind sometimes discovery and invention be combine in the same individual but often the discoverer be satisfy with the fame arise from have call attention to something new and leave to other the practical application of he discovery scientist will always claim that a new discovery which mark a advance in knowledge in they choose field be of paramount importance while the world at large be more grateful to the man who by combine the discovery of other and add the culminate link confer a tangible blessing upon humanity morse be completely possess by this new idea he work over it that day and far into the night he vivid imagination leap into the future brushing aside all obstacle and he realize that here in he hand be a instrument capable of work inconceivable good he recall the day and week of anxiety when he be hungry for news of he loved one he foresee that in affair of state and of commerce rapid communication might mean the avoidance of war or the saving of a fortune that in affair nearer to the heart of the people it might bring a husband to the bedside of a die wife or save the life of a beloved child apprehend the flee criminal or commute the sentence of a innocent man he great ambition have always be to work some good for he fellow-men and here be a means of bestow upon they a inestimable boon after several day of intense application he disclose he plan to mr rive and to other objection be raise but he be ready with a solution while the idea appear to he fellow-passenger as chimerical yet as we have see he earnestness make so deep a impression that when several year afterwards he exhibit to some of they a complete model they like captain pell instantly recognize it as embody the principle explain to they on the ship without go deeply into the scientific history of the successive step which lead up to the invention of the telegraph i shall quote a few sentence from a long paper write by the late professor en horsford of cambridge massachusett and include in mr prime 's biography : -- what be need to the _ original conception _ of the morse recording telegraph 1 a knowledge that soft wire bent in the form of a horseshoe could be magnetize by send a galvanic current through a coil wound round the iron and that it would lose its magnetism when the current be suspend 2 a knowledge that such a magnet have be make to lift and drop mass of iron of considerable weight 3 a knowledge or a belief that the galvanic current could be transmit through wire of great length these be all now come the conception of device for employ a agent which could produce reciprocal motion to effect registration and the invention of a alphabet in order to this invention it must be see how up and down -- reciprocal -- motion could be produce by the opening and closing of the circuit into this simple band of vertical tracery of path in space must be throw the shuttle of time and a ribbon of paper it must be see how a lever-pen alternately drop upon and rise at define interval from a fillet of paper move by independent clock-work would produce the fabric of the alphabet and writing and printing be there anything require to produce these result which be not know to morse he know for he have witness it year before that by means of a battery and a electro-magnet reciprocal motion could be produce he know that the force which produce it could be transmit along a wire he _ believe _ that the battery current could be make through a electro-magnet to produce physical result at a _ distance _ he see in he mind 's eye the existence of a agent and a medium by which reciprocal motion could be not only produce but control at a distance the question that address itself to he at the outset be naturally this : ` how can i make use of the simple up-and-down motion of opening and close a circuit to write a intelligible message at one end of a wire and at the same time print it at the other ' like many a kindred work of genius it be in nothing more wonderful than in its simplicity not one of the brilliant scientific man who have attach they name to the history of electro-magnetism have bring the means to produce the practical register telegraph some of they have ascend the tower that look out on the field of conquest some of they bring keener vision than other some of they stand higher than other but the genius of invention have not recognize they there be need a inventor now what sort of a want be this there be require a rare combination of quality and condition there must be ingenuity in the adaptation of available means to desire end there must be the genius to see through non-essential to the fundamental principle on which success depend there must be a kind of skill in manipulation great patience and pertinacity a certain measure of culture and the inventor of a recording telegraph must be capable of be inspire by the grandeur of the thought of write figuratively speak with a pen a thousand mile long -- with the thought of a postal system without the element of time moreover the person who be to be the inventor must be free from the exaction of well-compensated everyday absorb duty -- perhaps he must have have the final baptism of poverty now the inventor of the register telegraph do not rise from the perusal of any brilliant paper he happen to be at leisure on shipboard ready to contribute and share in the after-dinner conversation of a ship 's cabin when the occasion arise morse 's electro-magnetic telegraph be mainly a invention employ power and agency through mechanical device to produce a give end it involve the combination of the result of the labor of other with a succession of special contrivance and some discovery of the inventor himself there be a ideal whole almost at the outset but involve great thought and labor and patience and invention to produce a art harmonious in its organization and action after a voyage of over a month morse reach home and land at the foot of rector street on November 15 1832 he two brother sidney and richard meet he on he arrival and be tell at once of he invention he brother richard thus describe they meeting : -- hardly have the usual greeting pass between we three brother and while on we way to my house before he inform we that he have make during he voyage a important invention which have occupy almost all he attention on shipboard -- one that would astonish the world and of the success of which he be perfectly sanguine that this invention be a means of communicate intelligence by electricity so that a message could be write down in a permanent manner by character at a distance from the writer he take from he pocket and show from he sketch-book in which he have draw they the kind of character he propose to use these character be dot and space represent the ten digit or numeral and in the book be sketch other part of he electro-magnetic machinery and apparatus actually draw out in he sketch-book the other brother sidney also bear testimony : -- he be full of the subject of the telegraph during the walk from the ship and for some day afterwards could scarcely speak about anything else he express himself anxious to make apparatus and try experiment for which he have no material or facility on shipboard in the course of a few day after he arrival he make a kind of cogged or saw-toothed type the object of which i understand be to regulate the interruption of the electric current so as to enable he to make dot and regulate the length of mark or space on the paper upon which the information transmit by he telegraph be to be record he propose at that time a single circuit of wire and only a single circuit and letter word and phrase be to be indicate by numeral and these numeral be to be indicate by dot and other mark and space on paper it seem to I that as wire be cheap it would be better to have twenty-four wire each wire represent a letter of the alphabet but my brother always insist upon the superior advantage of he single circuit thus we see that morse from the very begin and from intuition or inspiration or whatever you please be insistent on one of the point which differentiate he invention from all other in the same field namely its simplicity and it be this feature which eventually win for it a universal adoption but simple as it be it still require much elaboration in order to bring it to perfection for as yet it be but a idea roughly sketch on paper the appliance to put this idea to a practical test have yet to be devise and make and morse now enter upon the most try period of he career he three year in europe while they have be enjoy to the full and have enable he to perfect himself in he art have not yield he large financial return he have not expect that they would but base he hope on increase patronage after he return he be entirely dependent on he brush for the support of himself and he three motherless child and now this new inspiration have come as a disturbing element he be on the horn of a dilemma if he devote himself to he art as he must in order to keep the wolf from the door he would not have the leisure to perfect he invention and other might grasp the prize before he if he allow thought of electric current and magnet and battery to monopolize he attention he could not give to he art notoriously a jealous mistress that worship which alone lead to success a add bar to the rapid development of he invention be the total lack -lrb- hard to realize at the present day -rrb- of the simplest essential there be no manufacturer of electrical appliance everything even to the wind of the wire around the magnet have to be do laboriously by hand even have they exist morse have but scant means with which to purchase they this be he situation when he return from europe in the fall of 1832 and it be small wonder that twelve year elapse before he could prove to the world that he revolutionize invention be a success and the wonder be great that he succeed at all that he do not sink under the manifold discouragement and hardship and let fame and fortune elude he unknown to he many man in different land be work over the same problem some of they of assure scientific position and with good financial backing be it then remarkable that morse in later year hold himself to be but a instrument in the hand of god to carry out he will he never cease to marvel at the amazing fact that he poor scoff at or pity surround by difficulty of every sort should have be choose to wrest the palm from the hand of trained scientist of two continent to we the wonder be not so great for we if we have read he character aright as reveal by he correspondence can see that in he more than in any other man of he time be combine the quality necessary to a great inventor as specify by professor horsford earlier in this chapter in follow morse 's career at this critical period it will be necessary to record he experience both as painter and inventor for there be no thought of abandon he profession in he mind at first on the contrary he still have hope of ultimate success and it be he sole means of livelihood it be true that he at time give way to fit of depression in a letter to he brother richard before leave europe he have thus give expression to he fear : -- i have frequently feel melancholy in thinking of my prospects for encouragement when i return and you letter find I in one of those moment you can not therefore conceive with what feeling i read you offer of a room in you new house give I a resting-place and i will yet move the country in favor of the art i return with some hope but many fear will my country employ I on work which may do it honor i want a commission from government to execute two picture from the life of columbus and i want eight thousand dollar for each and on these two i will stake my reputation as a artist it be in he brother richard 's house that he take the first step towards the construction of the apparatus which be to put he invention to a practical test this be the manufacture of the saw-toothed type by which he propose to open and close the circuit and produce he conventional sign he do not choose the most appropriate place for this operation for he sister-in-law rather pathetically remark : he melt the lead which he use over the fire in the grate of my front parlor and in he operation of cast the type he spill some of the heated metal upon the drugget or loose carpeting before the fireplace and upon a flagbottomed chair upon which he mould be place he be also handicap by illness just after he return as we learn from the follow letter to he friend fenimore cooper in this letter he also make some interesting comment on new york and american affair but curiously enough he say nothing of he invention : _ February 21 1833 _ do not scold at I i do not deserve a scolding if you know all and i do if you do not know all for i have not write to you since i land in November what with severe illness for several week after my arrival and the accumulation of care consequent on so long a absence from home i have be overwhelm and distract by call upon my time for a thousand thing that press upon I for immediate attention and so i have put off and put off what i have be longing -lrb- i be ashamed to say for week if not month -rrb- to do i mean to write to you the truth be my dear sir i have so much to say that i know not where to commence i throw myself on you indulgence and believe you will forgive I i commence without further apology first as to thing at home new york be _ improve _ as the word go wonderfully you will return to a strange city you will not recognize many of you acquaintance among the old building brand-new building store and house be take the place of the good staid modest house of the early settler _ improvement _ be all the rage and house and churchyard must be overthrow and upturn whenever the corporation plough be set to work for the widening of a narrow or the making of a new street i believe you sometimes have a fit of the blues it be singular if you do not with you temperament i confess to many fit of this disagreeable disorder and i know nothing so likely to induce one as the finding after a absence of some year from home the great hour-hand of life sensibly advance on all you former friend what will be you sensation after six or seven year if mine be acute after three year ' absence i have not be much in society as yet i have many visitation but until i clear off the accumulate rubbish of three year which lie upon my table i must decline see much of my friend i have see twice you sister the miss delancy and be prevent from be at they house last Friday evening by the severest snow-storm we have have this season we friend the jay i have meet several time and have have much conversation with they about you and you delightful family mr pa jay be a member of the club so i see he every Friday evening chancellor kent also be a member and both warm friend of yours my time for ten or twelve day past have be occupy in answer a pamphlet of colonel trumbull who come out for the purpose of justify he opposition to measure which have be devise for unite the two academy i send you the first copy hot from the press there be a great deal to dishearten in the state of feeling or rather state of no feeling on the art in this city the only way i can keep up my spirit be by resolutely resist all disposition to repine and by fight perseveringly against all the obstacle that hinder the progress of art i have be tell several time since my return that i be bear one hundred year too soon for the art in we country i have reply that if that be the case i will try and make it but fifty i be more and more persuade that i have quite as much to do with the pen for the art as the pencil and if i can in my day so enlighten the public mind as to make the way easier for those that come after I i do not know that i shall not have serve the cause of the fine art as effectively as by painting picture which might be appreciate one hundred year after i be go if i be to be the pioneer and be fit for it why should i not glory as much in fell tree and clear away the rubbish as in show the decoration suit to a more advanced state of cultivation you will certainly have the blues when you first arrive but the longer you stay abroad the more severe will be the disease excuse my prediction the georgium affair be settle after a fashion not so the nullifier they be infatuate disagreeable as it will be they will be put down with disgrace to they in another letter to mr cooper date February 28 1833 he write in the same vein : -- the south carolina business be probably settle by this time by mr clay 's compromise bill so that the legitimate of europe may stop blow they twopenny trumpet in triumph at we _ disunion _ the same clashing of interest in europe would have cause twenty year of war and torrent of bloodsh with we it have cause three or four year of wordy war and some hundred of gallon of ink but no neck be break nor head all will be in _ statu ante bello _ in a few day my dear sir you be want at home i want you to encourage I by you presence i find the pioneer business have less of romance in the reality than in the description and i find some tough stump to pry up and heavy stone to roll out of the way and i get exhaust and desponding and i should like a little of you sinew to come to my aid at such time as it be wont to come at the louvre there be nothing new in new york everybody be drive after money as usual and there be a alarm of fire every half-hour as usual and the pig have the freedom of the city as usual so that in these respects at least you will find new york as you leave it except that they be not the same people that be drive after money nor the same house burn nor the same pig at large in the street you will all be welcome home but come prepare to find many very many thing in taste and manners different from you own good taste and manners good taste and good manners would not be conspicuous if all around possess the same manners chapter xxii 1833 -- 1836 still painting -- thought on art -- picture of the louvre -- rejection as painter of one of the picture in the capitol -- john quincy adam -- jame fenimore cooper 's article -- death blow to he artistic ambition -- washington allston 's letter -- commission by fellow artist -- definite abandonment of art -- repayment of money advance -- death of lafayette -- religious controversy -- appoint professor in university of city of new york -- description of first telegraphic instrument -- successful experiment -- relay -- address in 1853 it be impossible for the inventor during the next few year to devote himself entirely to the construction of a machine to test he theory impatient though he must have be to put he idea into practical form he two brother come nobly to he assistance and do what lay in they power and accord to they means to help he but it be always repugnant to he to be under pecuniary obligation to any one and while gratefully accept he brother ' help he strain every nerve to earn the money to pay they back we therefore find little or no reference in the letter of those year to he invention and it be not until the year 1835 that he be able to make any appreciable progress towards the perfection of he telegraphic apparatus the intervene year be spend in effort to rouse a interest in the fine art in this country in hard work in behalf of the still young academy of design and in try to earn a living by the practice of he profession during this time he say i never lose faith in the practicability of the invention nor abandon the intention of testing it as soon as i could command the means but in order to command the means he be oblige to devote himself to he art and in this he do not meet with the encouragement which he have expect and which he deserve he ideal be always high perhaps too high for the materialistic age in which he find himself the follow fugitive note will illustrate the trend of he thought and be not inapplicable to condition at the present day : -- be not the refining influence of the fine art need doubly need in we country be there not a tendency in the democracy of we country to low and vulgar pleasure and pursuit do not the contact of those more cultivate in mind and elevated in purpose with those who be less so and to whom the former look for political favor and power necessarily debase that cultivate mind and that elevation of purpose when those be exalt to office who best can flatter the low appetite of the vulgar when boorishness and ill manners be prefer to polish and refinement and when indeed the latter if not avowedly be in reality make a objection be there not danger that those who would otherwise encourage refinement will fear to show they favorable inclination lest those to whom they look for favor shall be displeased and will not habit fix it and another generation bear it as its own inherent native character that he be naturally optimistic be show by a footnote which he add to this thought date October 1833 : -- these be once my fear there be doubtless danger but i believe in the possibility by the diffusion of the highest moral and intellectual cultivation through every class of raise the lower class in refinement but while in he leisure moment he could indulge in such hopeful dream he chief care at that time as state at the beginning of this chapter be to earn money by the exercise of he profession he important painting of the louvre from which he have hope so much be place on exhibition and while it receive high praise from the artist its exhibition barely pay expense and it be finally sell to mr george clarke of hyde hall on otsego lake for thirteen hundred dollar although the artist have expect to get at least twenty-five hundred dollar for it in a letter to mr clarke of June 30 1834 he say : -- the picture of the louvre be intend originally for a exhibition picture and i paint it in the expectation of dispose of it to some person for that purpose who could amply remunerate himself from the receipt of a well-managed exhibition the time occupy upon this picture be fourteen month and at much expense and inconvenience so that that sum -lrb- $ 2500 -rrb- for it if sell under such circumstance would not be more than a fair compensation i be aware that but few if any gentleman in we country would be willing to expend so large a sum on a single picture although in fact they would in this case purchase seven-and-thirty in one i have lately change my plan in relation to this picture and to my art generally and consequently i be able to dispose of it at a much less price i have need of fund to prosecute my new plan and if this picture could now realize the sum of twelve hundred dollar it would at this moment be to I equivalent in value to the sum first set upon it the change of plan no doubt refer to he desire to pursue he electrical experiment and for this ready money be most necessary and so he gladly and even gratefully accept mr clarke 's offer of twelve hundred dollar for the painting and one hundred dollar for the frame even this be not cash but be in the form of a note payable in a year he enthusiasm for he art seem at this period to have be gradually wane although he still strive to command success but it need a decisive stroke to wean he entirely from he first love and fate do not long delay the blow he great ambition have always be to paint historical picture which should commemorate the glorious event in the history of he beloved country in the early part of the year 1834 he great opportunity have apparently come and he be ready and eager to grasp it there be four huge panel in the rotunda of the capitol at washington which be still to be fill by historical painting and a committee in congress be appoint to select the artist to execute they morse president of the national academy of design and enthusiastically support by the best artist in the country have every reason to suppose that he would be choose to execute at least one of these painting confident that he have but to make he wish know to secure the commission he address the follow circular letter to various member of congress among whom be such famous man as daniel webster john c calhoun henry clay and john quincy adam all personally know to he : -- march 7 1834 my dear sir -- i perceive that the library committee have before they the consideration of a resolution on the expediency of employ four artist to paint the remain four picture in the rotunda of the capitol if congress should pass a resolution in favor of the measure i should esteem it a great honor to be select as one of the artist i have devote twenty year of my life of which seven be pass in england france and italy study with special reference to the execution of work of the kind propose and i must refer to my professional life and character in proof of my ability to do honor to the commission and to the country may i take the liberty to ask for myself you favorable recommendation to those in congress who have the disposal of the commission with great respect sir you most obedient servant sfb morse while this letter be write in 1834 the final decision of the committee be not make until 1837 but i shall anticipate a little and give the result which have such a momentous effect on morse 's career there be every reason to believe that he request would be grant and he and he friend many of whom endorse by letter he candidacy have no fear as to the result but here again fate intervene and order differently among the committee man in congress to whom this matter be refer be john quincy adam ex-president of the united state in discuss the subject mr adam submit a resolution open the competition to foreign artist as well as to american give it as he opinion that there be no artist in this country of sufficient talent properly to execute such monumental work the artist and they friend be naturally greatly incense at this slur cast upon they and a indignant and remarkably able reply appear anonymously in the new york evening post the authorship of this article be at once saddle on morse who be know to wield a facile and fearless pen mr adam take great offense and as a result morse 's name be reject and he great opportunity pass he by there can be no reasonable doubt that have he receive this commission he would have defer the perfecting of he telegraphic device until other have so far distance he in the race that he could never have overtake they instead of he have be the author of the evening post article it transpire that he have not even hear of mr adam 's resolution until he friend fenimore cooper the real author of the answer tell he of both attack and reply this be the second great tragedy of morse 's life the first be the untimely death of he young wife and this other marked the death of he hope and ambition as a artist he be stunned the blow be as unexpected as it be overwhelming and what add to its bitterness be that it have be innocently deal by the hand of one of he dearest friend who have seek to render he a favor the truth come out too late to influence the decision of the committee the die be cast and he whole future be change in the twinkling of a eye for what have be to he a joy and a inspiration he now turn from in despair he could not of course realize at the time that fate in deal he this cruel blow be dedicate he to a higher destiny it be doubtful if he ever fully realize this for in after year he could never speak of it unmoved in a letter to this same friend fenimore cooper write on November 20 1849 he thus lament : -- alas my dear sir the very name of _ picture _ produce a sadness of heart i can not describe painting have be a smile mistress to many but she have be a cruel jilt to I i do not abandon she she abandon I i have take scarcely any interest in painting for many year will you believe it when last in paris in 1845 i do not go into the louvre nor do i visit a single picture gallery i sometimes indulge a vague dream that i may paint again it be rather the memory of past pleasure when hope be entice I onward only to deceive I at last except some family portrait valuable to I from they likeness only i could wish that every picture i ever paint be destroy i have no wish to be remember as a painter for i never be a painter my ideal of that profession be perhaps too exalted -- i may say be too exalted i leave it to other more worthy to fill the niche of art of course he self-condemnation be too severe for we have see that present-day critic assign he a honorable place in the annals of art and while at the time of write that letter he have definitely abandon the brush he continue to paint for some year after he rejection by the committee of congress he have to for it be he only means of earn a livelihood but the old enthusiasm be go never to return fortunately for himself and for the world however he transfer it to the perfecting of he invention and devoted all the time he could steal from the daily routine of he duty to that end he friend sympathize with he most heartily and be indignant at he rejection washington allston write to he : -- i have learn the disposition of the picture i have hope to find you name among the commission artist but i be grieve to find that all my effort in you behalf have prove fruitless i know what you disappointment must have be at this result and most sincerely do i sympathize with you that my effort be both sincere and conscientious i hope will be some consolation to you but let not this disappointment cast you down my friend you have it still in you power to let the world know what you can do dismiss it then from you mind and determine to paint all the better for it god bless you you affectionate friend washington allston the follow sentence from a letter write on march 14 1837 by thoma cole one of the most celebrated of the early american painter will show in what estimation morse be hold by he brother artist : -- i have learn with mortification and disappointment that you name be not among the _ choose _ and i have fear that you would carry into effect you resolution of abandon the art and resign the presidency of we academy i sincerely hope you will have reason to cast aside that resolution to you we academy owe its existence and present prosperity and if in after time it should become a great institution you name will always be couple with its greatness but if you leave we i very much fear that the fabric will crumble to piece you be the keystone of the arch if you remain with we time may furnish the academy with another block for the place i hope my fear may be vain and that circumstance will conspire to induce you to remain we president other friend be equally sympathetic and morse do retain the presidency of the academy until 1845 to emphasize further they regard for he a number of artist head by thoma s cumming unknown to morse raise by subscription three thousand dollar to be give to he for the painting of some historical subject general cumming in he annals of the academy thus describe the receipt of the news by the discourage artist : -- the effect be electrical it rouse he from he depression and he exclaim that never have he read or know of such a act of professional generosity and that he be fully determine to paint the picture -- he favorite subject ` the signing of the first compact on board the mayflower ' -- not of small size as request but of the size of the panel in the rotunda that be immediately assent to by the committee think it possible that one or the other of the picture so order might fail in execution in which case it would afford favorable inducement to its substitution and of course much to mr morse 's profit as the artist from the first never contemplate take possession of the picture so execute it be to remain with mr morse and for he use and benefit the enthusiasm thus rouse be but a flash in the pan however the wound he have receive be too deep to be thus heal some of the money be raise and pay to he and he make study and sketch for the painting but he mind be now on he invention and the painting of the picture be defer from year to year and finally abandon it be characteristic of he that when he do finally decide to give up the execution of this work he pay back the sum which have be advance to he with interest another grief which come to he in the summer of 1834 -lrb- to return to that year -rrb- be the death of he illustrious friend general lafayette the last letter receive from he be write by he amanuensis and unsigned and simply say : -- general lafayette be detain by sickness have send to the reporter of the committee the follow note which the say reporter have read to the house the note refer to be unfortunately miss this letter be write on April 29 and the general die on may 20 morse send a letter of sympathy to the son george washington lafayette a member of the chamber of deputy in which the follow sentiment occur : -- in common with this whole country now clothe in mourn with the lover of true liberty and of exalted philanthropy throughout the world i bemoan the departure from earth of you immortal parent yet i may be permit to indulge in additional feeling of more private sorrow at the loss of one who honor I with he friendship and have not cease till within a few day of he death to send to I occasional mark of he affectionate remembrance be assure my dear sir that the memory of you father will be especially endear to I and mine morse 's admiration of lafayette be most sincere and he be greatly influence in he political feeling by he intercourse with that famous man among other opinion which he share with lafayette and other thoughtful man be the fear of a roman catholic plot to gain control of the government of the united state he defend he view fearlessly and vigorously in the public press and by means of pamphlet and later enter into a heated controversy with bishop spaulding of kentucky i shall not attempt to treat exhaustively of these controversy but think it only right to refer to they from time to time not only that the clearest possible light may be shed upon morse 's character and conviction but to show the extraordinary activity of he brain which while he be struggle against obstacle of all kind not only to make he invention a success but for the very mean of existence could yet busy itself with the champion of what he conceive to be the right to illustrate he point of view i shall quote a few extract from a letter to r willington esq who be the editor of a journal which be refer to as the courier this letter be write on may 20 1835 when morse 's mind we should think would have be wholly absorb in the detail of the infant telegraph : -- with regard to the more important matter of the conspiracy i perceive with regret that the evidence which have be convince to so many mind of the first order and which continue daily to spread conviction of the truth of the charge i have make be still view by the editor of the ` courier ' as inconclusive my situation in regard to those who dissent from I be somewhat singular i have bring against the absolute government of europe a charge of conspiracy against the liberty of the united state i support the charge by fact and by reasoning from those fact which produce conviction on most of those who examine the matter but those that dissent simply say ' i do not think there be a conspiracy ' yet give no reason for dissent the catholic journal very artfully make no defense themselves but adroitly make use of the protestant defense kindly prepare for they no catholic journal have attempt any refutation of the charge it can not be refute for it be true and be assure my dear sir it be no extravagant prediction when i say that the question of popery and protestantism or absolutism and republicanism which in these two opposite category be convertible term be fast become and will shortly be the _ great absorb question _ not only of this country but of the whole civilized world i speak not at random i speak from long and diligent observation in europe and from comparison of the state of affair in this country with the state of public opinion in europe we be asleep sir when every freeman should be awake and look to he arm surely if the danger be groundless there can be no harm in endeavor to ascertain its groundlessness if you be tell you house be on fire you would hardly think of call the man a maniac for inform you of it even if he should use a tone of voice and gesture somewhat earnest and impassion the course of some of we journal on the subject of popery have lead to the belief that they be covertly under the control of the jesuit and let I say sir that the mode of control in the resource of this insidious society notorious for its political art and intrigue be more numerous more powerful and more various than a unsuspicious people be at all conscious of mr y fall into the common error and deprecate what he call a _ religious _ controversy as if the subject of popery be altogether religious history it appear to I must have be read to very little purpose by any one who can entertain such a error in regard to the cunningest political despotism that ever curse mankind i must refer you to the preface of the second edition which i send you for my reasoning on that point if they be not conclusive i should be glad to be show wherein they be defective if they be conclusive be it not time for every patriot to open he eye to the truth of the fact that we be politically attack under guise of a religious system and be it not a serious question whether we political press should advocate the cause of foreign enemy to we government or help to expose and repel they it be in the year 1835 that morse be appoint professor of the literature of the art of design in the university of the city of new york and here again we can mark the guide hand of fate a few year earlier he have be tentatively offer the position of instructor of draw at the united state military academy at west point but this offer he have promptly but courteously decline have he accept it he would have miss the opportunity of meet certain man who give he valuable assistance as a instructor in the university he not only receive a small salary which relieve he in a measure from the grind necessity of painting pot-boiler but he have assign to he spacious room in the building on washington square which he could utilize not only as studio and live apartment but as a workshop for these room however he pay a rent at first of $ 325 a year afterwards of $ 400 three year have clasp since he first conception of the invention and although burn to devote himself to its perfect he have be compel to hold himself in check and to devote all he time to painting now however a opportunity come to he for he move into the university building before it be entirely finish and the stairway be in such a embryonic state that he could not expect sitter to attempt they perilous ascent this enforced leisure give he the chance he have long desire and he throw himself heart and soul into he electrical experiment write of this period in later year he thus record he struggle : -- -lrb- illustration : first telegraph instrument 1837 now in the national museum washington -rrb- there i immediately commence with very limited means to experiment upon my invention my first instrument be make up of a old picture or canvas frame fasten to a table the wheel of a old wooden clock move by a weight to carry the paper forward three wooden drum upon one of which the paper be wind and pass over the other two a wooden pendulum suspend to the top piece of the picture or stretching-frame and vibrate across the paper as it pass over the center wooden drum a pencil at the lower end of the pendulum in contact with the paper a electro-magnet fasten to a shelf across the picture or stretch frame opposite to a armature make fast to the pendulum a type rule and type for break the circuit rest on a endless band compose of carpet-binding which pass over two wooden roller move by a wooden crank and carry forward by point project from the bottom of the rule downward into the carpet-binding a lever with a small weight on the upper side and a tooth project downward at one end operate on by the type and a metallic fork also project downward over two mercury cup and a short circuit of wire embrace the helix of the electro-magnet connect with the positive and negative pole of the battery and terminate in the mercury cup this first rude instrument be carefully preserve by the inventor and be now in the morse case in the national museum at washington a reproduction of it be here give i shall omit certain technical detail in the inventor 's account of this first instrument but i wish to call attention to he ingenuity in adapt the means at he disposal to the end desire much capital have be make by those who oppose he claim out of the fact that this primitive apparatus could only produce a v-shaped mark thus -- __ __ _ \ \/ | __ | | \/ \ \/ | \/ \ \/ | __ \/ -- and not a dot and a dash which they insist be of later introduction and by another hand but a reference to the sketch make on board the sully will show that the original system of sign consist of dot and line and that the first conception of the means to produce these sign be by a up-and-down motion of a lever control by a electro-magnet it be easy to befog a issue by misstate fact but the fact be here to speak for themselves and that morse temporarily abandon he first idea because he have not the means at he disposal to embody it in workable form and have recourse to another method for produce practically the same result only show wonderful ingenuity on he part it can easily be see that the wave line trace by the first instrument -- thus __ __ _ \ \/ | __ | | \/ \ \/ | \/ \ \/ | __ \/ -- can be translate by read the lower part into a i u - - of the final morse alphabet the beginning of every great invention have be clumsy and uncouth compare with the result attain by year of study and elaboration participate in by many clever brain contrast the clermont of fulton with the float palace of the present day the rocket of stephenson with the powerful locomotive of we mile-a-minute flier and the hand-press of gutenberg with the marvellous and intricate hoe press of modern time and yet the name of those who first conceive and work these primitive contrivance stand highest in the roll of fame and with justice for it be infinitely easier to improve on the suggestion of another than to originate a practical advance in human endeavor return again to morse 's own account of he early experiment i shall quote the following sentence : -- with this apparatus rude as it be and complete before the first of the year 1836 i be enable to and do mark down telegraphic intelligible sign and to make and do make distinguishable sound for telegraph and have arrive at that point i exhibit it to some of my friend early in that year and among other to professor leonard d gale who be a college professor in the university i also experiment with the chemical power of the electric current in 1836 and succeed in mark my telegraphic sign upon paper dip in turmeric and solution of the sulphate of soda -lrb- as well as other salt -rrb- by pass the current through it i be soon satisfied however that the electro - _ magnetic _ power be more available for telegraphic purpose and possess many advantage over any other and i turn my thought in that direction early in 1836 i procured forty foot of wire and put it in the circuit i find that my battery of one cup be not sufficient to work my instrument this result suggest to I the probability that the magnetism to be obtain from the electric current would diminish in proportion as the circuit be lengthen so as to be insufficient for any practical purpose at great distance and to remove that probable obstacle to my success i conceive the idea of combine two or more circuit together in the manner describe in my first patent each with a independent battery make use of the magnetism of the current on the first to close and break the second the second the third and so on thus modestly do he refer to what be in fact a wonderful discovery the more wonderful because of its simplicity professor horsford thus comment on it : -- in 1835 morse make the discovery of the _ relay _ the most brilliant of all the achievement to which he name must be forever attach it be a discovery of a means by which the current which through distance from its source have become feeble could be reënforced or renew this discovery accord to the different object for which it be employ be variously know as the register magnet the local circuit the marginal circuit the repeater etc professor horsford place the date of this discovery in the year 1835 but morse himself in the statement quote above assign it to the early part of 1836 it be only fair to note that the discovery of the principle of the relay be make independently by other scientist notably by davy wheatstone and henry but morse apparently antedate they by a year or two and could not possibly have be indebted to any of they for the idea this point have give rise to much discussion among scientist which it will not be necessary to enter into here for all authority agree in accord to morse independent invention of the relay up to the autumn of 1837 again to quote morse 's own word my telegraphic apparatus exist in so rude a form that i feel a reluctance to have it see my means be very limited -- so limited as to preclude the possibility of construct a apparatus of such mechanical finish as to warrant my success in venture upon its public exhibition i have no wish to expose to ridicule the representative of so many hour of laborious think prior to the summer of 1837 at which time mr alfr vail 's attention become attract to my telegraph i depend upon my pencil for subsistence indeed so straitened be my circumstance that in order to save time to carry out my invention and to economize my scanty means i have for month lodge and eat in my studio procure my food in small quantity from some grocery and prepare it myself to conceal from my friend the stinted manner in which i live i be in the habit of bring my food to my room in the evening and this be my mode of life for many year nearly twenty year later in 1853 morse refer to this try period in he career at a meeting of the association of the alumnus of the university : -- yesternight on once more enter you chapel i see the same marble staircase and marble floor i once so often trod and so often with a heart and head overburdened with almost crush anxiety separate from the chapel by but a thin partition be that room i occupy now you philomathean hall whose wall -- have thought and mental struggle with the alternation of joy and sorrow the power of be daguerreotype upon they -- would show a thickly stud gallery of evidence that there the briarean infant be bear who have stretch forth he arm with the intent to encircle the world yes that room of the university be the birthplace of the recording telegraph attempt indeed have be make to assign to it other parentage and to its birthplace other locality personally i have very little anxiety on this point except that the truth should not suffer for i have a consciousness which neither sophistry nor ignorance can shake that that room be the place of its birth and a confidence too that its cradle be in hand that will sustain its rightful claim the old building of the university of the city of new york on washington square have be tear down to be replace by a mercantile structure the university have move to more spacious quarter in the upper part of the great city but one of its notable building be the hall of fame and among the first name to be immortalize in bronze in the stately colonnade be that of samuel fb morse chapter xxiii 1835 -- 1837 first exhibition of the telegraph -- testimony of robert g rankin and rev henry b tappan -- cooke and wheatstone -- joseph henry leonard d gale and alfred vail -- professor gale 's testimony -- professor henry 's discovery -- regrettable controversy of later year -- professor charle t jackson 's claim -- alfred vail -- contract of September 23 1837 -- work at morristown new jersey -- the morse alphabet -- reading by sound -- first and second form of alphabet in after year the question of the time when the telegraph be first exhibit to other be a dispute one it will therefore be well to give the testimony of a few man of undoubted integrity who personally witness the first experiment robert g rankin esq give he reminiscence to mr prime from which i shall select the follow passage : -- professor morse be one of the purest and noblest man of any age i believe i be among the earliest outside of he family circle to whom he communicate he design to encircle the globe with wire some time in the fall of 1835 i be pass along the easterly walk of washington parade-ground lead from waverly place to fourth street when i hear my name call on turn round i see over the picketfence a outstretched arm from a person standing in the middle or main entrance door of the unfinished university building of new york and immediately recognize the professor who beckon I toward he on meeting and exchange salutation -- and you know how genial he be -- he take I by the arm and say : ' i wish you to go up in my sanctum and examine a piece of mechanism which if you may not believe in _ you _ at least will not laugh at as i fear some other will i want you to give I you frank opinion as a friend for i know you interest in and love of the apply science ' here follow a description of what he see and morse 's explanation and then he continue : -- a long silence on the part of each ensue which be at length break by my exclamation : ` well professor you have a pretty play -- theoretically true but practically useful only as a mantel ornament or for a mistress in the parlor to direct the maid in the cellar but professor _ cui bono _ in imagination one can make a new earth and improve all the land communication of we old one but my unfortunate practicality stand in the way of my comprehension as yet ' we then have a long conversation on the subject of magnetism and its modification and if i do not recollect the very word which clothe he thought they be substantially as follow he have be long impress with the belief that god have create the great force of nature not only as manifestation of he own infinite power but as expression of good-will to man to do he good and that every one of god 's great force could yet be utilize for man 's welfare that modern science be constantly evolve from the hitherto hide secret of nature some new development promotive of human welfare and that at no distant day magnetism would do more for the advancement of human sociology than any of the material force yet know that he would scarcely dare to compare spiritual with material force yet that analogically magnetism would do in the advancement of human welfare what the spirit of god would do in the moral renovation of man 's nature that it would educate and enlarge the force of the world he say he have feel as if he be do a great work for god 's glory as well as for man 's welfare that such have be he long cherish think he whole soul and heart appear fill with a glow of love and good-will and he sensitive and impassioned nature seem almost to transform he in my eye into a prophet it require indeed the inspirational vision of a prophet to foresee in those narrow skeptical day the tremendous part which electricity be to play in the civilization of a future age and i wish again to lay stress on the fact that it be the telegraph which first harness this mysterious force and open the eye of the world to the availability of a power which have lie dormant through all the age but which be now for the first time to be bring under the control of man and which be destine to rival and eventually to displace in many way its elder brother steam be not morse 's ambition to confer a lasting good on he fellowman more fully realize than even he himself at that time comprehend the reverend henry b tappan who in 1835 be a colleague of morse 's in the new york university and afterwards president of the university of michigan give he testimony in reply to a request from morse and among other thing he say : -- in 1835 you have advance so far that you be prepare to give on a small scale a practical demonstration of the possibility of transmit and record word through distance by means of a electro-magnetic arrangement i be one of the limited circle whom you invite to witness the first experiment in a long room of the university you have wire extend from end to end where the magnetic apparatus be arrange it be not necessary for I to describe particulars which have now become familiar to every one the fact which i recall with the liveliest interest and which i mention in conversation at mr bancroft 's as one of the choicest recollection of my life be that of the first transmission and recording of a telegraphic dispatch i suppose of course that you have already make these experiment before the company arrive whom you have invite but i claim to have witness _ the first transmission and recording of word _ by lightning ever make public the arrangement which you exhibit on the above mention occasion as well as the mode of receive the dispatch be substantially the same as those you now employ i feel certain that you have then already grasp the whole invention however you may have since perfect the detail other bear testimony in similar word so that we may regard it as prove that both in 1835 and 1836 demonstration be make which uncouth though they be compare to present-day perfection prove that the electric telegraph be about to emerge from the realm of fruitless experiment among these witness be daniel huntington hon hamilton fish and commodore shubrick and several of these gentleman assert that at that early period morse confidently predict that europe and america would eventually be unite by a electric wire the letter write by morse during these critical year have become hopelessly dispersed and but few have come into my possession he brother be both in new york so that there be no necessity of write to they and the letter write to other can not at this late day be trace as he also unfortunately do not keep a journal i must depend on the testimony of other and on he own recollection in later year for a chronicle of he struggle the pencil copy of a letter write to a friend in albany on August 27 1837 have however survive and the follow sentence will i think be find interesting : -- thanks to you my dear c -- for the concern you express in regard to my health it have be perfectly good and be now with the exception of a little anxiety in relation to the telegraph and to my great pictorial undertaking which wear the furrow of my face a little deeper my telegraph in all its essential point be test to my own satisfaction and that of the scientific gentleman who have see it but the machinery -lrb- all which from its peculiar character i have be compel to make myself -rrb- be imperfect and before it can be perfect i have reason to fear that other nation will take the hint and rob I both of the credit and the profit there be indication of this in the foreign journal lately receive i have a defender in the ` journal of commerce ' -lrb- which i send you that you may know what be the progress of the matter -rrb- and doubtless other journal of we country will not allow foreign nation to take the credit of a invention of such vast importance as they assign to it when they learn that it certainly belong to america there be not a think in any one of the foreign journal relative to the telegraph which i have not express nearly five year ago on my passage from france to scientific friend and when it be consider how quick a hint fly from mind to mind and be soon past all trace back to the original suggester of the hint it be certainly by no means improbable that the excitement on the subject in england have its origin from my give the detail of the plan of my telegraph to some of the englishman or other fellow-passenger on board the ship or to some of the many i have since make acquaint with it during the five year past in this he be mistake for the english telegraph of cooke and wheatstone be quite different in principle use the deflection by a current of electricity of a delicately adjust needle to point to the letter of the alphabet while this be in use in england for a number of year it be gradually supersede by the morse telegraph which prove its decide superiority it be also worthy of note that in this letter and in all future letter and article he with pardonable pride use a capital t in speaking of he telegraph one of the most difficult of the problem which confront the historian who sincerely wish to deal dispassionately with he subject be justly to apportion the credit which must be give to different worker in the same field of endeavor and especially in that of invention for every invention be but a improvement on something which have go before the sail-boat be a advance on the rude dugout propel by paddle the first clumsy steamboat seem a marvel to those who have know no other propulsive power than that of the wind or the oar the horse-drawn vehicle succeed the litter and the palanquin to be in turn follow by the locomotive and so the telegraph as a means of rapidly communicate intelligence between distant point be the logical successor of the signal fire and the semaphore in all of these improvement by man upon what man have before accomplish the pioneer be not only dependent upon what he predecessor have achieve but in almost every case be compel to call to he assistance other worker to whom could be confide some of the minutiæ which be essential to the successful launching of the new enterprise i have show conclusively that the idea of transmit intelligence by electricity be original with morse in that he be unaware until some year after he first conception that anyone else have ever think of it i have also show that he unaided by other invent and make with he own hand a machine rude though it may have be which actually do transmit and record intelligence by means of the electric current and in a manner entirely different from the method employ by other but he have now come to a point where knowledge of what other have accomplish along the same line would greatly facilitate he labor and when the assistance of one more skilled in mechanical construction be a great desideratum and both of these essential be at hand it be quite possible that he might have succeed in work out the problem absolutely unaided just as a man might become a great painter without instruction without a knowledge of the accumulate wisdom of those who precede he and without the assistance of the color-maker and the manufacturer of brush and canvas but the artist be none the less a genius because he listen to the counsel of he master profit by the experience of other and purchase he supplies instead of grind he own color and laboriously manufacture he own canvas and brush the three man to whom morse be most indebted for material assistance in he labor at this critical period be professor joseph henry professor leonard d gale and alfr vail and it be my earnest desire to do full justice to all of they unfortunately after the telegraph have become a assure success and even down to the present day the claim of morse have be bitterly assail both by well-meaning person and by the unscrupulous who seek to break down he patent rights and the name of these three man be freely use in the effort to prove that to one or all of they more credit be due than to morse now after the lapse of nearly three quarter of a century the verdict have be give in favor of morse he name alone be accept as that of the inventor of the telegraph and in this work it be my aim to prove that the judgment of posterity have not err but also to give full credit to those who aid he when he be most in need of assistance my task in some instance will be a delicate one i shall have to prick some bubble for the friend of some of these man have claim too much for they and on that account have be bitter in they accusation against morse i shall also have to acknowledge some error of judgment on the part of morse for the malice of other foment a dispute between he and one of these three man which cause a permanent estrangement and be greatly to be regret the first of the three to enter into the history of the telegraph be leonard d gale who in 1836 be a professor in the university of the city of new york and he have give he recollection of those early day avoid a repetition of fact already record i shall quote some sentence from professor gale 's statement after describe the first instrument which he see in January of 1836 he continue : -- during the year 1836 and beginning of 1837 the study of professor morse on he telegraph i find much interrupt by he attention to he professional duty i understand that want of pecuniary means prevent he from procure to be make such mechanical improvement and such substantial workmanship as would make the operation of he invention more exact in the month of march and April 1837 the announcement of a extraordinary telegraph on the visual plan -lrb- as it afterwards prove to be -rrb- the invention of two french gentleman of the name of gonon and servell be go the round of the papers the thought occur to I as well as to professor morse and some other of he friend that the invention of he electro-magnetic telegraph have somehow become known and be the origin of the new telegraph thus conspicuously announce this announcement at once arouse professor morse to renew exertion to bring the new invention creditably before the public and to consent to a public announcement of the existence of he invention from April to September 1837 professor morse and myself be engage together in the work of prepare magnet wind wire construct battery etc in the university for a experiment on a larger but still very limited scale in the little leisure that each have to spare and be at the same time much cramped for fund the latter part of August 1887 the operation of the instrument be show to numerous visitor at the university on Saturday the 2d of September 1837 professor daubeny of the english oxford university be on a visit to this country be invite with a few friend to see the operation of the telegraph in its then rude form in the cabinet of the new york university where it have then be put up with a circuit of seventeen hundred foot of copper wire stretch back and forth in that long room professor daubeny professor torrey and mr alfr vail be present among other this exhibition of the telegraph although of very rude and imperfectly construct machinery demonstrate to all present the practicability of the invention and it result in enlist the mean the skill and the zeal of mr alfr vail who early the next week call at the room and have a more perfect explanation from professor morse of the character of the invention it be professor gale who first call morse 's attention to the discovery of professor joseph henry especially to that of the intensity magnet and he thus describe the interesting event : -- morse 's machine be complete in all its part and operate perfectly through a circuit of some forty foot but there be not sufficient force to send message to a distance at this time i be a lecturer on chemistry and from necessity be acquaint with all kind of galvanic battery and know that a battery of one or a few cup generate a large quantity of electricity capable of produce heat etc but not of project electricity to a great distance and that to accomplish this a battery of many cup be necessary it be therefore evident to I that the one large cup-battery of morse should be make into ten or fifteen smaller one to make it a battery of intensity so as to project the electric fluid accordingly i substitute the battery of many cup for the battery of one cup the remain defect in the morse machine as first see by I be that the coil of wire around the pole of the electro-magnet consist of but a few turn only while to give the greatest projectile power the number of turn should be increase from ten to hundred as show by professor henry in he paper publish in the ` american journal of science ' 1831 after substitute the battery of twenty cup for that of a single cup we add some hundred or more turn to the coil of wire around the pole of the magnet and send a message through two hundred foot of conductor then through one thousand foot and then through ten mile of wire arrange on reel in my own lecture-room in the new york university in the presence of friend this be a most important step in hasten the reduction of the invention to a practical workable basis and i wish here to bear testimony to the great service of professor henry in make this possible he valuable discovery be freely give to the world with no attempt on he part to patent they which be perhaps to be regret but much more be it to be deplore that in the litigation which ensue a few year later morse and henry be draw into a controversy foster and foment by other for they own pecuniary benefit which involve the honor and veracity of both of these distinguish man both be man of the greatest sensitiveness proud and jealous of they own integrity and the breach once make be never heal of the rights and wrong of this controversy i may have occasion later on to treat more in detail although i should much prefer to dismiss it with the acknowledgment that there be much to deplore in what be say and write by morse although he sincerely believe himself to be in the right and much to regret in some of the statement and action of henry at this late day when the mist which envelop the question have roll away it seem but simple justice to admit that the wonderful discovery of henry be essential to the successful work over long distance of morse 's discovery and invention just as the discovery and invention of earlier and contemporary scientist be essential to henry 's improvement but it be also just to place emphasis on the fact that henry 's experiment be purely scientific he never attempt to put they in concrete form for the use of mankind in general they lead up to the telegraph they be not a practical telegraph in themselves it be morse who add the final link in the long chain and by combine the discovery of other with those which he have himself make give to the world this wonderful new agent a recent writer in the scientific american give utterance to the follow sentiment which it seem to I most aptly describe this difference : we need physical discovery and revere those who seek truth for its own sake but mankind with keen instinct save its warmest acclaim for those who also make discovery of some avail in add to the length of life its joy its possibility its convenience we must also remember that while the baby telegraph have in 1837 be recognize as a promising infant by a very few scientist and personal friend of the inventor it be still regard with suspicion if not with scorn by the general public and even by many man of scholarly attainment and a long and heart-breaking struggle for existence be ahead of it before it should reach maturity and develop into the lusty giant of the present day here again morse prove that he be the one man of he generation most eminently fit to fight for the child of he brain to endure and to persevere until the victor 's crown be grasp it be always idle to speculate on what might have happen if certain event have not take place if certain man have not meet certain other man a telegraph would undoubtedly have be invent if morse have never be bear or he might have perfect he invention without the aid and advice of other or with the assistance of different man from those who appear at the psychological moment but we be deal with fact and not with supposition and the fact be that through professor gale he be make acquaint with the discovery of joseph henry which have be publish to the world several year before and could have be use by other if they have have the wit or genius to grasp they significance and hit upon the right means to make they of practical utility morse be ever ready cheerfully to acknowledge the assistance which have be give to he by other but at the same time he always take the firm stand that this do not give they a claim to a equal share with himself in the honor of the invention in a long letter to professor charle t jackson write on September 18 1837 he vigorously but courteously repudiate the claim of the latter to have be a co-inventor on board the sully and he prove he point for jackson not only know nothing of the plan adopt by morse and carry by he to a successful issue but have never suggest anything of a practical nature at the same time morse freely acknowledge that the conversation between they on the ship suggest to he the train of thought which culminate in the invention for he add : -- you say ' i trust you will take care that the proper share of credit shall be give to I when you make public you doings ' this i always have do and with pleasure i have always give you credit for great genius and acquirement and have always say in give any account of my telegraph that it be during a scientific conversation with you on board the ship that i first conceive the thought of a electric telegraph be there really any more that you will claim or that i could in truth and justice give i have acknowledgment of a similar kind to make to professor silliman and to professor gale to the former of whom i be under precisely similar obligation with yourself for several useful hint and to the latter i be most of all indebted for substantial and effective aid in many of my experiment if any one have a claim to be consider as a mutual inventor on the score of aid by hint it be professor gale but he prefer no claim of the kind and he never do prefer such a claim -lrb- although it be make for he by other -rrb- but remain always loyal to morse jackson on the other hand insist on press he demand although it be a absurd one and he be a thorn in the flesh to morse for many year it will not be necessary to go into the matter in detail as jackson be through he wild claim to other invention and discovery thoroughly discredit and he view have now no weight in the scientific world the third person who come to the assistance of morse at this critical period be alfr vail son of judge stephen vail of morristown new jersey in 1837 he be a young man of thirty and have graduate from the university of the city of new york in 1836 he be present at the exhibition of morse 's invention on the 2d of September 1837 and he at once grasp its great possibility after become satisfied that morse 's device of the relay would permit of operation over great distance he express a desire to become associate with the inventor in the perfect and exploitation of the invention he father be the proprietor of the speedwell iron work in morristown and young vail have have some experience in the manufacture of mechanical appliance in the factory although he have take the theological course at the university with the intention of enter the presbyterian ministry he have abandon the idea of become a clergyman however on account of ill-health and be for a time uncertain as to he future career when the interest arouse by the sight of morse 's machine settle the matter and after consult with he father and brother he enter into a agreement with morse on the 23d day of September 1837 in the contract draw up between they vail bind himself to construct at he own expense a complete set of instrument to defray the cost of secure patent in this country and abroad and to devote he time to both these purpose it be also agree that each should at once communicate to the other any improvement or new invention bearing on the simplification or perfecting of the telegraph and that such improvement or invention should be hold to be the property of each in the proportion in which they be to share in any pecuniary benefit which might accrue as the only way in which morse could at that time pay vail for he service and for money advance he give he a one-fourth interest in the invention in this country and one half in what might be obtain from europe this be in the follow march change to three sixteenth in the united state and one fourth in europe morse have now secure two essential most necessary to the rapid perfection of he invention the means to purchase material and a assistant more skilled than he in mechanical construction and who be imbue with faith in the ultimate success of the enterprise now begin the serious work of put the invention into such a form that it could demonstrate to the skeptical its capability of perform what be then consider a miracle it be hard for we at the present time when new marvel of science and invention be of everyday occurrence to realize the hidebound incredulousness which prevail during the first half of the nineteenth century man tap they forehead and shake they head in speaking of morse and he visionary scheme and deeply regret that here be the case of a brilliant man and excellent artist evidently go wrong but he be not to be turn from he great purpose by the jeer of the ignorant and the anxious solicitation of he friend and he be greatly hearten by the encouragement of such man as gale and vail they all three work over the problem yet to be solve morse go backwards and forwards between new york and morristown that both gale and vail suggest improvement which be adopt by morse can be take for grant but as i have say before to modify or elaborate something originate by another be a comparatively easy matter and the basic idea first conceive by morse on the sully be retain throughout all the detail of these experiment have not be record but i believe that at first a attempt be make to put into a more finished form the principle of the machine make by morse with its swing pendulum trace a wave line but this be soon abandon in favor of a instrument use the up-and-down motion of a lever as draw in the 1832 sketch-book in other word it be a return to first principle as think out by morse and not as some would have we believe something entirely new suggest and invent independently by vail it be rather unfortunate and curious in view of morse 's love of simplicity that he at first insist on use the dot and dash to indicate number only the number to correspond to word in a specially prepared dictionary he argument in favor of this plan be specious but the event have prove that he reasoning be faulty he first idea be that the telegraph should belong to the government that intelligence send should be secret by means of a kind of cipher that it would take less time to send a number than each letter of each word especially in the case of the longer word and finally that although the labor in prepare a dictionary of all the most important word in the language and give to each its number would be great once do it would be do for all time i say that this be unfortunate because the fact that the telegraphic alphabet of dot and dash be not use until after he association with vail have lend strength to the claim on the part of vail 's family and friend that he be the inventor of it and not morse this claim have be so insistently and even bitterly make especially after morse 's death that it gain wide credence and have even be incorporate in some encyclopedia and history fortunately it can be easily disprove and i be desirous of finally settle this vexed question because i consider the conception of this simplest of all conventional alphabet one of the grandest of morse 's invention and one which have confer great good upon mankind it be use to convey intelligence not only by electricity but in many other way its cabalistic character can be read by the eye the ear and the touch just as the name of ampère volta and watt have be use to designate certain property or thing discover by they so the name of morse be immortalize in the alphabet invent by he the telegraph operator all over the world send morse when they tick off the dot and dash of the alphabet and happily i can prove that this be not a honor filch from another it be a matter of record that vail himself never claim in any of he letter or diary -lrb- and these be voluminous -rrb- that he have anything to do with the devise of this conventional alphabet even with the modification of the first form on the other hand in several letter to morse he refer to it as be morse 's for instance in a letter of April 20 1848 he use the word you system of mark _ line _ and _ dot _ which you have patent all the evidence bring forward by the advocate of vail be purely hearsay he be say to have say that he invent the alphabet morse however always in every one of he many write reference to the matter speak of it as my conventional alphabet in a article which i contribute to the century magazine of march 1912 i treat this question at length and prove by documentary evidence that morse alone devise the dot-and-dash alphabet it will not be necessary for I to repeat all this evidence here i shall simply give enough to prove conclusively that the morse alphabet have not be misname the following be a fugitive note which be reproduce photographically in the century article : -- mr vail in he work on the telegraph at p 32 intimate that the saw-teeth type for letter as he have describe they in the diagram -lrb- 9 -rrb- be devise by I as early as the year 1832 two of the element of these letter indeed be then devise the dot and space and use in construct the type for numeral but so far as my recollection now serve I it be not until i experiment with the first instrument in 1835 that i add the -- dash which supply I with the three element for combination for letter it be on notice the fact that when the circuit be close a longer time than be necessary to make a dot there be produce a line or dash that if i rightly remember the broken part of a continuous line as the means of imprint at a distance be suggest to I since the inequality of long and short line separate by long and short space give I all the variation or combination of long and short line necessary to form the alphabet the date of the code complete must therefore be put at 1835 and not 1832 although at the date of 1832 the principle of the code be _ evolve _ in addition to this be a definite claim in write on the part of morse that he have devise a alphabetic code in 1836 two year before vail have ever hear of the telegraph it be well to note he scrupulous insistence on historical accuracy in a letter to professor gale refer to reading by sound as well as by sight occur the following sentence -lrb- let I remark by the way that it be interesting to note that morse thus early recognize the possibility of reading by sound a honor which have be claim for many other -rrb- exactly at what time i recognize the adaptation of the difference in the interval in read the _ letter _ as well as the numeral i have now no means of fix except in a general manner it be however almost immediately on the construction of the letter by dot and line and this be some little time previous to you see the instrument soon after the first operation of the instrument in 1835 in which the type for write number be use i not only conceive the letter type but make they from some lead use in the printing-office i have still quite a quantity of these type they be use in washington as well as the type for numeral in the winter of 1837-38 in the earlier period of the invention it be a matter which experience alone could determine whether the _ numerical _ system by means of a number dictionary or the alphabetic mode by spelling of the word be the better while i perceive some advantage in the alphabetic system especially in the writing of proper name i at that time lean rather towards the _ numerical _ mode under the impression that it would on the whole be the more rapid a very short experience however show the superiority of the alphabetic mode and the big leaf of the number dictionary which cost I a world of labor and which you perhaps remember be discard and the alphabetic install in its stead perhaps the most conclusive evidence that vail do not invent this alphabet be contain in he own book on the american electro-magnetic telegraph publish in 1845 in which he lay claim to certain improvement after describe the dot-and-dash alphabet he say : -- this conventional alphabet be originate on board the packet sully by professor morse the very first element of the invention and arise from the necessity of the case the motion produce by the magnet be limit to a single action during the period of the thirteen year _ many plan have be devise by the inventor _ to bring the telegraphic alphabet to its simplest form the italics be mine for the advocate of vail have always quote the first sentence only and have say that the word originate imply that while vail admit that the embryo of the alphabet -- the dot and dash to represent number only -- be conceive on the sully he do not admit that the alphabetical code be morse 's but when we read the second sentence with the word devise by the inventor the meaning be so plain that it be astonishing that any one at all familiar with the fact could have be mislead the first form of the alphabet which be attach to morse 's caveat of October 3 1837 be show in the drawing of the type in the accompany figure -lrb- illustration : rough drawing of alphabet by morse show the first form of the alphabet and the change to the present form -rrb- it have be state by some historian that the system of sign for letter be not attach to the caveat but a careful reading of the text in which reference be make to the drawing will prove conclusively that it be moreover in this caveat under section 5 the dictionary or vocabulary the very first sentence read : the dictionary be a complete vocabulary of word alphabetically arrange and regularly number _ beginning with the letter of the alphabet _ the italics be mine the mistake arise because the drawing be detach from the caveat and affix to the various patent which be issue even after the first form of the alphabet have be supersede by a better one the principle however remain the same so that it be not necessary to patent the new form as soon as it be prove that it would be simpler to use the letter of the alphabet in send intelligence the first form of the alphabet be change in the manner show in the precede figure exactly when this be do have not be record but it be after vail 's association with morse and it be quite possible that they work over the problem together but there be no written proof of this whereas the accompany reproduction of calculation in morse 's handwriting will prove that he give himself seriously to its consideration the large number represent the quantity of type find in the type-case of a printing-office for after puzzling over the question of the relative frequency of the occurrence of the different letter in the write language a visit to the printing-office easily settle the matter this dispute concern the paternity of the alphabet last for many year after the death of both principal and regrettably create much bad feeling be typical of many which arise in the case of the telegraph as well as in that of every other great invention and it may not be amiss at this point to introduce the follow fugitive note of morse 's which though evidently write many year later be applicable to this as well as to other case : -- it be quite common to misapprehend the nature and extent of a improvement without a thorough knowledge of a original invention a casual observer be apt to confound the new and the old and in note a new arrangement be often lead to consider the whole as new it be therefore necessary to exercise a proper discrimination lest injustice be do to the various laborer in the same field of invention i trust it will not be deem egotistical on my part if while conscious of the unfeigned desire to concede to all who be attempt improvement in the art of telegraphy that which belong to they i should now and then recognize the familiar feature of my own offspring and claim they paternity -lrb- illustration : quantity of the type find in a printing-office calculation make by morse to aid he in simplify alphabet -rrb- chapter xxiv October 3 1837 -- may 16 1838 the

-- smith 's report -- departure for europe i have incidentally mention the caveat in the precede chapter but a more detailed account of this important step in bring the invention into the light of day should perhaps be give the report in the newspaper of the activity of other especially of scientist in europe lead morse to decide that he must at once take step legally to protect himself if he do not wish to be distance in the race he accordingly write to the commissioner of patent henry l ellsworth who have be a classmate of he at yale for information as to the form to be use in apply for a caveat and after receive a cordial reply enclose the required form he immediately set to work to prepare he caveat this be in the early part of September 1887 before he have meet vail the rough draft which be still among he papers be complete on September 28 and the finish copy be send to washington on October 3 and the receipt acknowledge by commissioner ellsworth on October 6 the drawing contain the sign for both number and letter be attach to this caveat have now safeguard himself he be able to give he whole mind to the perfecting of the mechanical part of he invention and in this he be ably assist by he new partner alfr vail and by professor gale the next few month be try one to both morse and vail it must not be suppose that the work go along smoothly without a hitch many be the discouragement and many experiment be try and then discard to add to the difficulty judge vail who of course be supply the cash pique by the sneer of he neighbor and note the feverish anxiety of he son and of morse lose faith and would have willingly abandon the whole enterprise the two enthusiast work steadily on however avoid the judge as much as possible and finally on the 6th of January 1838 they proudly invite he to come to the workshop and witness the telegraph in operation he hope renew by they confident demeanor he hasten down from he house after a few word of explanation he hand a slip of paper to he son on which he have write the word -- a patient waiter be no loser he know that morse could not possibly know what he have write and he say : if you can send this and mr morse can read it at the other end i shall be convinced slowly the message be tick off and when morse hand he the duplicate of he message he enthusiasm know no bound and he propose to go at once to washington and urge upon congress the establishment of a government line but the instrument be not yet in a shape to be see of all man and many year be yet to elapse before the legislator of the country awake to they opportunity morse and vail be of course greatly encourage by this first triumph and work on with increase enthusiasm many year after they early struggle when the telegraph be a established success and morse have be honor both at home and abroad he thus speak of he friend : -- alfr vail then a student in the university and a young man of great ingenuity have hear of my invention come to my room and i explain it to he and from that moment he have take the deepest interest in the telegraph finding that i be unable to command the means to bring my invention properly before the public and believe that he could command those means through he father and brother he express the belief to I and i at once make such a arrangement with he as to procure the pecuniary means and the skill of these gentleman it be to they joint liberality but especially to the attention and skill and faith in the final success of the enterprise maintain by alfred vail that be due the success of my endeavor to bring the telegraph at that time creditably before the public the idea of telegraph seem to have be in the air in the year 1837 for the house of representative have pass a resolution on the 3d of February 1887 request the secretary of the treasury hon levus woodbury to report to the house upon the propriety of establish a system of telegraph for the united state the term telegraph in those day include semaphore and other visual appliance and in fact anything by which intelligence could be transmit to a distance the secretary issue a circular to collector of custom commander of revenue cutter and other person request information morse receive one of these circular and in reply send a long account of he invention but so hard to convince be the good people of that day and so skeptical and even flippant be most of the member of congress that six long year be to elapse year fill with struggle discouragement and heart-breaking disappointment before the victory be win morse have still to contend with occasional fit of illness for he write to he brother sidney from morristown on November 8 1837 : -- you will perhaps be surprise to learn that i come out here to be sick i catch a severe cold the day i leave new york from the sudden change of temperature and be take down the next morning with one of my bilious attack which under other treatment and circumstance might have result seriously but through a kind providence i have be throw among most attentive and kind and skilful friend who have treat I more like one of they own child than like a stranger mr vail have be a perfect mother to I we good nancy shepard can alone compare with she through she nursing and constant attention i be now able to leave my room and have be downstairs to-day and hope to be out in a few day this sickness will of course detain I a while longer than i intend for i must finish the portrait before i return this refer to portrait of various member of the vail family which he have undertake to execute while he be in morristown farther on in the letter he say : -- the machinery for the telegraph go forward daily slowly but well and thorough you will be surprise at the strength and quantity of machinery greater doubtless than will eventually be necessary yet it give the main point certainty and accuracy it may be well to note here that morse evidently foresee that the machinery construct by alfred vail be too heavy and cumbersome that more delicate workmanship would later be call for and this prove to be the case the iron work at morristown be only adapt to the manufacture of heavy machinery for ship etc and alfred vail have have experience in that class of work only so that he naturally make the telegraphic instrument much heavier and more unwieldy than be necessary while these answer the purpose for the time be they be soon supersede by instrument of greater delicacy and infinitely smaller bulk make by more skilful hand the future look bright to the sanguine inventor in the early day of the year 1838 as we learn from the follow letter to he brother sidney write on the 13th of January : -- mr alfr vail be just go in to new york and will return on Monday morning the machinery be at length complete and we have show it to the morristown people with great _ éclat _ it be the talk of all the people round and the principal inhabitant of newark make a special excursion on Friday to see it the success be complete we have try the experiment of send a pretty full letter which i set up from the number give I transmit through two mile of wire and decipher with but a single unimportant error i be stay out to perfect a modification of my portrule and hope to see you on Tuesday or at the farthest on Wednesday when i shall tell you all about it the matter look well now and i desire to feel grateful to he who give success and be always prepare for any disappointment which he in infinite wisdom may have in store we see from this letter and from a account which appear in the morristown journal that in these exhibition the message be send by number with the aid of the cumbersome dictionary which morse have be at such pain to compile very soon after this however as will appear from what follow the dictionary be discard forever and the morse alphabet come into practical use the follow invitation be send from the new york university on January 22 1838 : -- professor morse request the honor of thoma s cumming esq and family 's company in the geological cabinet of the university washington square to witness the operation of the electro-magnetic telegraph at a private exhibition of it to a few friend previous to its leave the city for washington the apparatus will be prepare at precisely twelve o'clock on Wednesday 24th instant the time be limit punctuality be specially request similar invitation be send to other prominent person and a very select company gather at the appoint hour that the exhibition be a success we learn from the follow account in the journal of commerce of January 29 1838 : -- the telegraph -- we do not witness the operation of professor morse 's electro-magnetic telegraph on Wednesday last but we learn that the numerous company of scientific person who be present pronounce it entirely successful intelligence be instantaneously transmit through a circuit of ten mile and legibly write on a cylinder at the extremity of the circuit the great advantage which must result to the public from this invention will warrant a outlay on the part of the government sufficient to test its practicability as a general means of transmit intelligence professor morse have recently improve on he mode of mark by which he can dispense altogether with the telegraphic dictionary use letter instead of number and he can transmit ten word per minute which be more than double the number which can be transmit by means of the dictionary a charming and rather dramatic incident occur at this exhibition which be never forget by those who witness it general cumming have just be appoint to a military command and one of he friend with this fact evidently in mind write a message on a piece of paper and without show it to any one else handed it to morse the assemble company be silent and only the monotonous clicking of the strange instrument be hear as the message be tick off in the dot and dash and then from the other end of the ten mile of wire be read out this sentence pregnant with meaning : -- attention the universe by kingdom right wheel the name of the man who indite that message seem not to have be preserve but whoever he be he must have be gifted with prophetic vision and he must have realize that he be assist at a occasion which be destine to mark the beginning of a new era in civilization the attention of the universe be indeed before long attract to this child of morse 's brain and kingdom after kingdom wheel into line vie with each other in admiration and acceptance the message be record fourfold by means of a newly invent fountain pen and be give to general cumming and preserve by he it be here reproduce -lrb- illustration : attention the unniverse by kingdom right wheel facsimile of the first morse alphabet message now in the national museum washington -rrb- it will be notice that the sign for the letter be those not of the first form of the alphabet as embody in the draw attach to the caveat but of the finally adopt code this have lead some historian notably mr franklin leonard pope to infer that some mistake have be make in give out this as a facsimile of this early message that the letter should have be those of the earlier alphabet i think however that this be but a add proof that morse devise the first form of the code long before he meet vail and that the change to the final form a description of which i have give be make by morse in 1837 or early in 1838 as soon as he become convinced of the superiority of the alphabetic mode in plenty of time to have be use in this exhibition the month of January 1838 be a busy one at morristown for morse and vail be bend all they energy toward the perfect and completion of the instrument so that a demonstration of the telegraph could be give in washington at as early a date as possible morse refer feelingly to the trial and anxiety of a inventor in a letter to a friend date January 22 1838 : -- i have just return from nearly six week ' absence at morristown new jersey where i have be engage in the superintendence of the making of my telegraph for washington be thankful c -- that you be not a inventor invention may seem a easy way to _ fame _ or what be the same thing to many _ notoriety _ different as be in reality the two object but it be far otherwise i indeed desire the first for true fame imply well-deserving but i have no wish for the latter which yet seem inseparable from it the condition of a inventor be indeed not enviable i know of but one condition that render it in any degree tolerable and that be the reflection that he fellow-man may be benefit by he discovery in the outset if he have really make a _ discovery _ which very word imply that it be before unknown to the world he encounter the incredulity the opposition and even the sneer of many who look upon he with a kind of pity as a little beside himself if not quite mad and while mature he invention he have the comfort of reflection in all the various discouragement he meet with from petty failure that should he by any means fail in the grand result he subject himself rather to the ridicule than the sympathy of he acquaintance who will not be slow in attribute he failure to a want of that common sense in which by implication they so much abound and which preserve they from the consequence of any such delusion but you will perhaps think that there be a offset in the honor and emolument that await the successful inventor one who have really demonstrate that he have make a important discovery this be not so trial of another kind be ready for he after the appropriate difficulty of he task be over many stand ready to snatch the prize or at least to claim a share so soon as the success of a invention seem certain and honor and profit alone remain to be obtain this long prelude c -- bring I at the same time to the point of my argument and to my excuse for my long silence my argument go to prove that unless there be a benevolent consideration in we discovery one which enable we to rejoice that other be benefit even though we should suffer loss we happiness from any honor award to a successful invention be expose to constant danger from the design of the unprincipled my excuse be that ever since the receipt of you most welcome letter i have be engage in prepare to repel a threaten invasion of my rights to the invention of the telegraph by a fellow-passenger from france one from whom i least expect any such insidious design the attempt startle I and put I on my guard and set I to the preparation for any attack i have be compel for some week to use my pen only for this purpose and have write much in the hope of prevent the public exposure of my antagonist but i fear my labor will be vain on this point from what i hear and the tone in which he write i have no fear for myself be now amply prepare with evidence to repel any attempt which may be make to sustain any claim he may prefer to a share with I in the invention of the telegraph i have already show that this claim of dr jackson 's be prove to be but the hallucination of a disorder brain and it will not be necessary to go into the detail of the controversy these be anxious and nerve-racking day for both morse and vail and it be small wonder that there should have be some slight friction vail in he private correspondence make some mention of this for instance in a letter to he brother george of January 22 1838 he say : -- we receive the machine on Thursday morning and in a hour we make the first trial which do not succeed nor do it with perfect success until Saturday -- all which time professor m be rather _ unwell _ to-morrow we shall make we first exhibition and continue it until Wednesday when we must again box up professor m have receive a letter from mr patterson invite we to exhibit at philadelphium and have answer it but have say nothing to I about he intention he be altogether incline to operate in he own name so much so that he have have print five hundred blank invitation in he own name at you expense on the other hand this same george vail write to morse on January 26 1838 ask he to bear with a which i have no doubt you will he be easily vex trust to you universal coolness however there be nothing to fear keep he from run ahead too fast again write to he brother george from washington on February 20 1838 alfr say : in regard to professor m call I he ' _ assistant _ ' this be also settle and he have say as much as to apologize for use the term why vail should have object to be call morse 's assistant i can not quite understand for he be so designate in the contract later make with the government but morse be evidently willing to humor he in this i have think it best to refer to these little incident partly in the interest of absolute candor partly to emphasize the nervous tension under which both be work at that time that there be no lasting resentment in the mind of vail be amply prove by the follow extract from a long letter write by he on march 19 1838 : -- the great expectation i have on my return home of go into partnership with george found or semi-founded on the promise make by my father have burst i be again on vague promise for three month and they rest upon the success of the printing machine i feel professor morse that if i be ever worth anything it will be wholly attributable to you kindness i now should have no _ earthly _ prospect of happiness and domestic bliss have it not be for what you have do for which i shall ever remember -lrb- you -rrb- with the liveliest emotion of gratitude whether it be eventually successful or not aside from the slight friction to which i have refer and which be most excusable under the circumstance the joint work on the telegraph proceed harmoniously the invitation from mr patterson to exhibit the instrument before the committee of science and art of the franklin institute of philadelphium be accept the exhibition take place on February 8 and be a pronounced success and the committee in express they gratification voice the hope that the government would provide the fund for a experiment on a adequate scale from philadelphium morse proceed to washington accompany by vail confidently believe that it would only be necessary to demonstrate the practicability of he invention to the country 's legislator assemble in congress in order to obtain a generous appropriation to enable he properly to test it but he have not take into account that trait of human nature which i shall dignify by call it conservatism in order not to give it a harder name the room of the committee on commerce be place at he disposal and there he hopefully string he ten mile of wire and connect they with he instrument outwardly calm but inwardly nervous and excited as he realize that he be face a supreme moment in he career he patiently explain to all who come congressman man of science representative of foreign government and hard-headed man of business the workings of the instrument and prove its feasibility the majority saw and wonder but go away unconvinced on February 21 president martin van buren and he entire cabinet at they own special request visit the room and see the telegraph in operation but no action be take by congress the time be not yet ripe for the general acceptance of such a revolutionary departure from the slow-going method of that early period while individual here and there grasp the full significance of what the mysterious ticking of that curious instrument foretold they be vastly in the minority the world through its representative in the capital city of the united state remain incredulous among those who at once recognize the possibility of the invention be franci oj smith member of congress from portland maine and chairman of the committee on commerce he be a lawyer of much shrewdness and a man of great energy and he very soon offer to become pecuniarily interested in the invention morse be unfortunately not a keen judge of man scrupulously honest and honorable himself he have a almost childlike faith in the integrity of other and all through he life he fall a easy victim to the scheme of self-seeker in this case a man of more acute intuition would have hesitate and would have make some enquiry before ally himself with one whose idea of honor prove eventually to be so at variance with he own smith do so much in later year to injure morse and to besmirch he fame and good name that i think it only just to give the follow estimate of he character make by the late franklin leonard pope in a article contribute to the electrical world in 1895 : -- a sense of justice compel I to say that the uncorroborated statement of foj smith in any matter affect the credit or honor due to professor morse should be allow but little weight for no better reason than that morse in 1843-1844 courteously but firmly refuse to be a party to a questionable scheme devise by smith for the irregular diversion into he own pocket of a portion of the governmental appropriation of $ 30000 for the construction of the experimental line he ever after cherish toward the inventor the bitterest animosity a feeling which he take no pain to conceal many of he letter to he at that time and for many year afterward be couch in studiously insulting language which must have be in the highest degree irritating to a sensitive artistic temperament like that of morse it probably by no means tend to mollify the disposition of such a man as smith to find that morse in reply to these covert sneer and open insinuation never once lose he self-control nor permit himself to depart from the dignified tone of rejoinder which become a gentleman in he dealings with one who in he inmost nature be essentially a blackguard however it be a old say that we must give the devil he due and the cloven foot do not appear at first on the other hand a man of business acumen and legal knowledge be greatly need at this stage of the enterprise and smith possess they both morse be so grateful to find any one with faith enough to be willing to invest money in the invention and to devote he time and energy to its furtherance that he at once accept smith 's offer and he be make a partner and give a one-fourth interest morse retain nine sixteenth vail two sixteenth and professor gale also admit as a partner be allot one sixteenth it be characteristic of morse that he insist before sign the contract that smith should obtain leave of absence from congress for the remainder of the term and should not stand for reelection it be agree that smith should accompany morse to europe as soon as possible and endeavor to secure patent in foreign country and if successful the profit be to be divide differently morse receive eight sixteenth smith five vail two and gale one in spite of the incredulity of the many morse could not help feeling encouraged and in a long letter to smith write on February 15 1838 propose a experiment of one hundred mile he thus forecast the future and propose a intelligent plan of government control : -- if no insurmountable obstacle present themselves in a distance of one hundred mile none may be expect in one thousand or in ten thousand mile and then will be present for the consideration of the government the propriety of completely organize this _ new telegraphic system as a part of the government _ attach it to some department already exist or create a new one which may be call for by the accumulate duty of the present department it be obvious at the slightest glance that this mode of instantaneous communication must inevitably become a instrument of immense power to be wield for good or for evil as it shall be properly or improperly direct in the hand of a company of speculator who should monopolize it for themselves it might be the means of enrich the corporation at the expense of the bankruptcy of thousand and even in the hand of government alone it might become the means of work vast mischief to the republic in consider these prospective evil i would respectfully suggest a remedy which offer itself to my mind let the sole right of use the telegraph belong in the first place to the government who should grant for a specify sum or bonus to any individual or company of individual who may apply for it and under such restriction and regulation as the government may think proper the right to lay down a communication between any two point for the purpose of transmit intelligence and thus would be promote a general competition the government would have a telegraph of its own and have its mode of communicate with its own officer and agent independent of private permission or interference with and interruption to the ordinary transmission on the private telegraph thus there would be a system of check and preventive of abuse operating to restrain the action of this otherwise dangerous power within those bound which will permit only the good and neutralize the evil should the government thus take the telegraph solely under its own control the revenue derive from the bonus alone it must be plain will be of vast amount from the enterprising character of we countryman show in the manner in which they carry forward any new project which promise private or public advantage it be not visionary to suppose that it would not be long ere the whole surface of this country would be channel for those _ nerve _ which be to diffuse with the speed of think a knowledge of all that be occur throughout the land make in fact one neighborhood of the whole country if the government be dispose to test this mode of telegraphic communication by enable I to give it a fair trial for one hundred mile i will engage to enter into no arrangement to dispose of my rights as the inventor and patentee for the united state to any individual or company of individual previous to offer it to the government for such a just and reasonable compensation as shall be mutually agree upon we have see that morse be say to be a hundred year ahead of he time as a artist from the sentence above quote it would appear that he be far in advance of he contemporary in some question of national policy for the plan outline by he for the proper governmental control of a great public utility like the telegraph it seem to I should appeal to those who at the present time be agitate for that very thing have the legislator and the people of 1838 be as wise and clear-headed as the poor artist-inventor a great leap forward in enlighten statecraft would have be undertake at a cost inconceivably less than would now be the case competent authority estimate that to purchase the present telegraph line in this country at they market valuation would cost the government in the neighborhood of $ 500000000 to parallel they would cost some $ 25000000 the enormous difference in these two sum represent what be foretell by morse would happen if the telegraph should become a monopoly in the hand of speculator the history of the telegraph monopoly be too well know to be more than allude to here but it be only fair to morse to state that he have sell all he telegraph stock and have retire from active participation in the management of the different company long before the system of stock-watering begin which have be carry on to the present day and for what sum could the government have keep this great invention under its own control it be on record that morse offer in 1844 after the experimental line between washington and baltimore have demonstrate that the telegraph be a success to sell all the rights in he invention to the government for $ 100000 and would have consider himself amply remunerate but the legislator and the people of 1838 and even those of 1844 be not wise and far-sighted they fail utterly to realize what a magnificent opportunity have be offer to they for a mere song and this in spite of the fact that the few who do glimpse the great future of the telegraph paint it in glowing term it be true that the house of representative have pass the resolution refer to earlier in this chapter but that be as far as they go for several year on the 6th of April 1838 mr foj smith make a long report on the petition of morse ask for a appropriation sufficient to enable he to test he invention adequately in the course of this report mr smith indulge in the follow eulogistic word : -- it be obvious however that the influence of this invention over the political commercial and social relation of the people of this widely extended country look to nothing beyond will in the event of success of itself amount to a revolution unsurpassed in moral grandeur by any discovery that have be make in the art and science from the most distant period to which authentic history extend to the present day with the means of almost instantaneous communication of intelligence between the most distant point of the country and simultaneously between any give number of intermediate point which this invention contemplate space will be to all practical purpose of information completely annihilate between the state of the union as also between the individual citizen thereof the citizen will be invest with and reduce to daily and familiar use a approach to the high attribute op ubiquity in a degree that the human mind until recently have hardly dare to contemplate seriously as belong to human agency from a instinctive feeling of religious reverence and reserve on a power of such awful grandeur in the face of these enthusiastic if somewhat stilted period the majority of he colleague remain cold and no appropriation be vote morse however be prepare to meet with discouragement for he write to vail on march 15 : -- everything look encouraging but i need not say to you that in this world a continued course of prosperity be not a rational expectation we shall doubtless find trouble and difficulty in store for we and it be the part of true wisdom to be prepare for whatever may await we if we heart be right we shall not be take by surprise i see nothing now but a unclouded prospect for which let we pay to he who show it to we the homage of grateful and obedient heart with most earnest prayer for grace to use prosperity aright this be write while there be still hope that congress might take some action at that session and morse be optimistic on march 31 he thus report progress to vail : -- i write you a hasty line to say in the first place that i have overcome all difficulty in regard to a portrule and have invent one which will be perfect it be very simple and will not take much time or expense to make it mr s have incorporate it into the specification for the patent please therefore not to proceed with the type or portrule as now construct : i will see you on my return and explain it in season for you to get one ready for we i find it a most arduous and tedious process to adjust the specification i have be engage steadily for three day with mr s and have not yet get half through but there be one consolation when do it will be well do the drawing i find on enquiry would cost you from forty to fifty dollar if procure from the draughtsman about the patent office i have therefore determine to do they myself and save you that sum the portrule refer to above be a device for send automatically message which be record permanently on the tape at the other end of the line it work well enough but it be soon supersede by the key manipulate by hand as this be much simpler and the dot and dash could be send more rapidly it be curious to note however that down to the present day inventor have be busy in a effort to devise some mechanism by which message could be send automatically and consequently more rapidly than by hand which be morse 's original idea but to the best of my knowledge no satisfactory solution of the problem have yet be find morse be now prepare to go to europe with smith to endeavor to secure patent abroad and while he have put in he application for a patent in this country he request that the issue of it should be hold back until he return so that a publication on this side should not injure he chance abroad all the partner be work under high pressure along they several line to get everything in readiness for a successful exhibition of the telegraph in europe vail send a long letter to morse on April 18 detail some of the difficulty which he be encounter and morse answer on the 24th : -- i write in greatest haste just to say that the box have safely arrive and we shall proceed immediately to examine into the difficulty which have trouble you but about which we apprehend no serious issue if you can possibly get the circular portrule complete before we go it will be a great convenience not to say a indispensable matter for i have just learn so much of wheatstone 's telegraph as to be pretty well persuade that my superiority over he will be make evident more by the rapidity with which i can make the portrule work than in almost any other particular at last every detail have be attend to and in a postscript to a letter of April 28 he say : we sail on the 16th of may for liverpool in the ship europe so i think you will have time to complete circular portrule try will not you chapter xxv June 1838 -- January 21 1839 arrival in england -- application for letter patent -- cooke and wheatstone

of the french it seem almost incredible to we who have come to look upon marvel after marvel of science and invention as a matter of course that it should have take so many year to convince the world that the telegraph be a possibility and not a iridescent dream while man of science and a few far-sighted layman see that the time be ripe for this much-needed advance in the means of convey intelligence government and capitalist have hold shyly aloof and even now weigh carefully the advantage of different system before decide which if any be the best for there be at this time several different system in the field and morse soon find that he would have to compete with the trained scientist of the old world back at last by they respective government in he effort to prove that he invention be the simplest and the best of they all that he should have persist in spite of discouragement after discouragement struggle to overcome obstacle which to the faint-hearted would have seem insuperable constitute one of he greatest claim to undying fame he leave on record a account of he experience in europe on this voyage memorable in more way than one and extract from this and from letter write to he daughter and brother will best tell the story : -- on may 16 1838 i leave the united state and arrive in london in June for the purpose of obtain letter patent for my electro-magnetic telegraph system i learn before i leave the united state that professor wheatstone and mr cooke of london have obtain letter patent in england for a ' _ magnetic-needle telegraph _ ' base as the name imply on the _ deflection of the magnetic needle _ they telegraph at that time require _ six conductor _ between the two point of intercommunication _ for a single instrument _ at each of the two terminus they mode of indicate sign for communicate intelligence be by deflect _ five magnetic needle _ in various direction in such a way as to point to the require letter upon a diamond-shaped dial-plate it be necessary that the signal should be _ observe at the instant _ or it be lose and vanish forever i apply for letter patent for my system of communicate intelligence at a distance by electricity differ in all respects from messr wheatstone and cooke 's system invent five year before theirs and have nothing in common in the whole system but the use of _ electricity _ on _ metallic conductor _ for which use no one could obtain a exclusive privilege since this much have be use for nearly one hundred year my system be peculiar in the employment of _ electro-magnetism _ or the _ motive _ power of electricity _ to imprint permanent sign at a distance _ i make no use of the deflection of the magnetic needle as _ sign _ i require but _ one conductor _ between the two terminus or any number of intermediate point of intercommunication i use _ paper move by clockwork _ upon which i cause a _ lever _ move by _ magnetism _ to _ imprint the letter _ and _ word _ of any require dispatch have also invent and adapt to telegraph write a _ new and peculiar alphabetic character _ for that purpose a _ conventional alphabet _ easily acquire and easily make and use by the operator it be obvious at once from a simple statement of these fact that the system of messr wheatstone and cooke and my system be wholly unlike each other as i have just observe there be _ nothing in common in the two system _ but the use of electricity upon metallic conductor for which no one could obtain a exclusive privilege the various step require by the english law be take by I to procure a patent for my mode and the fee be pay at the clerk 's office June 22 and at the home department June 25 1838 also June 26 caveat be enter at the attorney and solicitor-general 's and i have reach that part of the process which require the sanction of the attorney-general at this point i meet the opposition of messr wheatstone and cooke and also of mr davy and a hearing be order before the attorney-general sir john campbell on July 12 1838 i attend at the attorney-general 's residence on the morning of that day carry with I my telegraphic apparatus for the purpose of explain to he the total dissimilarity between my system and those of my opponent but contrary to my expectation the similarity or dissimilarity of my mode from that of my opponent be not consider by the attorney-general he neither examine my instrument which i have bring for that purpose nor do he ask any question bear upon its resemblance to my opponent ' system i be meet by the single declaration that my ' _ invention have be publish _ ' and in proof a copy of the london ` mechanic ' magazine ' no 757 for February 10 1838 be produce and i be tell that ` in consequence of say publication i could not proceed ' at this summary decision i be certainly surprise be conscious that there have be no such publication of my method as the law require to invalidate a patent and even if there have be i venture to hint to the attorney-general that if i be rightly inform in regard to the british law it be the province of a court and jury and not of the attorney-general to try and to decide that point the publication to which the attorney-general refer have merely state result with no description whatever of the means by which these result be to be obtain and it be manifestly unfair to morse on the part of this official to have refuse he sanction but he remain obdurate morse then write he a long letter after consultation with mr smith set forth all these point and beg for another interview in consequence of my request in this letter i be allow a second hearing i attend accordingly but to my chagrin the attorney-general remark that he have not have time to examine the letter he carelessly take it up and turn over the leaf without read it and then ask I if i have not take measure for a patent in my own country and upon my reply in the affirmative he remark that : ` america be a large country and i ought to be satisfy with a patent there ' i reply that with all due deference i do not consider that as a point submit for the attorney-general 's decision that the question submit be whether there be any legal obstacle in the way of my obtain letter patent for my telegraph in england he observe that he consider my invention as have be _ publish _ and that he must _ therefore _ forbid I to proceed thus forbid to proceed by a authority from which there be no appeal as i afterward learn but to parliament and this at great cost of time and money i immediately leave england for france where i find no difficulty in secure a patent my invention there not only attract the regard of the distinguished savant of pari but in a marked degree the admiration of many of the english nobility and gentry at that time in the french capital to several of these while explain the operation of my telegraphic system i related the history of my treatment by the english attorney-general the celebrated earl of elgin take a deep interest in the matter and be intent on my obtain a special act of parliament to secure to I my just rights as the inventor of the electro-magnetic telegraph he repeatedly visit I bring with he many of he distinguished friend and on one occasion the noble earl of lincoln since one of she majesty 's privy council the honorable henry drummond also interested himself for I and through he kindness and lord elgin 's i receive letter of introduction to lord brougham and to the marquis of northampton the president of the royal society and several other distinguished person in england the earl of lincoln show I special kindness in take leave of I in paris he give I he card and request I to bring my telegraphic instrument with I to london press I to give he the earliest notice of my arrival in london i must here say that for week in paris i have be engage in negotiation with the russian counselor of state the baron alexander de meyendorff arrange measure for put the telegraph in operation in russium the term of a contract have be mutually agree upon and all be conclude but the signature of the emperor to legalize it in order to take advantage of the ensue summer season for my operation in russium i determine to proceed immediately to the united state to make some necessary preparation for the enterprise without wait for the formal completion of the contract papers be lead to believe that the signature of the emperor be sure a matter of mere form under these circumstance i leave paris on the 13th of march 1839 and arrive in london on the 15th of the same month the next day i send my card to the earl of lincoln and my letter and card to the marquis of northampton and in two or three day receive a visit from both by earl lincoln i be at once invite to send my telegraph to he house in park lane and on the 19th of march i exhibit its operation to member of both house of parliament of the royal society and the lord of the admiralty invite to meet I by the earl of lincoln from the circumstance mention my time in london be necessarily short my passage have be secure in the great western to sail on the 23d of march although solicit to remain a while in london both by the earl of lincoln and the honorable henry drummond with a view to obtain a special act of parliament for a patent i be compel by the circumstance of the case to defer till some more favorable opportunity on my expect return to england any attempt of the kind the emperor of russium however refuse to ratify the contract make with I by the counselor of state and my design of return to europe be frustrated and i have not to this hour -lrb- April 2 1847 -rrb- have the means to prosecute this enterprise to a result in england all my exertion be need to establish my telegraphic system in my own country time have show conclusively the essential difference of my telegraphic system from those of my opponent time have also show that my system _ be not publish _ in england as allege by the attorney-general for to this day no work in england have publish anything that do not show that as yet it be perfectly misunderstand the refusal to grant I a patent be at that period very disastrous it be especially discourage to have make a long voyage across the atlantic in vain incur great expenditure and loss of time which in they consequence also produce year of delay in the prosecution of my enterprise in the united state the long statement from which i have take the above extract be write as i have note on April 2 1847 but the follow interesting addition be make to it on December 11 1848 : -- at the time of prepare this statement i lack one item of evidence which it be desirable to have aside from my own assertion viz evidence that the refusal of the attorney-general be on the ground ' _ that a publication of the invention have be make _ ' i deem it advisable rather to suffer from the delay and endure the taunt which my unscrupulous opponent have not be slow to lavish upon I in consequence if i could but obtain this evidence in proper shape i accordingly write to my brother then in london to procure if possible from lord campbell or he secretary a acknowledgment of the ground on which he refuse my application for a patent in 1838 since no public report or record in such case be make my brother in connection with mr carpmael one of the most distinguished patent agent in england address a note to mr h cooper the attorney-general 's secretary at the time and the only official person besides lord campbell connect with the matter the follow be mr cooper 's reply : -- ` wilmington square may 23d 1848 ` gentleman -- in answer to yours of the 20th inst i beg to state that i have a distinct recollection of professor morse 's application for a patent strengthen by the fact of he not have pay the fee for the hearing etc and these be now owe i understand at the time that the patent be stop on the ground that a publication of the invention have be make but i can not procure lord campbell 's certificate of that fact ' i be gentleman ` you obedient servant ' h cooper ' i thus have obtain the evidence i desire in the most authentic form but accompany with as gross a insult as could well be conceive on the receipt of this letter i immediately write to foj smith esq at portland who accompany I to england and at whose sole expense accord to agreement all proceedings in take out patent in europe be to be bear to know if this charge of the attorney-general 's secretary could possibly be true not know but through some inadvertence on he -lrb- mr smith 's -rrb- part this bill might have be overlook mr smith write I in answer send I a copy _ verbatim _ of the follow receipt which he hold and which speak for itself : -- ` mr morse to the attorney-general dr # s d hearing on a patent 3 10 0 give notice on the same 1 1 0 ------ 4 11 0 settle the 13th of August 1838 ' -lrb- sign -rrb- h cooper ' this receipt be sign as will be perceive by the same individual h cooper who nearly ten year after he acknowledgment of the money have the impudence to charge I with leave my fee unpaid i now leave the public to make they own comment both on the character of the whole transaction in england and on the character and motive of those in this country who have espouse lord campbell 's course make it a occasion to charge I with have _ invent nothing _ samuel fb morse i have in these extract from a account of he european experience write by morse at a later date give but a brief summary of certain event it will now be necessary to record more in detail some of the happening on that memorable trip attention have be call before to the fact that it be morse 's good fortune to have be a eye-witness of many event of historic interest still another be now to be add to the list for while he be in london strive unsuccessfully to secure a patent for he invention he be privileged to witness the coronation of queen victorium we minister the honorable andrew stevenson have procure for he a ticket of admission to westminster abbey write to he daughter susan on June 19 1838 before he have meet with he rebuff from the attorney-general he comment briefly on the festivity incident to the occasion : -- london be fill fast with crowd of all character from ambassador and prince to pickpocket and beggar all bring together by the coronation of the queen which take place in a few day -lrb- the 28th of June -rrb- everything in london now be color by the come pageant in the shop window be the robe of the nobility the crimson and ermine dress coronet etc preparation for illuminations be make all over the city i have scarcely enter upon the business of the telegraph but have examine -lrb- tell dr gale -rrb- the specification of wheatstone at the patent office and except the alarum part he have nothing which interfere with mine he invention be ingenious and beautiful but very complicated and he must use twelve wire where i use but four i have also see a telegraph exhibit at exeter hall invent by davy something like wheatstone 's but still complicated i find mine be yet the simplest and hope to accomplish something but always keep myself prepare for disappointment at a later date he recount the follow pretty incident show the kindly character of the young queen which may not be generally know : -- i be in london in 1838 and be present with my excellent friend the late charle r leslie ra at the impose ceremony of the coronation of the queen in westminster abbey he then related to I the follow incident which i think may truly be say to have be the first act of she majesty 's reign when she predecessor william iv die a messenger be immediately dispatch by he queen -lrb- then become by he death queen dowager -rrb- to victoria apprise she of the event she immediately call for paper and indite a letter of condolence to the widow folding it she direct it ` to the queen of england ' she maid of honor in attendance note the inscription say : ` you majesty you be queen of england ' ` yes ' she reply ` but the widow queen be not to be remind of that fact first by I ' write to he daughter from havre on July 26 1838 while on he way to pari after tell she of the unjust decision of the attorney-general he add : -- professor wheatstone and mr davy be my opponent they have each very ingenious invention of they own particularly the former who be a man of genius and one with whom i be personally much pleased he have invent he i believe without know that i be engage in a invention to produce a similar result for although he date back into 1832 yet as no publication of we thought be make by either we be evidently independent of each other my time have not be lose however for i have ascertain with certainty that the _ telegraph of a single circuit _ and a _ recording apparatus _ be mine i find also that both mr wheatstone and mr davy be endeavor to simplify theirs by add a recording apparatus and reduce theirs to a single circuit the latter show to the attorney-general a drawing which i obtain sight of of a method by which he propose a bungling imitation of my first character those that be print in we journal and one however plausible on paper and sufficiently so to deceive the attorney-general be perfectly impracticable partiality from national or other motive aside from the justice of the case i be persuade influence the decision against I we be now on we way to pari to try what we can do with the french government i confess i be not sanguine as to any favorable pecuniary result in europe but we shall try and at any rate we have see enough to know that the matter be view with great interest here and the plan of such telegraph will be adopt and of course the united state be secure to we and i do hope something from that be economical my dear child and keep you want within bound for i be prepare myself for a unsuccessful result here yet every proper effort will be make i be in excellent health and spirit and leave to-morrow morning for paris _ paris August 29 1838 _ i have obtain a patent here and it be exciting some attention the prospects of future benefit from the invention be good but i shall not probably realize much or even anything immediately i saw by the papers before i get you letter that congress have not pass the appropriation bill for the telegraph on some account i regret it but it be only delay and it will probably be pass early in the winter little do he think in he cheerful optimism that nearly five long year must elapse before congress should awaken to its great opportunity you will be glad to learn my dear daughter that you father 's health be never so good and probably before this reach you he will be on the ocean on he return i think of leave paris in a very few day i be only wait to show the telegraph to the king from whom i expect a message hourly the birth of a prince occupy the whole attention just how of the royal family and the court he be bear on the 24th inst the son of the duke and duchess of orlean my room be as delightfully situated perhaps as any in pari they be close to the palace of the tuilery and overlook the garden and be within half a stone 's throw of the room of the duke and duchess of orlean from my balcony i look directly into they room i see the company that be there assemble on the birthday of the little prince and see he in he nurse 's arm at the window the next day after he birth he look very much like any other baby and not half so handsome as little hugh peter i receive from the minister of war general bernard who have be very polite to I a ticket to be present at the _ te deum _ perform yesterday in the great cathedral of pari notre dame on account of the birth of the prince the king and all the royal family and the court with all the officer of state be present the cathedral be crowd with all the fashion of pari along the way and around the church be soldier without number almost a proof that some danger be apprehend to the king and yet he ought to be popular for he be the best ruler they have have for year the ceremony be impose appealing to the sens and the imagination and not at all to the reason or the heart the king be loui philippe the little prince he grandson be the count of paris _ paris September 29 1838 _ since my last matter have assume a totally different aspect at the request of monsieur arago the most distinguished astronomer of the day i submit the telegraph to the institute at one of they meeting at which some of the most celebrated philosopher of france and of germany and of other country be present its reception be in the highest degree flattering and the interest which they manifest by the question they ask and the exclamation they use show to I then that the invention have obtain they favorable regard the papers of pari immediately announce the telegraph in the most favorable term and it have literally be the topic of the day ever since the baron humboldt the celebrated traveller a member of the institute and who see its operation before that body tell mr wheaton we minister to prussia that my telegraph be the best of all the plan that have be devise i receive a call from the administrator-in-chief of all the telegraph of france monsieur alphonse foy i explain it to he he be highly delighted with it and tell I that the government be about to try a experiment with the view of test the practicability of the electric telegraph and that he have be request to see mine and report upon it that he should report that ' _ mine be the best that have be submit to he _ ' and he add that i have better forthwith get a introduction to the minister of the interior mon the count montalivet i procure a letter from we minister and be now wait the decision of the government everything look promising thus far as much so as i could expect but it involve the possibility not to say the probability of my remain in pari during the winter if i should be delay till December it would be prudent to remain until April if it be possible without detriment to my affair to make such arrangement that i may return this autumn i shall certainly do it but if i should not you must console yourselve that it be in consequence of meeting with success that i be detain and that i shall be more likely to return with advantage to you all on account of the delay i ought to say that the director of the saint-germain railroad have see my telegraph and that there be some talk -lrb- as yet vague -rrb- of establish a line of my telegraph upon that road i mention these my dear child to show you that i can not at this moment leave pari without detriment to my principal object _ pari October 10 1838 _ you be at a age when a parent 's care and particularly a mother 's care be most need you can not know the depth of the wound that be inflict when i be deprive of you dear mother nor in how many way that wind be keep open yet i know it be all well i look to god to take care of you it be he will that you should be almost truly a orphan for with all my effort to have a home for you and to be near you i have meet hitherto only with disappointment but there be now indication of a change and while i prepare for disappointment and wish you to prepare for disappointment we ought to acknowledge the kind hand of we heavenly father in so far prosper I as to put I in the honorable light before the world which be now my lot with the eminence be connect the prospect of pecuniary prosperity yet this be not consummate but only in prospect it may be a long time before anything be realize study therefore prudence and economy in all thing make you want as few as possible for the habit thus acquire will be of advantage to you whether you have much or little thus do hope alternate with despondency as the day and week wear away and nothing tangible be accomplish all who see the working of the telegraph be loud in they expression of wonder and admiration but for reason which shall presently be explain nothing else be gain by the inventor at that time a old friend of morse 's the reverend dr kirk be then live in pari and the two friend not only room together but dr kirk speak french fluently which morse do not act as interpreter in the many exhibition give writing of this in later year dr kirk say : -- i remember rally my friend frequently about the experience of great inventor who be generally permit to starve while live and be canonize after death when the model telegraph have be set up in we room mr morse desire to exhibit it to the savant of pari but as he have less of the talk propensity than myself i be make the grand exhibitor we levee-day be Tuesday and for week we receive the visit of distinguished citizen and stranger to whom i explain the principle and operation of the telegraph the visitor would agree upon a word among themselves which i be not to hear then the professor would receive it at the write end of the wire while it devolve upon I to interpret the character which record it at the other end as i explain the hieroglyphic the announcement of the word which they see could have come to I only through the wire would often create a deep sensation of delighted wonder and much do i now regret that i do not take note of these interview for it would be a interesting record of distinguished name and of valuable remark on the 10th of September 1838 morse enjoy the greatest triumph of all for it be on that day that by invitation of m arago the exhibition of he invention before the institute of france casually mention in one of he letter to he daughter take place writing of the occasion to alfr vail he say : -- i exhibit the telegraph to the institute and the sensation produce be as striking as at washington it be evident that hitherto the assemble science of europe have consider the plan of a electric telegraph as ingenious but visionary and like aëronautic navigation practicable in little more than theory and destine to be useless i can not describe to you the scene at the institute when you box with the registering-machine just as it leave speedwell be place upon the table and surround by the most distinguished man of all europe celebrate in the various art and science -- arago baron humboldt gay-lussac and a host of other whose name be star that shine in both hemisphere arago describe it to they and i show its action a buzz of admiration and approbation fill the whole hall and the exclamation ' _ extraordinaire ' ` très bien ' ` très admirable _ ' i hear on all side the sentiment be universal another american at that time in paris the honorable hl ellsworth also write home about the impression which be produce by the exhibition of this new wonder : -- i be sure you will be glad to learn that we american friend professor morse be produce a very great sensation among the learn man of this kingdom by he ingenious and wonderful magnetic telegraph he submit it to the examination of the academy of science of the royal institute of france at they sit on Monday last and the deepest interest be excite among the member of that learn body on the subject its novelty beauty simplicity and power be highly commend other project for the establishment of a magnetic telegraph have be broach here especially from professor wheatstone of london and professor steinheil of munich it be say however to be very manifest that we yankee professor be ahead of they all in the essential requisition of such a invention and that he be in the way to bear off the palm in simplicity of design cheapness of construction and efficiency professor morse 's telegraph transcend all yet make know in each of these quality it be admit by those who have inspect it closely there seem to be little else to desire it be certain moreover that in priority of discovery he antedate all other encourage by the universal praise which be shower upon he the hopeful inventor redouble he effort to secure in some way either through the government or through private party the means to make a practical test of he invention mr foj smith have in the mean time return to america and morse keep he inform by letter of the progress of affair in paris avoid as far as possible repetition and irrelevant detail i shall let extract from these letter tell the story : -- _ September 29 1838 _ on Monday i receive a very flattering letter from we excellent minister governor cass introduce I to the count montalivet and i accordingly call the next day i do not see he but have a interview with he secretary who tell I that the administrator of the telegraph have not yet report to the minister but that he would see he the next day and that if i would call on Friday he would inform I of the result i call on Friday the secretary inform I that he have see m foy and that he have more than confirm the flattering account in the american minister 's letter respect the telegraph but be not yet prepare with he report to the minister -- he wish to make a detailed account of the _ difference in favor of mine over all other that have be present to he _ or word to that effect and the secretary assure I that the report would be all i could wish this be certainly flattering and i be to call on Monday to learn further _ October 24 _ i can only add in a few word that everything here be as encourage as could be expect the report of the administrator of telegraph have be make to the minister of the interior and i have be tell that i should be notify of the intention of the government in a few day i have also show the railroad telegraph to the saint-germain director who be delighted with it and from they i expect a proposition within a few day _ November 22 _ i intend send this letter by the packet of the 24th inst and be in hope of send with it some intelligence from those from whom i have be so long expect something everything move at a snail 's pace here i find delay in all thing at least so it appear to I who have too strong a development of the american organ of ` go-ahead-ativeness ' to feel easy under its tantalizing effect a frenchman ought to have as many life as a cat to bring to pass on he dilatory plan of procedure the same result that a yankee would accomplish in he single life _ afternoon November 22 _ call on the ministre de l'intérieur no one at home leave card and will call again to-morrow and hope to be in time yet for the packet _ November 23 _ i have again call but do not find at home the chief secretary m merlin i shall miss the packet of the 24th but i be tell she be a slow ship and that i shall probably find the letter reach home quite as soon by the next i will leave this open to add if anything occur between this and next packet day _ November 30 _ i have be call off from this letter until the last moment by stir about and endeavor to expedite matter with the government i have be to see general cass since my last date i talk over matter with he he complain much of they dilatoriness but see no way of quicken they i call again this morning at the minister 's and as usual the secretary be absent at the palace they say if i could once get they to look at it i should be sure of they for i have never show it to any one who do not seem in rapture i show it a few day ago to m fremel the director of light-house who come with mr vail and captain perry he be cautious at first but afterwards become as enthusiastic as any the railroad director be as dilatory as the government but i know they be discuss the matter seriously at they meeting and i be tell that the most influential man among they say they ` must have it ' there be nothing in the least discourage that have occur but on the contrary everything to confirm the practicability of the plan both on the score of science and expense _ January 21 1839 _ i learn that the telegraph be much talk of in all society and i learn that the _ théâtre des variétés _ which be a sort of mirror of the popular topic have a piece in which person be make to converse by means of this telegraph some hundred of mile off this be a straw which show the way of the wind and although matter move too slow for my impatient spirit yet the telegraph be evidently gain on the popular notice and in time will demand the attention of government i have the promise of a visit from the count boudy chief of the household of the king and who i understand have great influence with the king and can induce he to adopt the telegraph between some of he palace hope you perceive continue bright but they be somewhat unsubstantial to a empty purse i look for the first fruit in america my confidence increase every day in the certainty of the eventual adoption of this means of communication throughout the civilized world its practicability hitherto doubt by savant here be completely establish and they do not hesitate to give I the credit of have establish it i rejoice quite as much for my country 's sake as for my own that both priority and superiority be award to my invention chapter xxvi January 6 1839 -- march 9 1839 despondent letter to he brother sidney -- longing for a home -- letter to smith -- more delay -- change of ministry -- proposal to form private company -- impossible under the law of france -- telegraph a government monopoly -- refusal of czar to sign russian contract -- dr jackson -- m amyot -- failure to gain audience of king -- lord elgin -- earl of lincoln -- robert walsh prophesy success -- meeting with earl of lincoln in later year -- daguerre -- letter to mr cass on lottery -- railway and military telegraph -- skepticism of a marshal of france thus hopefully the inventor keep write home always maintain that soon all obstacle would be overcome and that he would then have a chance to demonstrate in a really practical way the great usefulness of he invention but instead of melting away new obstacle keep arise at every turn the dilatoriness of the french government seem past all belief and yet in spite of he faith in the more expeditious method of he own country he be fate to encounter the same exasperating slowness at home it be therefore only natural that in spite of the courageous optimism of he nature he should at time have give way to fit of depression as be instance by the following extract from a letter write to he brother sidney on January 6 1839 : -- i know not that i feel right to indulge in the despondency which in spite of all reason to the contrary creep over I when i think of return i know the feeling of tantalus perfectly all my prospects in regard to the telegraph be bright and encouraging and so they have be for month and they still continue to be so but the sober _ now _ be that i be expend and not acquire it have as yet be all _ outgo _ and no income at the rate business be do here the slow dilatory manner in which the most favorable project be carry forward i have no reason to believe that anything will be realize before i must leave france which will probably be in about six week if so then i return penniless and worse than penniless i return to find debt and no home to find homeless child with all hope extinguish of ever see they again in a family indeed i may say that in this latter respect the last ray be depart i think no more of it i now feel anxious to see my child educate with the means they have of they own and in a way of usefulness and for myself i desire to live secluded without be burdensome to my friend i should be glad to exchange my room in the university for one or two in you new building i shall probably resign both professorship and presidency on my return the first have become merely nominal and the latter be connect with duty which properly confine to the city and as i wish to be free to go to other place i think it will be best to resign if we government should take the telegraph or company should be form for that purpose so that a sum be realize from it when i get home this will of course change the face of thing but i dare not expect it and ought not to build any plan on such a contingency so far as praise go i have every reason to be satisfy at the state of thing here in regard to the telegraph all the savant committee of learn society member of the chamber of deputy and officer of government have without exception be as enthusiastic in its reception as any in the united state both the priority and superiority of my invention be establish and thus the credit be it more or less be secure to we country the prefect of the seine express a desire to see it and call by appointment yesterday he be perfectly satisfied and say of he own accord that he should see the king last evening and should mention the telegraph to he i shall probably soon be request therefore to show the telegraph to the king all these be most encouraging prospects there be indeed nothing that have arise to throw any insurmountable obstacle in the way of its adoption with complete success and for all this i ought to feel gratitude and i wish to acknowledge it before he to whom gratitude be due be it right or be it wrong in view of all this to feel despondency in spite of all i do feel sad i be no longer young i have child but they be orphan and orphan they be likely to be i have a country but _ no home _ it be this _ no home _ that perpetually haunt I i feel as if it be duty duty most urgent for I to settle in a family state at all hazard on account of these child i know they suffer in this form period of they life for the want of a home of the care of a father and a mother and that no care and attention from friend be they ever so kind can supply the place of parent but all effort direct and indirect to bring this about have be frustrated my dear brother may you never feel as i have feel _ the loss of a wife _ that wind bleed afresh daily as if it be inflict but yesterday there be a meaning in all these acute mental trial and they be at time so severe as almost to deprive I of reason though few around I would suspect the state of my mind these last few line be eminently characteristic of the man while call upon to endure much both mentally and physically he possess such remarkable self-control that few if any of those around he be aware of he suffer only to he intimate do he ever reveal the pain which sometimes gnaw at he heart and then only occasionally and under great stress it be this self-control unite to a lofty purpose and a natural repugnance to wear he heart on he sleeve which enable he to accomplish what he do endowed also with a saving sense of humor he make light of he trial to other and be a welcome guest in every social gather the want of a place which he could really call home be a ever-present grief it be the dominant note in almost all the letter to he brother and he child and it be rather quaintly express in a letter of November 14 1838 to he daughter : -- tell uncle sidney to take good care of you and to have a little snug room in the upper corner of he new building where a bed can be place a chair and a table and let I have it as my own that there may be one little particular spot which i can call _ home _ i will there make three wooden stool one for you one for charle and one for finley and invite you to you father 's house in spite of the enthusiasm which the exhibition of he invention arouse among the learn man and other in pari he meet with obstruction of the most vexatious kind at every turn in he effort to bring it into practical use just as the way seem clear for its adoption by the french government something happen which be thus describe in a letter to mr smith of January 28 1889 : i write by the great western a few day ago the event then anticipate in regard to the ministry have occur the minister have resign and it be expect that the new cabinet will be form this day with marshal soult at its head thus you perceive new cause of delay in obtain any answer from the government as soon as i can learn the name of the new minister of the interior i will address a note to he or see he as i may be advise and see if i can possibly obtain a answer or at least a report of the administration of the telegraph nothing have occur in other respects but what be agreeable all my leisure -lrb- if that may be call leisure which employ nearly all my time -rrb- be devote to perfect the whole matter the invention of the correspondent i think you will say be a more essential improvement it have be my winter 's labor and to avoid expense i have be compel to make it entirely with my own hand i can now give you its exact dimension -- twelve and a half inch long six and a half wide and six and a half deep it dispense entirely with box of type -lrb- one set alone be necessary -rrb- and dispense also with the rule and with all machinery for move the rule there be no wind up and it be ready at all time you touch the letter and the letter be write immediately at the other extremity in my next i hope to send you report of my further progress one thing seem certain my telegraph have drive out of the field all the other plan on the magnetic principle i hear nothing of they in public or private no society notice they _ February 2 _ i can compare the state of thing here to a April day at one moment sunshine at the next cloudy the telegraph be evidently grow in favor testimonial of approbation and compliment multiply and yesterday i be advise by the secretary of the _ academie industrielle _ to interest moneyed man in the matter if i intend to profit by it and he observe that now be the precise time to do it in the interval of the chamber i be at a loss how to act i be not a business man and fear every movement which suggest itself to I i be thinking of propose a company on the same plan you last propose in you letter from liverpool and which you intend to create in case the government shall choose to do nothing that be to say a company take the right at one thousand franc per mile pay the proprietor fifty per cent in stock and fifty per cent in cash raise about fifty thousand franc for a trial some distance i shall take advice and let you know the result i wish you be here i be sure something could be do by a energetic business man like yourself as for poor I i feel that i be a child in business matter i can invent and perfect the invention and demonstrate its use and practicability but ` further the deponent saith not ' perhaps i underrate myself in this case but that be not a usual fault in human nature it be natural that a keen business man like foj smith should have lean rather toward a private corporation with its possibility of great pecuniary gain than toward government ownership morse on the contrary would have prefer both at home and abroad to place the great power which he know he invention be destine to wield in the hand of a responsible government however so eager be he to make a practical test of the telegraph that government apparently not appreciate they great opportunity he be willing to entrust the enterprise to capitalist here again he be balk however for write of he trial later he say : -- a unforeseen obstacle be interpose which have render my patent in france of no avail to I by the french patent law at the time one who obtain a patent be oblige to put into operation he invention within two year from the issue of he patent under the penalty of forfeiture if he do not comply with the law in pursuance of this requisition of the law i negotiate with the president -lrb- turneysen -rrb- of the saint-germain railroad company to construct a line of my telegraph on they road from pari to saint-germain a distance of about seven english mile the company be favorably dispose toward the project but upon application -lrb- as be necessary -rrb- to the government for permission to have the telegraph on they road they receive for answer that telegraph be a government monopoly and could not therefore be use for private purpose i thus find myself crushed between the conflicting force of two oppose law this be indeed a crush blow and end all hope of accomplish anything in france unless the government should in the short time still leave to he decide to take it up the letter home during the remainder of he stay in europe be voluminous but as they be in the main a repetition of experience similar to those already record it will not be necessary to give they in full he tell of the enthusiastic reception accord to he invention by the savant the high official of the government and the englishman of note then stop in paris he tell also of the exasperating delay to which he be subject and which finally compel he to return home without have accomplish anything tangible he go at length into he negotiation with the representative of the czar baron meyendorf from which he entertain so many hope hope which be destine in the end to be blast because the czar refuse to put he signature to the contract he objection be that malevolence can easily interrupt the communication this be a terrible disappointment to the inventor for he have make all he plan to return to europe in the spring of 1839 to carry out the russian contract which he be lead to believe be perfectly certain and the czar 's signature simply a matter of form while at the time and probably for all he life morse consider he failure in europe as a cruel stroke of fate we can not but conclude in the light of future development that here again fate be cruel in order to be kind the invention while it have be pronounce a scientific success and have be award the palm over all other system by the foremost scientist of the world have yet to undergo the baptism of fire on the field of battle it have never be try over long distance in the open air and many practical modification have yet to be make the necessity for which could only be ascertain during the actual construction of a commercial line morse 's first idea adhere to by he until find by experience in the building of the first line between washington and baltimore to be impracticable have be to bury the wire in a trench in the ground i say it be find to be impracticable but that be true only of the condition at that early date the inventor be here again ahead of he time for the underground system be now use in many city and may in time become universal however we shall see when the story of the building of that first historic line be tell that in this respect and in many other great difficulty be encounter and failure be avert only by the ingenuity the resourcefulness and the quick-wittedness of the inventor himself and he able assistant be it too much to suppose that have the russian or even the french contract go through and have morse be compel to recruit he assistant from the people of a alien land whose language he could neither speak nor thoroughly understand the result would have be a dismal failure call down only ridicule on the head of the luckless inventor and perhaps cause he to abandon the whole enterprise discourage and dishearten be this as it may the european trip be consider a failure in a practical sense while have result in a personal triumph in so far as the scientific element of the invention be concerned i shall therefore give only occasional extract from the letter some of they deal with matter not in any way related to the telegraph he write to mr smith on February 18 1839 : -- i have be wholly occupy for the last week in copy out the correspondence and other document to defend myself against the infamous attack of dr jackson notice of which my brother send I i have send a letter to dr jackson call on he to save he character by a total disclaimer of he presumptuous claim within one week from the receipt of the letter and give he the plea of a ` mistake ' and ` misconception of my invention ' by which he may retreat if he fail to do this i have request my brother to publish immediately my defense in which i give a history of the invention the correspondence between dr jackson and myself and close with the letter of hon mr rive mr fisher of philadelphium and captain pell i can not conceive of such infatuation as have possess this man he can scarcely be deceive it must be he consummate self-conceit that deceive he if he be deceive but this can not be he know he have no title whatever to a single hint of any kind in the matter i have already allude to the claim of dr jackson and have show that it be prove to be utterly without foundation and have only introduce this reference to it as a instance of the attack which be make upon morse attack which compel he to consume much valuable time in the midst of he other labor in order to repel they which he always succeed in do in writing of he negotiation with the russian government he mention m amyot who have propose also a electric telegraph but upon see mine he could not restrain he gratification and with he whole soul he be at work to forward it with all who have influence he be the right-hand man of the baron meyendorf and he be exert all he power to have the russian government adopt my telegraph he be really a noble-minded man the baron tell I he have a _ large soul _ and i find he have i have no claim on he and yet he seem to take as much interest in my invention as if it be he own how different a conduct from jackson 's every day be clear away all the difficulty that prevent its adoption the only difficulty that remain it be universally say be the protection of the wire from malevolent attack and this can be prevent by proper police and secret and deep interment i have no doubt of its universal adoption it may take time but it be certain _ pari march 2 1839 _ by my last letter i inform you of the more favorable prospects of the telegraphic enterprise these prospects still continue and i shall return with the gratifying reflection that after all my anxiety and labor and privation and you and my other associate ' expenditure and risk we be all in a fair way of reap the fruit of we toil the political trouble of france have be a hindrance hitherto to the attention of the government to the telegraph but in the mean time i have gradually push forward the invention into the notice of the most influential individual of france i have colonel lasalle aide-de-camp to the king and he lady to see the telegraph a few day ago he promise that without fail it should be mention to the king you will be surprise to learn after all the promise hitherto make by the prefect of the seine count remberteau and by various other officer of the government and after general cass 's letter to the aide on service four or five month since request it might be bring to the notice of the king that the king have not yet hear of it but so thing go here such dereliction would destroy a man with we in a moment but here there be a different standard -lrb- this of course _ entre nous _ -rrb- among the numerous visitor that have throng to see the telegraph there have be a great many of the principal english nobility among they the lord and lady aylmer former governor of canada lord elgin and son the celebrated preserver not depredator -lrb- as he have be most slanderously call -rrb- of the phidian marble lord elgin have be twice and express a great interest in the invention he bring with he yesterday the earl of lincoln a young man of unassuming manners he be delighted and give I he card with a press invitation to call on he when i come to london i have not fail to let the english know how i be treat in regard to my application for a patent in england and contrast the conduct of the french in this respect to theirs i believe they feel it and i think it be lord aylmer but be not quite sure who advise that the subject be bring up in parliament by some member and make the object of special legislation which he say might be do the attorney-general to the contrary notwithstanding i really believe if matter be rightly manage in england something yet might be do there if not by patent yet by a parliamentary grant of a proper compensation it be remarkable that they have not yet make anything like mine in england it be evident that neither wheatstone nor davy comprehend my mode after all they assertion that mine have be publish if matter move slower here than with we yet they gain surely i be tell every hour that the two great wonder of pari just now about which everybody be converse be daguerre 's wonderful result in fix permanently the image of the _ camera obscura _ and morse 's electro-magnetic telegraph and they do not hesitate to add that beautiful as be the result of daguerre 's experiment the invention of the electro-magnetic telegraph be that which will surpass in the greatness of the revolution to be effect all other invention robert walsh esq who have just leave I be beyond measure delighted i be write a word from one room to another he come to I and say : -- ` the next word you may write be immortality for the sublimity of this invention be of surpass grandeur _ i see now that all physical obstacle which may for a while hinder will inevitably be overcome the problem be solve _ man may instantly converse with he fellow-man in any part of the world ' this prophecy of the celebrated american author who be afterwards consul-general to france for six year be noteworthy consider the date at which it be make there be indeed many physical obstacle which for a while hinder the practical adoption of the invention but they be eventually overcome and the problem be solve five year of heart-breaking struggle discouragement and actual poverty have still to be endure by the brave inventor before the tide should turn in he favor but robert walsh share with morse the clear conviction that the victory would finally be win reference have be make to lord elgin the follow letter from he will be find interesting : -- pari 12th march 1839 dear sir -- i can not help express a very strong desire that instead of delay till you return from america you wish to take out a patent in england for you highly scientific and simple mode of communicate intelligence by a electric telegraph you would take measure to that effect at this moment and for that purpose take you model now with you to london you discovery be now much know as well as appreciate and the ingenuity now afloat be too extensive for one not to apprehend that individual even in good faith may make some addition to qualify they to take out a _ first patent _ for the principle whereas if you bring it at once now before the competent authority especially under the advantage of a introduction such as mr drummond can give you to lord brougham a short delay in you proceeding to america may secure you this desirable object immediately with every sincere good wish for you success and the credit you so richly deserve i be dear sir yours faithfully elgin while it be futile to speculate on what might have be it do seem as if morse make a serious mistake in not take lord elgin 's advice for there be no doubt that with the influential backing which he have now secure he could have overcome the churlish objection of the attorney-general and have secure a patent in england much to he financial benefit but with the glamour of the russian contract in he eye he decide to return home at once and the opportunity be lose we must also marvel at the strange fact that the fear express by lord elgin that another might easily appropriate to himself the glory which be rightly due to morse be not realize be it to be wonder at that morse should have always hold that he and he alone be the humble instrument choose by a all-wise providence to carry to a successful issue this great enterprise regard one of he other visitor the earl of lincoln it be interesting to learn that there be another meeting between the two man under rather dramatic circumstance in later year this be on the occasion of the visit of the prince of wale afterward edward vii to america accompany by a suite which include among other the duke of newcastle morse be invite to address the prince at a meeting give in he honor at the university of the city of new york and in the course of he address he say : -- a allusion in most flattering term to I render doubly so in such presence have be make by we respected chancellor which seem to call for at least the expression of my thanks at the same time it suggest the relation of a incident in the early history of the telegraph which may not be inappropriate to this occasion the infant telegraph bear and nurse within these wall have scarcely attain a feeble existence ere it essay to make its voice hear on the other side of the atlantic i carry it to paris in 1838 it attract the warm interest not only of the continental philosopher but also of the intelligent and appreciative among the eminent noble of britain then on a visit to the french capital foremost among these be the late marquis of northampton then president of the royal society the late distinguished earl of elgin and in a marked degree the noble earl of lincoln the last-named nobleman in a special manner give it he favor he comprehend its important future and in the midst of the skepticism that cloud its cradle he risk he character for sound judgment in venture to stand godfather to the friendless child he take it under he roof in london invite the statesman and the philosopher of britain to see it and urge forward with kindly word and generous attention those who have the infant in charge it be with no ordinary feeling therefore that after the lapse of twenty year i have the singular honor this morning of greet with hearty welcome in such presence before such a assemblage and in the cradle of the telegraph this noble earl of lincoln in the person of the present duke of newcastle reference be make by morse in the letter to mr smith of march 2 to daguerre and he wonderful discovery have himself experiment along the same line many year before he be naturally much interested and seek the acquaintance of daguerre which be easily bring about the two inventor become warm friend and each disclose to the other the minutiae of he discovery daguerre invite morse to he workshop select a Sunday as a day convenient to he and morse reply in the follow characteristic note : -- professor morse ask the indulgence of m daguerre the _ time _ m daguerre in he great kindness have fix to show he most interesting experiment be unfortunately one that will deprive mr m of the pleasure he anticipate as mr m have a engagement for the entire Sunday of a nature that can not be break will Monday or any other day be agreeable to m daguerre mr m again ask pardon for give m daguerre so much trouble have thus satisfied he puritan conscience another day be cheerfully appoint by daguerre who generously impart the secret of this new art to the american by whom it be carry across the ocean and successfully introduce into the united state as will be show further on writing of this experience to he brother on march 9 1839 he say : -- you have perhaps hear of the daguerreotype so call from the discoverer m daguerre it be one of the most beautiful discovery of the age i do not know if you recollect some experiment of mine in new haven many year ago when i have my painting-room next to professor silliman 's -- experiment to ascertain if it be possible to fix the image of the _ camera obscura _ i be able to produce different degree of shade on paper dip into a solution of nitrate of silver by means of different degree of light but find that light produce dark and dark light i presume the production of a true image to be impracticable and give up the attempt m daguerre have realize in the most exquisite manner this idea here follow the account of he visit to daguerre and a enthusiastic description of the wonder see in he workshop and he close by say : -- but i be near the end of my paper and i have unhappily to give a melancholy close to my account of this ingenious discovery m daguerre appoint yesterday at noon to see my telegraph he come and pass more than a hour with I express himself highly gratify at its operation but while he be thus employ the great building of the diorama with he own house all he beautiful work he valuable note and papers the labor of year of experiment be unknown to he at that moment the prey of the flame he secret indeed be still safe with he but the step of he progress in the discovery and he valuable research in science be lose to the scientific world i learn that he diorama be insure but to what extent i know not i be sure all friend of science and improvement will unite in express the deepest sympathy in m daguerre 's loss and the sincere hope that such a liberal sum will be award he by he government as shall enable he in some degree at least to recover from he loss it be pleasant to record that the french government do act most generously toward daguerre the reader may remember that when morse be a young man in london lottery be consider such legitimate way of raise money that not only do he openly purchase ticket in the hope of win a money prize but he pious father advise he to dispose of he surplus painting and sketch in that way as he grow older however he view on this question change as will be see by the follow letter address to mr cass wife of the american minister who be try to raise money to help a worthy couple suddenly reduce from wealth to poverty : -- January 31 1889 i be sure i need make no apology to you my dear madam for return the three lottery ticket enclose in the interesting note i have just have the honor to receive from you because i know you can fully appreciate the motive which prompt I in the measure take some year since for oppose the lottery system in the state of new york and which issue in its entire suppression i take a very prominent part under the conviction that the principle on which the lottery system be found be wrong but while on this account i can not my dear madam consistently take the ticket i must beg of you to put the price of they which i enclose into such a channel as shall in you judgment best promote the benevolent object in which you have interested yourself poverty be a bitter lot even when the habit of long endurance have reconcile the mind and body to its severity but how much more bitter must it be when it come in sudden contrast to a life of affluence and ease i thank you for give I the opportunity of contribute my mite to the relief of such affliction hope sincerely that all they earthly want may lead the sufferer to the inexhaustible fountain of true riches with sincere respect and christian regard i remain my dear madam you most obedient servant sfb morse before close the record of this european trip so disappointing in many way and yet so encouraging in other it may be well to note that while he be in paris morse in 1838 not only take out a patent on he record telegraph but also on a system to be use on railway to report automatically the presence of a train at any point on the line a reproduction of he own drawing of the apparatus to be use be here give and the mechanism be so simple that a explanation be hardly necessary from it can be see not only that he do at this early date realize the possibility of he invention along various line but that it embody the principle of the police and fire-alarm system now in general use it be not record that he ever realize anything financially from this ingenious modification of he main invention comment on it and on he plan for a military telegraph he give this amusing sketch : -- on September 10 1838 a telegraph instrument construct in the united state on the same principle but slightly modify to make it portable be exhibit to the academy of science in pari and explain by m arago at the session of that date a account of this exhibition be record in the _ compte rendus _ a week or two after i exhibit at my lodgings in connection with this instrument my railroad telegraph a application of signal by sound for which i take out letter patent in pari and at the same time i communicate to the minister of war general bernard my plan for a military telegraph with which he be much pleased -lrb- illustration : railway telegraph drawing by morse patent by he in france in 1838 and embody principle of police and fire alarm telegraph -rrb- i dine with he by invitation and in the evening repair with he to he billiard-room while the rest of the guest be amusing themselves with the game i give he a general description of my plan he listen with deep attention while i advocate its use on the battle-field and give he my reason for believe that the army first use the facility of the electric telegraph for military purpose would be sure of victory he reply to I after my answer many of he question : -- ` be reticent ' say he ` on this subject for the present i will send a officer of high rank to see and converse with you on the matter to-morrow ' the next day i be visit by a old marshal of france whose name have escape my memory conversing by a interpreter the reverend en kirk of boston i find it difficult to make the marshal understand its practicability or its importance the dominant idea in the marshal 's mind which he oppose to the project be that it involve a increase of the material of the army for i propose the addition of two or more light wagon each contain in a small box the telegraph instrument and a reel of fine insulate wire to be keep in readiness at the headquarters on the field i propose that when require the wagon with the corps of operator two or three person at a rapid rate should reel off the wire to the right the center and the left of the army as near to these part of the army as practicable or convenient and thus instantaneous notice of the condition of the whole army and of the enemy 's movement would be give at headquarters to all this explanation of my plan be oppose the constant objection that it increase the material of the army the hon marshal seem to consider that the great object to be gain by a improvement be a decrease of this material a example of this economy which he illustrate by the case of the substitution of the leather drinking cup for the tin cup hang to the soldier 's knapsack a improvement which enable the soldier to put he cup in he vest pocket for this improvement if i remember right he say the inventor who be a common soldier receive at the hand of the emperor napoleon i the cross of the legion of honor so set be the good marshal in he repugnance to any increase to the material of the army that after a few moment ' thought i rebut he position by put to he the follow case : -- be marshal ' i say ` you be invest a fortress on the capture of which depend the success of you campaign you have 10000 man on make you calculation of the chance of take it by assault you find that with the addition of 5000 more troops you could accomplish its capture you have it in you power by a simple order to obtain from the government these 5000 man in this case what would you do ' he reply without hesitation : ' i should order the 5000 of course ' ` but ' i rejoin ` the material of the army would be greatly increase by such a order ' he comprehend the case and laugh heartily abandon the objection but take refuge in the general skepticism of that day on the practicability of a electric telegraph he do not believe it could ever be put in practice this be a argument i could not then repel time alone could vindicate my opinion and time have show both its practicability and its utility chapter xxvii April 15 1839 -- September 30 1840 arrival in new york -- disappointment at find nothing do by congress or he associate -- letter to professor henry -- henry 's reply -- correspondence with daguerre -- experiment with daguerreotypes-professor draper -- first group photograph of a college class -- failure of russian contract -- mr chamberlain -- discouragement through lack of fund -- no help from he associate -- improvement in telegraph make by morse -- humorous letter morse sail from europe on the great western on the 23d of march 1889 and reach new york after a stormy passage on the 15th of April discourage by he lack of success in establish a line of telegraph in europe on a pay basis and yet encourage by the enthusiasm show by the scientist of the old world he hope much from what he consider the superior enterprise of he own countryman however on this point he be doom to bitter disappointment and the next few year be destine to be the darkest through which he be to pass on the day after he arrival in new york he write to mr foj smith : -- i take the first moment of rest from the fatigue of my boisterous voyage to apprise you of my arrival yesterday in the great western i be quite disappointed in find nothing do by congress and nothing accomplish in the way of company i have hope to find on my return some fund ready for prosecute with vigor the enterprise which i fear will suffer for the want think a moment of my situation i leave new york for europe to be go three month but have be go eleven month my only mean of support be in my profession which i have be compel to abandon entirely for the present give my undivided time and effort to this enterprise i return with not a farthing in my pocket and have to borrow even for my meal and even worse than this i have incur a debt of rent by my absence which i should have avoid if i have be at home or rather if i have be aware that i should have be oblige to stay so long abroad i do not mention this in the way of complaint but merely to show that i also have be compel to make great sacrifice for the common good and be willing to make more yet if necessary if the enterprise be to be pursue we must all in we various way put the shoulder to the wheel i wish much to see you and talk over all matter for it seem to I that the present state of the enterprise in regard to russium affect vitally the whole concern thus gently do he chide one of he partner who should have be exert himself to forward they joint interest in america while he himself be do what he could in europe the other partner alfr vail and dr leonard gale be equally lax and seem to have lose interest in the enterprise as we learn from the follow letter to mr smith of may 24 1839 : -- you will think it strange perhaps that i have not answer yours of the 28th ult sooner but various cause have prevent a earlier attention to it my affair in consequence of my protracted absence and the stagnant state of the telegraph here at home have cause I great embarrassment and my whole energy have be call upon to extricate myself from the confusion in which i have be unhappily place you may judge a little of this when i tell you that my absence have deprive I of my usual source of income by my profession that the state of the university be such that i shall probably leave and shall have to move into new quarter that my family be disperse require my care and anxiety under every disadvantage that my engagement be such with russium that every moment of my time be necessary to complete my arrangement to fulfill the contract in season and instead of find my associate ready to sustain I with counsel and mean i find they all disperse leave I without either the opportunity to consult or a cent of means and consequently bring everything in relation to the telegraph to a dead stand in the midst of this i be call on by the state of public opinion to defend myself against the outrageous attempt of dr jackson to pirate from I my invention the word would be harsh that be properly applicable to this man 's conduct you see therefore in what a condition i find myself when i return i be delay several day beyond the computed time of my arrival by the long passage of the steamer instead of find any fund by a vote of congress or by a company and my associate ready to back I i find not a cent for the purpose and my associate scatter to the four wind you can easily conceive that i give up all as it regard russium and consider the whole enterprise as seriously injured if not completely destroy in this state of thing i be hourly dread to hear from the russian minister and devise how i should save myself and the enterprise without implicate my associate in a charge of neglect and as it have most fortunately happen for we all the 10th of may have pass without the receipt of the promise advice and i take advantage of this and by the liverpool steamer of the 18th write to the baron meyendorff and to m amyot that it be impossible to fulfill the engagement this season since i have not receive the promise advice in time to prepare this be of course before he have hear of the czar 's refusal to sign the contract and he go on to make plan for carry out the russian enterprise the next year and conclude by say : -- do think of this matter and see if means can not be raise to keep ahead with the american telegraph i sometimes be astonish when i reflect how i have be able to take the stand with my telegraph in competition with my european rival back as they be with the purse of the king and wealthy of they country while we own government leave I to fight they battle for the honor of this invention fettered hand and foot thanks will be due to you not to they if i be able to maintain the ground occupy by the american telegraph shortly after he return from abroad on April 24 morse write the following letter to professor henry at princeton : -- my dear sir -- on my return a few day since from europe i find direct to I through you politeness a copy of you valuable contribution for which i beg you to accept my warmest thanks the various care consequent upon so long a absence from home and which have demand my more immediate attention have prevent I from more than a cursory perusal of its interesting contents yet i perceive many thing of great interest to I in my telegraphic enterprise i be glad to learn by a letter receive in pari from dr gale that a spool of five mile of my wire be loan to you and i perceive that you have already make some interesting experiment with it in the absence of dr gale who have go south i feel a great desire to consult some scientific gentleman on point of importance bearing upon my telegraph which i be about to establish in russium be under a engagement with the russian government agent in pari to return to europe for that purpose in a few week i should be exceedingly happy to see you and be tempt to break away from my absorb engagement here to find you at princeton in case i should be able to visit princeton for a few day a week or two hence how should i find you engage i should come as a learner and could bring no contribution to you stock of experiment of any value nor any means of further you experiment except perhaps the loan of a additional five mile of wire which it may be desirable for you to have i have many question to ask but should be happy in you reply to this letter of a answer to this general one : have you meet with any fact in you experiment thus far that would lead you to think that my mode of telegraphic communication will prove impracticable so far as i have consult the savant of pari they have suggest no insurmountable difficulty i have however quite as much confidence in you judgment from you valuable experience as in that of any one i have meet abroad i think that you have pursue a original course of experiment and discover fact of more value to I than any that have be publish abroad morse be too modest in say that he could bring nothing of value to henry in he experiment for as we shall see from henry 's reply the latter have no knowledge at that time of the relay for bring into use a secondary battery when the line be to stretch over long distance this important discovery morse have make several year before princeton may 6 1889 dear sir -- you favor of the 24th ult come to princeton during my absence which will account for the long delay of my answer i be pleased to learn that you fully sanction the loan which i obtain from dr gale of you wire and i shall be happy if any of the result be find to have a practical bearing on the electrical telegraph it will give I much pleasure to see you in princeton after this week my engagement will not then interfere with we communication on the subject of electricity during this week i shall be almost constantly engage with a friend in some scientific labor which we be prosecute together i be acquaint with no fact which would lead I to suppose that the project of the electro-magnetic telegraph be unpractical on the contrary i believe that science be now ripe for the application and that there be no difficulty in the way but such as ingenuity and enterprise may obviate but what form of the apparatus or what application of the power will prove best can i believe be only determine by careful experiment i can say however that so far as i be acquaint with the minutiae of you plan i see no practical difficulty in the way of its application for comparatively short distance but if the length of the wire between the station be great i think that some other modification will be find necessary in order to develop a sufficient power at the farther end of the line i shall however be happy to converse freely with you on these point when we meet in the meantime i remain with much respect yours etc joseph henry i consider this letter alone a sufficient answer to those who claim that henry be the real inventor of the telegraph he make no such claim himself in spite of the care of various kind which overwhelm he during the whole of he eventful life morse always find time to stretch out a help hand to other or to do a courteous act so now we find he write to daguerre on may 20 1839 : -- my dear sir -- i have the honor to enclose you the note of the secretary of we academy inform you of you election at we last annual meeting into the board of honorary member of we national academy of design when i propose you name it be receive with enthusiasm and the vote be _ unanimous _ i hope my dear sir you will receive this as a testimonial not merely of my personal esteem and deep sympathy in you late loss but also as a proof that you genius be in some degree estimate on this side of the water notwithstanding the effort make in england to give to another the credit which be you due i think i may with confidence assure you that throughout the united state you name alone will be associate with the brilliant discovery which justly bear you name the letter i write from paris the day after you sad loss have be publish throughout this whole country in hundred of journal and have excite great interest should any attempt be make here to give to any other than yourself the honor of this discovery my pen be ever ready for you defense i hope before this reach you that the french government long and deservedly celebrate for its generosity to man of genius will have amply supply all you loss by a liberal sum if when the proper remuneration shall be secure to you in france you should think it may be for you advantage to make a arrangement with the government to hold back the secret for six month or a year and would consent to a exhibition of you _ result _ in this country for a short time the exhibition might be manage i think to you pecuniary advantage if you should think favorably of the plan i offer you my service _ gratuitously _ to this letter daguerre reply on July 26 : -- my dear sir -- i have receive with great pleasure you kind letter by which you announce to I my election as a honorary member of the national academy of design i beg you will be so good as to express my thanks to the academy and to say that i be very proud of the honor which have be confer upon I i shall seize all opportunity of prove my gratitude for it i be particularly indebted to you in this circumstance and i feel very thankful for this and all other mark of interest you bestow upon I the transaction with the french government be nearly at a end my discovery shall soon be make public this cause add to the immense distance between we hinder I from take the advantage of you good offer to get up at new york a exhibition of my result believe I my dear sir you very devoted servant daguerre a prophecy shrewd in some particulars but rather faulty in other of the influence of this new art upon painting be contain in the following extract from a letter of morse 's to he friend and master washington allston : -- i have hope to have see you long ere this but my many avocation have keep I constantly employ from morning till night when i say morning i mean _ half past four _ in the morning i be afraid you will think I a goth but really the hour from that time till twelve at noon be the richest i ever enjoy you have hear of the daguerreotype i have the instrument on the point of completion and if it be possible i will yet bring they with I to boston and show you the beautiful result of this brilliant discovery art be to be wonderfully enrich by this discovery how narrow and foolish the idea which some express that it will be the ruin of art or rather artist for every one will be he own painter one effect i think will undoubtedly be to banish the sketchy slovenly daub that pass for spirited and learn those work which possess mere general effect without detail because forsooth detail destroy general effect nature in the result of daguerre 's process have take the pencil into she own hand and she show that the minutest detail disturb not the general repose artist will learn how to paint and amateur or rather connoisseur how to criticise how to look at nature and therefore how to estimate the value of true art we study will now be enrich with sketch from nature which we can store up during the summer as the bee gather she sweet for winter and we shall thus have rich material for composition and a exhaustless store for the imagination to feed upon a interesting account of he experience with this wonderful new discovery be contain in a letter write many year later on the 10th of February 1855 : -- as soon as the necessary apparatus be make i commence experiment with it the greatest obstacle i have to encounter be in the quality of the plate i obtain the common plate copper in coil at the hardware shop which of course be very thinly coat with silver and that impure still i be able to verify the truth of daguerre 's revelation the first experiment crown with any success be a view of the unitarian church from the window on the staircase from the third story of the new york city university this of course be before the building of the new york hotel it be in September 1839 the time if i recollect in which the plate be expose to the action of light in the camera be about fifteen minute the instrument chemical etc be strictly in accordance with the direction in daguerre 's first book a english gentleman whose name at present escape I obtain a copy of daguerre 's book about the same time with myself he commence experiment also but a american of the name of walcott be very successful with a modification of daguerre 's apparatus substitute a metallic reflector for the lens previous however to walcott 's experiment or rather result my friend and colleague professor john w draper of the new york city university be very successful in he investigation and with he i be engage for a time in attempt portrait in my intercourse with daguerre i specially converse with he in regard to the practicability of take portrait of live person he express himself somewhat skeptical as to its practicability only in consequence of the time necessary for the person to remain immovable the time for take a outdoor view be from fifteen to twenty minute and this he consider too long a time for any one to remain sufficiently still for a successful result no sooner however have i master the process of daguerre than i commence to experiment with a view to accomplish this desirable result i have now the result of these experiment take in September or beginning of October 1889 they be full-length portrait of my daughter single and also in group with some of she young friend they be take out of door on the roof of a building in the full sunlight and with the eye close the time be from ten to twenty minute about the same time professor draper be successful in take portrait though whether he or myself take the first portrait successfully i can not say it be afterwards establish that to professor draper must be accord this honor but i understand that it be a question of hour only between the two enthusiast soon after we commence together to take portrait cause a glass building to be construct for that purpose on the roof of the university as we experiment have cause we considerable expense we make a charge to those who sit for we to defray this expense professor draper 's other duty call he away from the experiment except as to they bearing on some philosophical investigation which he pursue with great ingenuity and success i be leave to pursue the artistic result of the process as more in accordance with my profession my expense have be great and for some time five or six month i pursue the taking of portrait by the daguerreotype as a means of reimburse these expense after this object have be attain i abandon the practice to give my exclusive attention to the telegraph which require all my time before leave the subject of the daguerreotype in which as i have show morse be a pioneer in this country it will be interesting to note that he take the first group photograph of a college class this be of the survive member of he own class of 1810 who return to new haven for they thirtieth reunion in 1840 it be not until August of the year 1839 that definite news of the failure of the russian agreement be receive and morse in a letter to smith of August 12 comment on this and on another serious blow to he hope : -- i receive yours of the 2d inst and the paper accompany it contain the notice of mr chamberlain i have previously be apprise that my foreboding be true in regard to he fate we enterprise abroad be destine to give we anxiety if not to end in disappointment i have just receive a letter from m amyot who be to have be my companion to russium and learn from he the unwelcome news that the emperor have decide against the telegraph the emperor 's objection be it seem that ` malevolence can easily interrupt the communication ' m amyot scout the idea and write that he refute the objection to the satisfaction of the baron who indeed do not need the refutation for himself for the whole matter be fully discuss between we when in paris the baron i should judge from the tone of m amyot 's letter be much disappointed yet as a faithful and obedient subject of one whose nay be nay he will be cautious in so express himself as to be self-committed thus my dear sir prospects abroad look dark i turn with some faint hope to my own country again will congress do anything or be my time and you generous zeal and pecuniary sacrifice to end only in disappointment if so i can bear it for myself but i feel it most keenly for those who have be engage with I for you for the messr vail and dr gale but i will yet hope i do not know that we enterprise look darker than fulton 's once appear there be no intrinsic difficulty the depressing cause be extrinsic i hope to see you soon and talk over all we affair mr smith in send a copy of the above letter to mr prime thus explain the reference to mr chamberlain : -- the allusion make in the letter just give to the fate of mr chamberlain be another depressing disappointment which occur to the professor contemporaneously with those of the russian contract before i leave paris we have close a contract with mr chamberlain to carry the telegraph to austria prussium the principal city of greece and of egypt and put it upon exhibition with a view to its utilization there he be a american gentleman -lrb- from vermont i think -rrb- of large wealth of eminent business capacity of please personal address and sustain a character for strict integrity he part with professor morse in pari to enter upon he expedition with high expectation of both pleasure and profit shortly after my own departure from pari in October 1838 he have subsequently apprise professor morse of very interesting exhibition of the telegraph which he have make and under date of athen January 5 1839 write as follow : ` we exhibit you telegraph to the learn of florence much to they gratification yesterday evening the king and queen of greece be highly delighted with its performance we have show it also to the principal inhabitant of athen by all of whom it be much admire fame be all you will get for it in these poor country we think of start in a few day for alexandrium and hope to get something worth have from mehemet alus it be however doubtful nation appear as poor as individual and as unwilling to risk they money upon such matter i hope the french will avail themselves of the benefit you offer they it be truly strange that it be not grasp at with more avidity if i can do anything in egypt i will try turkey and st petersburg ' morse himself write : in another letter from mr chamberlain to mr levering date syra January 9 he say : ` the pretty little queen of greece be delighted with morse 's telegraph the string which carry the cannon-ball use for a weight break and come near fall on she majesty 's toe but happily miss and we perhaps escape a prison my best respects to mr morse and say i shall ask mehemet alus for a purse a beauty from he seraglio and something else ' and morse conclude : i will add that if he will bring I the purse just now i can dispense with the beauty and the something else tragedy too often tread on the heel of comedy and it be sad to have to relate that mr chamberlain and six other gentleman be drown while on a excursion of pleasure on the danube in July of 1839 that all these disappointment add to the necessity for make money in some way for he bare subsistence should have weigh on the inventor 's spirit be hardly to be wonder at the wonder be rather that he do not sink under he manifold trial far from this however he only touch on he need in the follow letter to alfr vail write on November 14 1839 : -- as to the telegraph i have be compel from necessity to apply myself to those duty which yield immediate pecuniary relief i feel the pressure as well as other and have several pupil at the university i must attend to they nevertheless i shall hold myself ready in case of need to go to washington during the next session with it the one i be construct be complete except the rotary battery and the pen-and-ink apparatus which i shall soon find time to add if require mr smith expect I in portland but i have not the means to visit he the telegraph of wheatstone be go ahead in england even with all its complication so i presume be the one of steinheil in bavarium whether ours be to be adopt depend on the government or on a company and the time be not favorable for the formation of a company perhaps it be the part of wisdom to let the matter rest and watch for a opportunity when time look better and which i hope will be soon he give freer vent to he disappointment in a letter to mr smith of November 20 1839 : -- i feel the want of that sum which congress ought to have appropriate two year ago to enable I to compete with my european rival wheatstone and steinheil have money for they project the former by a company and the latter by the king of bavarium be there any national feeling with we on the subject i will not say there be not until after the next session of congress but if there be any cause for national exultation in be not merely _ first _ in the invention as to time but _ best _ too as decide by a foreign tribunal ought the inventor to be suffer to work with he hand tie be it honorable to the nation to boast of its inventor to contend for the credit of they invention as national property and not lift a finger to assist they to perfect that of which they boast but i will not complain for myself i can bear it because i make up my mind from the very first for this issue the common fate of all inventor but i do not feel so agreeable in see those who have interest themselves in it especially yourself suffer also perhaps i look too much on the unfavorable side i often thus look not to discourage other or myself but to check those too sanguine expectation which with I would rise to a inordinate height unless thus rein in and disciplined shall you not be in new york soon i wish much to see you and to concoct plan for future operation i be at present much straiten in means or i should yet endeavor to see you in portland but i must yield to necessity and hope another season to be in different and more prosperous circumstance thus the inventor who have hope so much from the energy and business acumen of he own countryman find that the condition at home differ not much from those which he have find so exasperating abroad praise in plenty for the beauty and simplicity of he invention but no money either public or private to enable he to put it to a practical test he associate have leave he to battle alone for he interest and theirs foj smith be in portland maine attend to he own affair professor gale be in the south fill a professorship and alfr vail be in philadelphium no one of they as far as i can ascertain be do anything to help in this critical period of the enterprise which be to benefit they all when credit be to be award to those who have accomplish something great many factor must be take into consideration not only must the aspirant for undying fame in the field of invention for instance have discover something new which when properly apply will benefit mankind but he must prove its practical value to a world constitutionally skeptical and he must persevere through trial and discouragement of every kind with a sublime faith in the ultimate success of he effort until the fight be win otherwise if he retire beat from the field of battle another will snatch up he sword and hew he way to victory it must never be forget that morse win he place in the hall of fame not only because of he invention of the simplest and best method of convey intelligence by electricity but because he alone and unaided carry forward the enterprise when but for he it would have be allow to fail with no thought of disparage the other who can hardly be blame for they loss of faith and who be of great assistance to he later on when the battle be nearly win i feel that it be only just to lay emphasis on this factor in the claim of morse to greatness it will not be necessary to record in detail the event of the year 1840 the inventor always confident that success would eventually crown he effort live a life of privation and constant labor in the two field of art and science he be still president of the national academy of design and in September he be elect a honorary member of the mercantile library association he strive to keep the wolf from the door by give lesson in painting and by practise the new art of daguerreotypy and in the mean time he employ every spare moment in improve and still further simplify he invention he hear occasionally from he associate the following sentence be from a letter of alfred vail 's dated philadelphium January 13 1840 : -- friend sfb morse dear sir it be many a day since i last have the pleasure of see and converse with you and if i be not mistake it be as long since any communication have be exchange however i trust it will not long be so when i last have the pleasure of see you it be when on my way to philadelphium at which time you have the kindness to show I specimen of the greatest discovery ever make with the exception of the electro-magnetic telegraph by the by i have be think that it be time money in some way be make out of the telegraph and i be almost ready to order a instrument make and to make the proposition to you to exhibit it here what do you think of the plan if mr prosch will make I a first-rate most perfect machine and as speedily as possible and will wait six or nine month for he pay you may order one for I morse 's reply to this letter have not be preserve but he probably agree to vail 's proposition -- anything honorable to keep the telegraph in the public eye -- for as we shall see in a later letter he refer to the machine which prosch be to make before quote from that letter however i shall give the following sentence from one to baron meyendorff of march 18 1840 : i have since i return to the united state make several important improvement which i regret my limited time will not permit I to describe or send you i have so change the _ form _ of the apparatus and condensed it into so small a compass that you would scarcely know it for the same instrument which you see in pari this and many other allusion in the correspondence of those year to morse 's work in simplify and perfect he invention some of which i have already note answer conclusively the claim of those who have say that all improvement be the work of other brain and hand on September 7 1840 he write again to vail : -- you letter of 28th ult be receive several day ago but i have not have a moment 's time to give you a word in return i be tie hand and foot during the day endeavor to realize something from the daguerreotype portrait as to the telegraph i know not what to say the delay in finish the apparatus on the part of prosch be exceedingly tantalizing and vexatious he be to have finish they more than six month ago and i have bear with he procrastination until i utterly despair of they be complete i suppose something might be do in washington next session if i or some of you could go on but i have expend so much time in vain there and in europe that i feel almost discourage from press it any further only however from want of fund i have none myself and i dislike to ask it of the rest of you you be all so scatter that there be no consultation and i be under the necessity of attend to duty which will give I the means of live the reason of its not be in operation be not _ the fault of the invention _ nor be it _ my neglect _ my faith be not only unshaken in its _ eventual adoption throughout the world _ but it be confirm by every new discovery in the science of electricity while the future look dark and the present be darker still morse maintain a cheerful exterior and be still able to write to he friend in a light and airy vein the follow letter dated September 30 1840 be to a mr levering in paris : -- some time since -lrb- i believe nearly a year ago -rrb- i write you to procure for I two lens and some plate for the daguerreotype process but have never hear from you nor have any intimation that my letter be ever receive after wait some month i procured both lens and plate here now if i know how to scold at you would not i scold well i recollect a story of a captain who be overload by a great many lady of he acquaintance with order to procure they various article in indium just as he be about to sail thither all which he promise to fulfill but on he return when they flock round he for they various article to they surprise he have only answer the order of one of they upon they express they disappointment he address they thus : ` lady ' say he ' i have to inform you of a most unlucky accident that occur to you order i be not unmindful of they i assure you so one fine day i take you order all out of my pocketbook and arrange they on the top of the companionway but just as they be all arrange a sudden gust of wind take they all overboard ' ` aye a very good excuse ' they exclaim ` how happen it that mr -- 's do not go overboard too ' ` oh ' say the captain ` mr -- have fortunately enclose in she order some dozen doubloon which keep the wind from blow hers away with the rest ' now friend lovering i have no idea of have my new order blow overboard so i herewith send by the hand of my young friend and pupil mr r hubbard whom i also commend to you kind notice ten golden half-eagle to keep my order down chapter xxviii June 20 1840 -- August 12 1842 first patent issue -- proposal of cooke and wheatstone to join force reject -- letter to rev e salisbury -- money advance by brother artist repay -- poverty -- reminiscence of general strother porte crayon -- other reminiscence -- inaction in congress -- flattering letter of foj smith -- letter to smith urge action -- gonon and wheatstone -- temptation to abandon enterprise -- partner all financially cripple -- morse alone do any work -- encouraging letter from professor henry -- renew enthusiasm -- letter to hon ww boardman urge appropriation of $ 3500 by congress -- not even consider -- despair of inventor it be only necessary to remember that the year 1840 and the year immediately precede and follow it be season of great financial depression and that in 1840 the political unrest which always precede a presidential election be greatly intensify to realize why but little encouragement be give to a enterprise so fantastic as that of a electric telegraph capitalist be disincline to embark on new and untried venture and the member of congress be too much absorb in the political game to give heed to the pleading of a mad inventor the election of harrison follow by he untimely death only a month after he inauguration and the elevation of tyler to the presidency prolong the period of political uncertainty so that morse and he telegraph receive but scant attention on capitol hill however the year 1840 mark some progress for on the 20th of June the first patent be issue to morse it may be remember that while he caveat and petition be file in 1837 he have request that action on they be defer until after he return from europe he have also during the year be gradually perfect he invention as time and mean permit it be during the year 1840 too that messr wheatstone and cooke propose to join force with the morse patentee in america but this proposition be reject although morse seem to have be almost tempt for in a letter to smith he say : -- i send you copy of two letter just receive from england what shall i say in answer can we make any arrangement with they need we do it do not we patent secure we against foreign interference or be we to be defeat not only in england but in we own country by the subsequent invention of wheatstone i feel my hand tie i know not what to say do advise immediately so that i can send by the british queen which sail on the first prox fortunately smith advise against a combination and the matter be drop it will not be necessary to dwell at length on the event of the year 1841 the situation and aim of the inventor be best sum up in a beautiful and characteristic letter write on February 14 of that year to he cousin the reverend edward s salisbury : -- you letter contain a draft for three hundred dollar i have receive for which accept my sincere thanks i have hesitate about receive it because i have begin to despair of ever be able to touch the pencil again the blow i receive from congress when the decision be make concern the picture for the rotunda have seriously and vitally affect my enthusiasm in my art when that event be announce to I i be tempt to yield up all in despair but i rouse myself to resist the temptation and determine still to fix my mind upon the work cast about for the means of accomplish it in such way as my heavenly father should make plain my telegraphic enterprise be one of those means induce to prosecute it by the secretary of the treasury and encourage by success in every part of its progress urge forward to complete it by the advice of the most judicious friend i have carry the invention on my part to perfection that be to say so far as the invention itself be concerned i _ have do my part _ it be approve in the highest quarter -- in england france and at home -- by scientific society and by government and wait only the action of the latter or of capitalist to carry it into operation thus after several year ' expenditure of time and money in the expectation -lrb- of my friend _ never of my own _ except as i yield my own judgment to theirs -rrb- of so much at least as to leave I free to pursue my art again i be leave humanly speak farther from my object than ever i be remind too that my prime be past the snow be on my temple the half-century of year will this year be mark against I my eye begin to fail and what can i now expect to do with decline power and habit in my art break up by repeat disappointment that prize which through the best part of my life animated I to sacrifice all that most man consider precious -- prospects of wealth domestic enjoyment and not least the enjoyment of country -- be snatch from I at the moment when it appear to be mine beyond a doubt i do not state these thing to you my dear cousin in the spirit of complaint of the dealings of god 's providence for i be perfectly satisfy that mysterious as it may seem to I it have all be order in its minutest particulars in infinite wisdom so satisfied that i can truly say i rejoice in the midst of all these trial and in view of my heavenly father 's hand guide all i have a joy of spirit which i can only express by the word ` singing ' it be not in man to direct he step i know i be so short-sighted that i dare not trust myself in the very next step how then could i presume to plan for my whole life and expect that my own wisdom have guide I into that way best for I and the universe of god 's creature i have not paint a picture since that decision in congress and i presume that the mechanical skill i once possess in the art have suffer by the unavoidable neglect i may possibly recover this skill and if anything will tend to this end if anything can tune again a instrument so long unstrung it be the kindness and liberality of my cousin edward i would wish therefore the matter put on this ground that my mind may be at ease i be at present engage in take portrait by the daguerreotype i have be at considerable expense in perfect apparatus and the necessary fixture and be just reap a little profit from it my ultimate aim be the application of the daguerreotype to accumulate for my studio model for my canvas its first application will be to the study of you picture yet if any accident any unforeseen circumstance should prevent i have make arrangement with my brother sidney to hold the sum you have advance subject to you order on these condition i accept it and will yet indulge the hope of give you a picture acceptable to you the picture be never paint for the discourage artist find neither time nor inclination ever to pick up he brush again but we may be sure that the money so generously advance by he cousin be repay it be in the year 1841 also that in spite of the difficulty he find in earn enough to keep he from actual starvation he begin to pay back the sum which have be advance to he by he friend for the painting of a historical picture which should in a measure atone to he for the undeserved slight of congress in a circular address to each of the subscriber he give the history of the matter and explain why he have hope that the telegraph would supply he with the means to paint the picture and then he add : -- i have as yet not realize one cent and thus i find myself farther from my object than ever upon deliberately consider the matter the last winter and spring i come to the determination in the first place to free myself from the pecuniary obligation under which i have so long lain to my friend of the association and i commence a system of economy and retrenchment by which i hope gradually to amass the necessary sum for that purpose which sum it will be see amount in the aggregate to $ 510 three hundred dollar of this sum i have already lay aside when a article in the new york ` mirror ' of the 16th October determine I at once to commence the refunding of the sum receive what the substance of the article in the mirror be i do not know but it be probably one of those scurrilous and defamatory attack from many of which he suffer in common with other person of prominence and which be call forth perhaps by he activity in the politics of the day that i have not exaggerate in say that he be almost on the verge of starvation during these dark year be evidence by the follow word picture from the pen of general strother of virginium know in the world of literature under the pen name of porte crayon : -- i engage to become morse 's pupil and subsequently go to new york and find he in a room in university place he have three other pupil and i soon find that we professor have very little patronage i pay my fifty dollar that settle for one quarter 's instruction morse be a faithful teacher and take as much interest in we progress -- more indeed than -- we do ourselves but he be very poor i remember that when my second quarter 's pay be due my remittance from home do not come as expect and one day the professor come in and say courteously : -- ` well strother my boy how be we off for money ' ` why professor ' i answer ' i be sorry to say i have be disappointed but i expect a remittance next week ' ` next week ' he repeat sadly ' i shall be dead by that time ' ` dead sir ' ` yes dead by starvation ' i be distressed and astonished i say hurriedly : -- ` would ten dollar be of any service ' ` ten dollar would save my life that be all it would do ' i pay the money all that i have and we dine together it be a modest meal but good and after he have finish he say : -- ` this be my first meal for twenty-four hour strother do not be a artist it mean beggary you life depend upon people who know nothing of you art and care nothing for you a house-dog life better and the very sensitiveness that stimulate a artist to work keep he alive to suffer ' another artist describe the condition in 1841 in the follow word : -- in the spring of 18411 be search for a studio in which to set up my easel my ` house-hunt ' end at the new york university where i find what i want in one of the turret of that stately edifice when i have fix my choice the janitor who accompany I in my examination of the room throw open a door on the opposite side of the hall and invite I to enter i find myself in what be evidently a artist 's studio but every object in it bear indubitable sign of unthrift and neglect the statuette bust and model of various kind be cover with dust and cobweb dusty canvas be face to the wall and stump of brush and scrap of paper litter the floor the only sign of industry consist of a few masterly crayon drawing and little luscious study of color pin to the wall ` you will have a artist for a neighbor ' say the janitor ` though he be not here much of late he seem to be get rather shiftless he be waste he time over some silly invention a machine by which he expect to send message from one place to another he be a very good painter and might do well if he would only stick to he business but lord ' he add with a sneer of contempt ` the idea of tell by a little streak of lightning what a body be say at the other end of it ' judge of my astonishment when he inform I that the ` shiftless individual ' whose foolish waste of time so much excited he commiseration be none other than the president of the national academy of design -- the most exalted position in my youthful artistic fancy it be possible for mortal to attain -- sfb morse since better know as the inventor of the electric telegraph but a little while after this he fame be flash through the world and the unbeliever who vote he insane be force to confess that there be at least ` method in he madness ' the spring and summer of 1841 wear away and nothing be accomplish on August 16 morse write to smith : -- we telegraph matter be in a situation to do none of we any good unless some understanding can be enter into among the proprietor i have recently receive a letter from mr isaac n coffin from washington with a commendatory letter from hon r mcclellan of the house mr coffin propose to take upon himself the labor of urge through the two house the bill relate to my telegraph which you know have long be before congress he will press it and let he compensation depend on he success this mr coffin write many long letter tell in vivid language of the great difficulty which beset the passage of a bill through both house of congress and of how skilled he be in all the diplomatic move necessary to success and finally after a long delay occasion by the difficulty of get power of attorney from all the proprietor he be authorize to go ahead the sanguine inventor hope much from this unsolicited offer of assistance but he be again doom to disappointment for mr coffin 's glowing promise amount to nothing at all and the session of 1841-42 end with no action take on the bill in view of the fact allude to in a former chapter that franci oj smith later become a bitter enemy of morse 's and be responsible for many of the virulent attack upon he go so far as to say that most if not all of the essential of the telegraph have be invent by other it may be well to quote the following sentence from a letter of August 21 1841 in reply to morse 's of August 16 : -- i shall be in washington more next winter and will lend all aid in my power of course to any agent we may have there my expenditure in the affair as you know have be large and liberal and have somewhat embarrassed I hence i can not incur more outlay i be however extremely solicitous for the double purpose of have you witness with you own eye and in you own lifetime the consummation in actual practical national utility -lrb- of -rrb- this beautiful and wonderful offspring of you mechanical and philosophical genius and know that you have not overestimate the service you have be ambitious of render to you country and the world on December 8 1841 morse again urge smith to action : -- indeed my dear sir something ought to be do to carry forward this enterprise that we may all receive what i think we all deserve the whole labor and expense of move at all devolve on I and i have nothing in the world completely cripple in means i have scarcely -lrb- indeed i have not at all -rrb- the means even to pay the postage of letter on the subject i feel it most tantalizing to find that there be a movement in washington on the subject to know that telegraph will be before congress this session and from the means possess by gonon and wheatstone -lrb- yes wheatstone who successfully head we off in england -rrb- one or the other of they two plan will probably be adopt wheatstone i suppose you know have a patent here and have expend $ 1000 to get everything prepare for a campaign to carry he project into operation and more than that he patent be date _ before mine _ my dear sir to speak as i feel i be sick at heart to perceive how easily other _ foreigner _ can manage we congress and can contrive to cheat we country out of the honor of a discovery of which the country boast and we countryman out of the profit which be we due to perceive how easily they can find man and mean to help they in they plan and how difficult nay impossible for we to find either be it really so or be i deceive what can be do do write immediately and propose something will you not be in washington this winter will you not call on I as you pass through new york if you do go gonon have he telegraph on the capitol and a committee of the senate report in favor of try he for a short distance and will pass a bill this session if we be not do something some means somehow must be raise i have be compel to stop my machine just at the moment of completion i can not move a step without run in debt and that i can not do as to the company that be think of to carry the telegraph into operation here it be another of those _ igne fatuus _ that have just lead I on to waste a little more time money and patience and then vanish the gentleman who propose the matter be doubtless friendly disposed but he lack judgment and perseverance in a matter of this sort if congress would but pass the bill of $ 30000 before they there would be no difficulty there be no difficulty in the scientific or mechanical part of the matter that be a problem solve the only difficulty that remain be obtain fund which congress can furnish to carry it into execution i have a great deal to say but must stop for want of time to write more but he do not stop he be so full of he subject that he continue at some length : -- everything do by I in regard to the telegraph be at arm 's length i can do nothing without consultation and when i wish to consult on the most trivial thing i have three letter to write and a week or ten day to wait before i can receive a answer i feel at time almost ready to cast the whole matter to the wind and turn my attention forever from the subject indeed i feel almost incline at tune to destroy the evidence of priority of invention in my possession and let wheatstone and england take the credit of it for it be tantalize in the highest degree to find the papers and the lecturer boast of the invention as one of the greatest of the age and as a honor to america and yet to have the nation by its representative leave the inventor without the means either to put he invention fairly before he countryman or to defend himself against foreign attack if i have the means in any way of support in washington this winter i would go on in the middle of January and push the matter but i can not run the risk i would write a detailed history of the invention which would be a interesting document to have print in the congressional document and establish beyond contradiction both priority and superiority of my invention have not the postmaster-general or secretary of war or treasury the power to pay a few hundred dollar from a contingent fund for such purpose whatever become of the invention through the neglect of those who could but would not lend a help hand _ you _ my dear sir will have the reflection that you do all in you power to aid I and i be deter from give up the matter as desperate most of all for the consideration that those who kindly lend they aid when the invention be in its infancy would suffer and that therefore i should not be deal right by they if this be a little _ blue _ forgive it it appear from this letter that morse bear no ill-will towards he partner for not come to he assistance at this critical stage of the enterprise so that it behoove we not to be too harsh in we judgment perhaps i have not sufficiently emphasize the fact that owe to the great financial depression which prevail at that time mr smith and the vail be seriously cripple in they means and be not able to advance any more money and professor gale have never be call upon to contribute money this do not alter my main contention however for it still remain true that if it have not be for morse 's dogged persistence during these dark year the enterprise would in all probability have fail with the other it be merely a incident with he it have become he whole life the same refrain run through all the letter of 1841 and 1842 discouragement at the slow progress which be be make and yet a sincere conviction that eventually the cause will triumph on December 13 1841 he say in a letter to vail : -- we be all somewhat cripple and i most of all be oblige to superintend the get up of a set of machinery complete and to make the greater part myself and without a cent of money all the burden now rest on my shoulder after year of time devoted to the enterprise and i be willing as far as i be able to bear my share if the other proprietor will lend a help hand and give I facility to act and a reasonable recompense for my service in case of success vail reply to this letter on December 15 say : i have recently give considerable thought to the subject of the telegraph and be intend to get permission of you if there be anything to the contrary in we article of agreement to build for myself and my private use a telegraph upon you plan in answer this letter on December 18 morse again urge vail to give he a power of attorney and add : -- you can see in a moment that if i have to write to all the scatter proprietor of the telegraph every time any movement be make what a burden fall upon I both of expense of time and money which i can not afford in act for my own interest in this matter i of course act for the interest of all if we can get that thirty thousand dollar bill through congress the experiment -lrb- if it can any longer be call such -rrb- can then be try on such a scale as to insure its success you ask permission to make a telegraph for you own use i have no objection but before you commence one you have better see I and the improvement which i have make and i can suggest a few more rather of a ornamental character and some economical arrangement which may be of use to you i thank you for you kind invitation and when i come to philadelphium shall _ a vail _ myself of you politeness i suppose by this time you have a brood of chicken around you well go on and prosper as for I i be not well be much depress at time and have many care anxiety and disappointment in which i be aware i be not alone but all will work for the best if we only look through the cloud and see a kind parent direct all this reflection alone cheer I and give I renewed strength condition remain practically unchanged during the early part of the year 1842 if it have not be for occasional bit of encouragement from different quarter the inventor would probably have yield to the temptation to abandon all and depend on he brush again for a living perhaps the ray of greatest encouragement which lighten the gloom of this depressing period be the following letter from professor henry date February 24 1842 : -- my dear sir -- i be pleased to learn that you have again petition congress in reference to you telegraph and i most sincerely hope you will succeed in convince we representative of the importance of the invention in this you may perhaps find some difficulty since in the mind of many the electro-magnetic telegraph be associate with the various chimerical project constantly present to the public and particularly with the scheme so popular a year or two ago for the application of electricity as a move power in the art i have assert from the first that all attempt of this kind be premature and make without a proper knowledge of scientific principle the case be however entirely different in regard to the electro-magnetic telegraph science be now fully ripe for this application and i have not the least doubt if proper means be afford of the perfect success of the invention the idea of transmit intelligence to a distance by means of electrical action have be suggest by various person from the time of franklin to the present but until the last few year or since the principal discovery in electro-magnetism all attempt to reduce it to practice be necessarily unsuccessful the mere suggestion however of a scheme of this kind be a matter for which little credit can be claim since it be one which would naturally arise in the mind of almost any person familiar with the phenomenon of electricity but the bring it forward at the proper moment when the development of science be able to furnish the means of certain success and the devise a plan for carry it into practical operation be the grounds of a just claim to scientific reputation as well as to public patronage about the same time with yourself professor wheatstone of london and dr steinheil of germany propose plan of the electro-magnetic telegraph but these differ as much from yours as the nature of the common principle would well permit and unless some essential improvement have lately be make in these european plan _ i should ` prefer the one invent by yourself _ with my best wish for you success i remain with much esteem yours truly joseph henry i consider this one of the most important bit of contemporary evidence that have come down to we professor henry perfectly conversant with all the minutiae of science and invention practically give to morse all the credit which the inventor himself at any time claim he dismiss the claim of those who merely suggest a telegraph or even make unsuccessful attempt to reduce one to practice unsuccessful because the time be not yet ripe and he award morse scientific as well as popular reputation furthermore professor henry with the clear vision of a trained mind point out that advance in discovery and invention be necessarily slow and dependent upon the labor of many in the same field he cordial endorsement of the invention in this letter and later so pleased and encouraged morse that he refer to it several time in he correspondence to mr smith on July 16 1842 he write : -- professor henry visit I a day or two ago he know the principle of the telegraph but have never before see it he tell a gentleman who mention it again to I that without exception it be the most beautiful and ingenious instrument he have ever see he say mine be the only truly practicable plan he have be experiment and make discovery on celestial electricity and he say that wheatstone 's and steinheil 's telegraph must be so influence in a highly electrical state of the atmosphere as at time to be useless they use the deflection of the needle while mine from the use of the magnet be not subject to this disturbing influence i believe if the truth be know some such cause be operate to prevent we hear more of these telegraph in this same letter he tell of the application of a certain mr john p manrow for permission to form a company but as nothing come of it it will not be necessary to particularize mr manrow however be a successful contractor on the new york and erie railroad and it be a most encouraging sign to have practical business man begin to take notice of the invention so cheer be the ever-hopeful inventor by the praise of professor henry that he redouble he effort to get the matter properly before congress and in this he work alone for in the letter to smith just quote from he say : i have not hear a word from mr coffin at washington since i see you i presume he have abandon the idea of do anything on the term we propose and so have give it up well so be it i be content take advantage of the fact that he be personally acquaint with many member of congress he write to several of they on the subject in some of the letter he treat exhaustively of the history and scientific principle of he telegraph but i have select the follow address to the honorable ww boardman as contain the most essential fact in the most concise form : -- August 10 1842 my dear sir -- i enclose you a copy of the tribune in which you will see a notice of my telegraph i have show its operation to a few friend occasionally within a few week among other to professor henry of princeton -lrb- a copy of whose letter to I on this subject i send you some time since -rrb- he have never see it in operation but have only learn from description the principle on which it be found he be not of a enthusiastic temperament but exceedingly cautious in give a opinion on scientific invention yet in this case he express himself in the warmest term and tell my friend dr chilton -lrb- who inform I of it -rrb- that he have just be witness the operation of the most beautiful and ingenious instrument he have ever see indeed since i last write you i have be wholly occupy in perfect its detail and make myself familiar with the whole system there be not a shadow of a doubt as to its perform all that i have promise in regard to it and indeed all that have be conceive of it few can understand the obstacle arise from want of pecuniary means that i have have to encounter the past winter to avoid debt -lrb- which i will never incur -rrb- i have be compel to make with my own hand a great part of my machinery but at a expense of time of very serious consideration to I i have execute in six month what a good machinist if i have the means to employ he would have perform in as many week and perform much better i have hope to be able to show my perfect instrument in washington long before this and be -lrb- until this morning -rrb- contemplate its transportation thither next week the news just arrive of the propose adjournment of congress have stop my preparation and interpose i fear another year of anxious suspense now my dear sir as you time be precious i will state in few word what i desire the government will eventually without doubt become possess of this invention for it will be necessary from many consideration not merely as a direct advantage to the government and public at large if regulate by the government but as a preventive of the evil effect which must result if it be a monopoly of a company to this latter mode of remunerate myself i shall be compel to resort if the government should not eventually act upon it you be so good as to call the attention of the house to the subject by a resolution of inquiry early in the session i write you some time after request a stay of action on the part of the committee in the hope that long before this i could show they the telegraph in washington but just as i be ready i find that congress will adjourn before i can reach washington and put the instrument in order for they inspection will it be possible before congress rise to appropriate a small sum say $ 3500 under the direction of the secretary of the treasury to put my telegraph in operation for the inspection of congress the next session if congress will grant this sum i will engage to have a complete telegraph on my electro-magnetic plan between the president 's house or one of the department and the capitol and the navy yard so that instantaneous communication can be hold between these three point at pleasure at any time of day or night at any season in clear or rainy weather and ready for they examination during the next session of congress so that the whole subject may be fairly understand i believe that do the great majority of congress but consider seriously the result of this invention of the electric telegraph on all the interest of society do they suffer themselves to dwell but for a moment on the vast consequence of the instantaneous communication of intelligence from one part to the other of the land in a commercial point of view and as facilitate the defens of the country which my invention render certain they would not hesitate to pass all the act necessary to secure its control to the government i ask not this until they have thoroughly examine its merit but will they not assist I in place the matter fairly before they surely so small a sum to the government for so great a object can not reasonably be deny i hardly know in what form this request of mine should be make should it be by petition to congress or will this letter hand in to the committee be sufficient if a petition be require for form 's sake to be refer to the committee to report shall i ask the favor of you to make such petition in proper form you know my dear sir just what i wish and i know from the kind and friendly feeling you have show toward my invention i may count on you aid if on you return you stop a day or two in new york i shall be glad to show you the operation of the telegraph as it be this modest request of the inventor be doom like so many of he hope to be shatter as we learn from the courteous reply of mr boardman date August 12 : -- dear sir -- yours of the 10th be receive i have already see the notice of you telegraph in the tribune and be prepare for such a report this be not the time to commence any new project before congress we be i trust within ten day of adjournment there be no prospect of a tariff at this session and as that matter appear settle the sooner congress adjourn the better the subject of you telegraph be some month ago as you know refer to the committee on commerce and by that committee it be refer to mr ferris one of the member of that committee from the city of new york and who by-the-way be now at home in the city and will be glad to see you on the subject i can not give you he address but you can easily find he the treasury and the government be both bankrupt and that foolish tyler have veto the tariff bill the house be in bad humor and nothing of the kind you propose could be do the only chance would be for the committee on commerce to report such a plan but there would be little or no chance of get such a appropriation through this session i have much faith in you plan and hope you will continue to push it toward congress this be almost the last straw and it be not strange that the long-suffering inventor should have be on the point of give up in despair nor that he should have give vent to he despondency in the follow letter to smith : -- while so far as the invention itself be concerned everything be favorable i find myself without sympathy or help from any who be associate with I whose interest one would think would impel they at least to inquire if they could render some assistance for two year past i have devote all my time and scanty means live on a mere pittance deny myself all pleasure and even necessary food that i might have a sum to put my telegraph into such a position before congress as to insure success to the common enterprise i be crush for want of means and means of so trivial a character too that they who know how to ask -lrb- which i do not -rrb- could obtain in a few hour one more year have go for want of these means i have now ascertain that however unpromising be the time last session if i could but have go to washington i could have get some aid to enable I to insure success at the next session the other project for telegraph must have be abandon for he go on to say : -- as it be although everything be favorable although i have no competition and no opposition -- on the contrary although every member of congress as far as i can learn be favorable -- yet i fear all will fail because i be too poor to risk the trifling expense which my journey and residence in washington will occasion I i will not run in debt if i lose the whole matter so unless i have the means from some source i shall be compel however reluctantly to leave it and if i get once engage in my proper profession again the telegraph and its proprietor will urge I from it in vain no one can tell the day and month of anxiety and labor i have have in perfect my telegraphic apparatus for want of means i have be compel to make with my own hand -lrb- and to labor for week -rrb- a piece of mechanism which could be make much better and in a tenth part of the time by a good mechanician thus waste _ time _ -- time which i can not recall and which seem double-winged to I ` hope defer maketh the heart sick ' it be true and i have know the full meaning of it nothing but the consciousness that i have a invention which be to mark a era in human civilization and which be to contribute to the happiness of million would have sustain I through so many and such lengthen trial of patience in perfect it chapter xxix July 16 1842 -- march 26 1843 continue discouragement -- work on improvement -- first submarine cable from battery to governor 's island -- the vail refuse to give financial assistance -- go to washington -- experiment conduct at the capitol -- first to discover duplex and wireless telegraphy -- dr fisher -- friend in congress -- find he statuette of die hercule in basement of capitol -- alternately hope and despair of bill pass congress -- bill favorably report from committee -- cloud break -- ridicule in congress -- bill pass house by narrow majority -- long delay in senate -- last day of session -- despair -- bill pass -- victory at last slowly the mill of the god have be grind so slowly that one marvel at they leaden pace and wonder why the dream of the man so eager to benefit he fellowman could not have be realize sooner we be force to echo the word of the inventor himself in a previously quote letter : i be perfectly satisfy that mysterious as it may seem to I it have all be order in its minutest particulars in infinite wisdom he enlarge on this point in the letter to smith of July 16 1842 refer to the difficulty he have encounter through lack of means he say : -- i have oftentimes rise in the morning not know where the means be to come from for the common expense of the day reflect one moment on my situation in regard to the invention compel from the first from my want of the means to carry out the invention to a practical result to ask assistance from those who have means i associate with I the messr vail and dr gale by make over to they on certain condition a portion of the patent right these means enable I to carry it successfully forward to a certain point at this point you be also admit into a share of the patent on certain condition which carry the enterprise forward successfully still further since then disappointment have occur and disaster to the property of every one concern in the enterprise but of a character not touch the intrinsic merit of the invention in the least yet bear on its progress so fatally as for several year to paralyze all attempt to proceed the depressed situation of all my associate in the invention have throw the whole burden of again attempt a movement entirely on I with the trifling sum of five hundred dollar i could have have my instrument perfect and before congress six month ago but i be unable to run the risk and i therefore choose to go forward more slowly but at a great waste of time in all these remark understand I as not throw the least blame on any individual i believe that the situation in which you all be throw be altogether providential -- that human foresight could not avert it and i firmly believe too that the delay tantalize and try as they have be will in the end turn out to be beneficial i have hazard the opinion that it be a kindly fate which frustrate the consummation of the russian contract and here again i venture to say that the fate be kind that morse be right in say that the delay would turn out to be beneficial and why because it need all these year of careful thought and experiment on the part of the inventor to bring he instrument to the perfection necessary to complete success and because the period of financial depression through which the country be then pass be unfavorable to a enterprise of this character the history of all invention prove that no matter how clear a vision of the future some enthusiast may have have the dream be never actually realize until all the condition be favorable and the psychological moment have arrive professor henry show in he letter of February 24 that he realize that some day electricity would be use as a motive power but that much remain yet to be discover and invent before this could be actually and practically accomplish so too the conquest of the air remain a dream for century until to use professor henry 's word science be ripe for its application therefore i think we can conclude that however confident morse may have be that he invention could have stand the test of actual commercial use during those year of discouragement it heed the perfection which he himself give it during those same year to enable it to prove its superiority over other method among the other improvement make by morse at this time the follow be mention in the letter to smith of July 16 1842 just quote from : i have invent a battery which will delight you it be the most powerful of its size ever invent and this part of my telegraphic apparatus the result of experiment have enable I to simplify and truly to perfect another most important development of the invention be make in the year 1842 the problem of cross wide body of water have naturally present itself to the mind of the inventor at a early date and during the most of this year he have devote himself seriously to its solution he laboriously insulate about two mile of copper wire with pitch tar and rubber and on the evening of October 18 1842 he carry it wind on a reel to the battery in new york and hire a row-boat with a man to row he while he pay out he cable tradition say that it be a beautiful moonlight night and that the stroller on the battery be mystified and wonder what kind of fish be be troll for the next day the follow editorial notice appear in the new york herald : -- morse 's electro-magnetic telegraph this important invention be to be exhibit in operation at castle garden between the hour of twelve and one o'clock to-day one telegraph will be erect on governor 's island and one at the castle and message will be interchange and order transmit during the day many have be incredulous as to the power of this wonderful triumph of science and art all such may now have a opportunity of fairly test it _ it be destine to work a complete revolution in the mode of transmit intelligence throughout the civilized world _ before the appoint hour on the morning of the 19th morse hasten to the battery and find a curious crowd already assemble to witness this new marvel with confidence he seat himself at the instrument and have succeed in exchange a few signal between himself and professor gale at the other end on governor 's island when suddenly the receive instrument be dumb look out across the water of the bay he soon see the cause of the interruption six or seven vessel be anchor along the line of he cable and one of they in raise she anchor have foul the cable and pull it up not know what it be the sailor haul in about two hundred foot of it then find no end they cut the cable and sail away ignorant of the blow they have inflict on the mortified inventor the crowd think they have be hoax turn away with jeer and morse be leave alone to bear he disappointment as philosophically as he could later in December the experiment be repeat across the canal at washington and this time with perfect success still cramped for means chafe under the delay which this necessitate he turn to he good friend the vail hope that they might be able to help he while he shrink from borrow money he consider that as they be financially interested in the success of the invention he could with propriety ask for a advance to enable he to go to washington to he request he receive the follow answer from the honorable george vail : -- speedwell iron work December 31 1842 sfb morse esq dear sir -- you favor be at hand i have expect that my father would visit you but he could not go out in the snow-storm of Wednesday and if he have i do not think anything could induce he to raise the needful for the prosecution of we object he say : tell mr morse that there be no one i would sooner assist than he if i could but in the present posture of my affair i be not warrant in undertake anything more than to make my payment as they become due of which there be not a few he think that mr s -- might soon learn how to manage it and as he be there it would save a great expense i do not myself know that he could learn but as my means be nothing at the present time i can only wish you success if you go on of course mr vail mean if you go on to washington but to the sensitive mind of the inventor the word must have seem to imply a doubt of the advisability of go on with the enterprise however he be not daunt but in some way he procure the means to defray he expense perhaps from he good brother sidney for the next letter to mr vail be from washington on December 18 1842 : -- i have not write you since my arrival as i have nothing special to say nor have i now anything very decide to communicate in relation to my enterprise except that it be in a very favorable train the telegraph as you will see by Thursday or Friday 's ` intelligencer ' be establish between two of the committee room in the capitol and excite universal admiration i be tell from all quarter that there be but one sentiment in congress respect it and that the appropriation will unquestionably pass the discovery i make with dr fisher just before leave new york of the fact that two or more current will pass without interference at the same time on the same wire excite the wonder of all the scientific in and out of congress here and when i show they the certainty of it in the practical application of it to simplify my telegraph they admiration be loudly express and it have create a feeling highly advantageous to I i believe i draw for you a method by which i think i could pass river _ without any wire _ through the water i try the experiment across the canal here on Friday afternoon _ with perfect success _ this also have add a fresh interest in my favor and i begin to hope that i be on the eve of realize something in the shape of compensation for my time and mean expend in bring my invention to its present state i dare not be sanguine however for i have have too much experience of delusive hope to indulge in any premature exultation now there be no opposition but it may spring up unexpectedly and defeat all i find dr fisher a great help he be acquaint with a great many of the member and he be round among they and create a interest for the telegraph mr smith have not yet make he appearance and if he do not come soon everything will be accomplish without he my associate proprietor indeed be at present broken reed yet i be aware they be disabled in various way from help I and i ought to remember that they help in the commencement of the enterprise be essential in put the telegraph into the position it now be -lrb- in -rrb- therefore although they give I now no aid it be not from unwillingness but from inability and i shall not grudge they they proportion of its profit nor do i believe they will be unwilling to reimburse I my expense should the telegraph eventually be purchase by the government mr ferris we representative be very much interested in understand the scientific principle on which my telegraph be base and have exert himself very strongly in my behalf so have mr boardman and in a special manner dr aycrigg of new jersey the latter of whom be determine the bill shall pass by acclamation mr huntington of the senate mr woodbury and mr wright be also very strongly friendly to the telegraph this letter to the best of my knowledge have never before be publish and yet it contain statement of the utmost interest the discovery of duplex telegraphy or the possibility of send two or more message over the same wire at the same time have be credit by various authority to different person by some to mose g farmer in 1852 by other to gintl of vienna in 1853 or to frischen or siemen and halske in 1854 yet we see from this letter that morse and he assistant dr fisher not only make the discovery ten year earlier in 1842 but demonstrate its practicability to the scientist and other in washington at that date why this fact should have be lose sight of i can not tell but i be glad to be able to bring forward the proof of the paternity of this brilliant discovery even at this late day still another scientific principle be establish by morse at this early period as we learn from this letter and that be the possibility of wireless telegraphy but as he have be generally credit with the first suggestion of what have now become one of the greatest boon to humanity it will not be necessary to enlarge on it a brighter day seem at last to be dawn and a most curious happen just at this time come to the inventor as a auspicious omen in string he wire between the two committee room he have to descend into a vault beneath they which have be long unused a workman who be help he go ahead and carry a lamp and as he glance around the chamber morse notice something white on a shelf at one side curious to see what this could be he go up to it when what be he amazement to find that it be a plaster cast of that little statuette of the die hercule which have win for he the adelphi gold medal so many year before in london there be the token of he first artistic success appear to he out of the gloom as the harbinger of another success which he hope would also soon emerge from behind the lower cloud the apparently mysterious presence of the little demigod in such a out-of-the-way place be easily explain six cast of the clay model have be make before the original be break up one of these morse have keep for himself four have be give to various institution and one to he friend charle bulfinch who succeed latrobe as the architect of the capitol a sinister fate seem to pursue these little effigy for he own and the four he have present to different institution be all destroy in one way and another after trace each one of these five to its untimely end he come to the conclusion that this evidence of he youthful genius have perish from the earth but here at last the only remain copy be providentially reveal to the eye of its creator have undoubtedly be place in the vault for safe-keeping and overlook it be cheerfully return to he by he it be give to he friend the reverend e goodrich smith and by the latter present to yale university where it now rest in the fine art build so end the year 1842 a decade since the first conception of the telegraph on board the sully and it find the inventor make he last stand for recognition from that government to which he have be so loyal and upon which he wish to bestow a priceless gift with the dawn of the new year a year destine to mark a epoch in the history of civilization he flagging spirit be revive and he enter with zest on what prove to be he final and successful struggle it pass belief that with so many ocular demonstration of the practicability of the morse telegraph and with the report of the success of other telegraph abroad the popular mind as reflect in its representative in congress should have remain so incredulous morse have be lead to hope that he bill be go to pass by acclamation but in this he be rudely disappoint still he have many warm friend who believe in he and he invention first and foremost should be mention he classmate henry l ellsworth the commissioner of patent at whose hospitable home the inventor stay during some of these anxious day and who with he family cheer he with encourage word and help among the member of congress who be energetic in support of the bill especially worthy of mention be -- kennedy of maryland mason of ohio wallace of indiana ferris and boardman of new york holme of south carolina and aycrigg of new jersey the alternate mood of hope and despair through which the inventor pass during the next few week be best picture forth by himself in brief extract from letter to he brother sidney : -- _ January 6 1843 _ i send you a copy of the report on the telegraph a day or two since i be in hope of have it call up to-day but the house refuse to go into committee of the whole on the state of the union so it be defer the first time they go into committee of the whole on the state of the union it will probably be call up and be decide upon everything look favorable but i do not suffer myself to be sanguine for i do not know what may be do secretly against it i shall believe it pass when the signature of the president be affix to it and not before _ January 16 _ i snatch the moment of wait for company in the committee room of commerce to write a few line patience be a virtue much need and much try here so far as opinion go everything be favorable to my bill i hear of no opposition but should not be surprise if it meet with some the great difficulty be to get it up before the house there be so many who must ' _ define they position _ ' as the term be so many who must say something to ` bunkum ' that a great deal of the people 's time be waste in mere idle unprofitable speechifying i hope something may be do this week that shall be decisive so that i may know what to do this wait at so much risk make I question myself : be i in the path of duty when i think that the little money i bring with I be nearly go that if nothing should be do by congress i shall be in a destitute state that perhaps i shall have again to be a burden to friend until i know to what to turn my hand i feel low-spirited i be only relieve by naked trust in god and it be right that this should be so _ January 20 _ my patience be still try in wait for the action of congress on my bill with so much at stake you may easily conceive how tantalizing be this state of suspense i wish to feel right on this subject not to be impatient nor distrustful nor fretful and yet to be prepare for the worst i find my fund exhausting my clothing wear out my time especially rapidly wane and my affair at home require some little look after and then if i should after all be disappoint the alternative look dark and to human eye disastrous in the extreme i hardly dare contemplate this side of the matter and yet i ought so far to consider it as to provide if possible against be strike down by such a blow at time after wait all day and day after day in the hope that my bill may be call up and in vain i feel heart-sick and finding nothing accomplish that no progress be make that _ precious time _ fly i be depressed and begin to question whether i be in the way of duty but when i feel that i have do all in my power and that this delay may be design by the wise disposer of all event for a trial of patience i find relief and a disposition quietly to wait such issue as he shall direct know that if i sincerely have put my trust in he he will not lead I astray and my way will in any event be make plain _ January 25 _ i be still _ wait wait _ i know not what the issue will be and wish to be prepare and have you all prepare for the worst in regard to the bill although i learn of no opposition yet i have see enough of the mode of business in the house to know that everything there be more than in ordinary matter uncertain it will be the end of the session probably before i return i will not have to reproach myself or be reproach by other for any neglect but under all circumstance i be exceedingly try i be too foreboding probably and ought not so to look ahead as to be distrustful i fear that i have no right feeling in this state of suspense it be easier to say ` thy will be do ' than at all tune to feel it yet i can pray that god 's will may be do whatever become of I and mine _ January 30 _ i be still keep in suspense which be become more and more tantalizing and painful but i endeavor to exercise patience _ February 21 _ i think the cloud begin to break away and a little sunlight begin to cheer I the house in committee of the whole on the state of the union have just pass my bill through committee to report to the house there be a attempt make to cast ridicule upon it by a very few head by mr cave johnson who propose a amendment that half the sum should be appropriate to mesmeric experiment only 26 support he and it be lay aside to be report to the house without amendment and without division i be immediately surround by my friend in the house congratulating I and tell I that the crisis be pass and that the bill will pass the house by a large majority mr kennedy chairman of the committee on commerce have put the bill on the speaker 's calendar for Thursday morning when the final vote in the house will be take it then have to go to the senate where i have reason to believe it will meet with a favorable reception then to the president and if sign by he i shall return with renovate spirit for i assure you i have for some time be at the lowest ebb and can now scarcely realize that a turn have occur in my favor i do not know when i have be so much try as in the tedious delay of the last two month but i see a reason for it in the providence of god he have be please to try my patience and not until my impatience have yield unreservedly to submission have he relieve I by grant light upon my path praise be he name for to he alone belong all the glory i write with a dreadful headache cause by over excitement in the house but hope to be better after a night 's rest i have write in haste just to inform you of the first symptom of success on the same date as that of the precede letter February 21 the following appear in the congressional globe and its very curtness and flippancy be indicative of the indifference of the public in general to this great invention and the proceedings which be summarize cast discredit on the intelligence of we national lawmaker : -- electro and animal magnetism on motion of mr kennedy of maryland the committee take up the bill to authorize a series of experiment to be make in order to test the merit of morse 's electro-magnetic telegraph the bill appropriate $ 30000 to be expend under the direction of the postmaster-general on motion of mr kennedy the word postmaster-general be stricken out and secretary of the treasury insert mr cave johnson wish to have a word to say upon the bill as the present congress have do much to encourage science he do not wish to see the science of mesmerism neglect and overlook he therefore propose that one half of the appropriation be give to mr fisk to enable he to carry on experiment as well as professor morse mr houston think that millerism should also be include in the benefit of the appropriation mr stanly say he should have no objection to the appropriation for mesmeric experiment provide the gentleman from tennessee -lrb- mr cave johnson -rrb- be the subject -lrb- a laugh -rrb- mr cave johnson say he should have no objection provide the gentleman from north carolina -lrb- mr stanly -rrb- be the operator -lrb- great laughter -rrb- several gentleman call for the reading of the amendment and it be read by the clerk as follow : -- _ provide _ that one half of the say sum shall be appropriate for try mesmeric experiment under the direction of the secretary of the treasury mr s mason rise to a question of order he maintain that the amendment be not _ bona fide _ and that such amendment be calculate to injure the character of the house he appeal to the chair to rule the amendment out of order the chairman say it be not for he to judge of the motive of member in offer amendment and he could not therefore undertake to pronounce the amendment not _ bona fide _ objection might be raise to it on the ground that it be not sufficiently analogous in character to the bill under consideration but in the opinion of the chair it would require a scientific analysis to determine how far the magnetism of mesmerism be analogous to that to be employ in telegraph -lrb- laughter -rrb- he therefore rule the amendment in order on take the vote the amendment be reject -- aye 22 no not count the bill be then lay aside to be report on February 23 the once more hopeful inventor send off the follow hurriedly write letter to he brother : -- you will perceive by the proceedings of the house to-day that _ my bill have pass the house by a vote of 89 to 80 _ a close vote after the expectation raise by some of my friend in the early part of the session but enough be as good as a feast and it be safe so far as the house be concerned i will advise you of the progress of it through the senate all my anxiety be now centre there i write in great haste a revise record of the voting show that the margin of victory be even slighter for in a letter to smith morse say : -- the long agony -lrb- truly agony to I -rrb- be over for you will perceive by the papers of to-morrow that so far as the house be concern the matter be decide _ my bill have pass by a vote of eighty-nine to eighty-three _ a close vote you will say but explain upon several grounds not affect the disposition of many individual member who vote against it to the invention in this matter six vote be as good as a thousand so far as the appropriation be concern the yea and nay will tell you who be friendly and who adverse to the bill i shall now bend all my attention to the senate there be a good disposition there and i be now strongly encourage to think that my invention will be place before the country in such a position as to be properly appreciate and to yield to all its proprietor a proper compensation i have no desire to vaunt my exertion but i can truly say that i have never pass so try a period as the last two month professor fisher -lrb- who have be of the greatest service to I -rrb- and i have be busy from morning till night every day since we have be here i have bring he on with I at my expense and he will be one of the first assistant in the first experimental line if the bill pass my feeling at the prospect of success be of a joyous character as you may well believe and one of the principal element of my joy be that i shall be enable to contribute to the happiness of all who formerly assist I some of whom be at present specially depressed write to alfred vail on the same day he say after tell of the passage of the bill : -- you can have but a faint idea of the sacrifice and trial i have have in get the telegraph thus far before the country and the world i can not detail they here i can only say that for two year i have labor all my time and at my own expense without assistance from the other proprietor -lrb- except in obtain the iron of the magnet for the last instrument obtain of you -rrb- to forward we enterprise my means to defray my expense to meet which every cent i own in the world be collect be nearly all go and if by any mean the bill should fail in the senate i shall return to new york with the _ fraction of a dollar _ in my pocket and now the final struggle which mean success or failure be on only eight day of the session remain and the calendar be as usual crowd the inventor he nerve stretch to the breaking point hope and yet fear he have every reason to believe that the senate would show more broad-minded enlightenment than the house and yet he have be tell that he bill would pass the house by acclamation while the event prove that it have barely squeeze through by a beggarly majority of six he hear disquieting rumor of a determination on the part of some of the house member to procure the defeat of the bill in the senate would they succeed would the victory almost win be snatch from he at the last moment or would he faith in a overrule providence and in he own mission as a instrument of that providence be justify at last every day of that fateful week see he in he place in the gallery of the senate chamber and all day long he sit there listen as we can well imagine with grow impatience to the senatorial oratory on the merit or demerit of bill which to he be of such minor importance however heavily freight with the destiny of the nation they may have be and every night he return to he room with the sad reflection that one more of the precious day have pass and he bill have not be reach and then come the last day march 3 that day when the session of the senate be prolonged till midnight when the president leave the white house sit in the room provide for he at the capitol ready to sign the bill which be pass in these last few hurry hour if they meet with he approval or to consign they to oblivion if they do not the now despairing inventor cling to he post in the gallery almost to the end but be assure by he senatorial friend that there be no possibility of the bill be reach and unable to bear the final blow of hear the gavel fall which should signalize he defeat shrink from the well-meant condolence of he friend he return almost broken-hearted to he room the future must have look black indeed he have stake he all and lose and he be resolve to abandon all further effort to press he invention on a unfeeling and a thankless world he must pick up he brush again he must again woo the fickle goddess of art who have desert he before and who would in all probability be chary of she favor now in that dark hour it would not have be strange if he trust in god have waver if he have doubt the goodness of that providence to whose mysterious workings he have always submissively bow but he faith seem to have rise triumphant even under this crush stroke for he thus describe the event of that fateful night and of the next morning in a letter to bishop steven of pennsylvanium write many year later : -- the last day of the last session of that congress be about to close a bill appropriate thirty thousand dollar for my purpose have pass the house and be before the senate for concurrence on the last day of the session -lrb- 3d of march 1843 -rrb- i have spend the whole day and part of the evening in the senate chamber anxiously watch the progress of the passing of the various bill of which there be in the morning of that day over one hundred and forty to be act upon before the one in which i be interested would be reach and a resolution have a few day before be pass to proceed with the bill on the calendar in they regular order forbid any bill to be take up out of its regular place as evening approach there seem to be but little chance that the telegraph bill would be reach before the adjournment and consequently i have the prospect of the delay of another year with the loss of time and all my means already expend in my anxiety i consult with two of my senatorial friend -- senator huntington of connecticut and senator wright of new york -- ask they opinion of the probability of reach the bill before the close of the session they answer be discourage and they advice be to prepare myself for disappointment in this state of mind i retire to my chamber and make all my arrangement for leave washington the next day painful as be this prospect of renew disappointment you my dear sir will understand I when i say that know from experience whence my help must come in any difficulty i soon disposed of my care and sleep as quietly as a child in the morning as i have just go into the breakfast-room the servant call I out announce that a young lady be in the parlor wish to speak with I i be at once greet with the smile face of my young friend the daughter of my old and value friend and classmate the honorable hl ellsworth the commissioner of patent on my express surprise at so early a call she say : -- ' i have come to congratulate you ' ` indeed for what ' ` on the passage of you bill ' ` oh no my young friend you be mistaken i be in the senate chamber till after the lamp be light and my senatorial friend assure I there be no chance for I ' ` but ' she reply ` it be you that be mistaken father be there at the adjournment at midnight and see the president put he name to you bill and i ask father if i might come and tell you and he give I leave be i the first to tell you ' the news be so unexpected that for some moment i could not speak at length i reply : -- ` yes annie you be the first to inform I and now i be go to make you a promise the first dispatch on the complete line from washington to baltimore shall be yours ' ` well ' say she ' i shall hold you to you promise ' this be the second great moment in the history of the morse telegraph the first be when the inspiration come to he on board the sully more than a decade before and now after year of heart-breaking struggle with poverty and discouragement of all kind the faith in god and in himself which have uphold he through all be justified and he see the dawn of a brighter day on what slight thread do hang we destiny the change of a few vote in the house the delay of a few minute in the senate would have doom morse to failure for it be doubtful whether he would have have the heart the means or the encouragement to prosecute the enterprise further he lose no time in inform he associate of the happy turn in they affair and in the excitement of the moment he not only dated he letter to smith march 3 instead of march 4 but he seem not to have understand that the bill have already be sign by the president and have become a law : -- well my dear sir the matter be decide _ the senate have just pass my bill without division and without opposition _ and it will probably be sign by the president in a few hour this i think be news enough for you at present and as i have other letter that i must write before the mail close i must say good-bye until i see you or hear from you write to I in new york where i hope to be by the latter part of next week and to vail he write on the same day : -- you will be glad to learn doubtless that my bill have pass the senate without a division and without opposition so that now the telegraphic enterprise begin to look bright i shall want to see you in new york after my return which will probably be the latter part of next week i have other letter to write so excuse the shortness of this which if short be sweet at least my kind regard to you father mother brother sister and wife the whole delegation of you state without exception deserve the highest gratitude of we all the representative from the state of new jersey in the house vote unanimously for the bill those of every other state be divide between the yea and the nay and those not vote congratulation now pour in on he from all side and the one he perhaps prize the most be from he friend and master washington allston then live in boston : -- _ march 24 1843 _ all you friend here join I in rejoice at the passing of the act of congress appropriate thirty thousand dollar toward carry out you electro-magnetic telegraph i congratulate you with all my heart shakespeare say : ` there be a tide in the affair of man that take at the flood lead on to fortune ' you be now fairly launch on what i hope will prove to you another pactolus _ i pede fausto _ this have be but a melancholy year to I i have be ill with one complaint or another nearly the whole time the last disorder the erysipelas but this have now nearly disappear i hope this letter will meet you as well in health as i take it you be now in spirit morse lose no time in reply : -- i thank you my dear sir for you congratulation in regard to my telegraphic enterprise i hope i shall not disappoint the expectation of my friend i shall exert all my energy to show a complete and satisfactory result when i last write you from washington i write under the apprehension that my bill would not be act upon and consequently i write in very low spirit ` what have become of painting ' i think i hear you ask ah my dear sir when i have diligently and perseveringly woo the coquettish jade for twenty year and she then jilt I what can i do but i do she injustice she be not to blame but she guardian for the time be i shall not give she up yet in despair but pursue she even with lightning and so overtake she at last i be now absorb in my arrangement for fulfil my design with the telegraph in accordance with the act of congress i know not that i shall be able to complete my experiment before congress meet again but i shall endeavor to show it to they at they next session chapter xxx march 15 1848 -- June 13 1844 work on first telegraph line begin -- gale fisher and vail appoint assistant -- foj smith to secure contract for trenching -- morse not satisfy with contract -- death of washington allston -- report to secretary of the treasury -- prophesy atlantic cable -- failure of underground wire -- carelessness of fisher -- foj smith show cloven hoof -- ezra cornell solve a difficult problem -- cornell 's plan for insulation endorse by professor henry -- many discouragement -- work finally progress favorably -- frelinghuysen 's nomination as vice-president report by telegraph -- line to baltimore complete -- first message -- triumph -- report of democratic convention -- first long-distance conversation -- utility of telegraph establish -- offer to sell to government out of the darkness of despair into which he have be plunge morse have at last emerge into the sunlight of success for a little while he bask in its ray with no cloud to obscure the horizon but he respite be short for new difficulty soon arise and new trial and sorrow soon darken he path immediately after the telegraph bill have become a law he set to work with energy to carry out its provision he decide after consultation with the secretary of the treasury hon jc spencer to erect the experimental line between washington and baltimore along the line of railway and all the preliminary and detail be carefully plan with the sanction of the secretary he appoint professor gale and fisher as he assistant and soon after add mr alfr vail to they number he return to new york and from there write to vail on march 15 : -- you will not fail with you brother and if possible you father to be in new york on Tuesday the 21st to meet the proprietor of the telegraph i be on the point of come out this afternoon with young mr serrell the patentee of the lead-pipe machine which i think promise to be the best for we purpose of all that have be invent as to it can be apply ' _ a mode of fill lead-pipe with wire _ ' for which professor fisher and myself have enter a caveat at the patent office vail gladly agree to serve as assistant in the construction of the line and on march 21 sign the follow agreement : -- professor morse -- as a assistant in the telegraphic experiment contemplate by the act of congress lately pass i can superintend and procure the making of the _ instrument complete _ accord to you direction namely : the register the correspondent with they magnet the battery the reel and the paper and will attend to the procuring of the acid the ink and the preparation of the various station i will assist in fill the tube with wire and the resinous coating and i will devote my whole time and attention to the business so as to secure a favorable result and should you wish to devolve upon I any other business connect with the telegraph i will cheerfully undertake it three dollar per diem with travel expense i shall deem a satisfactory salary very respectfully you ob ' t ser ' t alfr vail professor fisher be detail to superintend the manufacture of the wire its insulation and its insertion in the lead tube and professor gale 's scientific knowledge be to be place at the disposal of the patentee wherever and whenever it should be necessary foj smith undertake to secure a favorable contract for the trenching which be necessary to carry out the first idea of place the wire underground and morse himself be of course to be general superintendent of the whole enterprise in advertising for lead pipe the follow quaint answer be receive from morris tasker & morris of philadelphium : -- thy advertisement for about one hundred and twenty mile of 1\/2 in lead tube for electro magnetic telegraphic purpose have induce we to forward thee some sample of iron tube for thy inspection the quantity require and the term of payment be the inducement to offer it to thee at the exceed low price here state which thou wilt please keep _ to thyself undivulged to other person _ etc etc as iron tubing would not have answer morse 's purpose this decorous solicitation be decline with thanks during the first few month everything work smoothly and the prospect of a early completion of the line be bright morse keep all he account in the most businesslike manner and he monthly account to the secretary of the treasury be model of accuracy and a conscientious regard for the public interest one small cloud appear above the horizon so small that the unsuspecting inventor hardly notice it and yet it be destine to develop into a storm of portentous dimension on may 17 he write to foj smith from new york : -- yours of the 27th April i have this morning receive enclose the contract for trenching i have examine the contract and i must say i be not exactly please with the term if i understand you right before you leave for boston you be confident a contract could be make far within the estimate give in to the government and i have hope that something could be save from that estimate as from the other so as to present the experiment before the country in as cheap a form as possible i have take a pride in show to government how cheaply the telegraph could be lay since the main objection and the one most likely to defeat we ulterior plan be its great expense i have in my other contract be able to be far within my estimate to government and i have hope to be able to present to the secretary the contract for trench likewise reduce there be plenty of applicant here who will do it for much less and one even say he think for one half i shall do nothing in regard to the matter until i see you a great personal sorrow come to he also a short time after this to dim the brilliance of success on July 9 1843 he dearly love friend and master washington allston die in boston after month of suffer morse immediately drop everything and hasten to boston to pay the last tribute of respect to he whom he regard as he best friend he obtain as a memento one of the brush still wet with paint which allston be use on he last unfinished work the feast of belshazzar when he be suddenly stricken this brush he afterwards present to the national academy of design where it be i believe still preserved sorrowfully he return to he work in washington but with the comforting thought that he friend have live to see he triumph the justification for he desert that art which have be the bond to first bring they together on July 24 in he report to the secretary of the treasury he say : -- i have also the gratification to report that the contract for the wire have be faithfully fulfil on the part of aaron benedict the contractor that the first cover with cotton and two varnishing of the whole one hundred and sixty mile be also complete that experiment make upon forty-three mile have result in the most satisfactory manner and that the whole work be proceed with every prospect of a successful issue it be at first thought necessary to insulate the whole length of the wire and it be not until some time afterwards that it be discover that naked wire could be successfully employ on August 10 in he report to the secretary he indulge in a prophecy which must have seem in the highest degree visionary in those early day : -- some careful experiment on the decomposing power at various distance be make from which the law of propulsion have be deduce verify the result of ohm and those which i make in the summer of 1842 and allude to in my letter to the honorable cg ferris publish in the house report no 17 of the last congress the practical inference from this law be that a telegraphic communication on my plan may with certainty be establish across the atlantic startling as this may seem now the time will come when this project will be realize on September 11 he report a item of save to the government which illustrate he characteristic honesty in all business dealings : -- i would also direct the attention of the honorable secretary to the payment in full of mr chase -lrb- voucher 215 -rrb- for cover the wire accord to the contract with he the sum of $ 1010 be to be pay he in the course of the preparation of the wire several improvement occur to I of a economical character in which mr chase cheerfully concur although at a considerable loss to he of labor contract for so that my wire have be prepare at a cost of $ 55125 which be receipt in full instead of $ 1010 produce a economy of $ 45875 the work of trenching be commence on Saturday October 21 at 8 be and then he trouble begin describe they at a later date he say : -- much time and expense be lose in consequence of my follow the plan adopt in england of lay the conductor beneath the ground at the time the telegraph bill be pass there have be about thirteen mile of telegraph conductor for professor wheatstone 's telegraph system in england put into tube and inter in the earth and there be no hint publicly give that that mode be not perfectly successful i do not feel therefore at liberty to expend the public money in useless experiment on a plan which seem to be already settle as effective in england hence i fix upon this mode as one suppose to be the best it prosecute till the winter of 1843-44 it be abandon among other reason in consequence of ascertain that in the process of insert the wire into the leaden tube -lrb- which be at the moment of form the tube from the lead at melting heat -rrb- the insulate covering of the wire have become char at various and numerous point of the line to such a extent that greater delay and expense would be necessary to repair the damage than to put the wire on post in my letter to the secretary of the treasury of September 27 1837 one of the mode of lay the conductor for the telegraph be the present almost universal one of extend they on post set about two hundred foot apart this mode be adopt with success the sentence in the letter of September 27 1837 just refer to read as follow : if the circuit be lay through the air the first cost would doubtless be much lessen stout spar of some thirty foot in height well plant in the ground and place about three hundred and fifty foot apart would in this case be require along the top of which the circuit might be stretch a rough drawing of this plan also appear in the 1832 sketch-book it would seem from a voluminous correspondence that professor fisher be responsible for the failure of the underground system inasmuch as he do not properly test the wire after they have be insert in the lead pipe carelessness of this sort morse could never brook and he be reluctantly compel to dispense with the service of one who have be of great use to he previously he refer to this in a letter to he brother sidney of December 16 1843 : -- the season be against all my operation and i expect to resume in the spring i have difficulty and trouble in my work but none of a nature as yet to discourage they arise from neglect and unfaithfulness -lrb- _ inter no _ -rrb- on the part of fisher whom i shall probably dismiss although on many account i shall do it reluctantly i shall give he a opportunity to excuse himself if he ever get here i have be expect both he and gale for three week and write but without bring either of they they may have a good excuse we shall see the few month of sunshine be now past and the cloud begin again to gather : -- December 18 1843 dear sidney -- i have make every effort to try and visit new york twice i have be ready with my baggage in hand but be prevent by a pressure of difficulty which you can not conceive i be never so tried and never need more you prayer and those of christian for I trouble cluster in such various shape that i be almost overwhelmed and then the storm of which the little cloud be the forerunner burst in fury : -- December 30 1843 dear sidney -- i have no heart to give you the detail of the trouble which almost crush I and which have unexpectedly arise to throw a cloud over all my prospects it must suffice at present to say that the unfaithfulness of dr fisher in he inspection of the wire and connect with serrell 's bad pipe be the main origin of my difficulty the trenching be stop in consequence of this among other reason and have bring the contractor upon I for damages -lrb- that be upon the government -rrb- mr smith be the contractor and where i expect to find a _ friend _ i find a fiend the word be not too strong as i may one day show you i have be compel to dismiss fisher and have receive a very insolent letter from he in reply the lead-pipe contract will be litigate and smith have write a letter full of the bitterest malignity against I to the secretary of the treasury he seem perfectly reckless and act like a madman and all for what because the condition of my pipe and the imperfect insulation of my wire be such that it become necessary to stop trench on this account alone but take in connection with the advanced state of the season when it be impossible to carry on my operation out of door i be compel to stop any further trenching this cause he to lose he profit on the contract _ hinc illæ lachrymæ _ and because i refuse to accede to term which as a public officer i could not do without dishonor and violation of trust he pursue I thus malignantly bless be god i have escape snare set for I by this arch-fiend one of which a simple inquiry from you be the means of detect you remember i tell you that mr smith have make a advantageous contract with tatham & brother for pipe and have divide the profit with I by which i should gain five hundred dollar you ask if it be all right and if it should be make public it would be consider so i reply ` oh yes mr smith say it be all perfectly fair ' -lrb- for i have the utmost confidence in he fair dealing and uprightness -rrb- but you remark lead I to think of the matter and i determine at once that since there be a doubt i would not touch it for myself but credit it to the government and i accordingly credit it as so much save to the government from the contract and now will you believe it the man who would have persuade I that all be right in that matter turn upon I and accuse I to the secretary as deal in bad faith to the government cite this very transaction in proof but providentially my friend ellsworth and also a clerk in the treasury department be witness that that sum be credit to the government before any difficulty arise on the part of smith but i leave this unpleasant matter the enterprise yet look lowering but i know who can bring light out of darkness and in he i trust as a sure refuge till these calamity be overpast oh how these trouble drive all thought of child and brother and all relative out of my mind except in the wakeful hour of the night and then i think of you all with sadness that i can not add to you enjoyment but only to you anxiety love to all specially remember I in you prayer that i may have wisdom from above to act wisely and justly and calmly in this sore trial while thus some of those on whom he have rely fail he at a critical moment new helper be at hand to assist he in carry on the work on December 27 he write to the secretary of the treasury : i have the honor to report that i have dismiss professor jame c fisher one of my assistant whose salary be $ 1500 per annum my present labor require the service of a efficient mechanical assistant whom i believe i have find in mr ezra cornell and whom i present for the approval of the honorable secretary with a compensation at the rate of $ 1000 per annum from December 27 1843 cornell prove himself indeed a efficient assistant and much of the success of the enterprise from that time forward be due to he energy quick-wittedness and faithfulness mr prime in he biography of morse thus describe a dramatic episode of those try day : -- when the pipe have be lay as far as the relay house professor morse come to mr cornell and express a desire to have the work arrest until he could try further experiment but he be very anxious that nothing should be say or do to give to the public the impression that the enterprise have fail mr cornell say he could easily manage it and step up to the machine which be draw by a team of eight mule he cry out : ` hurrah boy we must lay another length of pipe before we quit ' the teamster crack they whip over the mule and they start on a lively pace mr cornell grasp the handle of the plough and watch a opportunity cant it so as to catch the point of a rock and break it to piece while professor morse stand look on consultation long and painful follow the anxiety of professor morse at this period be greater than at any previous hour know in the history of the invention some that be around he have serious apprehension that he would not stand up under the pressure cornell have thus cleverly cut the gordian knot it be decide to string wire on pole and cornell himself thus describe the solution of the insulation problem : -- in the latter part of march professor morse give I the order to put the wire on pole and the question at once arise as to the mode of _ fasten the wire to the pole _ and the insulation of they at the point of fastening i submit a plan to the professor which i be confident would be successful as a insulate medium and which be easily available then and inexpensive mr vail also submit a plan for the same purpose which involve the necessity of go to new york or new jersey to get it execute professor morse give preference to mr vail 's plan and start for new york to get the fixture direct I to get the wire ready for use and arrange for set the pole at the end of a week professor morse return from new york and come to the shop where i be at work and say he want to provide the insulator for put the wire on the pole upon the plan i have suggest to which i respond : ` how be that professor i think you have decide to use mr vail 's plan ' professor morse reply : ` yes i do so decide and on my way to new york where i go to order the fixture i stop at princeton and call on my old friend professor henry who inquire how i be get along with my telegraph ' i explain to he the failure of the insulation in the pipe and state that i have decide to place the wire on pole in the air he then inquire how i propose to insulate the wire when they be attach to the pole i show he the model i have of mr vail 's plan and he say it will not do you will meet the same difficulty you have in the pipe i then explain to he you plan which he say would answer ' however before the enterprise have reach this point in march 1844 many dark and discouraging day and week have to be pass which we can partially follow by the following extract from letter to he brother sidney and other to he brother he write on January 9 1844 : -- i thank you for you kind and sympathize letter which i assure you help to mitigate the acuteness of my mental suffering from the then disastrous aspect of my whole enterprise god work by instrumentality and he have wonderfully thus far interpose in keep evil that i fear in abeyance all i trust will yet be well but i have great difficulty to encounter and overcome with the detail of which i need not now trouble you i think i see light ahead and the great result of these difficulty i be persuade will be a great economy in lay the telegraphic conductor i be well in health but have sleepless night from the great anxiety and care which weigh I down _ January 13 _ i be work to retrieve myself under every disadvantage and amidst accumulate and most diversified trial but i have strength from the source of strength and courage to go forward fisher i have dismiss for unfaithfulness dr gale have resign from ill-health smith have become a malignant enemy and vail only remain true at he post all my pipe be useless as the wire be all injure by the _ hot process _ of manufacture i be prepare -lrb- as i say before under every disadvantage -rrb- a short distance between the patent office and capitol which i be desirous of have complete as soon as possible and by means of it relieve the enterprise from the heavy weight which now threaten it to he good friend commissioner ellsworth he write from baltimore on February 7 : -- in comply with you kind request that i would write you i can not refrain from express my warm thanks for the word of sympathy and the promise of a welcome on my return which you give I as i be leave the door i find that brace myself as i will against trouble the spirit so sympathise with the body that its mood be in sad bondage to the physical health the latter vanquish the former for the spirit be often willing and submit while the flesh be weak and rebel i be fully aware that of late i have evince a unusual sensitiveness and expose myself to the charge of great weakness which would give I the more distress be i not persuade that i have be among real friend who will make every allowance my temperament naturally sensitive have lately be make more so by the combination of attack from deceitful associate without and bodily illness within so that even the kind attention of the dear friend at you house and who have so warmly rally around I have scarcely be able to restore I to my usual buoyancy of spirit and i feel amidst other oppressive thought that i have not be grateful enough for you friendship but i hope yet to make amends for the past i have no time to add more than that i desire sincere love to dear annie to whom please present for I the accompany piece from my favorite bellinus and the book on etiquette after it shall have pass the ordeal of a mother 's examination as i have not have time to read it myself on march 4 he write to he brother : -- i have nothing new smith continue to annoy I but i think i have get he in check by a demand for compensation for my service for seven month for do that for he in pari which he be bind to do the agreement stipulate that i give my service for ' _ three month and no longer _ ' but at he earnest solicitation i remain seven month longer and be he agent in ` negotiate the sale of rights ' which by the article he be oblige to do consequently i have a right to compensation and mr e and other think my claim a valid one if it be sustain the table be completely turn on he and he be debtor to I to the amount of six or seven hundred dollar i have commence my operation with post which promise well at present _ march 23 _ my telegraph labor go on well at present the whole matter be now critical or as we good father use to say ' a crisis be at hand ' i hope for the best while i endeavor to prepare my mind for the worst smith if he go forward with he claim be a ruin man in reputation but he may sink the telegraph also in he passion but when he return from the east where he fortunately be now we hope through he friend to persuade he to withdraw it which he may do from fear of the consequence as to he claim privately on I i think i have he in check but he be a man of consummate art and unprincipled he will therefore doubtless give I trouble _ April 10 _ a brighter day be dawn upon I i send you the intelligencer of to-day in which you will see that the telegraph be successfully under way through six mile the experiment have be most gratifying in a few day i hope to advise you of more respect it i have prefer reserve until i could state something positive i have my post set to beltsville twelve mile and you will see by the intelligencer that i be prepare to go directly on to baltimore and hope to reach there by the middle of may _ may 7 _ let I know when susan and the two charle arrive -lrb- he son and he grandson -rrb- for if they come within the next fortnight i think i can contrive to run on and pay a visit of two or three day unless my marplot smith should prevent again as he be likely to do if he come on here as yet there be no settlement of that matter and he seem determine -lrb- _ inter no _ -rrb- to be as ugly as he can and defeat all application for a appropriation if i be to have the management of it he chafe like a wild boar but when he find that he can effect nothing by such a temper self-interest may soften he into term you will see by the papers that the telegraph be in successful operation for twenty-two mile to the junction of the annapoli road with the baltimore and washington road the nomination of mr frelinghuysen as vice-president be write send on and the receipt acknowledge back in two minute and one second a distance of forty-four mile the news be spread all over washington one hour and four minute before the car contain the news by express arrive in about a fortnight i hope to be in baltimore and a communication will be establish between the two city good-bye i be almost asleep from exhaustion so excuse abrupt closing this be the first great triumph of the telegraph morse and vail and cornell have work day and night to get the line in readiness as far as the junction so that the proceedings of the whig convention could be report from that point many difficulty be encounter -- cross of wire break injury from thunder storm and the natural error incidental to write and read what be virtually a new language but all obstacle be overcome in time and the day before the convention meet morse write to vail : -- get everything ready in the morning for the day and do not be out of hearing of you bell when you learn the name of the candidate nominate see if you can not give it to I and receive a acknowledgment of its receipt before the car leave you if you can it will do more to excite the wonder of those in the car than the mere announcement that the news be go to washington the next day 's report be most encouraging : -- thing go well to-day you last writing be good you do not correct you error of run you letter together until some time better be deliberate we have time to spare since we do not spend upon we stock get ready to-morrow -lrb- Thursday -rrb- as to-day there be great excitement about the telegraph and my room be throng therefore it be important to have it in action during the hour name i may have some of the cabinet to-morrow get from the passenger in the car from baltimore or elsewhere all the news you can and transmit a good way of exciting wonder will be to tell the passenger to give you some short sentence to send I let they note time and call at the capitol to verify the time i receive it before transmit notify I with -lrb- 48 -rrb- you message to-day that ` the passenger in the car give three cheer for henry clay ' excite the highest wonder in the passenger who give it to you to send when he find it verify at the capitol in a letter to he friend dr aycrigg of new jersey write on may 8 and tell of these successful demonstration this interesting sentence occur : i find that the ground in conformity with the result of experiment of dr franklin can be make a part of the circuit and i have use one wire and the ground with better effect for one circuit than two wire on the 11th of may he again caution vail about he writing : everything work well yesterday but there be one defect in you write make a _ longer _ space between each letter and a still longer space between each word i shall have a great crowd to-day and wish all thing to go off well many mc will be present perhaps mr clay give I news by the car when the car come along try and get a newspaper from philadelphium or new york and give item of intelligence the arrival of the car at the junction begin to excite here the greatest interest and both morning and evening i have have my room throng and now at last the supreme moment have arrive the line from washington to baltimore be complete and on the 24th day of may 1844 the company invite by the inventor assemble in the chamber of the united state supreme court to witness he triumph true to he promise to miss annie ellsworth he have ask she to indite the first public message which should be flash over the complete line and she in consultation with she good mother choose the now historic word from the 23d verse of the 23d chapter of number -- what have god work the whole verse read : surely there be no enchantment against jacob neither be there any divination against israel : accord to this time it shall be say of jacob and of israel what have god work to morse with he strong religious bent and he belief that he be but a choose vessel every word in this verse seem singularly appropriate calmly he seat himself at the instrument and tick off the inspired word in the dot and dash of the morse alphabet alfr vail at the other end of the line in baltimore receive the message without a error and immediately flash it back again and the electro-magnetic telegraph be no longer the wild dream of a visionary but a accomplished fact mr prime 's comment after describe this historic occasion be so excellent that i shall give they in full : -- again the triumph of the inventor be sublime he confidence have be so unshaken that the surprise of he friend in the result be not share by he he know what the instrument would do and the fact accomplish be but the confirmation to other of what to he be a certainty on the packet-ship sully in 1832 but the result be not the less gratifying and sufficient have he labor cease at that moment he would have cheerfully exclaim in the word of simeon : ` lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eye have see thy salvation ' -lrb- illustration : first form of key -rrb- -lrb- illustration : improved form of key -rrb- -lrb- illustration : early relay the two key and the relay be in the national museum washington -rrb- -lrb- illustration : first washington-baltimore instrument the washington-baltimore instrument be own by cornell university -rrb- the congratulation of he friend follow he receive they with modesty in perfect harmony with the simplicity of he character neither then nor at any subsequent period of he life do he language or manner indicate exultation he believe himself a instrument employ by heaven to achieve a great result and have accomplish it he claim simply to be the original and only instrument by which that result have be reach with the same steadiness of purpose tenacity and perseverance with which he have pursue the idea by which he be inspire in 1832 he adhere to he claim to the paternity of that idea and to the merit of bring it to a successful issue deny he assert it assail he defend it through long year of controversy discussion and litigation he maintain he right equable alike in success and discouragement calm in the midst of victory and undismayed by the number the violence and the power of those who seek to deprive he of the honor and the reward of he work he manfully maintain he ground until by the verdict of the highest court of he country and of academy of science and the practical adoption and indorsement of he system by he own and foreign nation those wire which be now speak only forty mile from washington to baltimore be stretch over continent and under ocean make a network to encompass and unite in instantaneous intercourse for business and enjoyment all part of the civilized world it be with well-earned but modest satisfaction that he write to he brother sidney on may 31 : -- you will see by the papers how great success have attend the first effort of the telegraph that sentence of annie ellsworth 's be divinely indite for it be in my thought day and night ` what have god work ' it be he work and he alone could have carry I thus far through all my trial and enable I to triumph over the obstacle physical and moral which oppose I ` not unto we not unto we but to thy name o lord be all the praise ' i begin to fear now the effect of public favor lest it should kindle that pride of heart and self-sufficiency which dwell in my own as well as in other ' breast and which alas be so ready to be inflamed by the slightest spark of praise i do indeed feel gratified and it be right i should rejoice but i rejoice with fear and i desire that a sense of dependence upon and increase obligation to the giver of every good and perfect gift may keep I humble and circumspect the convention at baltimore happen most opportunely for the display of the power of the telegraph especially as it be the means of correspondence in one instance between the democratic convention and the first candidate elect for the vice-presidency the enthusiasm of the crowd before the window of the telegraph room in the capitol be excite to the highest pitch at the announcement of the nomination of the presidential candidate and the whole of it afterwards seem turn upon the telegraph they give the telegraph three cheer and i be call to make my appearance at the window when three cheer be give to I by some hundred present compose mainly of member of congress such be the feeling in congress that many tell I they be ready to grant anything even the most inveterate opposer have change to admirer and one of they hon cave johnson who ridicule my system last session by associate it with the trick of animal magnetism come to I and say : ` sir i give in it be a astonishing invention ' when i see all this and such enthusiasm everywhere manifest and contrast the present with the past season of darkness and almost despair have i not occasion to exclaim ` what have god work ' surely none but he who have all heart in he hand and turn they as the river of water be turn could so have bring light out of darkness ` sorrow may continue for a night but joy cometh in the morning ' pray for I then my dear brother that i may have a heart to praise the great deliverer and in future when discourage or despairing be enable to remember he past mercy and in full faith rest all my care on he who careth for we mr s still embarrass the progress of the invention by he stubbornness but there be indication of give way mainly i fear because he see he pecuniary interest in do so and not from any sense of the gross injury he have do I i pray god for a right spirit in deal with he the incident refer to in this letter with regard to the nomination for the vice-presidency by the democratic convention be worthy of more extended notice the convention meet in baltimore on the 26th of may and it be then that the two-third rule be first adopt van buren have a majority of the vote but could not secure the necessary two third and finally jame k polk be unanimously nominate this news be instantly flash to washington by the telegraph and be receive with mingled feeling of enthusiasm disappointment and wonder and not believe by many until confirm by the arrival of the mail the convention then nominate van buren 's friend senator sila wright of new york for the vice-presidency this news too be immediately send by wire to washington morse at once inform mr wright who be in the capitol at the time of he nomination but he refuse to accept it and morse wire he refusal to vail in baltimore and it be read to the convention only a few moment after the nomination have be make this be too much for the credulity of the assembly and they adjourn till the follow day and send a committee to washington to verify the dispatch upon the return of the committee with the report that the telegraph have indeed perform this wonder this new instrumentality receive such a advertisement as could not fail to please the most exacting then a scene be enact new in the annals of civilization in baltimore the committee of conference surround vail at he instrument and in washington senator wright sit beside morse all other be exclude the committee urge wright to accept the nomination give he good reason for do so he reply give as good reason for refuse this first long-distance conversation be carry on until the committee be finally convince that wright be determine to refuse and they so report to the convention mr dalla be then nominate and in November of that year polk and dalla be elect on June 3 morse make he report to the honorable mcclintock young who be then secretary of the treasury _ ad interim _ it be with great satisfaction that he be able to say : of the appropriation make there will remain in the treasury after the settlement of outstanding account about $ 3500 which may be need for contingent liability and for sustain the line already construct until provision by law shall be make for such a organization of a telegraphic department or bureau as shall enable the telegraph at least to support itself if not to become a profitable source of revenue to the government in the course of this report mention be also make of the follow interesting incident : -- in regard to the _ utility _ of the telegraph time alone can determine and develop the whole capacity for good of so perfect a system in the few day of its infancy it have already casually show its usefulness in the relief in various way of the anxiety of thousand and when such a sure means of relief be available to the public at large the amount of its usefulness become incalculable a instance or two will best illustrate this quality of the telegraph a family in washington be throw into great distress by a rumor that one of its member have meet with a violent death in baltimore the evening before several hour must have elapse ere they state of suspense could be relieve by the ordinary means of conveyance a note be dispatch to the telegraph room at the capitol request to have inquiry make at baltimore the messenger have occasion to wait but _ ten minute _ when the proper inquiry be make at baltimore and the answer return that the rumor be without foundation thus be a worthy family relieved immediately from a state of distressing suspense a inquiry from a person in baltimore hold the check of a gentleman in washington upon the bank of washington be send by telegraph to ascertain if the gentleman in question have fund in that bank a messenger be instantly dispatch from the capitol who return in a few minute with a affirmative answer which be return to baltimore instantly thus establish a confidence in a money arrangement which might have affect unfavorably -lrb- for many hour at least -rrb- the business transaction of a man of good credit other case might be give but these be deem sufficient to illustrate the point of utility and to suggest to those who will reflect upon they thousand of case in the public business in commercial operation and in private and social transaction which establish beyond a doubt the immense advantage of such a speedy mode of convey intelligence while such instance of the use of the telegraph be but the commonplace of to-day we can imagine with what wonder they be regard in 1844 morse then address a memorial to congress on the same day refer to the report just quote from and then say : -- the proprietor respectfully suggest that it be a engine of power for good or for evil which all opinion seem to concur in desire to have subject to the control of the government rather than have it in the hand of private individual and association and to this end the proprietor respectfully submit they willingness to transfer the exclusive use and control of it from washington city to the city of new york to the united state together with such improvement as shall be make by the proprietor or either of they if congress shall proceed to cause its construction and upon either of the follow term here follow the detail of the two plan : either outright purchase by the government of the exist line and construction by the government of the line from baltimore to new york or construction of the latter by the proprietor under contract to the government but no specific sum be mention in either case this offer be not accept as will appear further on but $ 8000 be appropriate for the support of the line already build and that be all that congress would do it be while this matter be pend that morse write to he brother sidney on June 13 : -- i be in the crisis of matter so far as this session of congress be concern in relation to the telegraph which absorb all my time perfect enthusiasm seem to pervade all class in regard to it but there be still the thorn in the flesh which be permit by a wise father to keep I humble doubtless may he strength be sufficient for I and i shall fear nothing and will bear it till he see fit to remove it pray for I as i do for you that if prosperity be allot to we we may have heart to use it to the glory of god chapter xxxi June 28 1844 -- October 9 1846 fame and fortune now assure -- government decline purchase of telegraph -- accident to leg give need rest -- reflection on way of providence -- consideration of financial proposition -- foj smith 's fulsome praise -- morse 's reply -- extension of telegraph proceeds slowly -- letter to russian minister -- letter to london mechanic ' magazine claim priority and first experiment in wireless telegraphy -- hope that government may yet purchase -- longing for a home -- dinner at russian minister 's -- congress again fail he -- amo kendall choose as business agent -- first telegraph company -- fourth voyage to europe -- london broek hamburg -- letter of charle t fleischmann -- pari -- nothing definite accomplished morse 's fame be now secure and fortune be soon to follow try as he have be in the school of adversity he be now destine to undergo new trial trial incident to success to prosperity and to world-wide eminence that he foresee the new danger which would beset he on every hand be clearly evidence in the letter to he brother but hearten by the success which have at last crown he effort he buckle on he armor ready to do battle to such foe both within and without as should in the future assail he fatalist as we must regard he he believe in he star or rather he go forward with sublime faith in that god who have thus far guard he from evil and in he own good time have give he the victory and such a victory for twelve year he have fight on through trial and privation hamper by bodily ailment and the deep discouragement of those who should have aid he pit against the trained mind and the wealth of other nation he have go forth a very david to battle and like david the simplicity of he missile have give he the victory other telegraph have be devise by other man some have actually be put into operation but it would seem as if all the nation have hold they breath until he appear and sweep all the other from the field demonstrate and maintain its supremacy from this time forward he life become more complex honor be shower upon he fame carry he name to the uttermost part of the earth he counsel be seek by eminent scientist and by other inventor both practical and visionary on the other hand detractor innumerable arise he rights to the invention be challenge in all sincerity and in insincerity infringement of he patent rights necessitate long and acrimonious lawsuit and like other man of mark he be traduce and vilify in addition to all this he take a active interest in the seething politics of the day and in religious question which to he mind and that of many other affect the very foundation of the nation to follow he through all these labyrinthine way would require volume and i shall content myself with select only such letter as may give a fair idea of how he bear himself in the face of these new and manifold trial of how he sometimes err in judgment and in action but how through all he be sincere and firm in he faith and how at last he be to find that home and that domestic bliss which he have all he life so earnestly desire but which have until the evening of he day be deny to he have win he great victory retirement from the field of battle would have best suit he he be now fifty-three year of age and he feel that he have earn repose to this end he seek to carry out he long-cherished idea that the telegraph should become the property of the government and he be willing to accept a very modest remuneration as i have say before he and the other proprietor join in offer the telegraph to the government for the paltry sum of $ 100000 but the administration of that day seem to have be stricken with unaccountable blindness for the postmaster-general that same wise and sapient cave johnson who have seek to kill the telegraph bill by ridicule in the house and in despite of he acknowledgment to morse report : that the operation of the telegraph between washington and baltimore have not satisfied he that under any rate of postage that could be adopt its revenue could be make equal to its expenditure congress be equally lax and so the government lose its great opportunity for when in after year the question of government ownership again come up it be find that either to purchase outright or to parallel exist line would cost many more million than it would have take thousand in 1844 the failure of the government to appreciate the value of what be offer to they be always a source of deep regret to morse for while he himself gain much more by the operation of private company the evil which he have foretell be more than realize but to return to the day of '44 it would seem that in the spring of that year he meet with a painful accident its exact nature be not specify but it must have be severe and yet we learn from the follow letter to he brother sidney date June 23 that he see in it only another blessing : -- i be still in bed and from appearance i be likely to be hold here for many day perhaps week the wound on the leg be worse than i at first suppose it seem slow in healing and have be much inflamed although now yield to remedy my hope be to have spend some week in new york but it will now depend on the time of the healing of my leg the way of god be mysterious and i find prayer answer in a way not at all anticipate this accident as we be apt to call it i can plainly see be calculate to effect many salutary object i need rest of body and mind after my intense anxiety and exertion and i might have neglect it and so perhaps bring on premature disease of both but i be involuntarily lay up so that i must keep quiet and although the fall that cause my wound be painful at first yet i have no severe pain with it now but the principal effect be doubtless intend to be of a spiritual character and i be afford a opportunity of quiet reflection on the wonderful dealings of god with I i can not but constantly exclaim ` what have god work ' when i look back upon the darkness of last winter and reflect how at one time everything seem hopeless when i remember that all my associate in the enterprise of the telegraph have either desert I or be discourage and one have even turn my enemy reviler and accuser -lrb- and even mr vail who have hold fast to I from the beginning feel like give up just in the deepest darkness of all -rrb- when i remember that give up all hope myself from any other source than he right arm which bring salvation he salvation do come in answer to prayer faith be strengthen and do i not know by too sad experience the deceitfulness of the heart i should say that it be impossible for I again to distrust or feel anxiety undue anxiety for the future but he who know the heart know its disease and as the good physician if we give ourselves unreservedly into he hand to be cure he will give that medicine which he perfect knowledge of we case prescribe i be well aware that just now my praise ring from one end of the country to the other i can not take up a paper in which i do not find something to flatter the natural pride of the heart i have pray indeed against it i have ask for a right spirit under a trial of a new character for prosperity be a trial and we savior have denounce a woe on we ` when all man speak well of we ' may it not then be in answer to this prayer that he shut I up to strengthen I against the temptation which the praise of the world present and so by meditation on he dealings with I and review the way in which he have lead I show I my perfect helplessness without he he be prepare to bless I with stronger faith and more unreserved faith in he to he indeed belong all the glory i have have evidence enough that without christ i could do nothing all my strength be there and i fervently desire to ascribe to he all the praise if i be to have influence increase influence i desire to have it for christ to use it for he cause if wealth for christ if more knowledge for christ i speak sincerely when i say i fear prosperity lest i should be proud and forget whence it come have at length recover from the accident which have give he in spite of himself the rest which he so much need morse again devoted himself to he affair with he accustomed vigor the government still delay to take action he be compel much to he regret to consider the offer of private party to extend the line of the telegraph to important point in the union he have receive proposition from various person who be eager to push the enterprise but in all negotiation he be hamper by the dilatoriness of smith who seem bent on put as many obstacle in the way of a amicable settlement as possible and some of whose proposition have to be reject for obvious reason before congress have finally put the quietus on he hope in that direction he consider the advisability of parting with he interest to some individual and on July 1 1844 he write to mr david burbank from baltimore : -- in reply to you query for what sum i would sell my share of the patent right in the telegraph which amount to one half i frankly say that if _ one hundred and ten thousand dollar _ shall be secure to I in cash current fund in the united state or stock at cash value such as i may be dispose to accept if present so that in six month from this date i shall realize that sum i will assign over all my rights and privilege in the telegraph in the united state i offer it at this price not that i estimate the value of the invention so low for it be perfectly demonstrable that the sum above mention be not half its value but that i may have my own mind free to be occupy in perfect the system and in a general superintendence of it unembarrassed by the business arrangement necessary to secure its utmost usefulness and value a mr fry of philadelphium have also make a offer and refer to this he write to smith from new york on July 17 : a letter from mr fry of philadelphium in answer to the proposal which you send i have just receive i wish much to see you as i can not move in this matter until i know you view i be here for about a fortnight and wish some arrangement make by which we business can be transact without the necessity of so much wait and so much write all these negotiation seem to have come to nothing and i have only mention they as show morse 's willingness to part with he interest for much less than he know it be worth in order that he might not prove a obstacle in the expansion of the system by be too mercenary and so that he might obtain some measure of freedom from care mr foj smith while still prove himself a thorn in the flesh to morse in many way have compile a telegraph dictionary which he call : the secret corresponding vocabulary adapt for use to morse 's electro-magnetic telegraph and also in conduct write correspondence transmit by the mail or otherwise the dedication read as follow : _ to professor samuel fb morse inventor of the electro-magnetic telegraph _ sir -- the homage of the world during the last half-century have be and will ever continue to be accord to the name and genius of the illustrious american philosopher benjamin franklin for have first teach mankind that the wild and terrific way and force of the electric fluid as it fly and flash through the rent atmosphere or descend to the surface of the earth be guide by positive and fixed law as much as the movement of more sluggish matter in the physical creation and that its terrible death-stroke may be render harmless by proper scientific precaution to another name of another generation yet of the same proud national nativity the glory have be reserve of have first teach mankind to reach even beyond the result of franklin and to subdue in a modify state into the familiar and practical use of a household servant who run at he master 's bidding this same once frightful and tremendous element indeed the great work of science which franklin commence for the protection of man you have most triumphantly subdue to he convenience and it need not the gift of prophecy to foresee nor the spirit of personal flattery to declare that the name of franklin and morse be destine to glide down the declivity of time together the equal in the renown of inventive achievement until the hand of history shall become palsied and whatever pertain to humanity shall be lose in the general dissolution of matter of one thus rich in the present applause of he countryman and in the prospect of they future gratitude it afford the author of the follow compilation which be design to contribute in a degree to the practical usefulness of you invention a high gratification to speak in the presence of a enlighten public feeling that you may live to witness the full consummation of the vast revolution in the social and business relation of you countryman which you genius have prove to be feasible under the liberal encouragement of we national council and that you may with this great gratification also realize from it the substantial reward which inventive merit too seldom acquire in the shape of pecuniary independence be the sincere wish of you most respectful and obedient servant the author this florid and fulsome eulogy be write by that singular be who could thus flatter and almost apotheosize the inventor in public while in secret he be do everything to thwart he and who never as long as he live cease to antagonize he and later accuse he of have claim the credit of a invention all the essential of which be invent by other no wonder that morse be embarrassed and at a loss how to reply to the letter of smith 's enclose this eulogy and at the same time bring up one of the subject in dispute : -- new york November 13 1844 dear sir -- i have receive yours of the 4th and 5th inst and reply in relation to the several subject you mention in they order i like very well the suggestion in regard to the presentation of a set of the telegraph dictionary you be publish to each member of congress and when i return to washington will see the secretary of the treasury and see if he will assent to it as to the dedication to I since you have ask my opinion i must say i should prefer to have it much curtail and less laudatory i must refer it entirely to you however as it be not for I to say what other should write and think of I in regard to the bartlett claim against the government and you plan for settle it i can not admit that as proprietor of the telegraph we have anything to do with it i regret that there have be any mention of it and i have hope that you yourself have come to the determination to leave the matter altogether or at least until the telegraph bill have be definitely settle in congress however much i may deprecate agitation of the subject in the senate to mar and probably to defeat all we prospects it be a matter over which i have no control in the aspect that have be give to it and therefore -- the suppression of detail which have better not be push to a decision -- do not rest with I in regard however to such a division of the property of the telegraph as shall enable each of we to labor for the general benefit without embarrassment from each other i think it worthy of consideration and the principle on which such a division be propose to be make might be extend to embrace the entire property the subject however require mature deliberation and i be not now prepare to present the plan but will think it over and consult with vail and gale and arrange it perhaps definitely when i see you again in washington i have letter from vail at washington and roger at baltimore state the fact that complete success have attend all the transmission of result by telegraph there not have be a failure in a single instance and to the entire satisfaction of both political party in the perfect impartiality of the director of the telegraph while the success of the telegraph have now be fully demonstrate and while congratulation and honor be shower on the inventor from all quarter negotiation for its extension proceed but slowly morse still keep hope that the government would eventually purchase all the rights and it be not until well into 1845 that he be compel to abandon this dream in the mean time he be keep busy reply to enquiry from the representative of russium france and other european country and in repel attack which have already be launch against he in scientific circle as a example of the former i shall quote from a letter to he excellency alexander de bodisco the russian minister write in December 1844 : -- in comply with you request to write you respect my invention of the electro-magnetic telegraph i find there be but few point of interest not embrace in the print document already in you possession the principle on which my whole invention rest be the power of the electro-magnet command at pleasure at any distance the application of this power to the telegraph be original with I if the electro-magnet be now use in europe for telegraphic purpose it have be subsequently introduce all the system of electric telegraph in europe from 1820 to 1840 be base on the _ deflection of the magnetic needle _ while my system invent in 1832 be base as i have just observe on the electro-magnet should the emperor be desirous of the superintendence of a experienced person to put the telegraph in operation in russium i will either engage myself to visit russium for that purpose or if my own or another government shall previous to receive a answer from russium engage my personal attendance i will send a experienced person in my stead as a specimen of the vigorous style in which he repel attack on he merit as a inventor i shall give the following : -- messr editor -- the london mechanic ' magazine for October 1844 copy a article from the baltimore american in which my discovery in relation to cause electricity to cross river without wire be announce and then in a note to he reader the editor of the magazine make the follow assertion : the english reader need scarcely be inform that mr morse have in this as in other matter relate to magneto telegraph only _ re_discovered what be previously well know in this country more illiberality and deliberate injustice have be seldom condensed within so small a compass from the experience however that i in common with many american scientific gentleman have already have of the piratical conjoin with the abusive propensity of a certain class of english _ savan _ and writer i can scarcely expect either liberality or justice from the quarter whence this falsehood have issue but there be fortunately a appeal to my own countryman to the impartial and liberal-minded of continental europe and the truly noble of england herself i claim to be the original inventor of the electro-magnetic telegraph to be the first who plan and operate a really practicable electric telegraph this be the broad claim i make in behalf of my country and myself before the world if i can not substantiate this claim if any other to whatever country he belong can make out a previous or better claim i will cheerfully yield he the palm although i have plan and complete my telegraph unconscious until after my telegraph be in operation that even the word electric telegraph have ever be combine until i have combine they i have now make myself familiar with i believe all the plan abortive and otherwise which have be give to the world since the time of franklin who be the first to suggest the possibility of use electricity as a means of transmit intelligence with this knowledge both of the various plan devise and the time when they be severally devise i claim to be the first inventor of a really practicable telegraph on the electric principle when this shall be seriously call in question by any responsible name i have the proof in readiness as to english electric telegraph the telegraph of wheatstone and cooke call the magnetic needle telegraph inefficient as it be be invent five year after mine and the printing telegraph so-called -lrb- the title to the invention of which be litigate by wheatstone and bain -rrb- be invent seven year after mine so much for my _ re_discovering what be previously know in england as to the discovery that electricity may be make to cross the water without wire conductor above through or beneath the water the very reference by the editor to another number of the magazine and to the experiment of cooke or rather steinheil and of bain show that the editor be wholly ignorant of the nature of my experiment i have in detail the experiment of bain and wheatstone they be merely in effect repetition of the experiment of steinheil they object be to show that the earth or water can be make one half of the circuit in conduct electricity a fact prove by franklin with ordinary electricity in the last century and by professor steinheil of munich with magnetic electricity in 1837 mr bain and after he mr wheatstone in england repeat or -lrb- to use the english editor 's phrase -rrb- rediscover the same fact in 1841 but what have these experiment in which _ one wire _ be carry across the river to do with mine _ which dispense with wire altogether _ across the river i challenge the proof that such a experiment have ever be try in europe unless it be since the publication of my result the year 1844 be draw to a close and congress still be dilatory morse hate to abandon he cherish dream of government ownership and while carry on negotiation with private party in order to protect himself he still hope that congress would at last see the light he write to he brother from washington on December 30 : -- telegraph matter look exceedingly encourage not only for the united state but for europe i have just get a letter from a special agent of the french government send to boston by the minister of foreign affair in which he say that he have see mine and ` be convince of its superiority ' and wish all information concern it add : ' i consider it my duty to make a special report on you admirable invention ' and on January 18 1845 he write : -- i be well but anxiously wait the action of congress on the bill for extension of telegraph texa drive everything else into a corner i have not many fear if they will only get it up i have to-day the russian spanish and belgian minister to see the operation of the telegraph they be astonished and delighted the russian minister particularly take the deepest interest in it and will write to he government by next steamer the french minister also come day before yesterday and will write in its favor to he government senator woodbury give a discourse before the institute a few night ago in the hall of the house of representative in which he laud the telegraph in the highest term and think i have go a step beyond franklin the popularity of the telegraph increase rather than decline the mention of texa in this letter refer to the fact that polk be elect to the presidency on a platform which favor the annexation of that republic to the united state and this question be naturally paramount in the hall of congress texa be admit to the union in December 1845 write to he daughter mr lind in porto rico on February 8 he say : -- the telegraph operate to the perfect satisfaction of the public as you perhaps see by the laudatory notice of the papers in all part of the country i be now in a state of unpleasant suspense wait the passage of the bill for the extension of the telegraph to new york i be in hope they will take it up and pass it next week if they should not i shall at once enter into arrangement with private company to take it and extend it i do long for the time if it shall be permit to have you with you husband and little charle around I i feel my loneliness more and more keenly every day fame and money be in themselves a poor substitute for domestic happiness as means to that end i value they yesterday be the sad anniversary -lrb- the twentieth -rrb- of you dear mother 's death and i spend the most of it in thinking of she _ Thursday February 12 _ i dine at the russian ambassador 's Tuesday it be the most gorgeous dinner-party i ever attend in any country thirty-six sit down to table there be eleven senator nearly half the senate the table some twenty or twenty-five foot long be decorate with immense gilt vase of flower on a splendid plateau of richly chase gilt ornament and candelabrum with about a hundred and fifty light we be usher into the house through eight livery servant who afterward wait on we at table i go to-morrow evening to mr wickliffe 's postmaster general and probably on Wednesday evening next to the president 's the new president polk arrive this evening amid the roar of cannon he will be inaugurate on the 4th of march and i presume i shall be there i be most anxiously wait the action of congress on the telegraph it be exceedingly tantalizing to suffer so much loss of precious time that can not be recall this time there be no eleventh-hour passage of the bill for congress adjourn without reach it and while this in the light of future event be undoubtedly a tactical error on the part of the government it inure to the financial benefit of the inventor himself the question now arise of the best means of extend the business of the telegraph through private company and morse keenly feel the need of a better business head than he possess to guide the enterprise through the shoal and quicksand of commerce he be fortunate in choose as he business and legal adviser the honorable amo kendall mr jame d reid one of the early telegrapher and a staunch and faithful friend of morse 's thus speak of mr kendall in he valuable book the telegraph in america : -- mr kendall be too well know in american history to require description he be general jackson 's postmaster general incorruptible able a educate lawyer clear-headed methodical and ingenious but he be somewhat rigid in he manners and method and lack the dash and _ bonhomie _ which would have carry he successfully into the business centre of the seaboard city and bring capital largely and cheerfully to he foot of personal magnetism indeed except in private intercourse where he be eminently delightful he have at this period of he life none this make he work difficult especially with railroad man yet the telegraph could not have be entrust to more genuinely honest and able hand on the part of those he represent this confidence be so complete that they interest be commit to he without reserve professor gale and alfred vail join with morse in entrust they interest to mr kendall 's care but foj smith prefer to act for himself this cause much trouble in the future for it be a foregone conclusion that the honest upright kendall and the shifty smith be bind to come into conflict with each other the latter as one of the original patentee have to be consult in every sale of patent rights and kendall soon find it almost impossible to deal with he at first kendall have great difficulty in induce capitalist to subscribe to what be still look upon as a very risky venture mr corcoran of washington be the first man wise in he generation and other then follow he lead so that a cash capital of $ 15000 be raise mr reid say : it be provide in this original subscription that the payment of $ 50 should entitle the subscriber to two share of $ 50 each a payment of $ 15000 therefore require a issue of $ 30000 stock to the patentee be issue a additional $ 30000 stock or half of the capital as the consideration of the patent the capital be thus $ 60000 for the first link ww corcoran and bb french be make trustee to hold the patent rights and property until organization be effect meanwhile a act of incorporation be grant by the legislature of the state of maryland the first telegraphic charter issue in the united state the company be call the magnetic telegraph company and be the first telegraph company in the united state under the able if conservative management of mr kendall the business of the telegraph progress slowly but surely many difficulty be encounter many obstacle have to be overcome and the effort of unprincipled man to pirate the invention or to infringe on the patent be the cause of numerous lawsuit but it be not my purpose to write a history of the telegraph mr reid have accomplish this task much better than i possibly could and in follow the personal history of morse the now famous inventor i shall but touch incidentally on all these matter on the 18th of July 1845 the follow letter of introduction be send to morse from the department of state : -- to the respective diplomatic and consular agent of the united state in europe sir -- the bearer hereof professor samuel fb morse of new york superintendent of electro magnetic telegraph for the united state be about to visit europe for the purpose of exhibit to the various government he own system and its superiority over other now in use from a personal knowledge of professor morse i can speak confidently of he amiability of disposition and high respectability the merit of he discovery and invention in this particular branch of science be i believe universally concede in this country i take pleasure in introduce he to you acquaintance and in bespeak for he during he stay in you neighborhood such attention and good office in aid of he object as you may find it convenient to extend to he i be sir with great respect you obedient servant jame buchanan _ secretary of state _ -lrb- illustration : sfb morse from a portrait by daniel huntington -rrb- with the assurance that he have leave he business affair in capable hand morse sail from new york on August 6 1845 and arrive in liverpool on the 25th for the fourth time he be cross from america to europe but under what totally different circumstance on previous occasion practically unknown he have voyage forth to win he spur in the field of art or to achieve higher honor in this same field or as a humble petitioner at the court of europe force by circumstance to practice the most rigid economy he have yet look confidently to the future for he reward in material as well as spiritual gift now have abandon he art he have win such fame in a totally different realm that he name be become well-known in all the centre of civilization and he be assure of a respectful hearing wherever he might present himself free already from pecuniary embarrassment he need no longer take heed for the morrow but could with a light heart give himself up to the enjoyment of new scene and the business of prove to other nation the superiority of he system secure in the knowledge that whatever might betide he in europe he be assure of a competence at home he brother sidney with he family have precede he to europe and write to vail from london on September 1 morse say : -- i have just take lodgings with my brother and he family preparatory to look about for a week when i shall continue my journey to stockholm and st petersburg by the way of hamburg direct from london on my way from liverpool i see at rugby the telegraph wire of wheatstone which extend i understand as far as northampton i go into the office as the train stop a moment and have a glimpse of the instrument as we have see it in the ` illustrated time ' the place be the ticket-office and the man very uncommunicative but he tell I it be not in operation and that they do not use it much this be easily account for from the fact that the two terminus be inconsiderable place and wheatstone 's system clumsy and complicate the advantage of recording be incalculable and in this i have the undisputed superiority as soon as i can visit the telegraph-office here i will give you the result of my observation i shall probably do nothing until my return from the north nothing definite be accomplish during he short stay in london and on the 17th of September he leave for the continent with mr henry ellsworth and he wife mr ellsworth the son of he old friend have be appoint attaché to the american legation at stockholm morse 's letter to he daughter give a detailed account of he journey but i shall give only a few extract from they : -- _ hamburg September 27 1845 _ everything be ready on the morning of the 17th instant we leave brompton square in very rainy and stormy weather and drive down to the custom-house wharf and go on board we destine steamer the william joliffe a dirty black-looking tub-like thing about as large but not half so neat as a north river wood-sloop the wind be full from the southwest blow a gale with rain and i confess i do not much fancy leave land in so unpromise a craft and in such weather yet we vessel prove a excellent seaboat and although all be sick on board but mr ellsworth and myself we have a safe but rough passage across the boisterous north sea stop but a short time in rotterdam the party proceed through the hague and haarlem to amsterdam and from the latter place they visit the village of broek : -- the inn at broek be another example of the same neatness here we take a little refreshment before go into the village we walk of course for no carriage not even a wheelbarrow appear to be allow any more than in a gentleman 's parlor everything about the exterior of the house and garden be as carefully care for as the furniture and embellishment of the interior the street -lrb- or rather alley like those of a garden -rrb- be narrow and pave with small variously color brick form every variety of ornamental figure the house from the highest to the lowest class exhibit not merely comfort but luxury yet it be a selfish sort of luxury the perpetually closed door and shut-up room of ceremony the largest and most conspicuous of all in the house give a air of inhospitableness which i should hope be not indicative of the real character of the inhabitant yet it seem to be a desert village a place of the dead rather than of the live a ornamental graveyard the liveliness of social being be absent and be even inconsistent with the superlative neatness of all around we it be a best parlor out-of-door where the gayety of frolic child would derange the set order of the furniture or a accidental touch of a sacrilegious foot might scratch the polish of a fresh-varnished fence or flatten down the nap of the green carpet of grass every blade of which be train to grow exactly so the grounds and garden of a mr vander beck be indeed a curiosity from the strange mixture of the useful with the ridiculously ornamental here be the beautiful bank of a lake and nature 's embellishment of reed and water plant which for a wonder be leave to grow in they native luxuriance and in the midst a huge pasteboard or wooden swan and a wooden mermaid of tasteless proportion blow from a conchshell in another part be a cottage with puppet the size of life move by clock-work a peasant smoking and turn a reel to wind off the thread which he ` goe vrow ' be spin upon a wheel while a most sheep-like dog be make to open he mouth and to bark -- a dog which be doubtless the progenitor of all the bark toy-shop dog of the world directly in the vicinity be a beautiful grapery with the richest cluster of grape literally cover the top side and wall of the greenhouse which stand in the midst of a garden gay with dahlia and amaranth and every variety of flower with delicious fruit thickly stud the well-trained tree everything however be cut up into miniature landscape little bridge and little temple adorn little canal and little mound miniature representation of stream and bill we visit the residence of the burgomaster he be away and he servant permit we to see the house it be cleaning-day everything in the house be in keep with the character of the village but the kitchen how shall i describe it the polish marble floor the dresser with glass door like a bookcase to keep the least particle of dust from the bright-polished utensil of brass and copper the varnished mahogany handle of the brass spigot lest the moisture of the hand in turn it should soil its polish and will you believe it the very pothook as well as the crane -lrb- for there be two -rrb- in the fireplace be as bright as you scissors broek be certainly a curiosity it be unique but the impression leave upon I be not on the whole agreeable i should not be contented to live there it be too ridiculously and uncomfortably nice fancy a lady always dress throughout the day in she best evening-party dress and say if she could move about with that ease which she would like such however must be the feeling of the inhabitant of broek they must be in perpetual fear not only of soil or derange they clothes merely but they very street every step they take but good-bye to broek i would not have miss see it but do not care to see it again holland which he have never visit before interested he greatly but he could not help say : one feel in holland like be in a ship constantly liable to spring a leak hamburg he find more to he taste : -- _ September 26 _ hamburg you may remember be nearly destroy by fire in 1842 it be now almost rebuilt and in a most splendid style of architecture i be much prepossess in its favor we have take up we quarter at the victorium hotel one of the splendid new hotel of the city i find the season so far advance in these northern region that i be thinking of give up my journey farther north my matter in london will demand all my spare time _ September 30 _ the window of my hotel look out upon the alster basin a beautiful sheet of water three side of which be surround with splendid house boat and swan be glide over the glassy surface give with the well-dressed promenader along the shore a air of gayety and liveliness to the scene it will not be necessary to follow the traveller step by step during this visit to europe he do not go to sweden and russium as he have at first plan for he learn that the emperor of russium be in the south and that nothing could be accomplish in he absence he therefore return to london from hamburg he be respectfully receive everywhere and he invention be recognize as be one of great merit and simplicity but it take time for anything new to make its way this be perhaps best sum up in the word of charle t fleischmann who at that time be agent of the united state patent office and be travel through europe collect information on agriculture education and the art he be a good friend of morse 's and a enthusiastic advocate of he invention he carry with he a complete telegraphic outfit and lose no opportunity to bring it to the notice of the different government visit by he and he official position give he the entree everywhere write from vienna on October 7 he say : -- there be no doubt morse 's telegraph be the best of that description i have yet see but the difficulty of introduce it be in this circumstance that every scientific man invent a similar thing and without have the practical experience and practical arrangement which make morse 's so preferable they will experiment a few mile ' distance only and no doubt it work but when they come to put it up at a great distance then they will find that they experience be not sufficient and must come back ultimately to morse 's plan the austrian government be much occupy select out of many plan -lrb- of telegraph -rrb- one for she railroad i have offer morse 's and proposed experiment i be determine to stay for some time to give they a chance of make up they mind two other young american charle robinson and charle l chapin be also travel around europe at this time for the purpose of introduce morse 's invention but while all these effort result in the ultimate adoption by all the nation of europe and then of the world of this system the superiority of which all be compel sometimes reluctantly to admit no arrangement be make by which morse and he co-proprietor benefit financially the gain in fame be great in money nil it be therefore with mixed feeling that morse write to he brother from pari on November 1 : -- i be still gratify in verify the fact that my telegraph be ahead of all the other system propose wheatstone 's be not adopt here the line from pari to rouen be not on he plan but be a experimental line of the governmental commission i go to see it yesterday with my old friend the administrator-in-chief of the telegraph of france mr poy who be one of the committee to decide on the best mode for france the system on this line be he modification i have have a long interview with m arago he be the same affable and polite man as in 1839 he be a warm friend of mine and contend for priority in my favor and be also partial to my telegraphic system as the best he be president of the commission and be go to write the history of electric telegraph i shall give he the fact concern mine the day after to-morrow i exhibit my telegraphic system again to the academy of science and be in the midst of preparation for a day important to I i have strong hope that mine will be the system adopt but there may be obstacle i do not see wheatstone at any rate be not in favor here i like the french every nation have its defect and i could wish many change here but the french be a fine people i receive a welcome here to which i be a perfect stranger in england how deep this welcome may be i can not say but if one must be cheat i like to have it do in a civil and polite way he sum up the result of he european trip in a letter to he daughter write from london on October 9 as he be on he way to liverpool from where he sail on November 19 1845 : -- i know not what to say of my telegraphic matter here yet there be nothing decide upon and i have many obstacle to contend against particularly the opposition of the proprietor of exist telegraph but that mine be the best system i have now no doubt all that i have see while they be ingenious be more complicate more expensive less efficient and easier derange it may take some time to establish the superiority of mine over the other for there be the usual array of prejudice and interest against a system which throw other out of use chapter xxxii December 20 1845 -- April 18 1849

return to he native land but not to the rest and quiet which he have so long desire telegraph line be be push forward in all direction but the more the utility of this wonderful new agent be realize the greater become the effort to break down the lawful rights of the patentee and compete line be hurriedly build on the plea of fight a baleful monopoly by the use of the invention of other say to be superior internal dissension also arise in the rank of the worker on the morse line and some on whom he have rely prove faithless or cause trouble in other way but while these cloud arise to darken he sky there be yet much sunshine to gladden he heart he health be good he child and the family of he brother be well and prosperous in the year 1846 he patent rights be extend for another period of year and he be gradually accumulate a competence as the various line in which he hold stock begin to declare dividend in addition to all this he fame have so increase that he be often allude to in the papers as the idol of the nation and honorary degree be confer on he by various institution both at home and abroad of these the one that perhaps please he the most be the degree of lld bestow by he _ alma mater _ yale he allude to it with pride in many of he letter to he brother sidney and once playfully suggest that it must mean lightning line doctor one of the first letter which he receive on he return to america be from cambridge livingston date December 20 1845 and read as follow : -- the trustee of the new york and boston magnetic telegraph association be get up a certificate of stock and be desirous of make it neat and appropriate it have seem to I very desirable that one of its decoration should be you coat of arm and if you will do I the favor to transmit a copy or a wax impression of the same i shall be much oblige to this morse reply : -- i send you a sketch of the morse coat of arm accord to you request to do as you please with it i be no advocate of heraldic device but the _ motto _ in this case sanction it with I i wish to live and die in its spirit : -- ' _ deo non armi fido _ ' i have say that many on whom morse rely proved faithless and while i do not intend to go into the detail of all these trouble it be only right that in the interest of historical truth some mention should be make of some of these man the one who next to foj smith cause the most trouble to morse and he associate be henry o'reilly mr reid in he telegraph in america thus describe he : -- henry o'reilly be in many respects a wonderful man he taste be cultivate he instinct be fine he be intelligent and genial he energy be untire he hopefulness shine he mental activity and power of continuous labor be marvellous he be liberal generous profuse full of the best instinct of he nation but he lack prudence in money matter be loose in the use of it have little veneration for contract be more anxious for personal fame than wealth he form and break friendship with equal rapidity be bitter in he hate be impatient of restraint my personal attachment to he be great and sincere we be friend for many year until he become the agent of foj smith and my duty throw I in collision with he it be not until some year after he first connection with the telegraph in 1845 that o'reilly turn against morse and he associate this will be refer to at the proper time but i have introduce he now to give point to the follow extract from a letter of he to morse dated December 28 1845 : -- do you recollect a person who while under you hand for a daguerreotype in 1840-41 break accidentally a eight-dollar lens tho ' many tho ' t you ` visionary ' in you idea of telegraphic communication that person you may recollect take a lively interest in the matter and make some suggestion about the propriety of press the matter energetically upon congress and upon public attention you seem then to feel pleased to find a person who take so lively a interest in you invention and you will see by the enclose circular that that person -lrb- you humble servant -rrb- have not lose any of he early confidence in its value may you reap a adequate reward for the glorious thought it be one of life 's little irony that the man who could thus call down good fortune on the head of the inventor should soon after become one of the chief instrument in the effort to rob he of he adequate reward and he good name as well morse have such bitter experience with several person who turn from friend to enemy that it be no wonder he write as follow to vail some time after this date : -- i be grieve to say that many thing have lately come to my knowledge in regard to -- that show double-dealing be on you guard i hope it be but appearance and that he course may be clear up by subsequent event i declare to you that i have see so much duplicity in those in whom i have confide as friend that i feel in danger of entertaining suspicion of everybody i have hitherto think you be too much inclined to be suspicious of people but i no longer think so keep this to yourself it may be that appearance be deceptive and i would not wrong one whom i have esteem as a real friend without the clearest evidence of unfaithfulness yet when appearance be against it be right to be cautious the name of the person refer to be leave blank in the copy of this letter which i have so i do not know who it be but the sentiment would apply to several of the early worker in the establishment of the telegraph i have say that morse be only human be sometimes guilty of error of judgment but in a careful study of the fact the wonder be great that he commit so few it be a ungracious task for a son to call attention to anything but the virtue of he father especially when any lapse be the result of great provocation and be make under the firm conviction that he be in the right yet in the interest of truth it be best to state the fact fairly and dispassionately and let posterity judge whether the virtue do not far outweigh the fault such a error be commit in my judgment by morse in the bitter controversy which arise between he and professor joseph henry and i shall briefly sketch the origin and progress of this regrettable incident in 1845 alfred vail compile and publish a history of the american electro-magnetic telegraph in this work hardly any mention be make of the important discovery of professor henry and this cause that gentleman to take great offense as he believe that morse be the real author of the work or have at least give vail all the material as a matter of fact he have give vail only he note on european telegraph and have not see the proof of the work which be publish while he be absent in europe as soon as morse be make aware of henry 's feeling he write to he regret the omission and explain he innocence in the matter and he also draught a letter at vail 's request which the latter copy and send to henry state that he vail have be unable to obtain the particulars of henry 's discovery and that if he have offend he have do so innocently henry be a extremely sensitive man and he pay no attention to vail 's letter and send only a curt acknowledgment of the receipt of morse 's however at a meeting somewhat later the misunderstanding seem to be smooth over on the assurance that in a second edition of vail 's work due credit should be give to henry and that whenever morse have the opportunity he would gladly accord to that eminent man the discovery which be he there never be a true second edition of vail 's book but in 1847 a few more copy be strike off from the old plate and the date be unfortunately change from 1845 to 1847 henry naturally look upon this as a second edition and he resentment grow morse 's opportunity to do public honor to henry come in 1848 when professor sear c walker of the coast survey publish a report contain some remark on the theory of morse 's electro-magnetic telegraph when professor walker submit this report to morse the latter say : i have now the long-wished-for opportunity to do justice publicly to henry 's discovery bearing upon the telegraph i should like to see he however previously and learn definitely what he claim to have discover i will then prepare a paper to be append and publish as a note if you see fit to you report this paper be write by morse and send to professor walker with the request that it be submit to professor henry for he revision which be do but it be not include in professor walker 's report and this naturally nettle morse who also have sensitive nerve and so the breach be widen in this paper after give a brief history of electric discovery bear on the telegraph and of he own invention morse sum up : -- while therefore i claim to be the first to propose the use of the _ electro-magnet for telegraphic purpose _ and the _ first _ to _ construct a telegraph on the basis of the electro-magnet _ yet to professor henry be unquestionably due the honor of the _ discovery of a fact in science _ which prove the practicability of exciting magnetism through a long coil or at a distance either to _ deflect a needle _ or _ to magnetize soft iron _ i wish he have never revise this opinion although he be sincere in think that a more careful study of the subject justified he in do so a few year afterwards morse and he associate become involve in a series of bitterly contest litigation with party interested in break down the original patent rights and henry be call as a witness for the opponent of morse he give he testimony with great reluctance but it be tinge with the bitterness cause by the failure of vail to do he justice and he apparent conviction that morse be disingenuous he deny to the latter any scientific discovery and give the impression -lrb- at least to other -rrb- that henry and not morse be the real inventor of the telegraph he testimony be use by the enemy of morse both at home and abroad to invalidate the claim of the latter and sting by these aspersion on he character and attainment and urge thereto by injudicious friend morse publish a lengthy pamphlet entitle : a defense against the injurious deduction draw from the deposition of professor joseph henry in this pamphlet he not only attempt to prove that he owe nothing to the discovery of henry but he call in question the truthfulness of that distinguished man the breach between these two honorable highly sensitive man be now complete and it be never heal the consensus of scientific opinion give to henry 's discovery great value in the invention of the telegraph while they do not constitute a true telegraph in themselves while they need the invention and discovery and i might add the sublime faith and indomitable perseverance of morse to make the telegraph a commercial success they be in my opinion essential to it and morse i think err in deny this but from a thorough study of he character we must give he the credit of be sincere in he denial henry too err in ignore the advance of morse and vail and in he proud sensitiveness professor leonard d gale the friend of both man make the following comment in a letter to morse of February 9 1852 : i fear henry and i shall never again be on good term he be as cold as a polar berg and i be inform very sensitive it have be say by some busybody that he testimony be incompatible with mine and so a sort of feeling be manifest as if it be so i have say nothing about it yet it would have be more dignified on the part of morse to have disregard the imputation contain in henry 's testimony or to have reply much more briefly and dispassionately on the other hand the provocation be great and he be egg on by other partly from motive of self-interest and partly from a sincere desire on the part of he friend that he should justify himself in a long letter to vail of January 15 1851 in which he detail the whole unfortunate affair he say : if there be a man in the world not related to I for whom i have conceive not merely admiration but affection it be for professor joseph henry i think you will remember and can bear I witness that i often express the wish that i be able to put several thousand dollar at he service for scientific investigation the whole case have sadden I more than i can express i have to fight hard against misanthropy friend vail and i have find the best antidote to be when the fit be come on I to seek out a case of suffering and to relieve it that the act in the one case may neutralize the feeling in the other and thus restore the balance in the heart in take leave for the present of this unfortunate controversy i shall quote from the defense to show that morse sincerely believe it he duty to act as he do but that he act with reluctance : -- that i have be slow to complain of the injurious character of he testimony that i have so long allow almost entirely uncontradicted its distortion to have all they legal weight against I in four separate trial without public exposure and for a space of four year of time will at least show i humbly contend my reluctance to appear oppose to he even when self-defence be combine with the defense of the interest of a large body of assignee painful therefore as be the task impose upon I i can not shrink from it but shall endeavor so to perform it as rather to parry the blow that have be aim at I than to inflict any in return if what i say shall wind it shall be from the severity of the simple truth itself rather than from the manner of set it forth in the year 1846 there still remain one panel in the rotunda of the capitol at washington to be fill by a historical painting it have be assign to inman but that artist have recently die morse 's friend artist and other send a petition to congress urge the appointment of morse in he place refer to this in a letter to he brother sidney date march 28 he say : -- in regard to the rotunda picture i learn that my friend be quite zealous and it be not improbable that it may be give I to execute if so what should you say to see I in pari however this be but castle-building i be quite indifferent as to the result except that in case it be give I i shall be restore to my position as a artist by the same power that prostrate I and then shall i not more than ever have cause to exclaim : ` surely thou hast lead I in away which i know not ' i have already in look back see enough of the dealings of providence with I to excite my wonder and gratitude how singularly have my way be hedge up in my profession at the very moment when to human appearance everything seem prosperously tend to the accomplishment of my desire in paint a national picture the language of providence in all he dealings with I have be almost like that to abraham : ` take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and offer he for a burnt offering ' etc it have always seem a mystery to I how i should have be lead on to the acquirement of the knowledge i possess of painting with so much sacrifice of time and money and through so many anxiety and perplexity and then suddenly be stop as if a wall be build across my path so that i could pursue my profession no longer but i believe i have grace to trust in god in the darkest hour of trial persuade that he could and would clear up in he own time and manner all the mystery that surround I and now if not greatly deceive i have a glimpse of he wonderful truly wonderful mercy towards I he have choose thus to order event that my mind might be concentrate upon that invention which he have permit to be bear for the blessing i trust of the world and he have choose I as the instrument and give I the honor and at the moment when all have be accomplish which be essential to its success he so order event as again to turn my thought to my almost sacrifice isaac in this however he do not read the fate aright for a letter from he friend reverend e goodrich smith date march 2 1847 convey the follow intelligence : i have just learn to-day that with they usual discrimination and justice congress have vote $ 6000 to have the panel fill by young powell he enlist all ohio and they all electioneer with all they might and no one know that the question would come up new york i understand go for you i hope however you may yet yourself resume the pencil and furnish the public the most striking commentary on they utter disregard of justice by place somewhere ` the germ of the republic ' in such color that shall make they blush and hang they head to think themselves such man but while he be to be bless in the fulfilment of a long cherish dream it be not the dream of paint a great historic picture he never seriously touch a brush again for all he energy be need in the defense of himself and he invention from defamation and attack in the summer of 1846 he meet with another accident give he a slight period of rest which he would not otherwise have take he write of it to he brother on July 30 : on Monday last i have the misfortune to fall into one of those mantrap on broadway set principally to break people 's leg and maim they and _ incidentally _ for the deposit of the coal of the household vail refer jestingly to this mishap in a letter of August 21 : i trust you unfortunate and unsuccessful attempt to get down cellar have not be a serious affair and morse reply in the same vein : my _ cellar experiment _ be not so unsuccessful as you imagine i succeed to my entire satisfaction in take three inch of skin a little of the flesh and a trifle of bone from the front of my left leg and as the result get one week 's entire leisure with my leg in a chair the experiment be so satisfactory that i deem it needless to try it again have establish beyond a doubt that skin flesh and bone be no match against wood iron and stone i be entirely well of it and enjoy my visit to the western line very much it be characteristic of morse that the first money which he receive from the actual sale of he patent rights -lrb- $ 45 for the right to use he patent on a short line from the post-office to the national observatory in washington -rrb- be devote by he to a religious purpose from a letter of October 20 1846 we learn that add $ 5 to this sum he present $ 25 to a Sunday school and $ 25 to the fund for repair the attachment of the three morse brother to each other be intense and last to the end of they life the letter of finley morse to he brother sidney in particular would alone fill a volume and be of great interest most of they have never before be publish and i shall quote from they freely in follow morse 's career sidney and he family be still in europe and the two follow extract be from letter to he : -- _ October 29 1846 _ i do not know where this will find you but as the steamer caledonium go in a day or two and as i do not write you by the last steamer i think i would occupy a few moment -lrb- not exactly of leisure -rrb- to write you charle have little to do but do all he can he be desirous of a farm and i have make up my mind to indulge he i shall go up the river in a day or two and look in the vicinity of po ` keepsie telegraph matter be every day assume a more and more interesting aspect all physical and scientific difficulty be vanquish if conductor be well put up there be nothing more to wish for in the facility of intercourse my operator can easily talk with each other as fast as person usually write and faster than this would be faster than be necessary the canadian be alive on the subject and line be project from toronto to montreal from montreal to quebec and to halifax line be also in contemplation from toronto to detroit on the canada side and from buffalo to chicago on this side so that it may not be visionary to say that we first news from england may reach new york via halifax detroit buffalo and albany the papers will inform you of the event of the war we people be unite on this point so far as to pursue it with vigor to a speedy termination however john bull may sneer and endeavor to detract from the valor of we troops he own annals do not furnish proof of greater skill and more fearless daring and successful result the mexican race be a worn-out race and god in he providence be take this mode to regenerate they whatever may be the opinion of some in relation to the justness or unjustness of we quarrel there ought to be but one opinion among all good man and that should be that the moment should be improve to throw a light into that darkened nation and to raise a standard there which whatever may become of the star and stripe or eagle and prickly pear shall be never take down till all nation have flock to it we bible and tract society and missionary ought to be in the wake of we army _ January 28 1847 _ telegraph matter be become more and more interesting the people of the country everywhere be desirous of avail themselves of its facility and the line be be extend in all direction as might be expect then i have my plan interfere with by mercenary speculator who threaten to put up rival telegraph and contest my patent _ i be ready for they _ we have have to apply for a injunction on the philadelphium and pittsburg line the case be a aggravate one and will be decide on Monday or Tuesday at philadelphia in circuit court of united state i have no uneasiness as to the result -lrb- it be decide against he however but this prove only a temporary check -rrb- there be more foj than one yet not one quite so bad i think amid all the scramble i shall probably have enough come to my share and it do not matter by what mean we heavenly father choose to curtail my receipt for i shall have just what he please none can hinder it and more i do not want house and he associate be make most strenuous effort to interfere and embarrass I by play on the ignorance of the public and the natural timidity of capitalist i shall probably have to lay the law on he and make a example before my patent be confirm in the mind of the public it be the course i be tell of every substantial patent it have to undergo the ordeal of one trial in the court although i thus write you need have no fear that my operation will be seriously affect by any scheme of common letter print telegraph i have just file a caveat for one which i have invent which as far transcend in simplicity and efficiency any previous plan for the purpose as my telegraph system be superior to the old visual telegraph i will have it in operation by the time you return apropo of the attack make upon he by would-be infringer the follow from a letter of he legal counsel daniel lord esq date January 12 1847 may not come amiss : it ought to be a source of great satisfaction to you to have you invention steal and counterfeit think what a acknowledgment it be and what a tribute to its merit refer to this in a letter to mr lord of a later date morse answer : the plot thicken all around I i think a _ dénouement _ not far off i remember you consoling I under these attack with bidding I think that i have invent something worth contend for alas my dear sir what encouragement be there to a inventor if after year of toil and anxiety he have only purchase for himself the pleasure of be a target for every vile fellow to shoot at and in proportion as he invention be of public utility so much the greater effort be to be make to defame that the robbery may excite the less sympathy i know however that beyond all this be a clear sky but the cloud may not break away until i be no longer personally interested whether it be foul or fair i wish not to complain but i have feeling and can not play the stoic if i would it be a new experience for morse to become involve in the intricacy of the law and in a letter to a friend henry i williams esq date February 22 1847 he naively remark : a student all my life mostly in a profession which be adverse in its habit and taste from those of the business world and never before engage in a lawsuit i confess to great ignorance even of the ordinary commonplace detail of a court he desire to be both just and merciful be show in a letter to mr kendall write on February 16 just before the decision be render against he : i have be in court all day and have be much pleased with the clearness and i think conclusiveness of mr mile 's argument i think he have produce a evident change in the view of the judge yet it be best to be prepare for the worst and even if we succeed in get the injunction i wish as much leniency as possible to be show to the oppose party indeed in this i know my view be second by you however we may have ` speak dagger ' let we use none and let we make every allowance for honest mistake even where appearance be at first against such a supposition o'reilly may have act hastily under excitement under bad advisement and in that mood have take wrong step yet i still believe he may be recover and while i would use every precaution to protect we just rights i wish not to take a single step that can be misconstrue into vindictiveness or triumph it be well that it be he invariable rule to be prepare for the worst for write to he brother sidney on February 24 he say : we have just have a lawsuit in philadelphium before judge kane we apply for a injunction to stay irregular and injurious proceedings on the part of western -lrb- pittsburg and cincinnatus -rrb- company and we application have be _ refuse _ on technical grounds i know not what will be the issue i be try to have matter compromise but do not know if it can be do and we may have to contest it in _ law _ we application be in court of equity a movement of smith be the cause of all another sidelight be throw on morse 's character by the follow extract from a letter to one of he lieutenant t faxton write on march 15 : we must raise the salary of we operator or they will all be take from we that be all that be good for anything you will recollect that at the first meeting of the board of director i take the ground that ` it be we policy to make the office of operator desirable to pay operator well and make they situation so agreeable that intelligent man and man of character will seek the place and dread to lose it ' i still think so and depend upon it it be the soundest economy to act on this principle just about this time to add to morse 's other perplexity doctor charle t jackson begin to renew he claim to the invention of the telegraph while also dispute with morton the discovery of ether as a anesthetic then call letheon and claim the invention of gun-cotton and the discovery of the circulation of the blood morse find a willing and able champion in edward warren esq of boston and many letter pass between they as jackson 's wild claim be effectually dispose of i shall not dwell upon this source of annoyance but shall content myself with one extract from a letter to mr warren of march 23 : i wish not to attack dr jackson nor even to defend myself in _ public _ from he _ private _ attack if in any of he publication he renew he claim which i consider as long since settle by default then it will be time and proper for I to notice he the most charitable construction of the dr 's conduct be to attribute it to a monomania induce by excessive vanity while many of those upon whom he have look as friend turn against he in the mad scramble for power and wealth engender by the extension of the telegraph line it be gratify to turn to those who remain true to he through all and among these none be more loyal than alfred vail they correspondence which be voluminous be always characterize by the deepest confidence and affection in a long letter of march 24 vail show he solicitude for morse 's peace of mind : i think i would not be bother with a directorship in the new york and buffalo line nor in any other i should wish to keep clear of they it will only tend to harass and vex when you should be leave quiet and undisturbed to pursue you improvement and the enjoyment of what be most gratifying to you and morse write to vail somewhat later in this same year exclaim : you say you hope i shall not forget that we have spend many hour together you might have add ` happy hour ' i have try you dear vail as a friend and think i know you as a zealous and honest one still earlier on march 18 1845 in one of he report to the postmaster-general cave johnson he add : in regard to the salary of the ` one clerk at washington -- $ 1200 ' mr vail who would from the necessity of the case take that post be my right-hand man in the whole enterprise he have be with I from the year 1837 and be as familiar with all the mechanism and scientific arrangement of the telegraph as i be myself he time and talent be more essential to the success of the telegraph than -lrb- those of -rrb- any two person that could be name return now to the letter to he brother sidney i shall give the following extract : -- _ march 29 1847 _ i be now in new york permanently that be i have no longer any official connection with washington and be thinking of _ fix _ somewhere so soon as i can get my telegraphic matter into such a state as to warrant it but my patience be still much try although the enterprise look well and be prosper yet somehow i do not command the cash as some business man would if they be in the same situation the property be doubtless good and be increase but i can not use it as i could the money for while everybody seem to think i have the wealth of john jacob the only sum i have actually realize be my first dividend on one line about fourteen hundred dollar and with this i can not purchase a house but time will perhaps enable I to do so if it be well that i should have one i have have some pretty threatening obstacle but they as yet be summer cloud which seem to be dissipate through the smile of we heavenly father house 's affair i think be dead i believe it have be hold up by speculator to drive a better bargain with I think to scare I but they do not find I so easily frighten in virginium i have to oppose a most bigoted narrow illiberal clique in a railroad company which have the address to get a bill through the house of delegate give they actually the monopoly of telegraph and venture to halloo before they be out of the wood mr kendall go post-haste to richmond meet the bill and its supporter before the committee of the senate and after a sharp contest procure its rejection in the senate and the adoption by a vote of 13 to 7 of a substitute grant I _ right of way _ and _ corporate power _ which bill after violent opposition in the house be finally pass 44 to 27 so a mean intrigue be defeat most signally and i come off triumphant _ April 27 _ this you will recognize by the date be my birthday 36 year old only think i shall never be 26 again do not you wish you be as young as i be well if _ feeling _ determine age i should be in reality what i have above state but that leaf in the family bible those boy and that daughter those niece and nephew of younger brother and especially that _ grandson _ they all concur in put twenty year more to those 36 i can not get they off there they be 56 there be a underhand intrigue against my telegraph interest in virginium foster by a friend turn enemy in the hope to better he own interest a man whom i have ever treat as a friend while i have the governmental patronage to bestow and give he office in baltimore have no more of patronage to give i have no more friendship from he mr r have prove himself false notwithstanding he name he son after I as a proof of friendship the mr r refer to be henry j roger and writing of he to vail on April 26 morse say : i be truly grieve at roger 's conduct he must be conscious of do great injustice for a man that have wrong another be sure to invent some cause for he act if there have be none give in this case he endeavor to excuse he selfish and injurious act by the false assertion that ' i have cast he overboard ' why what do he mean be i not overboard myself do he or anyone else suppose i have nothing else to do than to find they place and not only intercede for they which in roger 's case and zantziger 's i have constantly and perseveringly do to the present hour but i be bind to force the company over which i have no control to take they at any rate on the penalty of be traduce and injure by they if they do not get the office they seek as to roger you know my feeling towards he and he i have receive he as a _ friend _ not as a mere employee and let no opportunity pass without urge forward he interest i recollect he name he son for I and have determine if the wealth actually come which have be predict to I that that child should be remembered always desirous of be just and merciful morse write to vail on may 1 : roger be here i have have a good deal of conversation with he and the result be that i think that some circumstance which seem to inculpate he be explicable on other grounds than intention to injure we but he be finally force to give he up for on August 7 he write : you can not tell how pained i be at be compel to change my opinion of r you feeling correspond entirely with my own i be hope to do something gratify to he and he family and soon should have do it if he would permit it but no the mask of friendship cover a deep selfishness that scruple not to sacrifice a real friendship to a shortsighted and overreaching ambition let he go i wish to befriend he and he and would have do so from the heart but as he can not trust I i have enough who can and do the case of roger be typical and i have therefore give it in some detail it be always a source of grief to morse when man whom in he large-hearted way he have admit to he intimacy turn against he and he be call upon to suffer many such blow he have be accuse of have quarrel with all he associate this of course be not true for we have only to name vail and gale and kendall and reid and a host of other to prove the contrary but like all man who have achieve great thing he make bitter enemy some of whom at first profess sincere friendship for he and be implicitly trust by he however a dispassionate study of all the circumstance lead up to the rupture of these friendly tie will prove that in practically every case he be sin against not sin a letter to jame d reid write on December 21 will show that the quality of he mercy be not strain : you may recollect when i meet you in philadelphium on the unpleasant business of attend in a court to witness the contest of two party for they rights you inform I of the destitute condition of o'reilly 's family at that moment i be lead to believe from consultation with the counsel for the patentee that the case would undoubtedly go in they -lrb- the patentee ' -rrb- favor you statement touch I and i could not bear to think that a innocent wife and inoffensive child should suffer even from the wrong-doing of they proper protector should this prove to be the case you remember i authorize you to draw on I for twenty dollar to be remit to mr o'reilly 's family and to keep the source from whence it be derive secret my object in write be to ask if this be do and in case it be to request you to draw on I for that amount in a earlier letter to he brother he remark philosophically : smith be smith yet and so likely to be but i have become use to he and you would be surprise to find how well oil and water appear to agree there must be cross and the aim should be rather to bear they gracefully graciously and patiently than to have they remove while thus harass on all side by those who would filch from he he good name as well as he purse he reward be come to he for the patience and equanimity with which he be bear he cross the longing for a home of he own have be intense all through he life and now in the evening of he year this dream be to be realize he thus announce to he brother the glorious news : -- poughkeepsie north river July 30 1847 in my last i write you that i have be look out for a farm in this region and give you a diagram of a place which i fancy since then i be inform of a place for sale south of this village 2 mile on the bank of the river part of the old livingston manor and far superior _ i have this day conclude a bargain for it _ there be about one hundred acre i pay for it $ 17500 i be almost afraid to tell you of its beauty and advantage it be just such a place as in england could not be purchase for double the number of pound sterling its capability as the landscape gardener would say be unequalled there be every variety of surface plain hill dale glen run stream and fine forest and every variety of different prospect the fishkill mountain towards the south and the catskill towards the north the hudson with its variety of river craft steamboat of all kind sloop etc constantly show a varied scene -lrb- illustration : house at locust grove poughkeepsie ny -rrb- i will not enlarge i be congratulate by all in have make a excellent purchase and i find a most delightful neighborhood within a few mile around approach by excellent road be mr lenox general talmadge philip van rensselaer etc on one side on the other harry livingston mr smith thomson -lrb- judge thomson 's widow and sister to the first mr arthur breese -rrb- mr crosby mr boorman etc etc the new railroad will run at the foot of the grounds -lrb- probably -rrb- on the river and bring new york within two hour of we there be every faculty for residence -- good market church school take it all in all i think it just the place _ for we all _ if you should fancy a spot on it for build i can accommodate you and richard want twenty acre reserve for he singularly enough this be the very spot where uncle arthur find he wife the old tree be point out where he and she use to ramble during they courtship on September 12 after again expatiate on the beauty and advantage of he home he add : i have some cloud and muttering of thunder on the horizon -lrb- the necessary attendant i suppose of a lightning project -rrb- which i trust will give no more of storm than will suffice under he who direct the element to clear the air and make a serener and calmer sunset on October 12 he announce the name which he have give to he country place and a singular coincidence : -- _ locust grove _ you see by the date where i be locust grove it seem be the original name give to this place by judge livingston and without know this fact i have give the same name to it so that there be a natural appropriateness in the designation of my home the wind be howl mournfully this evening a second edition i fear of the late destructive equinoctial but dreary as it be out-of-doors i have comfortable quarter within in the world of affair the wind be howl too and the storm be gather which culminate in the series of lawsuit bring by morse and he associate against the infringer on he patent the letter to he brother be full of the detail of these piratical attack but throughout all the turmoil he maintain he poise and he faith in the triumph of justice and truth in the letter just quote from he say : these matter do not annoy I as formerly i have see so many dark storm which threaten and particularly in relation to the telegraph and i have see they so often hush at the ` peace be still ' of we covenant god that now the fear and anxiety on any fresh gathering soon subside into perfect calm and on November 27 he write : the most annoying part of the matter to I be that notwithstanding my matter be all in the hand of agent and i have nothing to do with any of the arrangement i be hold up by name to the odium of the public lawsuit be commence against they at cincinnatus and will be in indiana and illinoi as well as here and so notwithstanding all my effort to get along peaceably i find the fate of whitney before I i think i may be able to secure my farm and so have a place to retire to for the evening of my day but even this may be deny I a few month will decide you have before you the fate of a inventor and take as much pain as you will to secure to yourself you valuable invention make up you mind from my experience now in addition to other that you will be rob of it and abuse into the bargain this be the lot of a successful inventor or discoverer and no precaution i believe will save he from it he will meet with a mixed estimate the enlighten the liberal the good will applaud he and respect he the sordid the unprincipled will hate he and detract from he reputation to compass they own contemptible and selfish end while event in the business world be rapidly converge towards the great lawsuit which should either confirm the inventor 's rights to the offspring of he brain or deprive he of all the benefit to which he be justly and morally entitle he continue to find solace from all he care and anxiety in he new home with he child and friend around he he touch on the light and shadow in a letter to he brother who be still in england date new york April 19 1848 : -- i snatch a moment by the washington which go to-morrow to redeem my character in not have write of late so often as i could wish i have be so constantly under the necessity of watch the movement of the most unprincipled set of pirate i have ever know that all my time have be occupy in defense in put evidence into something like legal shape that i be the inventor of the electro-magnetic telegraph would you have believe it ten year ago that a question could be raise on that subject yet this very morning in the ` journal of commerce ' be a article from a new orlean paper give a account of a public meeting convene by o'reilly at which he boldly state that i have ' _ pirate my invention from a german invention _ ' a great deal better than mine and the ` journal of commerce ' have a sort of halfway defense of I which imply there be some doubt on the subject i have write a note which may appear in to-morrow 's ` journal ' quite short but which i think will stop that game here a trial in court be the only event now which will put public opinion right so indefatigable have these unprincipled man be in manufacture a spurious public opinion although these event embarrass I and i do not receive and may not receive my rightful due

than one the first of the historic lawsuit be to be begin at frankfort kentucky -- lawsuit which be not only to establish this inventor 's claim but be to be use as a precedent in all future patent litigation in he peaceful retreat on the bank of the hudson he carefully and systematically prepare the evidence which should confound he enemy and calmly await the verdict firm in he faith that however lower the cloud the sun would yet break through finding relaxation from he care and worry in the problem of he farm he devote every spare moment to the life out-of-door and drink in new strength and inspiration with every breath of the pure country air although soon to pass the fifty-seventh milestone he sane temperate habit have keep he young in heart and vigorous in body and in this same year he be to be reward for he long and lonely vigil during the dark decade of he middle life and to enter upon a indian summer of happy family life while spend as much time as possible at he beloved locust grove he be yet compel in the interest of he approach legal contest to consult with he lawyer in new york and washington and it be while in the latter city that he receive a letter from colonel tal p shaffner one of the most energetic of the telegraph pioneer and a devoted if sometimes injudicious friend it be he who more than any one else be responsible for the publication of morse 's defense against professor henry the letter be write from louisville on January 9 1848 and contain the following sentence : we be go ahead with the line to new orlean i have twenty-five hand on the road to nashville and will put on more next week i have ten on the road to frankfort and my associate have gang at other part o'reilly have fifteen hand on the nashville route and i confidently expect a few fight my man be well arm and i think they can do they duty i shall be with they when the party get together and if anything do occur the use of dupont 's best will be appreciate by I this be to be lament but if it come we shall not back out deeply exercise morse answer he post-haste : it give I real pain to learn that there be any prospect of physical collision between the o'reilly party and ours and i trust that this may arrive in time to prevent any movement of those friendly to I which shall provoke so sad a result i emphatically say that if _ the law _ can not protect I and my rights in you region i shall never sanction the appeal to force to sustain myself however conscious of be in the right i infinitely prefer to suffer still more from the gross injustice of unprincipled man than to gain my rights by a single illegal step i hope you will do all in you power to prevent collision if the party meet in put up post or wire let we opponent have they way unmolested i have no patent for put up post or wire they as well as we have a right to put they up it be the use make of they afterwards which may require legal adjustment the man employ by each party be not to blame let no ill-feeling be foment between the two no rivalry but that of do they work the best let friendly feeling as between they be cherish and teach they to refer all dispute to the principal i wish no one to fight for I physically he may ` speak dagger but use none ' however much i might appreciate he friendship and he motive it would give I the deepest sorrow if i should learn that a single individual friend or foe have be injure in life or limb by any profess friendship for I he be reassure by the follow from colonel shaffner : -- _ January 27 _ you favor of the 21st be receive yesterday i be sorry that you allow you feeling to be so much arouse in the case of contemplated difficulty between we hand and those of o'reilly they hold out the threat that we should not pass they and we be determine to do it i have they notify that we be prepare to meet they under any circumstance we be prepare to have a real ` hug ' but when we hand overtake they they only ` yell ' a little and mine follow and for fifteen mile they be side by side and when a man finish he hole he run with all he might to get ahead but finally on the 24th we pass they about eighty mile from here and now we be about twenty-five mile ahead of they without the loss of a drop of blood and we shall be able to beat they to nashville if we can get the wire in time which be doubtful there be many such stir incident in the early history of the telegraph and the half of they have not be tell thus leave much material for the future historian but while so much that be exciting be take place in the outside world the cause of it all be turn he thought towards matter more domestic on June 13 he write to he brother : charle leave I for utica last evening and finley and i go this evening to be present at he marriage on Thursday the 15th it be at he son 's wedding that he be again strongly attract to he young second cousin -lrb- or to be more exact he first cousin once remove -rrb- the first cousin of he son 's bride and the result be announce to he brother in a letter of August 7 : before you return i shall be again marry i leave to-morrow for utica where cousin -lrb- second cousin -rrb- sarah elizabeth griswold now be on Thursday morning the 10th we shall -lrb- god willing -rrb- be marry and i shall immediately proceed to louisville and frankfort in kentucky to be present at my first suit against o'reilly the pirate of my invention it come off on the 23d inst so far as the justice of the case be concerned i be confident of final success but there be so many crook in the law that i ought to be prepare for disappointment continue he tell he brother that he have be secretly in love with he future wife for some year : but reflect on it i find i be in no situation to indulge in any plan of marry she have nothing i have nothing and the more i love she the more i be determine to stifle my feeling without hint to she anything of the matter or let she know that i be at all interested in she but now with increase wealth the condition be change and so they be marry and in they case it can with perfect truth be say they live happy ever after and fail by but a year of be able to celebrate they silver wedding soon a young family grow up around he to whom he be always a patient and loving father we he child undoubtedly give he many a anxious moment as child have a habit of do but through all he trial domestic as well as extraneous he be calm wise and judicious -lrb- illustration : sarah elizabeth griswold second wife of sfb morse -rrb- but now the first of the great lawsuit which be to confirm morse 's patent rights or to throw he invention open to the world be begin and with he young bride he hasten to frankfort to be present at the trial to follow these suit through all they legal intricacy would make dry reading and consume ream of paper mr prime in a footnote remark : mr henry o'reilly have deposit in the library of the new york historical society more than one hundred volume contain a complete history of telegraphic litigation in the united state these record be at all time accessible to any person who wish to investigate the claim and rights of individual or company the _ testimony _ alone in the various suit fill several volume each as large as this it will therefore only be necessary to say that almost all of these suit include the final one before the supreme court of the united state be decide in morse 's favor every legal device be use against he he claim and those of other be sift to the uttermost and then as now expert opinion be find to uphold both side of the case to quote mr prime : the decision of the supreme court be unanimous on all the point involve the right of professor morse to the claim of be the original inventor of the electro-magnetic recording telegraph a minority of the court go still further and give he the right to the motive power of magnetism as a means of operate machinery to imprint signal or to produce sound for telegraphic purpose the testimony of expert in science and art be not introduce because it be thoroughly weigh and sift by intelligent and impartial man whose judgment must be accept as final and sufficient the justice of the decision have never be impugn each succeed year have confirm it with accumulate evidence one point be decide against the morse patent and it be worthy of be notice that this decision which deny to morse the exclusive use of electromagnetism for record telegraph have never be of injury to he instrument because no other inventor have devise a instrument to supersede he the court decide that the electro-magnetic telegraph be the sole and exclusive invention of samuel fb morse if other could make better instrument for the same purpose they be at liberty to use electromagnetism twenty year have elapse since this decision be render the morse patent have expire by limitation of time but it be still without a rival in any part of the world this be write in 1873 but i think that i be safe in say that the same be true now after the lapse of forty more year while of course there have be both elaboration and simplification the basic principle of the universal telegraph of to-day be embody in the drawing of the sketch-book of 1832 and it be the invention of morse and be entirely different from any form of telegraph devise by other i shall make but one quotation from the long opinion hand down by the supreme court and deliver by chief justice taney : -- neither can the inquiry he make nor the information or advice he receive from man of science in the course of he research impair he right to the character of a inventor no invention can possibly be make consist of a combination of different element of power without a thorough knowledge of the property of each of they and the mode in which they operate on each other and it can make no difference in this respect whether he derive he information from book or from man skilled in the science if it be otherwise no patent in which a combination of different element be use could ever be obtain for no man ever make such a invention without have first obtain this information unless it be discover by some fortunate accident and it be evident that such a invention as the electro-magnetic telegraph could never have be bring into action without it for a very high degree of scientific knowledge and the nicest skill in the mechanic art be combine in it and be both necessary to bring it into successful operation _ and the fact that morse seek and obtain the necessary information and counsel from the best source and act upon it neither impair he rights as a inventor nor detract from he merit _ the italics be mine for it have over and over be claim for everybody who have a part in the early history of the telegraph either by hint help or discovery that more credit should be give to he than to morse himself -- to henry to gale to vail to doctor page and even to foj smith in fact morse use often to say that some people think he have no right to claim he invention because he have not discover electricity nor the copper from which he wire be make nor the brass of he instrument nor the glass of he insulator i shall make one other quotation from the opinion of judge kane and judge grier at one of the earlier trial in philadelphium in 1851 : -- that he mr morse be the first to devise and practice the art of record language at telegraphic distance by the dynamic force of the electro-magnet or indeed by any agency whatever be to we mind plain upon all the evidence it be unnecessary to review the testimony for the purpose of show this he application for a patent in April 1838 be precede by a series of experiment result illustration and proof of final success which leave no doubt whatever but that he great invention be consummate before the early spring of 1837 there be no one person whose invention have be speak of by any witness or refer to in any book as involve the principle of mr morse 's discovery but must yield precedence of date to this neither steinheil nor cooke and wheatstone nor davy nor dyar nor henry have at this time make a recording telegraph of any sort the device then know be merely _ semaphore _ that speak to the eye for a moment -- bear about the same relation to the great discovery before we as the abbé sicard 's invention of a visual alphabet for the purpose of conversation bear to the art of printing with movable type mr dyar 's have no recording apparatus as he expressly tell we and professor henry have contented himself with the abundant honor of he laboratory and lecture-room one case be decide against he but this decision be afterwards overrule by the supreme court so that it cause no lasting injury to he claim as decision after decision be render in he favor he receive the news calmly always attribute to divine providence every favor bestow upon he letter of congratulation pour in on he from he friend and among other the follow from alfr vail must have arouse mingled feeling of pleasure and regret it be date September 21 1848 : -- i congratulate you in you success at frankfort in arrest thus far that pirate o'reilly i have receive many a hearty shake from we friend congratulating I upon the glorious issue of the application for a injunction the pirate die hard and well he may it be he privilege to kick awhile in this last death struggle these pirate must be follow up and each in he turn nail to the wall the wash & no co be at last organized and for the last three week we have receive daily communication from no we prospects be flattering and what do you think they have do with I superintendent of washington & no line all the way from washington to columbium at $ 900 this game will not be play long i have make up my mind to leave the telegraph to take care of itself since it can not take care of I i shall in a few month leave washington for new jersey family kit and all and bid adieu to the subject of the telegraph for some more profitable business i have just finish a most beautiful register with a _ pen lever key _ and a expand reel have order for six of the same kind to be make at once three for the south and three for the west i regret you could not on you return from the west have make we at least a fly visit with you charming lady i be happy to learn that you cup of happiness be so full in the society of one who i learn from mr k be well calculate to cheer you and relieve the otherwise solitude of you life my kindest wish for yourself and mr morse and believe I to be now as ever yours etc alfr vail mr jame d reid in a article in the electrical world October 12 1895 after quote from this letter add : -- the truth be mr vail have no natural aptitude for executive work and he have a temper somewhat variable and unhappy he and i get along very well together until i determine to order my own instrument he be too heavy and too difficult as i think for a operator to handle while receive we have we instrument make by the same maker -- clark & co philadelphium yet even that do not greatly separate we and we be always friend about some thing he notion be very crude it be under he guidance that david brook henry c hepburn and i in 1845 undertake to insulate the line from lancaster to harrisburg pennsylvanium by saturating bit of cotton cloth in beeswax and wrap they round project arm the bee enjoy it greatly but it spoil we work but i have no desire to criticize he he seem to I to have great opportunity which he do not use he might have have i think the register work of the country and secure a large business but it go from he to other and so he leave the field this eventful year of 1848 close with the great telegraph suit in full swing but with the inventor calm under all he trial in a letter of December 18 to he brother sidney who have now return to america he say : my affair -lrb- telegraphically -rrb- be only under a slight mist hardly a cloud i see through the mist already and in another part of this letter he say : i may see you at the end of the week if i can bring sarah down with I i will to spend christmas but the weather may change and prevent what weather i be work on the lawn as if it be spring you have no idea how lovely this spot be not a day pass that i do not feel it if i have trouble abroad i have peace and love and happiness at home my sweet wife i find indeed a rich treasure uniformly cheerful and most affectionate she make sunshine all the day god 's gift be worthy of the giver it be in the early day of 1849 that a gift of another kind be receive by he which could not fail to gratify he this be a decoration the nichan iftikar or order of glory present to he by the sultan of turkey the first and only decoration which the sultan of the ottoman empire have confer upon a citizen of the united state it be a beautiful specimen of the jeweller 's art the monogram of the sultan in gold surround by 130 diamond in a graceful design it be accompany by a diploma -lrb- or _ berait _ -rrb- in turkish which be translate read : -- in the name of he sultan abdul hamid khan son of mahmoud khan son of abdul hamid khan -- may he ever be victorious the object of the present sovereign decoration of noble exalted glory of elevated place and of this illustrious world conquer monogram be as follow : the bearer of this imperial monogram of exalted character mr morse a american a man of science and of talent and who be a model of the chief of the nation of the messiah -- may he grade be increase -- have invent a electrical telegraph a specimen of which have be exhibit in my imperial presence and it be proper to patronize knowledge and to express my sense of the value of the attainment of the inventor as well as to distinguish those person who be the inventor of such object as serve to extend and facilitate the relation of mankind i have confer upon he on my exalted part a honorable decoration in diamond and issue also this present diploma as a token of my benevolence for he write in the middle of the moon sefer the fortunate the year of the flight one thousand two hundred and sixty-four in constantinople the well-guarded the person who be instrumental in gain for the inventor this mark of recognition from the sultan be dr jame lawrence smith a young geologist at that time in the employ of the sultan he aid by the reverend c hamlin of the armenian seminary at bebek give a exhibition of the working of the telegraph before the sultan and all the officer of he government and when it be propose to decorate he for he trouble and lucid explanation he modestly and generously disclaim any honor and beg that any such recognition should be give to the inventor himself other decoration and degree be bestow upon the inventor from time to time but these will be summarize in a future chapter i have enlarged upon this one as be the first to be receive from a foreign monarch as he fame increase request of all sort pour in on he and it be amazing to find how courteously he answer even the most fantastic overwhelm as he be by he duty in connection with the attack on he purse and he reputation two of he answer to correspondent be here give as example : -- January 17 1849 gentleman -- i have receive you polite invitation to the printer ' festival in honor of franklin on he birthday the 17th of the present month and regret that my engagement in the city put it out of my power to be present i thank you kindly for the flattering notice you be pleased to take of I in connection with the telegraph and make peculiarly grateful at the present time as come from a class of society with whom be my earliest pleasurable association i may be allow perhaps to say that in my boyhood it be my delight during my vacation to seek my pastime in the operation of the printing-office i solicit of my father to take the correct proof of he geography to the printing-office and there through the day for week i make myself practically acquaint with all the operation of the printer at 9 year of age i compile a small volume of story call it the ` youth 's friend ' and then set it up lock the matter in its form prepare the paper and work it off go through the entire process till it be ready for the binder i think i have some claim therefore to belong to the fraternity the other letter be in answer to one from a certain solomon andrew president of the inventor ' institute of perth amboy who be make experiment in aviation and i shall give but a few extract : -- i know by experience the language of the world in regard to a untried invention he who will accomplish anything useful and new must steel himself against the sneer of the ignorant and often against the unimaginative sophistry of the learn in regard to the subject on which you desire a opinion i will say that the idea of navigate the air have be a favorite one with the inventive in all age it be naturally suggest by the flight of a bird i have watch for hour together in early life in my walk across the bridge from boston to charlestown the motion of the sea-gull often have i attempt to unravel the mystery of they motion so as to bring the principle of it to bear upon this very subject but i never experiment upon it many ingenious man however have experiment on air navigation and have so far succeed as to travel in the air many mile but always with the current of wind in they favor by _ navigate _ the atmosphere be mean something more than drop down with the tide in a boat without sail or oar or other means of propulsion bird not only rise in the air but they can also propel themselves against the ordinary current a study then of the condition that enable a bird thus to defy the ordinary current of the atmosphere seem to furnish the most likely mode of solve the problem whilst a bird fly whilst i see a mass of matter overcome by its structure and a power within it the natural force of gravitation and a current of air i dare not say that air navigation be absurd or impossible i consider the difficulty to be overcome be the combine of strength with lightness in the machine sufficient to allow of the exercise of a force without the machine from a source of power within a difficulty will occur in the right adaptation of propeller and should this difficulty be overcome the risk of derangement of the machinery from the necessary lightness of its part would be great and consequently the risk to life would be greater than in any other mode of travel from a wreck at sea or on shore a man may be rescue with he life and so by the run off the track by the railroad car the majority of passenger will be save but from a fall some thousand or only hundred of foot through the air not one would escape death i have no time to add more than my best wish for the success of those who be struggle with these difficulty these observation make nearly sixty-five year ago be most pertinent to present-day condition when the conquest of the air have be accomplish and along the very line suggest by morse but at what a terrible cost in human life that the inventor harass on all side by pirate unscrupulous man and false friend should in spite of he christian philosophy have suffer from occasional fit of despondency be but natural and he must have give vent to he feeling in a letter to he true friend and able business agent mr kendall for the latter thus strive to hearten he in a letter of April 20 1849 : -- you say ` mr morse and elizabeth be both sit by I ' how be it possible in the midst of so much that be charming and lovely that you _ could _ sink into the gloomy spirit which you letter indicate can there be a paradise without devil in it -- blue devil i mean and how be it that now instead of address themselves first to the woman they march boldly up to the man faith in we maker be a most important christian virtue but man have no right to rely on faith alone until he have exhaust he own power when we have do all we can with pure hand and honest heart then may we rely with confidence on the aid of he who govern world and atom control when he choose the will of man restrain he passion and make he bad design subservient to the best of end now for a short application of a short sermon we must do we best to have the deposition and affidavit prepare and forward in due time this do we may have _ faith _ that we will gain we cause or if with we utmost exertion we fail in we preparation we shall be warrant in have faith that no harm will come of it but if like the jew in the maccabee we rely upon the lord to fight we battle without lift a weapon in we defense or like the wagoner in the fable we content ourselves with call on hercule we shall find in the end that ` faith without work be dead ' the world as you say be ' _ the world _ ' -- a quarrel vicious fighting plunder world -- yet it be a very good world for good man why should man torment himself about that which he can not help if we but enjoy the good thing of earth and endure the evil thing with a cheerful resignation bad spirit -- blue devil and all -- will fly from we bosom to they appropriate abode another true and loyal friend be george wood associate with mr kendall in washington from whom be many affectionate and witty letter which it would be a pleasure to reproduce but for the present i shall content myself with extract from one date may 4 1849 : -- it do seem to I that satan have from the jump be at war with this invention of yours at first he strive to cover you up with a fog of egyptian hue then he run you wire through leaden pipe construct by he ` pipe-lay ' agent into the ground and ` all aground ' and when these be hoist up like the brazen serpent on pole for all to gaze at and admire then who so devout a worshipper as the devil in the person of one of he child of darkness who come forward at once to contract for a line reach to st loui -- _ and round the world _ -- upon that principle of the true construction of _ constitution _ and such like _ contract _ first promulgate by that ` old roman ' the ` hero of two war ' and approve by the ` whole hog ' democracy of the ` first republic of the world ' and which like the moral law be summarily comprehend in a few word -- ` the constitution -lrb- or contract -rrb- be what i understand it to be ' now without stop to show you that o'reilly be a true disciple of o'hickory i think you will not question he be a son of satan whose brazen instrument -lrb- one of whom give he first bear the name of morse -rrb- instigate by the gent in black not content with inflict we with the irish potato rot have recently bring over the scotch itch if perhaps by plague job be never call upon to suffer -lrb- for there be no court of equity and chancery in those early day -rrb- the american inventor might be tempt to curse god and die but ah you have such a sweet wife and job 's be such a vinegar cruet it be perhaps hardly necessary to explain that foj smith be nickname fog smith and that the scotch itch refer to the telegraph of alexander bain which for a time be use by the enemy of morse in the effort to break down he patent rights the other allusion be to the politics of the day another good friend and business associate be thomas r walker who in 1849 be mayor of utica new york mr walker 's wife be the half-sister of mr griswold morse 's mother-in-law so there be tie of relationship as well as of friendship between the two man and morse think so highly of mr walker that he make he one of the executor of he will in a letter of July 11 1849 mr walker say : the course pursue by the press be simply mercenary be it otherwise you would receive justice at they hand and you fame and merit would be vindicate instead of be tarnish by the editorial of selfish and ungenerous man but -- _ ` magna est veritas et prevalebit _ ' there be comfort in that at any rate it would seem that not only be the inventor force to uphold he rights through a long series of lawsuit but a great part of the press of the country be hostile to he on the specious plea that they be attempt to overthrow a baleful monopoly in this connection the follow extract from a letter to j fenimore cooper write about this time be peculiarly apt : -- it be not because i have not think of you and you excellent family that i have not long since write to you to know you personal welfare i hear of you often it be true through the papers they praise you as usual for it be praise to have the abuse of such as abuse you in all you libel suit against these degrade wretch i sympathize entirely with you and there be thousand who now thank you in they heart for the moral courage you display in bring these licentious scamp to a knowledge of they duty be assure the good sense the intelligence the right feeling of the community at large be with you the licentiousness of the press need the rebuke which you have give it and it feel it too despite its awkward attempt to brave it out i will say nothing of you ` home as find ' i will use the frankness to say that i wish you have not write it when in paris last i several time pass 59 rue st dominique the gate stand invitingly open and i look in but do not see my old friend although everything else be present i feel as one might suppose another to feel on rise from he grave after a lapse of a century a attack from another and a old quarter be refer to in a letter to he brother sidney of July 10 also another instance of the unfairness of the press : -- dr jackson have the audacity to appear at louisville by _ affidavit _ against I my _ counter-affidavit _ with he original letter contradict _ in toto _ he statement put he _ hor de combat _ mr kendall say he be ` completely use up ' i have get a copy of jackson 's affidavit which i should like to show you there never be a more finished specimen of wholesale lie than be contain in it he be certainly a monomaniac no other conclusion could save he from a indictment for perjury by the frankfort paper send you last week and the extract i now send you you can give a very effective shot to the ` tribune ' it be perhaps worthy of remark that while all the papers in new york be so forward in publish a _ false _ account of o'reilly 's success in the frankfort case not one that i have see have notice the decision just give at louisville _ against _ he in every particular this show the animus of the press towards I nor have they take any pain to correct the false account give of the previous decision although no longer president of the national academy of design have refuse reëlection in 1845 in order to devote he whole time to the telegraph morse still take a deep interest in its welfare and he counsel be seek by its active member on October 13 1849 mr charle c ingham send he a long letter detail the trial and triumph of the institution from which i shall quote a few sentence : ` lang syne ' when you fight the good fight for the cause of art you prospects in life be not brighter than they be now and in bodily and mental vigor you be just the same therefore do not at this most critical moment desert the cause it be the same and we enemy be the same old insolent quack and impostor who wish to make a footstool of the profession on which to stand and show themselves to the public now with this prospect before you rouse up a little of you old enthusiasm put you shoulder to the wheel and place the only school of art on all this side of the world on a firm foundation unfortunately the answer to this letter be not in my possession but we may be sure that it come from the heart while it must have express the writer 's deep regret that the multiplicity of he other care would prevent he from undertake what would have be to he a labor of love although alfred vail have sever he active connection with the telegraph he and he brother george still own stock in the various line and morse do all in he power to safeguard and further they interest they on they part be always zealous in champion the rights of the inventor as the follow letter from george vail date December 19 1849 will show : -- enclose i hand you a paragraph cut from the ` newark daily ' of 17th inst it be evidently draw out by a letter which i address to the editor some month ago state that i could not see what consistency there be in he course that while he be assume the championship of american manufacture ingenuity enterprise etc etc he be at the same time hold up a english inventor to praise while he hold all the better claim of morse in the dark -- allude to he bespatter mr bain and o'reilly with compliment at we expense etc i would now suggest that if you be willing we give _ mr daily _ a temperate article on the rise and progress of telegraph assert claim for yourself and as i must father the article give the vail and new jersey all the ` sodder ' they be entitle to and a little more if you can spare it will you write something adapt to the case and forward it to I as early as possible that it may go in on the heel of this paragraph enclose foj smith continue to embarrass and thwart the other proprietor by he various wild scheme for self-aggrandizement as mr kendall say in a letter of August 4 : there be much _ fog _ in smith 's letter but it be nothing else and on December 4 he write in a more serious vein : mr smith peremptorily refuse a arbitration which shall embrace a separation of all we interest and i think it inexpedient to have any other he be so utterly unprincipled and selfish that we can expect nothing but renew imposition as long as we have any connection with he he ask I to make a proposition to buy or sell which i have delay do because i know that nothing good can come of it but i have inform he that i will consider any proposition he may make if not too absurd to deserve it i do not expect any that we can accede to without sacrifice to this worse than patent pirate which i be not prepare to make mr kendall then conclude that the only recourse will be to the law but morse always averse to war and prefer to exhaust every effort to bring about a amicable adjustment of difficulty send the follow courteous letter to smith on December 8 which however fail of the desire result : -- i deeply regret to learn from my agent mr kendall that a unpleasant collision be likely to take place between you interest in the telegraph and the rest of you coproprietor in the patent i have hope that a amicable arbitrament might arrange all we mutual interest to we mutual advantage and satisfaction but i learn that he proposition to that effect have be reject by you you must be aware that the rest of you coproprietor have be great sufferer in they property for some time past from the frequent disagreement between they agent and yourself and that for the sake of peace they have endure much and long it be impossible for I to say where the fault lie for from the very fact that i put my affair into the hand of a agent to manage for I it be evident i can not have that minute full and clear view of the matter at issue between he and yourself that he have or under other circumstance that i might have but this i can see that mutual disadvantage must be the consequence of litigation between we and this we both ought to be desirous to avoid between fair-minded man i can not see why there should be a difference or at least such a difference as can not be adjust by uninterested party choose to settle it by each of the disagree party i write this in the hope that on second thought you will meet my agent mr kendall in the mode of arbitration propose i have repeatedly advise my agent to refrain from extreme measure until none other be leave we and if such be now deem by he necessary to secure a large amount of we property hazard by perpetual delay while i shall most sincerely regret the necessity there be interest which i be bind to protect connect with the secure possession of what be rightfully mine which will compel I to oppose no further obstacle to he proceed to obtain my due in such

the result of the various lawsuit it must be bear in mind that these drag along for year and that the final decision of the supreme court be not hand down until January 30 1854 during all this time the inventor be keep in suspense as to the final outcome and often the future look very dark indeed and he be hard press to provide for the present on march 5 1850 he write to a friend who have request a loan of a few hundred dollar : -- it truly pain I to be oblige to tell you of my inability to make you a loan however small in amount or amply secure in the present embarrassed state of my affair consequent upon these never-ending and vexatious suit i know not how soon all my property may be take from I the newspaper among they other innumerable falsehood circulate one in regard to my ` enormous wealth ' the object be obvious it be to destroy any feeling of sympathy in the public mind from the gross robbery commit upon I ` he be rich enough he can afford to give something to the public from he extortionate monopoly ' etc etc now no man like to proclaim he poverty for there be a sort of satisfaction to some mind in be esteem rich even if they be not the evil of this be that from a rich man more be expect in the way of pecuniary favor -lrb- and justly too -rrb- and consequently application of all kind be daily i might say for the last few month almost hourly make to I and the fabled wealth attribute to I or to croesus would not suffice to satisfy the request make and after state that of the 11607 mile of telegraph at that time in operation only one company of 509 mile be then pay a dividend he add : if this fail i have nothing on this i solely depend for i have now no profession and at my age with impaired eyesight i can not resume it i have indeed a farm out of which a farmer might obtain he living but to I it be a source of expense and i have not actually though you may think it strange the means to make my family comfortable in a letter to mr kendall of January 4 1851 he enlarge on this subject : -- i have be take in sail for some time past to prepare for the storm which have so long continue and still threaten destruction but with every economy my family must suffer for the want of many comfort which the low state of my means prevent I from procure i contrived to get through the last month without incur debt but i see no prospect now of be able to do so the present month i wish much to know and indeed it be indispensably necessary i should be inform of the precise condition of thing for if my property be but nominal in the stock of the company and be to be soon render valueless from the operation of pirate i desire to know it that i may sell my home and seek another of less pretension one of humbler character and suit to my change of circumstance it will indeed be like cut off a right hand to leave my country home but if i can not retain it without incur debt it must go and before debt be incur and not after i have make it a rule from my childhood to live always within my means to have no debt for if there be a terror which would unman I more than any other in this world it be the sight of a man to whom i owe money however inconsiderable in amount without my be in a condition to pay he on this point i be nervously sensitive to a degree which some might think ridiculous but so it be and i can not help it please tell I how matter stand in relation to fog i wish nothing short of entire separation from that unprincipled man if it can possibly be accomplishedus can suffer he fraud upon myself with comparative forbearance but my indignation boil when i be make _ nolen volen _ a _ particep criminis _ in he fraud on other i will not endure it if i must suffer the loss of all the property i hold in the world the beloved country place be not sacrifice and a way out of all he difficulty be find but he faith and christian forbearance be severely test before he path be smooth among all he trial none be so hard to bear as the conduct of foj smith whose strange tergiversation be almost inconceivable like the old man of the sea he could not be shake off much as morse and he partner desire to part company with he forever the proposition make by he be so absurd that they could not for a moment be seriously consider and the reasonable term submit by mr kendall be unconditionally reject by he it will be necessary to refer to he and he strange conduct from time to time but to go into the matter in detail would consume too much valuable space it seem only right however to emphasize the fact that he animosity and unscrupulous self-seeking constitute the greatest cross which morse be call upon to bear even to the end of he life and that many of the aspersion which have be cast upon the inventor 's fame and good name before and after he death can be trace to the fertile brain of this same foj smith while the inventor be fight for he rights in he own country he invention by the sheer force of its superiority be gradually displace all other system abroad even in england it be supersede the cooke and wheatstone needle telegraph and on the continent it have be adopt by prussium austrium bavarium hanover and turkey it be worthy of note that that broad-minded scientist professor steinheil of bavarium who have himself invent a ingenious plan of telegraph when he be make acquaint with the morse system at once acknowledge its superiority and urge its adoption by the bavarian government in france too it be make its way and morse in answer to a letter of inquiry as to term etc by m brequet thus characteristically avow he motive after finish the business part of the letter which be date April 21 1851 : -- to be frank with you my dear sir -lrb- and i feel that i can be frank with you -rrb- while i be not indifferent to the pecuniary reward of my invention -lrb- which will be amply satisfactory if my own countryman will but do I justice -rrb- yet as these be not the stimulus to my effort in perfect and establish my invention so they now hold but a subordinate position when i attempt to comprehend the full result of the telegraph upon the welfare of my fellow man i be more solicitous to see its benefit extend world-wide during my lifetime than to turn the stream of wealth which it be generate to million of person into my own pocket a few drop from the sea which may not be miss will suffice for I in the early day of 1852 death take from he one of he dearest friend and the follow letter write in February 1852 to rufus griswold esq express he sentiment : -- i sincerely regret that circumstance over which i have no control prevent my participation in the service commemorative of the character literary and moral of my lament friend the late jame fenimore cooper esq i can scarcely yet realize that he be no longer with we for the announcement of he death come upon I most unexpectedly the pleasure of year of close intimacy with mr cooper be never for a moment cloud by the slightest coolness we be in daily i can truly say almost hourly intercourse in the year 1831 in paris i never meet with a more sincere warm-hearted constant friend no man come nearer to the ideal i have form of a truly high-minded man if he be at time severe or caustic in he remark on other it be when excite by the exhibition of the little art of little mind he own frank open generous nature instinctively recoil from contact with they he liberality obedient to he generous sympathy be scarcely bound by prudence he be always ready to help a friend and many such there be who will learn of he departure with the most poignant sorrow although unable to be with you i trust the committee will not overlook I when they be collect the fund for the monument to he genius it might have be say of morse too that he liberality be scarcely bound by prudence for he give away or lose through investment urge upon he by man whom he regard as friend but who be actuate by selfish motive much more than he retain he give largely to the various religious organization and charity in which he be interested and it be characteristic of he that he could not wait until he have the actual cash in hand but even while he own future be uncertain he make donation of large block of stock which while of problematical value while the litigation be proceed eventually rise to much above par while he strive to keep he charity secret they be bruit abroad much to he sorrow for although at the time he be hard press to make both end meet they create a false impression of great wealth and the importunity increase in volume it be always interesting to note the genesis of familiar word and the follow be write in pencil by morse on a little slip of paper : -- _ telegram _ be first propose by the albany ` evening journal ' April 6 1852 and have be universally adopt as a legitimate word into the english language on April 21 1852 mr kendall report a mysterious occurrence : -- we case in the supreme court will very certainly be reach by the middle of next week a most singular incident have occur the papers bring up from the court below not enter in the record be on a table in the clerk 's room there be no fire in the room one of the clerk after dark light a lamp look up some papers blow out the lamp and lock the door some time afterwards wish to obtain a book he enter the room without a light and get the book in the dark in the morning we papers be burn up and _ nothing else _ the papers burn be all the drawing all the book file dana 's lecture chester 's pamphlet you sketchbook -lrb- if the original be there -rrb- you tag of type etc etc but we shall replace they as far as possible and go on with the case _ be _ you original sketch-book there if so have any copy be take the original sketch-book be in this collection of papers so mysteriously destroy but most fortunately a certify copy have be make and this be now in the national museum in washington also most fortunately this effort on the part of some enemy to undermine the foundation of the case prove abortive if indeed it be not a boomerang for as we have see the decision of the supreme court be in morse 's favor in the year 1852 commodore perry sail on he memorable trip to japan which as be well know open that wonderful country to the outside world and start it on its upward path towards its present powerful position among the nation the following letter from commodore perry date July 22 1852 will therefore be find of unusual interest : -- i shall take with I on my cruise to the east india specimen of the most remarkable invention of the age among which stand preëminent you telegraph and i write a line by lieutenant budd unite state navy not only to introduce he to you acquaintance but to ask as a particular favor that you would give he some information and instruction as to the most practicable means of exhibit the telegraph as well as a daguerreotype apparatus which i be also authorize to purchase also other article connect with draw i have direct lieutenant budd to visit poughkeepsie in order to confer with you he will have list furnish by mr norton and a daguerreotype artist which i shall not act upon until i learn the result of he consultation with you i hope you will pardon this intrusion upon you time i feel almost assure however that you will take a lively interest in have you wonderful invention exhibit to a people so little known to the world and there be no one better qualify than yourself to instruct lieutenant budd in the duty i have entrust to he charge and who will fully explain to you the object i have in view i leave this evening for washington and should be much oblige if you would address I a line to that place most truly and respectfully yours mc perry it be about this time that the testimony of professor joseph henry be be increasingly use by morse 's opponent to discredit he in the scientific world and to injure he cause in the court i shall therefore revert for a moment to the matter for the purpose of emphasize morse 's reluctance to do or say anything against he erstwhile friend in a letter to hj raymond editor of the new york time he request space in that journal for a fair exposition of he side of the controversy in reply to a article attack he to this mr raymond courteously reply on November 22 1852 : the column of the ` time ' be entirely at you service for the purpose you mention or indeed for almost any other the writer of the article you allude to be dr bettner of philadelphium morse answer on November 30 : -- i regret finding you absent i wish to have have a few moment ' conversation with you in relation to the allusion i make to professor henry if possible i wish to avoid any course which might weaken the influence for good of such a man as henry i will forbear exposure to the last moment and in view of my duty as a christian at least i will give he a opportunity to explain to I in private if he refuse then i shall feel it my duty to show how unfairly he have conduct himself in allow he testimony to be use to my detriment i write in haste and will merely add that to consummate these view i shall for the present delay the article i have request you to insert in you column and allow the various misrepresentation to remain yet a little longer unexposed at the same time thank you cordially for you courteous accordance of my request a slight set-back be encounter by morse and he associate at this time by the denial of a injunction against foj smith and in a letter to mr kendall of December 4 the long-suffering inventor exclaim : -- foj crow at the top of he voice and i learn that he and he man Friday foss have a regular spree in consequence and that the latter be notice in broadway drunk and boisterously huzzae for foj and cursing I and my telegraph i read in my bible : ` the triumph of the wicked be short ' this may have a practical application in this case at any rate i have full confidence in that power that for wise purpose allow wickedness temporarily to triumph that he own design of bring good out of evil may be the more apparent another of morse 's fix principle in life be refer to in a letter to judge e fitch smith of February 4 1858 : yours of the 31st ulto be this moment receive you request have give I some trouble of spirit on this account to wit : my father lose a large property the earnings of he whole life of literary labor by simply endorse my mother be ever after so affect by this fact that it be the constant theme of she disapprobation and on she deathbed i give she my promise in accordance with she request that _ i never would endorse a note _ i have never do such a thing and of course have never request the endorsement of another i can not therefore in that mode accommodate you but i can probably aid you as effectually in another way it will not be necessary to dwell at length on further happening in the year 1853 order be gradually emerge from chaos in the various line of telegraph which under the wise guidance of amo kendall be tend towards a consolidation into one great company the decision of the supreme court have not yet be give cause temporary embarrassment to the patentee by allow the pirate to continue they depredation unchecked foj smith continue to give trouble to quote from a letter of morse 's to mr kendall of January 10 1853 : the good book say that ` one sinner destroyeth much good ' and foj being -lrb- as will be admit by all perhaps except himself -rrb- a sinner of that class bent upon destroy as much good as he can i be desirous even at much sacrifice -lrb- a desire of course _ inter no _ -rrb- to get rid of controversy with he further on in this letter refer to another cause for anxiety he say : law be expensive and we must look it in the face and expect to pay roundly for it it be a delicate task to dispute a professional man 's charge and though it may be a evil to find ourselves bleed so freely by lawyer it be perhaps the least of evil to submit to it as gracefully as we can but while he could not escape the common lot of man in have to bear many and severe trial there be compensatory blessing which he appreciate to the full he home life be happy and in the main serene he farm be a source of never-ending pleasure to he he be honor at home and abroad by those whose opinion he most value and he be almost daily in receipt of the news of the extension of the morse system throughout the world even from far-off australium come the news of he triumph a letter be send to he write from melbourne on December 3 1853 by a mr samuel mcgowan to a friend in new york which contain the follow gratifying intelligence : -- since the date of my last to you matter with I have undergo a material change i have come off conqueror in my hard fight battle the contract have be award to I in the face of the representative of messr wheatstone and cooke brett and other telegraphic luminary much to they chagrin as i afterwards ascertain several of they it appear have be league together in order as they state to thwart a speculate yankee however matter be not so ordain and i be as well satisfied i hope they will all live to be the same in spite of he financial difficulty cause by bad management of some of the line in which he be interested he could not resist the temptation to give liberally where he heart incline he and in a letter of January 9 1854 to president woolsey of yale he say : -- enclose therefore you have my check for one thousand dollar which please hand to the treasurer of the college as my subscription towards the fund which be be raise for the benefit of my dearly love _ alma mater _ i wish i could make it a larger sum and without promise what i may do at some future time yet i will say that the prosperity of yale college be so near my heart that should my affair -lrb- now embarrass by litigation in self-defence yet undecided -rrb- assume a more prosperous aspect i have it in mind to add something more to the sum now send the year 1854 be memorable in the history of the telegraph because of two important event -- the decision of the supreme court in morse 's favor already refer to and the extension of he patent for another period of seven year the first establish for all time he legal right to be call the inventor of the telegraph and the second enable he to reap some adequate reward for he year of privation of struggle and of heroic faith it be for a long time doubtful whether he application for a extension of he patent would be grant and much of he time in the early part of 1854 be consume in put in proper form all the datum necessary to substantiate he claim and in visit washington to urge the justice of a extension from that city he write often to he wife in poughkeepsie and i shall quote from some of these letter _ February 17 _ i be at the national hotel which be now quite crowded but i have a endurable room with furniture hardly endurable for it be hard to find in this hotel at least a table or a bureau that can stand on its four proper leg rock and teter like a gold-digger 's washing-pan unless the lame leg be prop up with a old shoe or a stray newspaper fifty time fold or a magazine of due thickness -lrb- i be use ` harper 's magazine ' at this moment which be somewhat a desecration as it be too good to be trample under foot even the foot of a table -rrb- or a coal cinder or a towel well it be but for a moment and so let it pass where do you think i be last evening read the invitation on the enclosed card which although forbid to be _ transferable _ may without breach of honor be transfer to my other and better half i feel no inclination to go but as no refusal would be accept i put on my best and at nine o'clock in company with mr and mr shaffner -lrb- the latter of whom by the by be quite a pleasant and pretty woman with a boy one year older than arthur and about as mischievous -rrb- and mr and mr john kendall i go to the lady ' parlor and be present to the lady six in number who do the honor -lrb- if that be the expression -rrb- of the evening there be a great crowd i think not less than three hundred people and from all part of the country -- senator and they wife member of the house and they wife and daughter and there be a great number of fine look man and woman i be constantly introduce to a great many who uniformly shower they compliment on you _ modest _ husband the card of invitation have be lose but it be perhaps to a president 's reception and the great crowd of three hundred would not tax the energy of the president 's aide at the present day the next letter be write in a more serious vein : -- _ February 26 _ i be very busily engage in the preparation of my papers for a extension of my patent this object be of vital importance to I it be in fact the moment to reap the harvest of so many year of labor and expense and toil and neglect would lose I the fruit of all foj smith be here the same ugly fiendlike dog-in-the-manger be he have ever be the ` thorn in the flesh ' which i pray to be able to support by the sufficient grace promise it be difficult to know how to feel and act towards such a man so unprincipled so vengeful so bent on injury yet the command to bless those that curse to pray for those who despitefully use we and persecute we to love we enemy to forgive we enemy be in full force and i feel more anxious to comply with this injunction of we bless savior than to have the thorn remove however strongly this latter must be desire _ march 4 _ you have little idea of the trouble and expense to which i be put in this ` extension ' matter i shall have to pay hundred of dollar more before i get through here besides be harass in all sort of way from now till the 20th of June next if i get my extension then i may expect some respite or at least opposition in another shape i hope eventually to derive some benefit from the late decision but the reckless and desperate character of my opponent may defeat all the good i expect from it such be the reward i have purchase for myself by my invention mr wood be here also he be the same firm consistent and indefatigable friend as ever i know not what i should do in the present crisis without he i could not possibly put my account into proper shape without he aid and he exert himself for I as strongly as if i be he brother mr kendall have be ill almost all the time that i have be here which have cause I much delay and consumption of time it be not until the latter part of June that the extension of he patent be grant and he good friend allude to in the precede letter mr george wood tell in a letter of June 21st something of the narrow escape it have : -- you patent extension be another instance of god 's wonder work providence towards you as express in the history of this great discovery of that history of all the various shape and incident you may never know not have be on the spot to watch all its moment of peril and the way in which like many a good christian it be ` scarcely save ' in this you must see god 's hand in give you a man of remarkable skill energy talent and power as you agent i refer to ph watson to whom mainly and mostly i think this extension be due god work by means and though he design to do this for you he select the proper person and give he the skill perseverance and power to accomplish this result i hope now you have get it you will make it do for you all it can accomplish pecuniarily but as for the money i do not think so much as i do the effect of this upon you reputation this be the apex of the pyramid and mr watson in a letter of June 20 say : we have many difficulty to contend with even to-day for at one time the commissioner intend to withhold he decision for reason which i shall explain at length when we meet it seem to give the commissioner much pleasure to think that in extend the patent he be do a act of justice to you as a great public benefactor and a somewhat unfortunate man of genius dr gale and myself have to assure he that the extension would legally inure to you benefit and not to that of you agent and associate before he could reconcile it with he duty to the public to grant the extension morse himself in a letter to mr kendall also of June 20 thus characteristically express himself : -- a memorable day i never have my anxiety so try as in this case of extension and after week of suspense this suspense be prolong to the last moment of endurance i have just return with the intelligence from the telegraph office from mr watson -- ` patent extend all right ' well what be now to be do i be for take time by the forelock and place ourselves above the contingency of the next expiration of the patent while keep we vantage ground with the pirate i wish to meet they in a spirit of compromise and of magnanimity i hope we may now be able to consolidate on advantageous term it appear that at this time he be advise by many of he friend include dr gale to sever he business connection with mr kendall both on account of the increase feebleness of that gentleman and because while admittedly the soul of honor mr kendall have keep they joint account in a very careless and slipshod manner thereby cause considerable financial loss to the inventor but true to he friend as he always be he reply to dr gale on June 30 : -- let I thank you specially personally for you solicitude for my interest this i may say without disparagement to mr kendall that be the contract with a agent to be make anew i might desire to have a younger and more healthy man and better acquaint with regular book-keeping but i could not desire a more upright and more honorable man if he have commit error -lrb- as who have not -rrb- they have be of the head and not of the heart i have have many year experience of he conduct think i have see he under strong temptation to do injustice with prospects of personal benefit and with little chance of detection and yet firmly resist among the calumny which be spread broadcast both during the life of the inventor and after he death even down to the present day be the accusation of great ingratitude towards those who have help he in he early struggle and especially towards alfr vail the more the true history of he connection with he associate be study the more baseless do these accusation appear and in this connection the follow extract from letter to alfred vail and to he brother george be most illuminating the first letter be date July 15 1854 : -- the legal title to my patent for the american electro-magnetic telegraph of June 20th 1840 be by the late extension of say patent for seven year from the say date now vest in I alone but i have intend that the pecuniary interest which be guarantee to you in my invention as it exist in 1838 and in my patent of 1840 should still inure to you benefit -lrb- yet in a different shape -rrb- under the second patent and the late extension of the first for the simplification of my business transaction i prefer to let the article of agreement which expire on the 20th June 1854 remain cancel and not to renew they retain in my sole possession the _ legal title _ but i hereby guarantee to you two sixteenth of such sum as may be pay over to I in the sale of patent rights after the proportionate deduction of such necessary expense as may be require in the business of the agency for conduct the sale of say patent rights subject also to the term of you agreement with mr kendall mr kendall inform I that no assignment of a interest in my second patent -lrb- the patent of 1846 -rrb- be ever make to you this be news to I i presume it be do and that the assignment be duly record at the patent office the examination of the record in the progress of obtain my extension have doubtless lead to the discovery of the omission after go over much the same ground in the letter to george vail also of July 15th he give as one of the reason why the new arrangement be better : the annoyance of smith be at a end so far as the necessity of consult he be concerned and then he add : -- i presume it can be no matter of regret with alfr that by the position he now take strengthen we defensive position against the annoyance of smith he can receive _ more pecuniarily _ than he could before please consult with mr kendall on the form of any agreement by which you and alfr may be properly secure in the pecuniary benefit which you would have be he to stand in the same legal relation to the patent that he do before the expiration of its original term so as to give I the position in regard to smith that i must take in self-defense and i shall cheerfully accede to it poor alfred i regret to know torment himself needlessly i have hope that i be sufficiently know to he to have he confidence i have never have other than kind feeling towards he and while plan for he benefit and guard he interest at great and almost ruinous expense to myself i have have to contend with difficulty which he imprudence arise from morbid suspicion have often create my wish have ever be to act towards he not merely justly but generously in a letter to mr kendall of July 17 1854 morse declare he intention of publishing that defense which he have hold in reserve for several year hope that the necessity for its publication might be avoid by a personal understanding with professor henry which however that gentleman refuse : -- you will perceive what injury i have suffer from the machination of the sordid pirate against whom i have have to contend and it will also be notice how history have be falsify in order to detract from I and how the conduct of henry on he deposition have tend to strengthen the ready prejudice of the english against the american claim to priority a increase necessity on this account arise for my ` defense ' and so soon as i can get it into proper shape by revision i intend to publish it this i consider a duty i owe the country more than myself for so far as i be personally concerned i be conscious of a position that history will give I when the fact now suppress by interested pirate and they abettor shall be know which the verdict of posterity no less than that of the judicial tribunal already give be sure to award while involve in apparently endless litigation which necessitate much correspondence and while the compilation and revision of he defense must have consume not only day but week and month he yet find time to write a prodigious number of letter and newspaper article on other subject especially on those relate to religion and politics although more tolerant as he grow older he be still bitterly oppose to the method of the roman catholic church and to the jesuit in particular he in common with many other prominent man of he day be fearful lest the church of rome through she emissary the jesuit should gain political ascendancy in this country and overthrow the liberty of the people he take part in a long and heated newspaper controversy with bishop spaulding of kentucky concern the authenticity of a say attribute to lafayette -- if ever the liberty of the united state be destroy it will be by romish priest it be claim by the roman catholic that this statement of lafayette 's be ingeniously extract from a sentence in a letter of he to a friend in which he assure this friend that such a fear be groundless morse follow the matter up with the patience and keenness of a detective and prove that no such letter have ever be write by lafayette that it be a clumsy forgery but that he really have make use of the sentiment quote above not only to morse himself but to other of the greatest credibility who be still live in the field of politics he come near play a more active part than that of a mere looker-on and humble voter for in the fall of 1854 he be nominate for congress on the democratic ticket it would be difficult and perhaps invidious to attempt to state exactly he political faith in those heated year which precede the civil war in the light of future event he and he brother and many other prominent man of the day be on the wrong side he deprecate the war and do he best to prevent it sectional division be abhorrent to he but on the question of slavery he sympathy be rather with the south for i find among he papers the following : -- my creed on the subject of slavery be short slavery _ per se _ be not sin it be a social condition ordain from the beginning of the world for the wisest purpose benevolent and disciplinary by divine wisdom the mere holding of slave therefore be a condition have _ per se _ nothing of moral character in it any more than the be a parent or employer or ruler but be moral or unmoral as the duty of the relation of master parent employer or ruler be rightly use or abuse the subject in a national view belong not therefore to the department of moral and be transfer to that of politics to be politically regulate the accident of the relation of master and slave like the accident of other social relation be to be praise or condemn as such individually and in accordance with the circumstance of every case and whether adjudge good or bad do not affect the character of the relation itself on the subject of foreign immigration he be most outspoken and reply to a enquiry of one of he political friend concern he attitude towards the so-called know nothing he say : -- so far as i can gather from the public papers the object of this society would seem to be to resist the aggression of foreign influence and its insidious and dangerous assault upon all that american hold dear politically and religiously it appear to be to prevent injury to the republic from the ill-timed and i may say unbecoming tampering with the law and habit and deeply sacred sentiment of american by those whose position alike dictate by modesty and safety to they as well as to we be that of minor in training for american not european liberty i have not at this late day to make up a opinion on this subject my sentiment ` on the danger to the free institution of the united state from foreign immigration ' be the same now that i have ever entertain and these same have be promulgate from maine to louisiana for more than twenty year this subject involve question which in my estimation make all other insignificant in the comparison for they affect all other to the disturbing influence of foreign action in we midst upon the political and religious question of the day may be attribute in a great degree the present disorganization in all part of the land so far as the society you speak of be act against this great evil it of course meet with my hearty concurrence i be content to stand on the platform in this regard occupy by washington in he warning against foreign influence by lafayette in he personal conversation and instruction to I and by jefferson in he condemnation of the encouragement give even in he day to foreign immigration if this society have ulterior object of which i know nothing of these i can be expect to speak only when i know something as he opinion on important matter political and religious appear in the course of he correspondence i shall make note of they it be more than probable that as he differ radically from he father and the other federalist on the question of man and measure during the war of 1812 so i should have take other ground than he have i be bear and old enough to have opinion in the stir _ ante-bellum _ day of the fifty and yet as hindsight make we vision clearer than foresight it be impossible to say definitely what we opinion would have be under other condition and there can at any rate be no question of the absolute sincerity of the man who from he youth up have place the welfare of he beloved country above every other consideration except he duty to he god it would take a keen student of the political history of this country to determine how far the opinion and activity of those who be in opposition on question of such prime importance as slavery secession and unrestricted immigration serve as a wholesome check on the radical view of those who finally gain the ascendancy the aftermath of two of these question be still with we for the negro question be by no mean a problem solve and the subject of proper restriction on foreign immigration be just now occupy the attention of we solon that morse should make enemy on account of the outspoken stand he take on all these question be to be expect but i shall not attempt to sit in judgment but shall simply give he view as they appear in he correspondence at any rate he be not call upon to state and maintain he opinion in the hall of congress for in a letter of November 10 1854 to a friend he say at the end : i come near be in congress at the late election but have _ not quite vote enough _ which be the usual cause of failure on

and a perusal of the voluminous correspondence between morse and kendall and other connect with the different line leave the reader in a state of confused bewilderment and wonder that all the conflict interest and plot and counterplot could ever have be bring into even seem harmony too much praise can not be give to mr kendall for the patience and skill with which he disentangle this apparently hopeless snarl while at the same time battle against physical ill which would have cause most man to give up in despair that morse fully appreciate the sterling quality of this faithful friend be evidence by the letter to dr gale in the precede chapter and by many other he always refuse to consider for a moment the substitution of a younger man on the plea of mr kendall 's fail health and he carelessness in the keep of they personal account it be true that because of this laxity on mr kendall 's part morse be for a long time deprive of the full income to which he be entitle but he never hold this up against he friend always make excuse for he affair seem to have be go from bad to worse in the matter of dividend for while in 1850 he have say that only 509 mile out of 1150 be pay he personally anything he say in a letter to mr kendall of January 8 1855 : -- i perceive the magnetic telegraph company meet in washington on Thursday the 11th please inform I by telegraph the amount of dividend they declare and the time payable this be the only source on which i can calculate for the means of subsistence from day to day with any degree of certainty it be a singular reflection that occur frequently to my mind that out of 40000 mile of telegraph all of which should pay I something only 225 mile be all that i can depend upon with certainty and the case be a little aggravate when i think that throughout all europe which be now mesh with telegraph wire from the southern point of corsica to st petersburg on which my telegraph be universally use not a mile contribute to my support or have pay I a farthing well it be all well i be not in absolute want for i have some credit and painful as be the state of debt to I from the apprehension that creditor may suffer from my delay in pay they yet i hope on mr kendall be not so sensitive on the subject of debt as be morse and he be also much more optimistic and often rebuke he friend for he gloomy anticipation assure he that the cloud be not nearly so dark as they appear always imbue with a spirit of lofty patriotism morse never fail even in the midst of overwhelming care to give voice to warning which he consider necessary reply to a invitation to be present at a public dinner he write : -- gentleman -- i have receive you polite invitation to join with you in the celebration of the birthday of washington although unable to be present in person i shall still be with you in heart every year indeed every day be demonstrate the necessity of we be wide awake to the insidious sap of we institution by foreign emissary in the guise of friend who take advantage of the very liberality and unparalleled national generosity which we have extend to they be undermine the foundation of we political fabric substitute -lrb- as far as they be able to effect they purpose -rrb- on the one hand a dark cold and heartless atheism or on the other a disgusting puerile degrading superstition in place of the god of we father and the glorious elevate religion of love preach by he son the american mind i trust be now in earnest wake up and no one more rejoice at the sign of the time than myself twenty year ago i hope to have see it awake but alas it prove to be but a spasmodic yawn preparatory to another nap if it shall now have wake in earnest and with renew strength shall gird itself to the battle which be assuredly before it i shall feel not a little in the spirit of good old simeon -- now let thy servant depart in peace for mine eye have see thy salvation go forward my friend in you patriotic work and may god bless you in you labor with eminent success it have be show i think in the course of this work that morse while long-suffering and patient under trial and affliction be by no means poor-spirited but could fight and use forceful language when rouse by act of injustice towards himself he country or he sense of right nothing make he more righteously angry than dishonesty in whatever form it be manifest and the follow incident be characteristic on June 26 1855 mr kendall forward a letter which he have receive from a certain milton s latham member of congress from california make a proposition to purchase the morse patent rights for line in californium in this letter occur the following sentence : for the use of professor morse 's patent for the state of californium in perpetuity with the reservation name in yours of the 3d march 1855 address to I they be willing to give you $ 30000 in they stock this be all they will do it be proper i should state that the capital stock of the californium state telegraph in cash be $ 75000 which they raise to $ 150000 and subsequently to $ 300000 the surplus stock over the cash stock be use among member of the legislature to procure the passage of the act incorporate the company and secure for it certain privilege mr kendall in he letter enclose this naïve business proposition remark : it be a impressive commentary on the principle which govern business in californium that this company double they stock to bribe member of the state legislature and be now willing to add but ten per cent to be relieve from the position of patent pirate and place henceforth on a honest footing morse more impulsively exclaim in he reply : -- be it possible that there be man who hold up they head in civilized society who can unblushingly take the position which the so-called californium state telegraph company have deliberately take accept the proposition yes i will accept it when i can consent to the housebreaker who have enter my house pack up my silver and plate ware and then coolly say to I -- ` allow I to take what i have pack up and i will select out that which be worthless and give it to you after i have use it for a few year provide any of it remain ' a more unprincipled set of swindler never exist who be this mr latham that he could recommend we accept such term in addition to the opposition of open enemy and unprincipled pirate morse and kendall be sometimes hamper by the unjust suspicion of some of those whose interest they be strive to safeguard refer to one such case in a letter of June 15 1855 mr kendall say : -- if there should be opposition i count on the vail against I alfr have for some time be hostile because i could not if i would and would not if i could find he a snug sinecure in some of the company i fear george have in some degree give way to the same spirit i have hear of he complain of I and when before my departure for the west i tender my service to negotiate a connection of himself and brother with the lessee of the no & o line he decline my offer protest against the entire arrangement touch that line have do all i could and much more than i be bind to do for the benefit of those gentleman i shall not permit they jealousy to disturb I but i be anxious to have they understand the exact position i be to occupy in relation to they i understand you purpose to be that they should share in the benefit of the extension whether legally entitle to they or not yet nothing have be pay over to they for sale since make all the receipt except a portion of my commission have be pay out on account of expense and to secure a interest for you in the no & o line it be easy to understand that the vail should have be somewhat suspicious when little or nothing in the way of cash be come in to they but they seem not to have realize that morse and kendall be in the same boat and live more on hope than cash mr kendall enlarge somewhat on this point in a letter of June 22 1855 : -- most heartily will i concur in a sale of all my interest in the telegraph at any reasonable rate to such a company as you describe i fully appreciate you reason for desire such a consummation and in addition to they have other peculiar to my own position any one who have a valuable patent can profit by it only by a constant fight with some of the most profligate and at the same time most shrewd member of society i have find myself not only the agent of yourself and the messr vail to sell you patent rights but the soldier to fight you battle as well in the country as in the court of justice almost single-handed with the deadly enmity of one of the patentee and the annoying jealousy of another i have encounter surround host and i trust be instrumental in save something for the proprietor of this great invention and do something to maintain the rights and vindicate the fame of its true author nothing but you generous confidence have render my position tolerable and enable I to meet the countless difficulty with which my path have be beset with any degree of success and now at the end of a ten year ' war i be prepare to retire from the field and leave the future to other hand if i can but see you interest secure beyond contingency and a moderate competency provide for my family and myself the company refer to in this letter be one propose by cyrus w field and other capitalist of new york the plan be to purchase the patent rights of morse kendall vail and foj smith and by means of the large capital which would be at they command fight the pirate who have infringe on the patent and gradually unite the different war company into one harmonious concern a monopoly if you will but a monopoly which have for its object better cheaper and quicker service to the people this object be achieve in time but unfortunately for the peace of mind of morse and kendall not just then the name of cyrus field naturally suggest the atlantic cable and it be just at this time that step be be seriously take to realize the prophecy make by morse in 1843 in he letter to the secretary of the treasury : the practical inference from this law be that a telegraphic communication on the electro-magnetic plan may with certainty be establish across the atlantic ocean startling as this may now seem i be confident the time will come when this project will be realize in 1852 a company have be form and incorporate by the legislature of newfoundland call the newfoundland electric telegraph company the object of this company be to connect the island by means of a cable with the mainland but this be not accomplish at that time and no suggestion be make of the possibility of cross the ocean one of the officer of that company however mr fn gisborne come to new york in 1854 and try to revive the interest of capitalist and engineer in the scheme among other he consult matthew d field and through he meet he brother cyrus w field and the question of a through line from newfoundland to new york be seriously discuss cyrus field a man of great energy and already interested financially and otherwise in the terrestrial telegraph be fascinate by the idea of stretch long line under the water also he examine a globe which be in he study at home and suddenly realize that newfoundland and ireland be comparatively near neighbor he say to himself : why not cross the ocean and connect the new world with the old he have hear that morse long ago have prophesy that this link would some day be weld and he become possess with the idea that he be the person to accomplish this marvel just as morse have receive the inspiration of the telegraph in 1832 a letter to morse who be just then in washington receive a enthusiastic and encouraging reply couple with the information that lieutenant maury of the navy have by a series of careful sounding establish the existence of a plateau between ireland and newfoundland at no very great depth which seem expressly design by nature to receive and carefully guard a telegraphic cable mr field lose no time in organize a company compose originally of himself he brother the honorable david dudley field peter cooper mose taylor marshall o robert and chandler white after a liberal charter have be secure from the legislature of newfoundland the follow name be add to the list of incorporator : sfb morse robert w lowber wilson g hunt and john w brett mr field then go to england and with characteristic energy soon enlist the interest and capital of influential man and the atlantic telegraph company be organize to cooperate with the american company and liberal pledge of assistance from the british government be secure similar pledge be obtain from the congress of the united state but quite in line with former precedent by a majority of only _ one _ in the senate morse be appoint electrician of the american company and faraday of the english company and much technical correspondence follow between these two eminent scientist in the spring of 1855 morse in a letter to he friend and relative by marriage thoma r walker of utica write enthusiastically of the future : we _ atlantic line _ be in a fair way we have the government and capitalist of europe zealously and warmly engage to carry it through _ three year _ will not pass before a _ submarine telegraph communication will be have with europe _ and i do not despair of sit in my office and by a touch of the telegraph-key ask a question simultaneously to person in london pari cairo calcutta and canton and get the answer from all of they in _ five minute _ after the question be ask do this seem strange i presume if i have even suggest the think some twenty year ago i might have have a quiet residence in a big building in you vicinity the first part of this prophecy be actually realize for in 1858 just three year after the date of this letter communication be establish between the two continent and be maintain for twenty day then it suddenly and mysteriously cease and not till 1866 be the indomitable perseverance of cyrus field crown with permanent success more of the detail of this stupendous undertaking will be tell in the proper chronological order but before leave the letter to mr walker just quote from i wish to note that when morse speak of sit in he office and communicate by a touch of the key with the outside world he refer to the fact that the telegraph company with which he be connect have obligingly run a short line from the main line -lrb- which at that time be erect along the highway from new york to albany -rrb- into he office at locust grove poughkeepsie so that he be literally in touch with every place of any importance in the united state always solicitous for the welfare of mankind in general he say in a letter to norvin green in July 1855 after discuss the propose cable : the effect of the telegraph on the interest of the world political social and commercial have as yet scarcely begin to be apprehend even by the most speculative mind i trust that one of its effect will be to bind man to he fellow-man in such bond of amity as to put a end to war i think i can predict this effect as in a not distant future alas in this he do not prove himself a true prophet although it must be concede that many war have be avert or shorten by means of the telegraph and there be some who hope that a warless age be even now be conceive in the womb of time on July 18 1855 he write to he good friend dr gale : i have no time to add as every moment be need to prepare for my newfoundland expedition to be present at lay down the first submarine cable _ of any considerable length _ on this side the water although the first for telegraph purpose you well remember we lay between castle garden and governor 's island in 1842 on the 7th of August morse with he wife and they eldest son a lad of six join a large company of friend on board the steamer jame adger which sail for newfoundland there they be to meet the sarah l bryant from england with the cable which be to be lay across the gulf of st lawrence the main object of the trip be a failure like so many of the first attempt in telegraphic communication for a terrific storm compel they to cut the cable and postpone the attempt which however be successfully accomplish the next year the party seem to have have a delightful time otherwise for they be fêted wherever they stop notably at halifax nova scotium and st john newfoundland at the latter place a return banquet be give on board the jame adger and the toastmaster in call on morse for a speech recite the follow line : -- the steed call lightning -lrb- say the fate -rrb- be tame in the united state ' t be franklin 's hand that catch the horse ' t be harness by professor morse to turn again for a moment to the darker side of the picture of those day it must be keep in mind that annoying litigation be almost constant and in the latter part of 1855 a decision have be render in favor of foj smith who insist on share in the benefit of the extension of the patent although instead of do anything to deserve it he have do all in he power to thwart the other patentee comment on this in a letter to mr kendall of November 22 1855 morse pathetically and yet philosophically say : -- be there any mode of arrangement with smith by which matter in partnership can be conduct with any degree of harmony i wish he to have he legal rights in full however unjustly award to he i must suffer for my ignorance of legal technicality mortify as this be it be better perhaps to suffer it with a good grace and even with cheerfulness if possible rather than endure the wear and tear of the spirit which a brooding over the gross fraud occasion a opportunity of set ourselves right in regard to he may be not far off in the future till then let we stifle at least all outward expression of disgust or indignation at the legal swindle and with the keen sense of justice which always actuate he he add in a postscript : by the by if judge curti 's decision hold good in regard to smith 's _ inchoate _ right do it not equally hold good in regard to vail and be he not entitle to a proportionate right in the extension during the early month of 1856 the financial affair of the inventor have so far be straighten out that he feel at liberty to leave the country for a few month ' visit to europe the object of this trip be threefold he wish as electrician of the cable company to try some experiment over long line with certain english scientist with a view to determine beyond peradventure the practicability of a ocean telegraph he also wish to visit the different country on the continent where he telegraph be be use to see whether they government could not be induce to make he some pecuniary return for the use of he invention last but not least he feel that he have earn a short vacation from the hard work and the many trial to which he have be subject for so many year and a trip abroad with he wife who have never be out of she own country offer the best means of relaxation and enjoyment on the 7th of June 1856 he sail from new york on the baltic accompany by he wife and he niece louisa daughter of he brother richard the trip prove a delightful one in every way he be acclaimed as one of the most note man of he day wherever he go and emperor king and scientist vie with each other in shower attention upon he he letter contain minute description of many of he experience and i shall quote liberally from they to cyrus field he write on July 6 of the result of some of he experiment with dr whitehouse : -- i intend to have write you long before this and have you receive my letter previous to you departure from home but every moment of my time have be occupy as you can well conceive since my arrival i have especially be occupy in experiment with dr whitehouse of the utmost importance they result except in a general way i be not at present at liberty to divulge besides they be not as yet by any means complete so as to assure commercial man that they may enter upon the great project of unite europe to america with a certainty of success and then after dwelling upon the importance of dr whitehouse 's service and express the wish that he should be liberally reward for he labor he continue : -- i can say on this subject generally that the experiment dr whitehouse have make favorably affect the project so far as its _ practicability _ be concerned but to certainly assure its _ practicality _ further experiment be essential to enable dr whitehouse to make these and that he may derive the benefit of they i conceive it to be a wise outlay to furnish he with adequate means for he purpose i wish i have time to give you in detail the kind reception i have everywhere meet with to mr statham and he family in a special manner be we indebted for the most indefatigable and constant attention be we relative they could not have be more assiduous in do everything to make we stay in london agreeable to mr brett also i be under great obligation he have manifest -lrb- as have indeed all the gentleman connect with the telegraph here -rrb- the utmost liberality and the most ample concession to the excellence of my telegraphic system i have be assure now from the _ highest source _ that my system be not only the most practical for general use but that it be fast become the _ world 's telegraph _ he brother sidney be at this time also in europe with he wife and some other member of he family and the brother occasionally meet in they wanderings to and fro finley write to sidney from fenton 's hotel london on July 1 : -- yours from edinburgh of the 28th ulto be just receive i regret we do not see you when you call the evening before you leave london we all wish to see you and all yours before we separate so widely apart but you know in what a whirl one be keep on a first arrival in london and can make allowance for any seeming neglect from morning till night we have be overwhelm with call and the kindest and most flattering attention on the day before you call i dine at greenwich with a party invite by mr brett represent the great telegraph interest of europe and indium i be most flatteringly receive and mr brett in the only toast give give my name as the inventor of the telegraph and of the system which have spread over the whole world and be supersede all other dr o'shaughnessy who sit opposite to I make some remark warmly second mr brett and state that he have come from indium where he have construct more than four thousand mile of telegraph that he have try many system upon he line and that a few day before i arrive he have report in he official capacity as the director of the east indium line to the east indium company that my system be the best and recommend to they its adoption which i be tell will undoubtedly be the case this be a unexpected triumph to I since i have hear from one of we passenger in the baltic that in the east indy they be reluctant to give any credit to america for the telegraph claim it exclusively for wheatstone it be therefore a surprise to I to hear from the gentleman who control all the eastern line so warm and even enthusiastic acknowledgment of the superiority of mine but i have a additional cause for gratitude for a acknowledgment from a quarter whence i least expect any favor to my system mr cooke formerly associate with wheatstone tell one of the gentleman who inform I of it that he have just recommend to the british government the substitution of my system for they present system and have no doubt he recommendation would be entertain he also say that he have hear i be about to visit europe and that he should take the earliest opportunity to pay he respects to I under these circumstance i call and leave my card on mr cooke and i have now a note from he state he shall call on I on Thursday thus the way seem to be make for the adoption of my telegraph throughout _ the whole world _ i visit one of the office with dr whitehouse and mr brett where -lrb- in the city -rrb- i find my instrument in full activity send and receive message from and to paris and vienna and other place on the continent i ask if all the line on the continent be now use my system that i have understand that some of the line in france be still work by another system the answer be -- ` no _ all the line on the continent _ be now _ morse line _ ' you will undoubtedly be please to learn these fact while he be thus be wine and dine and praise by those who be interested in he scientific achievement he hark back for a few hour to memory of he student day in london for he old friend and room-mate charle r leslie now a prosperous and successful painter give he a cordial invitation to visit he at petworth near london morse joyfully accept and several happy hour be spend by the two old friend as they wander through the beautiful grounds of the earl of egremont where leslie be then make study for the background of a picture the next letter to he brother sidney be date copenhagen July 19 : -- here we be in copenhagen where we arrive yesterday morning have travel from hamburg to kiel and thence by steamboat to corsoer all night and thence by railroad here much fatigued owing to the miserable _ dis_commodations on board the boat i have deliver my letter here and be await they effect expect call and i therefore improve a few moment to apprise you of we whereabouts in paris i be most courteously receive by the count de vouchy now at the head of the telegraph of france who with many compliment tell I that my system be the one in universal use the simplest and the best and desire I to visit the room in the great building where i should find my instrument at work sure enough i go into the telegraph room where some twenty of my own child -lrb- beautifully make -rrb- be chat and chatter as in american office i could not but think of the contrast in that same building even as late as 1845 when the clumsy semaphore be still in use and but a single line of electric wire a experimental one to rouen be in existence in france when we leave paris we take a courier william carter a englishman whom thus far we find to be everything we could wish active vigilant intelligent honest and oblige as soon as he learn who i be he make diligent use of he information and wherever i travel it be along the line of the telegraph the telegraph post seem to be post to present arm -lrb- shall i say -rrb- as i pass and the line of conductor be constantly stoop and curtsy to I at all the station the official receive I with marked respect everywhere the same remark meet I -- ` you system sir be the only one recognize here it be the best we have try other but have settle down upon yours as the best ' but yesterday in travel from corsoer to copenhagen the chief director of the railroad tell I upon my ask if the telegraph be yet in operation in denmark that it be and be in process of construction along this road ` at first ' say he ` in use the needle system we find it so difficult to have employee skilled in its operation that we be about to abandon the idea but now have adopt yours we find no difficulty and be construct telegraph on all we road ' at all the custom-house and in all the railroad depot i find my name a passport my luggage be pass with only the form of a examination and although i have take second-class ticket for my party of four yet the inspector put we into first-class carriage and give order to the conductor to put no one in with we without we permission i can not enumerate all the attention we have receive at hamburg we be delighted not only with its splendor and cleanliness but have make know to mr lind -lrb- widow of edward 's brother henry -rrb- that we be in hamburg we receive the most hearty welcome pass the day at she house and ride out in the environs at dinner a few friend be invite to meet we mr overman a distant connection of the lind be very anxious for I to stay a few day hint that if i would consent the authority and dignitary of hamburg would show I some mark of respect for my name be well know to they i be oblige to decline as i be anxious to be in st petersburg before the emperor be engage in he coronation preparation while in denmark morse be grant a private interview with the king at he castle of frederiksborg whither he be accompany by captain raasloff : -- after a few minute the captain be call into the presence of the king and in a few minute more i be request to go into the audience-chamber and be introduce by the captain to frederick vii king of denmark the king receive I standing and very courteously he be a man of middle stature thick-set and resemble more in the feature of he face the bust and picture of christian iv than those of any of he predecessor judge as i do from the numerous bust and portrait of the king of denmark which adorn the city palace and the castle of frederiksborg the king express he pleasure at see the inventor of the telegraph and regret he could not speak english as he wish to ask I many question he thank I he say for the beautiful instrument i have send he tell I that a telegraph line be now in progress from the castle to he royal residence in copenhagen that when it be complete he have decide on use my instrument which i have give he in he own private apartment he then speak of the invention as a most wonderful achievement and wish I to inform he how i come to invent it i accordingly in a few word give he the early history of it to which he listen most attentively and thank I express himself highly gratify after a few minute more of conversation of the same character the king shake I warmly by the hand and we take we leave we arrive in the afternoon at copenhagen mr f call in she carriage we drive to the thorwaldsen museum or depository where be all the work of this great man this collection of the greatest sculptor since the best period of greek art be attractive enough in itself to call traveller of taste to copenhagen after spend some hour in thorwaldsen 's museum i go to see the study of oerst where he most important discovery of the _ deflection of the needle _ by a galvanic current be make which lay the foundation of the science of electro-magnetism and without which my invention could not have be make it be now a draw school i sit at the table where he make he discovery we go to the porcelain manufactory and singularly enough meet there the daughter of oerst to whom i have the pleasure of a introduction oerst be a most amiable man and universally beloved the daughter be say to resemble she father in she feature and i trace a resemblance to he in the small porcelain bust which i come to the manufactory to purchase _ st petersburg August 8 1856 _ up to this date we have be in one constant round of visit to the truly wonderful object of curiosity in this magnificent city i have see as you know most of the great and marvellous city of europe but i can truly say none of they can at all compare in splendor and beauty to st petersburg it be a city of palace and palace of the most gorgeous character the display of wealth in the palace and church be so great that the simple truth tell about they would incur to the narrator the suspicion of romance england boast of she regalia in the tower she crown jewel she kohinoor diamond etc i can assure you that they fade into insignificance as a rush-light before the sun when bring before the wealth in jewel and gold see here in such profusion what think you of nosegay as large as those we young lady take to party compose entirely of diamond ruby emerald sapphire and other precious stone choose to represent accurately the color of various flower -- the imperial crown globular in shape compose of diamond and contain in the center of the greek cross which surmount it a unwrought ruby at least two inch in diameter the sceptre have a diamond very nearly as large as the kohinoor at the arsenal at tsarskoye selo we see the trappings of a horse bridle saddle and all the harness with a immense saddle-cloth set with ten of thousand of diamond on those part of the harness where we have rosette or knob or buckle be rosette of diamond a inch and a half to two inch in diameter with a diamond in the center as large as the first joint of you thumb or say three quarter of a inch in diameter other trappings be as rich indeed there seem to be no end to the diamond all the church be decorate in the most costly manner with diamond and pearl and precious stone the following account of he reception by the czar be write in pencil : on the paper find in my room in peterhoff it differ somewhat from the letter write to he child and introduce by mr prime in he book but be to my mind rather more interesting _ August 14 1856

appoint the hour of 130 this day to see I at he palace at peterhoff i accordingly wait upon we minister to know the etiquette to be observe on such a occasion it be necessary he say to be at the boat

he party journey to berlin what be to he the most interesting incident of he visit to that city be thus describe : -- _ August 23 _ to-day i go to potsdam to see baron humboldt and have a delightful interview with this wonderful man although i have meet with he at the soirées of baron gerard the distinguished painter in pari in 1822 and afterward at the academy of science when my telegraph be exhibit to the assemble academician in 1838 i take letter of introduction to he from baron gerolt the prussian minister but they be unnecessary for the moment i enter he room which be in the royal palace he call I by name and greet I most kindly say as i present my letter : ` oh sir you need no letter you name be a sufficient introduction ' and so seat myself he rapidly touch upon various topic relate to america on the margin of a photograph of himself present to morse by the baron be a inscription in french of which the follow be a translation : -- to mr sfb morse whose philosophic and useful labor have render he name illustrious in two world the homage of the high and affectionate esteem of alexander humboldt potsdam August 1856 the next thirty day be spend in show the beauty of cologne aix-la-chapelle brussels and pari to he wife and niece and in the latter part of September the little party return to london here morse resume he experiment with dr whitehouse and mr bright and on October 3 he report to mr field : -- as the electrician of the new york newfoundland and london telegraph company it be with the highest gratification that i have to apprise you of the result of we experiment of this morning upon a single continuous conductor of more than two thousand mile in extent a distance you will perceive sufficient to cross the atlantic ocean from newfoundland to ireland the admirable arrangement make at the magnetic telegraph office in old broad street for connect ten subterranean gutta-percha insulate conductor of over two hundred mile each so as to give one continuous length of more than two thousand mile during the hour of the night when the telegraph be not commercially employ furnished we the means of conclusively settle by actual experiment the question of the practicability as well as the practicality of telegraph through we propose atlantic cable i be most happy to inform you that as a crowning result of a long series of experimental investigation and inductive reasoning upon this subject the experiment under the direction of dr whitehouse and mr bright which i witness this morning -- in which the induction-coil and receiving-magnet as modify by these gentleman be make to actuate one of my recording instrument -- have most satisfactorily resolve all doubt of the practicability as well as practicality of operate the telegraph from newfoundland to ireland in 1838 morse have be curtly and almost insultingly refuse a patent for he invention in england a humiliation for which he never quite forgive the english now eighteen year after this mortifying experience the most eminent scientist of this same england vie with each other in do he honor thus be he scientific fame vindicate but let it be remark parenthetically this kind of honor be all that he ever receive from the land of he ancestor while other nation of europe unite two year later in grant he a pecuniary gratuity and while some of they sovereign bestow upon he decoration or medal england do neither however it be always a source of the keenest gratification that two of those who have invent rival telegraph prove themselves broad-minded and liberal enough to acknowledge the superiority of he system and to urge its adoption by they respective government the first of these be dr steinheil of munich to whom i have already refer and to whom be due the valuable discovery that the earth can be use as a return circuit the second be the englishman wf cooke who with wheatstone devise the needle telegraph on October 9 a banquet be tender to morse by the telegraph company of england it be give at the albion tavern mr cooke preside and introduce the guest of the evening in the follow charming speech : -- i be consult only a few month ago on the subject of a telegraph for a country in which no telegraph at present exist i recommend the system of professor morse i believe that system to be one of the simplest in the world and in that lie its permanency and certainty -lrb- cheer -rrb- there be other which may be as good in other circumstance but for a wide country i hesitate not to say professor morse 's be the best adapt it be a great thing to say and i do so after twenty year ' experience that professor morse 's system be one of the simplest that ever have be and i think ever will be conceive -lrb- cheer -rrb- it be a great thing for I after have be so long connect with the electric telegraph to be invite to preside at this interesting meeting and i have travel upward of one hundred mile in order to be present to-day have when ask to preside reply by electric telegraph ' i will ' -lrb- cheer -rrb- but i may lower you idea of the sacrifice i make in so do when i tell you that i know the talent of professor morse and be only too glad to accept a invitation to do honor to a man i really honor in my heart -lrb- cheer -rrb- i have be think during the last few day on what professor morse have do he stand alone in america as the originator and carrier out of a grand conception we know that america be a enormous country and we know the value of the telegraph but i think we have a right to quarrel with professor morse for not be content with give the benefit of it to he own country but that he extend it to canada and newfoundland and even beyond that he system have be adopt all over europe -lrb- cheer -rrb- -- and the nuisance be that we in england be oblige to communicate by means of he system -lrb- cheer and laughter -rrb- i as a director of a electric telegraph company however should be ashamed of myself if i do not acknowledge what we owe he but he threaten to go further still and promise that if we do not he will carry out a communication between england and newfoundland across the atlantic i be nearly pledge to pay he a visit on the other side of the atlantic to see what he be about and if he persevere in he obstinate attempt to reach england i believe i must join he in he endeavor -lrb- cheer -rrb- to think that he have unite all the stripe and star of america which be increase day by day -- and i hope they will increase until they be too numerous to mention -- that he have extend he system to canada and be about to unite those portion of the world to europe be a glorious thing for any man and although i have do something in the same cause myself i confess i almost envy professor morse for have force from a unwilling rival a willing acknowledgment of he service -lrb- cheer -rrb- i be proud to see professor morse this side of the water i beg to give you ` the health of professor morse ' and may he long live to enjoy the high reputation he have attain throughout the world soon after this with these flattering word still ring in he ear he and he party sail for new york and once arrive at home the truth of the trite say that a prophet be not without honor save in he own country be soon to be bring to he attention while he have be fêted and honor abroad while he have every reason to believe that he petition to the european government for some pecuniary compensation would in time be grant he return to be plunge anew into vexatious litigation intrigue and attack upon he purse he fame and he good name on November 27 1856 he refer to he greatest cross in a letter to mr kendall : -- i have just return from boston have accomplish the important duty for which i alone go there to wit to say ` yes ' before a gentleman have we commissioner after he name instead of ` yes ' before one who have only s commissioner after he name and this at a cost of exactly twenty dollar or if the one dollar throw away in new york upon the s commissioner be add twenty-one dollar and three day of time to say nothing of sundry risk of accident by land and water travel well if it will lead to a thorough separation of all interest and all intercourse with foj i shall not consider the time and money lose yet in conversation with mr curti i have little hope of a change in judge curti 's view of the point in which he decide that smith have a inchoate right and we only chance of success be in the reversal of that decision by the supreme bench and that after another year 's suspense i wish there be some way of stop this harass paralyze litigation i find my mind wholly unfit for the study which the present state of the telegraph require from I be distract and irritated by the constant necessity for stand on the defensive smith will be smith i know and therefore as he be the appoint thorn to keep a proper ballast of humility in sfbm with he load of honor why be it so if i can only have the proper strength and disposition to use the trial aright write I some encouraging news if you can how will the present calm in political affair affect we californium matter the calm to which he refer be the apparent one which have settle down on the country after the election of buchanan and which as everybody know be but the calm before the storm of we civil war he have this to say about the election in a letter to the honorable john y mason we minister to france : -- i may congratulate you my dear sir on the issue of the late election my prediction have be verify the country be quiet and as usual after the excitement of a election have settle down into orderly acquiescence to the will of the majority and into general good feeling european can hardly understand this truly anomalous phase of we american institution they do not understand that it be characteristic that ` we speak dagger but use none ' that we fight with ballot and not with bullet that we have abundance of inkshed and little bloodshed and that all that be explosive be blow off through newspaper safety-valve the event of the next few year be destine to shatter the peaceful vision of this lover of he country for many dagger be draw the bullet fly thick and fast and the bloodshed be appalling it be difficult to follow the history of the telegraph in its relation to its inventor through all the intricacy involve in the conflict interest of various company and man in this its formative period morse himself be often at a loss to determine on the course which he should pursue a course which would at the same time inure to he financial benefit and be in accordance with he high sense of right absolutely straightforward and honest himself it be difficult for he to believe that other who speak he fair be not equally sincere and he be often impose upon and be frequently force in the exigency of business to be intimately associate with those whose idea of right and wrong be far different from he own the one person in whose absolute integrity he have faith be amo kendall and yet he must sometimes have think that he friend be too severe in he judgment of other for i find in a letter of mr kendall 's of January 4 1857 the follow warning : -- i earnestly beseech you to give up all idea of go out again on the cable-laying expedition you true friend do not comprehend how it be that you give you time you labor and you fame to build up a interest deliberately and unscrupulously hostile to all they interest and you own i believe that peter cooper be the only man among they who be sincerely you friend as to field i have as little faith in he as i have in foj smith if you could get cooper to take a stand in favor of the faithful observance of the contract for connection with the ne union line at boston he can put a end to all trouble if at the same time he will refuse to concur in a further extension of they line south in spite of this warning or perhaps because peter cooper succeed in overcome mr kendall 's objection morse do go out on the next cable-laying expedition and yet he find in the end that mr kendall 's suspicion be by no means unjustified but of this in its proper place the united state government have place the steam frigate niagara at the disposal of the cable company and on she morse as the electrician of the american company sail from new york on April 21 1857 arrive in london he be again honor by many attention and entertainment include a dinner at the lord mayor 's the loading of the cable on board the ship designate for that purpose consume necessarily some time and morse take advantage of this delay to visit pari at the suggestion of we minister mr mason in order to confer with the premier count walewskus with regard to the pecuniary indemnity which all agree be due to he from the nation use he invention this conference bear fruit as we shall see later on in a letter to he wife from paris he make this amusing comment on the fashion of the day after remark on the dearth of female beauty in france : -- you must consider I now as speaking of feature only for as to form alas that be under such a total crinoline eclipse that this season of total darkness in fashion 's firmament forbid any speculation on that subject the reign of crinoline amplitude be not only not remove but be more dominant than ever who could have predict that because a heir to the french throne be in expectancy all womankind old and young would so far sympathize with the amiable consort of napoleon iii as to be in appearance at least likely to flood the earth with heir that grave parliament would be in solemn debate upon the press necessity of enlarge the entrance of royal palace in order to meet the exigency of enlarged crinoline that the new carriage be all of increase dimension to accommodate the crinoline but so it be it be the age of crinoline talk no longer of chair they be no longer visible talk no longer of tête-à-têtes two crinoline might get in sight of each other at least by the use of the lorgnette but as for conversation that be out of the question except by speak trumpet by sign and who know but in this age of telegraph crinoline may not follow the world 's fashion and be a patroness of the morse system all the preparation for the great enterprise of the lay of the cable proceed slowly and it be not until the latter part of July that the little fleet sail from liverpool on its way to the cove of cork and then to valencium on the west coast of ireland which be choose as the european terminus of the cable morse write many page of minute detail to he wife and from they i shall select the most important and interesting : -- _ July 28 _ here we be steam we way towards cork harbor with most beautiful weather along the irish coast which be in full view and expect to be in the cove of cork in the morning of to-morrow we leave liverpool yesterday morning as i write you we should and as we pass the ship of war in the harbor we be cheer from the rigging by the tar of the various vessel and the flag of other be dip as a salute all of which be return by we in kind the landing stage and quay of liverpool be densely crowd with people who wave they handkerchief as we slowly sail by they two steamer accompany we down to the bar fill with people and then after mutual cheer and firing of cannon from one of the steamer they return to port we shall be in cork the remainder of the week possibly sail on Saturday go round to valencium and be ready to commence on Monday then if all thing be prosperous we hope to reach newfoundland in twenty day and dear home again the first week in September and yet there may be delay in this great work for it be a vast and new one so do not be impatient if i do not return quite so soon the work must be thoroughly and well do before we leave it _ evening ten o'clock _ we have have a beautiful day and have be go slowly along and expect to be in the cove of cork by daylight in the morning the deck of we ship present a curious appearance just now between the main and mizzen mast be a immense coil of one hundred and thirty mile of the cable the rest be in larger coil below deck abaft the mizzen mast be a ponderous mass of machinery for regulate the pay out of the cable a steam-engine and boiler complete and they have just be test it to see if all be right and it be find right we have the prospect of a fine moon for we expedition i send you the copy of a prayer that have be read in the church i be rejoice at the manner in which the christian community view we enterprise it be calculate to inspire my confidence of success what the first message will be i can not say but if i send it it shall be ` glory to god in the highest on earth peace and good will to man ' ` not unto we not unto we but to thy name be all the glory ' _ July 29 four o'clock afternoon _ on awake this morning at five o'clock with the noise of come to anchor i find myself safely ensconce in one of the most beautiful harbor in the world with queenstown picturesquely rise upon the green hill from the foot of the bay _ August 1 _ when i write the finishing sentence of my last letter i be suffer a little from a slight accident to my leg we be lay out the cable from the two ship the agamemnon and niagara to connect the two half of the cable together to experiment through the whole length of twenty-five hundred mile for the first time in go down the side of the agamemnon i have to cross over several small boat to reach the outer one which be to take I on board the tug which have the connect cable on board in step from one to the other of the small boat the water be very rough and the boat have a good deal of motion i make a misstep my right leg be on board the outer boat and my left leg go down between the two boat scrape the skin from the upper part of the leg near the knee for some two or three inch it pained I a little but not much still i know from experience that however slight and comparatively painless at the time i should be lay up the next day and possibly for several day my warm-hearted generous friend sir william o'shaughnessy be on board and be a surgeon he at once take it in hand and dress it tell susan in good hydropathic style with cold water i feel so little inconvenience from it at the time that i assist throughout the day in lay the cable and operate through it after it be join and have the satisfaction of witness the successful result of pass the electricity through twenty-five hundred mile at the rate of one signal in one and a quarter second since then dr whitehouse have succeed in telegraph a message through it at the rate of a single signal in three quarter of a second if the cable therefore be successfully lay so as to preserve continuity throughout there be no doubt of we be able to telegraph through and at a good commercial speed i have be on my back for two day and be still confine to the ship to-morrow i hope to be well enough to hobble on board the agamemnon and assist in some experiment the accident to he leg be more serious than he at first imagine and condition be not improve by he use he leg more than be prudent _ August 3 eleven o'clock be _ i be still confine most of the time on my back in my berth quite to my annoyance in one respect to wit that i be unable to be on board the agamemnon with dr whitehouse to assist at the experiment yet i have so much to be thankful for that gratitude be the prevail feeling _ seven o'clock _ all the ship be under way from the cove of cork the leopard leave first then the agamemnon then the susquehanna and the niagara last and at this moment we be off the head of kinsale in the follow order : niagara leopard agamemnon susquehanna the cyclops and another vessel the advice leave for valencium on Saturday evening and with a beautiful night before we we hope to be there also by noon to-morrow this day three hundred and sixty-five year ago columbus sail on he first voyage of discovery and discover america _ August 4 _ off the skellig light of which i send you a sketch a beautiful morning with head wind and heavy sea make many seasick we be about fifteen mile from we point of destination we companion ship be out of sight astern except the susquehanna which be behind we only about a mile in a few hour we hope to reach we expectant friend in valencium and to commence the great work in earnest we ship be crowd with engineer and operator and delegate from the government of russium and france and the deck be a bewildering mass of machinery steam-engine cog-wheel break boiler rope of hemp and rope of wire buoy and boy pulley and sheaf of wood and iron cylinder of wood and cylinder of iron meter of all kind -- anemometer thermometer barometer electrometer -- steam-gauges ship ' log -- from the common log to massey 's log and friend 's log to we friend whitehouse 's electro-magnetic log which i think will prove to be the best of all with a modification i have suggest thus freight we expect to disgorge most of we solid cargo before reach mid-ocean i be keep ready to close this at a moment 's warning so give all manner of love to all friend kiss to whom kiss be due i be get almost impatient at the delay we necessarily encounter but we great work must not be neglect i have see enough to know now that the atlantic telegraph be sure to be establish _ for it be practicable _ be it a foreboding of what be to happen that cause he to add : -- _ we may not succeed in we first attempt _ some little neglect or accident may foil we present effort but the present enterprise will result in gathering store of experience which will make the next effort certain not that i do not expect success now but accidental failure now will not be the evidence of its impracticability we principal electrical difficulty be the slowness with which we must manipulate in order to be intelligible twenty word in sixteen minute be now the rate i be confident we can get more after awhile but the atlantic telegraph have its own rate of talk and can not be urge to speak faster any more than any other orator without danger of become unintelligible _ three o'clock pm _ we be in valencium harbor we shall soon come to anchor a pilot who have just come to show we we anchorage ground say : ` there be a power of people ashore ' _ August 8 _ yesterday at half past six pm all be right we commence again pay out the heavy shore-end of which we have about eight mile to be leave on the rocky bottom of the coast to bear the attrition of the wave and to prevent injury to the delicate nerve which it inclose in its iron mail and which be the living principle of the whole work a critical time be approach it be when the end of the massive cable should pass overboard at the point where it join the main and smaller cable i be in my berth by order of the surgeon lest my injured limb which be somewhat inflamed by the excitement of the day and too much walk about should become worse above my head the heavy rumble of the great wheel over which the cable be pass and be be regulate every now and then give a tremendous thump like the discharge of artillery keep I from sleep and i know they be approach the critical point presently it come the machinery stop and soon amid the voice i hear the unwelcome intelligence -- ` the cable be break ' sure enough the smaller cable at this point have part but owe to the prudent precaution of those superintend the end of the great cable have be buoy and the hawser which have be attach secure it the sea be moderate the moonlight give a clear sight of all and in half a hour the joyous sound of ` all right ' be hear the machinery commence a low and regular rumble like the purring of a great cat which have continue from that moment -lrb- midnight -rrb- till the present moment uninterrupted the coil on deck be most beautifully uncoil at the rate of three nautical mile a hour the day be magnificent the land have almost disappear and we companion ship be leisurely sailing with we at equal pace and we be all of course in fine spirit i send you a telegraph dispatch this morning thirty mile out which you will duly receive with other that i shall send if all continue to go on without interruption if you do receive any preserve they with the greatest care for they will be great curiosity _ August 10 _ thus far we have have most delightful weather and everything go on regularly and satisfactorily you be aware we can not stop night nor day in pay out on Saturday we make we calculation that the first great coil which be upon the main deck would be completely pay out and one of we critical movement to wit the change from this coil to the next which be far forward would be make by seven or eight o'clock yesterday morning -lrb- Sunday -rrb- so we be up and watch the last flake of the first coil gradually diminish everything have be well prepare the man be at they post it be a anxious moment lest a kink might occur but as the last round come up the motion of the ship be slightly slacken the man handle the slack cable handsomely and in two minute the change be make with perfect order and the pay out from the second coil be as regularly commence and at this moment continue and at a increase rate to-day of five mile per hour last night however be another critical moment on examine we chart of sounding we find the depth of the ocean gradually increase up to about four hundred fathom and then the chart show a sudden and great increase to seventeen hundred fathom and then a further increase to two thousand and fifty nearly the greatest depth with which we should meet in the whole distance we have therefore to watch the effect of this additional depth upon the strain of the cable at two in the morning the effect show itself in a greater strain and a more rapid tendency to run fast we could check its speed but it be a dangerous process _ too sudden a check would inevitably snap the cable _ too slack a rein would allow of its egress at such a waste rate and at such a violent speed that we should lose too great a portion of the cable and its future stop within controllable limit be almost impossible hence we anxiety all be on the alert we expert engineer apply the brake most judiciously and at the moment i write -- latitude 52 ° 28 ' -- the cable be be lay at the depth of two mile in its ocean bed as regularly and with as much facility as it be in the depth of a few fathom _ six pm _ we have just have a fearful alarm ` stop she stop she ' be reiterate from many voice on deck on go up i perceive the cable have get out of its sheaf and be run out at great speed all be confusion for a few moment mr canning we friend who be the engineer of the newfoundland cable show great presence of mind and to he coolness and skill i think be due the remedy of the evil by rope stopper the cable be at length bring to a standstill and it strain most ominously perspire at every part great tar drop but it hold together long enough to put the cable on the sheaf again _ Tuesday August 11 _ abruptly indeed be i stop in my letter this morning at 345 the cable part and we shall soon be on we way back to england thus end the first attempt to unite the old world with the new by means of a electric nerve authority differ as to who be responsible for the disaster but the cause be prove to be what morse have foresee when he write : too sudden a check would inevitably snap the cable while of course disappointed he be not discourage for under date of August 13 he write : -- we accident will delay the enterprise but will not defeat it i consider it a settle fact from all i have see that it be perfectly practicable it will surely be accomplish there be no insurmountable difficulty that have for a moment appear none that have shake my faith in it in the slightest degree my report to the company as co-electrician will show everything right in that department we get a electric current through till the moment of parting so that electric connection be perfect and yet the farther we pay out the feebler be the current indicate a difficulty which however i do not consider serious while it be of a nature to require attentive investigation _ plymouth August 17 _ here i be still hold by the leg and lie in my berth from which i have not move for six day i suffer but little pain unless i attempt to sit up and the healing process be go on most favorably but slowly i have be here three day and have not yet have a glimpse of the beautiful country that surround we and if we should be order to another port before i can be out i shall have as good a idea of plymouth as i should have at home look at a map while the wounded leg heal slowly the plan of the company move more deliberately still a movement be on foot for the east indium company to purchase what remain of the cable for use in the red sea or the persian gulf so that the atlantic company could start afresh with a entirely new cable and morse hope that this plan might be consummate at a early date so that he could return to america in the niagara but the negotiation halt from day to day and week to week the burden of he letter to he wife be always that a decision be promise by to-morrow and finally he say in desperation : to-day be to-morrow yesterday but to-day have to-day another to-morrow on which day as usual we be to know something but as to-day have not yet go i wait with some anxiety to learn what it be to bring forth he letter be fill with affectionate longing to be at home again and with loving message to all he dear one and at last he be able to say that he wound have completely heal and that he have decide to leave the niagara and sail from liverpool on the arabium on September 19 and in due time he arrive at he beloved home on the hudson while still intensely interested in the great cable enterprise he begin to question the advisability of continue he connection with the man against whom mr kendall have warn he for in a letter to he brother richard of October 15 1857 he say : i intend to withdraw altogether from the atlantic telegraph enterprise as they who be prominent on this side of the water in its interest be use it with all then : effort and influence against my invention and my interest and those of my assignee to whom i feel bind in honor to attach myself even if some of they have be deceive into coalition with the hostile party it be however a great disappointment to he that he be not connect with future attempt to lay the cable he withdrawal be not altogether voluntary in spite of what he say in the letter from which i have just quote while he have be make a honorary director of the company in 1857 although not a stockholder a law be subsequently pass declare that only stockholder could be director even honorary director he have not feel financially able to purchase stock but it be a source of astonishment to he and to other that a few share at least have not be allot to he for he valuable service in connection with the enterprise he have nevertheless cheerfully give of he time and talent in the first attempt although caution by mr kendall he go fully into the whole matter in a very long letter to mr john w brett of December 27 1858 in which he detail he connection with the cable company he regret and surprise at be exclude on the ground of he not be a stockholder especially as on a subsequent visit to europe he find that two other man have be make honorary director although they be not stockholder he say that he learn also that mr field have represent to the director that i be hostile to the company and be use my exertion to defeat the measure for aid from the united state government to the enterprise and that it be in consequence of these misrepresentation that i be not elect he say farther on : i sincerely rejoice in the consummation of the great enterprise although prevent in the way i have show from be present i ought to have be with the cable squadron last summer it be no fault of mine that i be not there i hope mr field can exculpate himself in the eye of the board before the world and before he own conscience in the course he have take on the margin of the letter-press copy of a letter write to mr kendall on December 22 1859 be a note in pencil write evidently at a later date : mr field have since manifest by he conduct a different temper i have long since forgive what after all may have be error of ignorance on he part the fact remain however that he connection with the cable company be sever and that he relation with messr field cooper etc be decidedly strained it be more than possible that have he continue as electrician of the company the second attempt might have be successful for he foresee the difficulty which result in failure and have he be the guide mind it would naturally have be avoid the proof of this be in the follow incident which be relate by a friend of he mr jacob s jewett to mr prime : -- i think it might interest you to know when and how professor morse receive the first tiding of the success of the atlantic cable i accompany he to europe on the steamer fulton which sail from new york July 24 1858 we be near southampton when a sail boat be notice approach and soon we vessel be board by a young man who seek a interview with professor morse and announce to he that a message from america have just be receive the first that have pass along the wire lie upon the bed of the ocean professor morse be of course greatly delighted but turn to I say : ' _ this be very gratifying but it be doubtful whether many more message will be receive _ ' and give as he reason that -- ` the cable have be so long store in a improper place that much of the coating have be destroy and the cable be in other respects injure ' he prediction prove to be true and mr prime add : have he be in the board of direction have he judgment and experience as electrician be employ that great calamity which cost million of money and eight year of delay in the use of the ocean telegraph would in all human probability have be avert but it be idle to speculate on what might have be he letter show that the action of the director amaze and hurt he and that it be with deep regret that he cease to take a active part in the great enterprise the success of which he have be the first to prophesy many other matter claim he attention at this time for as usual upon return from a prolonged absence he find he affair in more or less confusion and he time for some month after he return be spend mainly in straighten they out the winter be spend in new york with he family but business call he to washington he give utterance in a letter to he wife of December 16 to sentiment which will appeal to all who have have to do with the power that be in the government service : -- as yet i have not have the least success in get a proper position for charle a more thankless repulsive business than ask for a situation under government i can not conceive i would myself starve rather than ask such a favor if i be alone concern the mode of obtain even a hearing be such as to drive a man of any sensitiveness to wish himself in the depths of the forest away from the vicinity of man rather than encounter the air of those on they temporary throne of power i can not say what i feel i shall do all i can but anticipate no success i call to see secretary toucey for the purpose of ask he to put I in the way of find some place for charle but after send in my card and wait in the anteroom for half to three fourth of a hour he take no notice of my card just leave he room pass by deliberately the open door of the anteroom without speak to I and leave the building this may be all explain and i will charitably hope there be no intention of rudeness to I but unexplained a ruder slight could not well be conceive the affection of the three morse brother for each other be unusually strong and it be from the unreserved correspondence between finley and sidney that some of the most interesting material for this work have be gather both of these brother possess a keen sense of humor and delighted in playful banter the follow be write in pencil on a odd scrap of paper and have no date : -- when my brother and i be child my father one day take we each on he knee and say : ` now i be go to tell you the character of each of you ' he then tell we the fable of the hare and the tortoise ` now ' say he ` finley ' -lrb- that be I -rrb- ` you be the hare and sidney you brother be the tortoise see if i be not correct in prophesy you future career ' so ever since it have be a topic of banter between sidney and I sometimes sidney seem to be more prosperous than i then he would say ` the old tortoise be ahead ' then i would take a vigorous run and cry out to he ' the hare be ahead ' for i be naturally quick and impulsive and he sluggish and phlegmatic so i be now go to give he the hare ride the tortoise as a piece of fun sidney will say : ` ah you see the hare be oblige to ride on the tortoise in order to get to the goal ' but i shall say : ` yes but the tortoise could not get there unless the hare spur he up and guide he ' both of these brother achieve success but unfortunately for the moral of the old fable the hare quite outdistance the tortoise without however kindle any spark of jealousy in that faithful heart while sidney be still in europe he brother write to he on December 29 1857 : -- i do not know what you must think of I for not have write to you since my return it have not be for want of will but truly from the impossibility of withdraw myself from a unprecedented pressure of more important duty on which to _ write _ so that you could form any clear idea of they would be impossible these duty arise from the state of my affair throw into confusion by the conduct of party intent on control all my property but i be happy to state my affair be in a way of adjustment through the active exertion of my faithful agent and friend mr kendall so far as he decline strength permit i wish you be near I so that we could exchange view on many subject particularly on the one which so largely occupy public attention everywhere i have be collect work pro and con on the slavery question with a view of write upon it we be in perfect accord i think on that subject i believe that you and i would be consider in new england as rank heretic for i confess the more i study the subject the more i feel compel to declare myself on the southern side of the question i care not for the judgment of man however i feel on sure ground while stand on bible doctrine and i have arrive at the conclusion that a fearful hallucination not less absurd than that which becloud some of the most pious and otherwise intelligent mind of the day of salem witchcraft have for a time darken the moral atmosphere of the north the event have seem to prove that it be the southern sympathizer at the north those most pious and otherwise intelligent mind whose moral atmosphere be darken by a fearful hallucination for no one now claim that slavery be a divine institution because the bible say slave obey you master i have state that one of the purpose of morse 's visit to europe in 1856 be to seek to persuade the various government which be use he telegraph to grant he some pecuniary remuneration the idea be receive favorably at the different court and result in a concerted movement initiate by the count walewskus represent france and participate in by ten of the european nation the sitting of this convention or congress be hold in pari from April 1868 to the latter part of August and the result be announce in a letter of count walewskus to morse of September 1 : -- sir -- it be with lively satisfaction that i have the honor to announce to you that a sum of four hundred thousand franc will be remit to you in four annuity in the name of france of austrium of belgium of the netherland of piedmont of russium of the holy see of sweden of tuscany and of turkey as a honorary gratuity and as a reward altogether personal of you useful labor nothing can better mark than this collective act of reward the sentiment of public gratitude which you invention have so justly excite the emperor have already give you a testimonial of he high esteem when he confer upon you more than a year ago the decoration of a chevalier of he order of the legion of honor you will find a new mark of it in the initiative which he majesty wish that he government should take in this conjuncture and the decision that i charge myself to bring to you knowledge be a brilliant proof of the eager and sympathetic adhesion that he proposition have meet with from the state i have just enumerate i pray you to accept on this occasion sir my personal congratulation as well as the assurance of my sentiment of the most distinguished consideration while this letter be date September 1 the amount of the gratuity agree upon seem to have be make know soon after the first meeting of the convention for on April 29 the follow letter be write to morse by m van den broek he agent in all the preliminary lead up to the convention and who by the way be to receive as he commission one third of the amount of the award whatever it might be : i have this morning see the secretary of the minister and from he learn that the sum definitely fix be 400000 franc payable in four year this do not by any means answer we expectation and i be afraid you will be much disappointed yet i use every exertion in my power but without avail to procure a grant of a larger sum it certainly be a pitiful return for the million of dollar which morse 's invention have save or earn for those nation which use it as a government monopoly and while i find no note of complaint in he own letter he friend be more outspoken mr kendall in a letter of may 18 exclaim : i know not how to express my contempt of the meanness of the european government in the award they propose to make you as _ the _ inventor of the telegraph i have set the sum at half a million dollar as the least that they could feel to be at all compatible with they dignity i hope you will acknowledge it more as a tribute to the merit of you invention than as a adequate reward for it and in a letter of June 5 answer one of morse 's which must have contain some expression of gratitude mr kendall say further : in reference to the second subject of you letter i have to say that it be only as a tribute to the superiority of you invention that the european grant can in my opinion be consider either ` generous ' or ` magnanimous ' as a indemnity it be niggardly and mean it will be in place to record here the testimonial of the different nation of europe to the inventor of the telegraph manifest in various form : -- _ france _ a contributor to the honorary gratuity and the decoration of the legion of honor _ prussium _ the scientific gold medal of prussium set in the lid of a gold snuff-box _ austrium _ a contributor to the honorary gratuity and the scientific gold medal of austrium _ russium _ a contributor to the honorary gratuity _ spain _ the cross of knight commander de numero of the

of the danish cross which have to be return at the death of the recipient and one of the medal which mysteriously disappear many year ago be now in the morse case at the national museum in washington have be present to that institution by the child and grandchild of the inventor it should be add that in addition to the honor bestow on he by foreign government he be make a member of the royal academy of science of sweden a member of the institute of france and of the principal scientific society of the united state it have be already note in these page that he _ alma mater _ yale confer on he the degree of lld i have say that i find no note of complaint in morse 's letter whatever he feeling of disappointment may have be he feel it he duty to send the following letter to count walewskus on September 15 1858 perhaps a slight note of irony may be read into the sentence accept the gratuity but if intend i fear it be too feeble to have reach its mark and the letter be as a whole and under the circumstance almost too fulsome conform however to the stilted style of the time : -- on my return to pari from switzerland i have this day receive from the minister of the united state the most gratifying information which you excellency do I the honor to send to I through he respect the decision of the congress of the distinguished diplomatic representative of ten of the August

illegible through the fading of the ink and other have be tear out -lrb- by whom i do not know -rrb- and have entirely disappear it will therefore be necessary to summarize the event of the remainder of the year 1858 and of some of the follow year we find that on July 24 1858 morse sail with he family include he three young boy he mother-in-law and other relative a party of fifteen all tell for havre on the steamer fulton that he be tender a banquet by he fellow-countryman in pari and that he be receive with honor wherever he go travel with a large family be a different proposition from the independence which he have enjoy on he previous visit to europe when he be either alone or accompany only by he wife and niece and he pathetically remark to he brother sidney in a letter of September 3 write from interlaken : it be a great mistake i commit in bring my family i have scarcely have one moment 's pleasure and be almost wear out with anxiety and care if i get back safe with they to paris i hope after arrange my affair there to go as direct as possible to southampton and settle they there till i sail in November i be tire of travel and long for the repose of locust grove if it shall please we heavenly father to permit we to meet there again -lrb- illustration : morse and he youngest son -rrb- before return to the quiet of he home on the hudson however he pay a visit which he have long have in contemplation on November 17 1858 he and he wife and they two younger son sail from southampton for porto rico where he elder daughter mr edward land have for many year live and where he younger daughter have be visit while he be in europe he describe he first impression of a tropical country in a letter to he mother-in-law mr griswold who have decide to spend the winter in geneva to superintend the education of he son arthur a lad of nine : -- in st thoma we receive every possible attention the governor call on we and invite edward and myself to breakfast -lrb- at 1030 o'clock -rrb- the day we leave he live in a fine mansion on one of the lesser hill that enclose the harbor have directly beneath he on the slope and only separate by a wall the residence of santa anna he be invite to be present but he be ill -lrb- so he say -rrb- and excuse himself i presume he illness be occasion by the thought of meet a american from the state for he hold the citizen of the state in perfect hatred so much so as to refuse to receive united state money in change from he servant on they return from market a few day in change of latitude make wonderful change in feeling and clothing when we leave england the air be wintry and thick woolen clothing and fire be necessary the first night at sea blanket be in great demand with two extra and my great-coat over all i be comfortably warm in twenty-four hour the great-coat be dispense with then one blanket then another until a sheet alone begin to be enough and the last two or three night on board this slight covering be too much when we get into the harbor of st thoma the temperature be oppressive we slightest summer clothing be in demand surround by pomegranate tree magnificent oleander cocoa-nut tree with they large fruit some thirty foot from the ground the aloe and innumerable and to I strange tropical plant i could scarcely believe it be December we arrive on Thursday morning and remain until Monday morning edward have engage a long island schooner which happen to be in port to take we to arroyo at four o'clock the governor send he official barge under the charge of the captain of the port a most excellent intelligent scientific gentleman who have breakfast with we at the governor 's in the morning and in a few minute we be row alongside of the schooner estelle and before dark be under way and out of the harbor we quarter be very small and close but not so uncomfortable at daylight in the morning of Tuesday we be sail along the shore of porto rico and at sunrise we find we be in sight of guyama and arroyo and with we glass we see at a distance the building on edward 's estate susan have be advise of we come and a flag be fly on the house in answer to the signal we make from the vessel in two or three hour we get to the shore as near as be safe for the vessel and then in the doctor 's boat which have pay we a official visit to see that we do not bring yellow fever or other infectious disease the kind doctor a irishman educate in america take we ashore at a little temporary landing-place to avoid the surf on the shore there be some handkerchief shake and in a crowd we see susan and leilum and charlie -lrb- he grandson -rrb- who be wait for we in carriage and in a few moment we embrace they all the sun be hot upon we but after a ride of two or three mile we come to the henrietta my dear edward and susan 's residence and be soon under the roof of a spacious elegant and most commodious mansion and here we be with midsummer temperature and vegetation but a tropical vegetation all around we well we always know that edward be a prince of a man but we do not know or rather appreciate that he have a princely estate and in as fine order as any in the island when i say ` fine order ' i do not mean that it be lay out like the bois de boulogne nor be there quite as much picturesqueness in a level plain of sugar cane as in the tree and shrubbery of the garden of versaille but it be a rich and well-cultivated estate of some fourteen hundred acre gradually rise for two or three mile from the sea-shore to the mountain include some of they and stretch into the valley between they he visit to porto rico be a most delightful one to he in many way and i shall have more to say of it further on but i digress for a moment to speak of two event which occur just at this time and which show he that even in this land of _ dolce far niente _ he could not escape the grief and care which be common to all mankind mr kendall in a letter of February 20 announce the death of one of he early associate : i presume you will have hear before this reach you of the death of alfred vail he have sell most of he telegraph stock and tell I when i last see he that it be with difficulty he could procure the means of comfort for he family morse have hear of this melancholy event for in a letter to mr shaffner of February 22 he say : poor vail alas he be go i only hear of the event on Saturday last this death and the death of many friend besides have make I feel sad vail ought to have a proper notice he be a upright man and although some way of he make he unpopular with those with whom he come in contact yet i believe he intention be good and he fault be the result more of ill-health a dyspeptic habit than of he heart he refer to this also in a letter to he brother sidney of February 23 : poor vail be go he be the innocent cause of the original difficulty with the sensitive henry he all the time earnestly desirous of do he honor and on march 30 he answer mr kendall 's letter : i regret to learn that poor vail be so straitened in he circumstance at he death i intend pay a visit to he father and family on my return i may be able to relieve they in some degree this intention he fulfil as we shall see later on and i wish to call special attention to the tone of these letter because as i have say before morse have be accuse of gross ingratitude and injustice towards alfr vail whereas a careful and impartial study of all the circumstance of they connection prove quite the contrary vail 's advocate in loudly claim for he much more than the evidence show he be entitle to have not hesitate to employ gross personal abuse of morse in they newspaper article letter etc even down to the present day this have make my task rather difficult for while earnestly desirous of give every possible credit to vail i have be compel to introduce much evidence which i should have prefer to omit to show the essential weakness of he character he seem to have be foredoom to failure he undoubtedly be of great assistance in the early stage of the invention and for this morse always cheerfully give he full credit but i have prove that he do not invent the dot-and-dash alphabet which have be so insistently claim for he and that he service as a mechanician be soon dispense with in favor of more skilful man i have also show that he practically leave morse to he fate in the darkest year of the struggle to bring the telegraph into public use and that by he morbid suspicion he hamper the effort of mr kendall to harmonize conflict interest for all this morse never bear he any ill-will but endeavor in every way to foster and safeguard he interest that he do not succeed be no fault of he another reminder that he be but human and that he could not expect to sail serenely along on the calm sea of popular favor without a occasional squall be give to he just at this time professor joseph henry have request the regent of the smithsonian institute to enquire into the rights and wrong of the controversy between himself and morse which have its origin in henry 's testimony in the telegraph suit tinge as this testimony be with bitterness on account of the omission in vail 's book and which be fan into a flame by morse 's defense the latter resent the fact that all these proceedings have take place while he be out of the country and without give he a opportunity to present he side of the case however he show he willingness to do what be right in the letter to colonel shaffner of February 22 from which i have already quote : -- well it have take he four year to fire off he gun and perhaps i be kill when i return i shall examine my wound and see if they be mortal and if so shall endeavor to die becomingly seriously however if there be any new fact which go to exculpate henry for he attack upon I before the court at a moment when i be struggle against those who from whatever motive wish to deprive I of my rights and even of my character i shall be most happy to learn they and if i have unwittingly do he injustice shall also be most happy to make proper amends but as all this be for the future as i know of no fact which alter the case and as i be wholly unconscious of have do any injustice i must wait to see what he have put forth in a letter to he brother sidney of February 23 he philosophize as follow : -- i can not avoid notice a singular coincidence of event in my experience of life especially in that part of it devoted to the invention of the telegraph to wit that when any special and marked honor have be confer upon I there have immediately succeed some event of the envious or sordid character seemingly as a set-off the tendency of which have be invariably to prevent any excess of exultation on my part can this be accident be it not rather the wise order of event by infinite wisdom and goodness to draw I away from repose in earthly honor to the more substantial and enduring honor that come only from god i pray for wisdom to direct in such trial and in any answer i may find it necessary to give to henry or other i desire most of all to be mindful of that charity which ` suffereth long which vaunteth not itself be not puff up hopeth all thing thinketh no evil ' this check to self-laudation come at a appropriate moment as he say for just at this time honor be be plentifully shower upon he it be then that he be first notify of the bestowal of the spanish decoration and of the probability of portugal 's follow suit perhaps even more gratify still be he election as a member of the royal academy of science of sweden for this be a recognition of he merit as a scientist and not as a mere promoter as he have be contemptuously call on the island of porto rico too he be be honor and fêted on march 2 he write : -- i have just complete with success the construction and organization of the short telegraph line the first on this island initiate the great enterprise of the southern telegraph route to europe from we shore so far as to interest the porto rican in the value of the invention yesterday be a day of great excitement here for this small place the principal inhabitant of this place and guayama determine to celebrate the completion of this little line in which they take a great pride as be the first in the island and so they compliment I with a public breakfast which be preside over by the lieutenant-colonel commandant of guayama the commandant and alcalde the collector and captain of the port with all the official of the place and the clergy of guayama and arroyo and gentleman planter and merchant of the two town numbering in all about forty be present we sit down at one o'clock to a very handsome breakfast and the greatest enthusiasm and kind and generous feeling be manifest my portrait be behind I upon the wall drape with the spanish and american flag i give they a short address of thanks and take the opportunity to interest they in the great telegraph line which will give they communication with the whole world i presume account will be publish in the united state from the porto rico papers thus step by step -lrb- shall i not rather say _ stride by stride _ -rrb- the telegraph be compass the world my account from madrid assure I that the government will soon have all the papers prepare for grant the concession to mr perry we former secretary of legation at madrid in connection with sir jame carmichael mr john w brett the new york newfoundland and london telegraph company and other the recent consolidation plan in the united state have remove the only hesitation i have in sustain this new enterprise for i fear that i might unwittingly injure by a counter plan those it be my duty to support be now in harmony with the american company and the newfoundland company i presume all my other company will derive benefit rather than injury from the success of this new and grand enterprise at any rate i feel impel to support all plan that manifestly tend to the complete circumvention of the globe and the bring into telegraphic connection all the nation of the earth and this when i be not fully assure that present personal interest may not temporarily suffer i be glad to know that harmonious arrangement be make between the various company in the united state although i have be so ill-used i will have no litigation if i can avoid it even henry may have the field in quiet unless he have present a case too flagrantly unjust to leave unanswered the short line of telegraph be from he son-in-law 's house to he place of business on the bay about two mile and the building of it give rise to the legend on the island that morse conduct some of he first electrical experiment in porto rico which of course be not true there be much correspondence concern the propose cable from spain or portugal by various route to the west indy and thence to the united state but nothing come of it the rest of they stay in porto rico be greatly enjoy by all in spite of certain drawback incidental to the tropics to one of which he allude in a letter to he sister-in-law mr goodrich who be then in europe speaking of he wife he say : she be dreadfully trouble with a plague which if you have be in italy i be sure you be no stranger to ' _ pulci pulci _ ' if you have not have a colony of they settle upon you and quarter and give you no quarter you have be a exception to traveller in italy well i will pit any two _ pulcus _ of porto rico against any ten you can bring from italy and i should be sure to see they bite the dust before the bite of we porto rico breed he letter be fill with apothegm and reflection on life in general and he own in particular and they alone would almost fill a book in a letter to mr kendall of march 30 we find the following : -- i have hope to return from honor abroad to enjoy a little rest from litigation at home but if i must take up arm i hope to be able to use they efficiently in self-defense and in a chivalrous manner as becometh a ' _ knight _ ' i have no reason to complain of my position abroad but i suppose as i be not yet under the ground honor to a living inventor must have they offset in the attack of envy and avarice ` wrath be cruel but who can stand before envy ' say the wise man the contest with the envious be indeed a annoyance but if one 's spirit be under the right guidance and revenge do not actuate the strife victory be very certain my position be now such before the world that i shall use it rather to correct my own temper than to make it a means of arrogant exultation he and he family leave the island in the middle of April 1859 and in due time reach they poughkeepsie home the daily press of that city give the follow account of the homecoming : -- for some time previous to the hour at which the train be to arrive hundred of people be see flock from all direction to the railroad depot both in carriage and on foot and when the train do arrive and the familiar and love form of professor morse be recognize on the platform of the car the air be rent with the cheer of the assemble multitude as soon as the cheer subside professor morse be approach by the committee of reception and welcome to the country of he birth and to the home of he adoption a great procession be then form compose of the carriage of citizen the sidewalk be crowd with people on foot the child of the public school which have be dismiss for the occasion be quite conspicuous among they amid the ringing of bell the wave of flag and the gratulation of the people the procession proceed through a few of the principal street and then drive to the beautiful residence of professor morse the band playing as they enter the grounds ` sweet home ' and then ` auld lang syne ' the gateway at the entrance have be arch with evergreen and wreathe with flower as the carriage contain they loved proprietor drive along the gravelled road we notice that several of the domestic unable to restrain they welcome run to he carriage and give and receive salutation after a free interchange of salutation and a general ` shake-hand ' the people withdraw and leave they honor guest to the retirement of he own beautiful home so the world reverence its great man and so it ought in professor morse we find those simple element of greatness which elevate he infinitely above the hero of any of the world 's sanguinary conflict or any of the most successful aspirant after political power he have benefit not only america and the world but have dignified and benefit the whole race he friend and neighbor desire to honor he still further by a public reception but this he feel oblige to decline and in he letter of regret he express the follow sentiment : if during my late absence abroad i have receive unprecedented honor from european nation convene in special congress for the purpose and have also receive mark of honor from individual sovereign and from scientific body all which have gratify I quite as much for the honor reflect by they upon my country as upon myself there be none of these testimonial be assure which have so strongly touch my heart as this you beautiful tribute of kindly feel from esteemed neighbor and fellow-citizen among the letter which have accumulate during he absence morse find one write some time previously from a mr reibart who have publish he name as a candidate for the presidency of the united state in courteously decline this honor morse drily add : there be hundred nay thousand more able -lrb- not to say million more willing -rrb- to take any office they can obtain and perform its function more faithfully and with more benefit to the country while this be the case i do not feel that the country will suffer should one like myself weary with the struggle and litigation of half a century desire to be excuse from encounter the annoyance and misapprehension inseparable from political life thanks to the successful effort of he good friend mr kendall he be now financially independent so much so that he feel justified in purchase in the fall of the year 1859 the property at 5 west twenty-second street new york where the winter of the remain year of he life be pass except when he be abroad this house have now be replace by a commercial structure but a bronze tablet mark the spot where once stand the old-fashioned brown stone mansion while he mind be comparatively at rest regard money matter he be not yet free from vexatious litigation and he opinion of lawyer be tersely express in a letter to mr kendall of December 27 1859 : i have not lose my respect for law but i have for its administrator not so much for any premeditated dishonesty as for they stupidity and want of just insight into a case it be not long before he have a practical proof of the truth of this aphorism for he thorn in the flesh never cease from rankle and now give a new instance of the depths to which a unscrupulous man could descend on June 9 1860 morse write to he legal adviser mr george ticknor curti of boston : you may remember that smith just before i sail for europe in 1858 intimate that he should demand of I a portion of the honorary gratuity vote to I by the congress of ten power at pari i procured you opinion as you know and i have hope that he would not insist on so preposterous a claim i be however disappointed he have recently renew it i have have some correspondence with he on the subject utterly deny any claim on he part he propose a reference but i have not yet encourage he to think i would assent i wish you advice before i answer he it be difficult to conceive of a meaner case of extortion than this as morse say in a letter to mr kendall of August 3 1860 after he have consent to a reference of the matter to three person : i have no apprehension of the result except that i may be entrap by some legal technicality look at the case in a equitable point of view and it appear to I no intelligent just man could give a judgment against I or in he favor smith 's purchase into the telegraph the consideration he give be he effort to obtain a property in the invention abroad by letter patent or otherwise in _ such _ property he be to share no such property be create there what can he then claim the money that he hazard -lrb- take he own estimate -rrb- be to the amount of some seven thousand dollar and this be a advance virtually a loan to be pay back to he if he have create the property abroad but he effort be fruitless for that purpose and of no value whatever to I yet procure he one fourth patent interest in the united state for which we know he have obtain at least $ 300000 be he not pay amply without claim a portion of honorary gift to I well we shall see how legal man look at the matter -lrb- illustration : house and library at 5 west 22 would st new york -rrb- one legal man of great brilliance give he opinion without hesitation as we learn from a letter of morse 's to mr curti of July 14 : i have a day or two since my cousin judge breese late senator of the united state from illinoi on a visit to I i make he acquaint with the point after which he scout the idea that any court of legal character could for a moment sustain smith 's claim he think my argument unanswerable and playfully say : ' i will insure you against any claim from smith for a bottle of champagne ' it be a pity that morse do not close with the offer of the learn judge for in spite of he opinion in spite of the opinion of most man of intelligence in defiance of the perfectly obvious and proven fact that smith have utterly fail in fulfil he part of the contract and that the award have be make to morse as a reward altogether personal -lrb- _ toute personelle _ -rrb- the referee decide in smith 's favor and on what do they base this remarkable decision on the ground that in the contract of 1838 with smith the word otherwise occur property in europe be to be obtain by letter patent or otherwise of course no actual property have be obtain and smith have have no hand in secure the honorary gratuity and it be difficult to follow the reasoning of these sapient referee they be on smith 's part judge upham of new hampshire on morse 's mr hilliard of boston and judge sprague of the circuit court boston chairman however the decision be make and morse with characteristic large-heartedness submit gracefully on October 15 he write to mr curti : i ought perhaps with my experience to learn for the first time that _ law _ and _ justice _ be not synonym but with all deference to the opinion of the excellent referee for each of whom i have the highest personal respect i still think that they have not give a decision in strict conformity with law i submit however to law with kindly feeling to all and now bend my attention to repair my loss as best i may as remark before earlier in this volume morse in he correspondence with smith always write in that courteous manner which become a gentleman and he express he dissent from the verdict in this manner in a letter of November 20 in answer to one of smith 's quibble over the allowance to morse by the referee of certain expense : throw aside as of no avail any discussion in regard to the equity of the decision of the referee especially in the view of a conscientious and high-minded man i now deal with the decision as it have be make since accord to the technicality of the law it have be pronounce by honorable and honest man in accordance with they construction of the language of the deed in you favor but ` he that be convince against he will be of the same opinion still ' and in regard to the intrinsic injustice of be compel by the strict construction of a general word to pay over to you any portion of that which be expressly give to I as a personal and honorary _ gratuity _ by the european government my opinion be always as it have be a opinion sustain by the sympathy of every intelligent and honorable man who have study the merit of the case he be hard hit for a time by this unjust decision and he correspondence show that he regret it most because it prevent he from bestow as much in good work as he desire he be oblige to refuse many request which strongly appeal to he he daily mail contain numerous request for assistance in sum from twenty thousand dollar to fifty cent and it be always with great reluctance that he refuse anybody anything however as be usual in this life the gay be mingle with the grave and we find that he be one of the committee of prominent man to arrange for the entertainment of the prince of wale afterward edward vii on he visit to this country i have already refer to one incident of this visit when morse in a address to the prince at the university of the city of new york refer to the kindness show he in london by the earl of lincoln who be now the duke of newcastle and be in the suite of the prince morse have hope that he might have the privilege of entertaining hrh at he country place on the hudson but the duke of newcastle in a letter of October 8 1860 regret that this can not be manage : -- i assure you i have not forget the circumstance which give I the pleasure of you acquaintance in 1839 and i be very desirous of see you again during my short visit to this continent i fear however that a visit by the prince of wale to you home however i might wish it be quite impracticable although on we journey up the hudson we shall pass so near you every hour of we time be fully engage be there any chance of see you in new york or if not be there any better hope in boston if you should be in either during we stay i hope you will be kind enough to call upon I pray let I have a line on Thursday at new york i have lately be much interested in some electro-telegraphic invention of yours which be new to I i be yours very truly newcastle refer to another function in honor of the prince morse say in a letter to mr kendall : i do not see you after the so-styled ball in new york which be not a _ ball _ but a _ levee _ and a great jam i hope you and yours suffer no inconvenience from it the war cloud in he beloved country be now lower most ominously and true to he conviction he exclaim in a letter to a friend of January 12 1861 : -- we politician be play with edge tool it be easy to raise a storm by those who can not control it if i trust at all in they i should despair of the country but a almighty arm make the wrath of man to praise he and he will restrain the rest there be something so unnatural and abhorrent in this outcry of _ arm _ in one great family that i can not believe it will come to a decision by the sword such counsel of force be in the court of passion not of reason imagine such a conflict imagine a victory no matter by which side can the victor rejoice in the blood of brethren shed in a family brawl whose heart will thrill with pride at such success no no i should as soon think of rejoice that one of my son have kill the other in a brawl but i have not time to add i hope for the best and even can see beyond the cloud of the hour a brighter day god bless the whole family north south east and west i will never divide they in my heart however they may be politically or geographically divide he hope of a peaceful solution of the question at issue between the north and the south be of course destine to be cruelly dash and he suffer much during the next few year both in he feeling and in he purse on account of the war i have already show that he with many other pious man believe that slavery be a divine institution and that therefore the abolitionist be entirely in the wrong but that at the same time he be unalterably oppose to secession hold these view he be misjudge in both section of the country those at the north accuse he of be a secessionist because he be not a abolitionist and many at the south hold that he must be a abolitionist because he live at the north and do not believe in the doctrine of secession many page of he letter-book be fill with vehement argument uphold he point of view and he together with many other eminent man at the north strive without success to avert the war he former pastor at poughkeepsie the reverend hg ludlow in long letter with many bible quotation call upon he to repent he of he sin and join the cause of righteousness he in still longer letter indignantly repel the accusation of error and quote chapter and verse in support of he view he be make the president of the american society for promote national unity and in one of he letter to mr ludlow he use forceful language : -- the tone of you letter call for extraordinary draft on christian charity you criticism upon and denunciation of a society plan in the interest of peace and good will to all inaugurate by such man as bishop mcilvaine and hopkin dr kreb and hutton and winslow and bliss and van dyke and hawk and seabury and lord and adam of boston and wilson the missionary and style and boorman and professor owen and president wood and dr parker and my brother and many other as warm-hearted pray conscientious christian as ever assemble to devise means for promote peace -- denunciation of these and such as these can not but be painful in the highest degree i lay no stress upon these name other than to show that conscience in this matter have move some christian quite as strongly to view _ abolitionism _ as a sin of the deepest dye as it have other christian mind to view slavery as a sin and so to condemn slaveholder to excommunication and simply for be slaveholder who be to decide in a conflict of conscience if the bible be the umpire as i hold it to be then it be the abolitionist that be denounce as worthy of excommunication it be the abolitionist from whom we be command to withdraw ourselves while not a syllable of reproof do i find in the sacred volume administer to those who maintain in the spirit of the gospel the relation of _ master and slave _ if you have be more successful please point out chapter and verse i have no justification to offer for southern _ secession _ i have always consider it a remedy for nothing it be indeed a expression of a sense of wrong but in turn be itself a wrong and two wrong do not make a right i have quote thus at some length from one of he many polemic to show the absolute and fearless sincerity of the man mistake though he may have be in he major premise i shall quote from other letter on this subject as they appear in chronological order but as no person of any mental caliber think and act continuously along one line of endeavor so will it be necessary in a truthful biography to change from one subject of activity to another and then back again in order to portray in they proper sequence the thought and action of a man which go to make up he personality for instance while the outspoken view which morse hold on the subject of slavery and secession make he many enemy he be still hold in high esteem for it be in the year 1861 that the member of the national academy of design urge he so strongly to become they president again that he yield but on condition that it should be for one year only and the follow letter to matthew vassar of poughkeepsie date February 1 1861 show that he be actively interested in the foundation of the first college for woman in this country : you favor of the 24th ulto be receive and so far as i can further you magnificent and most generous enterprise i will do so i will endeavor to attend the meeting at the gregory house on the 26th of the present month may you long live to see you noble design in successful operation in spite of he deep anxiety for the welfare of he country and in spite of the other care which weigh he down he could not resist the temptation to indulge in humor when the occasion offer this humor be tinge with sarcasm in a letter of July 13 1861 to mr ab griswold he wife 's brother a prominent citizen of new orlean after assure he of he undiminished affection he add : -- and now see what a risk i have run by say thus much for accord to modern application of the definition of _ treason _ it would not be difficult to prove I a traitor and therefore amenable to the halter for instance -- treason be give aid and comfort to the enemy everybody south of a certain geographical line be a enemy you live south of that line ergo you be a enemy i send you my love you be a enemy this give you _ comfort _ ergo i have give comfort to the enemy ergo i be a traitor ergo i must be hang as the war progress he continue to express himself in forcible language against what he call the twin heresy -- abolitionism and secession he have do he best to avert the war he describe he effort in a letter of April 2 1862 to mr george l dougla of louisville kentucky who at that time be prominently connect with the southern line of the telegraph and who have loyally do all in he power to safeguard morse 's interest in those line : -- you be correct in say in you answer as garnishee that i have be a active and decide friend of peace in the early stage of the trouble when the southern commissioner be in washington i devoted my time and influence and property subscribing and pay in the outset five hundred dollar to set on foot measure for preserve peace honorable to all party the attack on fort sumter strike down all these effort -lrb- so far as my associate be concern -rrb- but i be not personally discourage and i again address myself to the work of the peacemaker determine to visit _ personally _ both section of the country the government at washington and the government of the confederate at richmond to ascertain if there be by possibility any means of avert war and when from physical inability and age i be unable to undertake the duty personally i defray from my own pocket the expense of a friend in he performance of the same duty for I who actually visit both washington and richmond and confer with the president and chief of each section on the subject true he effort be unsuccessful and so nothing remain for I but to retire to the quiet of my own study and watch the vicissitude of the awful storm which i be powerless to avert and descry the first sign of any clear up ready to take advantage of the earliest glimmering of light through the cloud he have no doubt as to the ultimate issue of the conflict for in a letter to he wife 's sister mr goodrich of may 2 1862 he reduce it to mathematics : -- sober man could calculate and do calculate the _ military _ issue for it be a problem of mathematics and not at all of individual or comparative courage a force of equal quality be to be divide and the two part to be set in opposition to each other if equally divide they will be at rest if one part equal 3 and the other 9 it do not require much knowledge of mathematics to decide which part will overcome the force of the other now this be the case here just now two third of the physical and material force of the country be at the north and on this account _ military _ success other thing be equal must be on the side of the north courage justness of the cause right have nothing to do with it war in we day be a game of chess two player be equal if one begin the game with dispense with a third of he best piece the other win as a matter of course he be firmly of the opinion that england and other european nation have foment if they have not originate the bad feeling between the north and the south and at time he give way to the most gloomy foreboding as in a letter of July 23 1862 to mr kendall who share he view on the main question at issue : -- i be much depressed there be no light in the political sky rabid abolitionism with its intense infernal hate intensify by the same hate from secession quarter be fast gain the ascendancy we country be dead god only can resuscitate it from its tomb i see no hope of union we be two country and what be most deplorable two hostile country oh how the nation with england at they head crow over we it be the hour of she triumph she have conquer by she art that which she fail to do by she arm if there be a corner of the world where i could hide myself and i could consult the welfare of my family i would sacrifice all my interest here and go at once may god save we with he salvation i have no heart to write or to do anything without a country without a country he go even further in one respect in a letter to mr walker of utica of October 27 but he ordinarily keen prophetic vision be at fault : have you make up you mind to be under a future monarch english or french or some scion of a european stock of king i shall not live to see it i hope but you may and you child will i leave you this prophecy in black and white in spite of he occasional fit of pessimism he still strive with all he might by letter and publish pamphlet to rescue he beloved country from what he believe be the machination of foreign enemy at the same time he do not neglect he more immediate concern and he letter-book be fill with loving admonition to he child instruction to he farmer answer to inventor seek he advice or to those ask for money for various cause etc he and he two brother have unite in cause a monument to be erect to the memory of they father and mother in the cemetery at new haven and he insist on bear the lion 's share of the expense as we learn from a letter write to he nephew sidney e morse jr on October 10 1862 : -- above you have my check on broadway bank new york for five hundred dollar towards mr ritter 's bill tell you dear father and uncle sidney that this be the portion of the bill for the monument which i choose to assume tell they i have still a good memory of past year when i be poor and receive from they the kind attention of affectionate brother i be now through the loving kindness and bounty of we heavenly father in such circumstance that i can afford this small testimonial to they former fraternal kindness and i know no better occasion to manifest the long pent-up feeling of my heart towards they than by lighten under the embarrassment of the time the pecuniary burden of we unite testimonial to the best of father and mother this monument a tall column surmount by a terrestrial globe symbolical of the fact that the elder morse be the first american geographer be still to be see in the new haven cemetery another instance of the inventor 's desire to show he gratitude towards those who have befriend he in he day of poverty and struggle be show in a letter of November 17 1862 to the widow of alfred vail : -- you be aware that a sum of money be vote I by a special congress convene at paris for the purpose as a personal honorary gratuity as the inventor of the telegraph notwithstanding however that the congress have put the sum vote I on the ground of a personal honorary gratuity i make up my mind in the very outset that i would divide to you good husband just that proportion of what i might receive -lrb- after due allowance and deduction of my heavy expense in carry through the transaction -rrb- as would have be he if the money so vote by the congress have be the purchase money of patent rights this design i early intimate to mr vail and i be happy in have already fulfil in part my promise to he when i have receive the gratuity only in part it be only the last spring that the whole sum promise in four annual instalment -lrb- after the various deduction in europe -rrb- have be remit to I i write to mr cobb -lrb- one of alfred vail 's executor -rrb- some month ago while he be in washington request a early interview to pay over the balance for you but have never receive a answer could you not come to town this week either with or without mr cobb as be most agreeable to you prepare to settle this matter in full if so please drop I a line state the day and hour you will come and i will make it a point to be at home at the time in this connection i shall quote from a letter to mr george vail write much earlier in the year on may 19 : -- it will give I much pleasure to aid you in you project of dispose of the _ ` original wire ' _ of the telegraph and if my certificate to its genuineness will be of service you shall cheerfully have it i be not at this moment aware that there be any quantity of this wire anywhere else except it may be in the helix of the big magnet which i have at poughkeepsie these shall not interfere with you design i make only one modification of you proposal and that be if any profit be realize please substitute for my name the name of you brother alfr 's amiable widow although the malign animosity of foj smith follow he to he grave and even afterwards he be in this year of 1862 relieve from one source of annoyance from he as we learn from a letter of may 19 to mr kendall : i have have a settlement with smith in full on the award of the referee in regard to the ` honorary gratuity ' and with less difficulty than i expect morse have now pass the scriptural age allot to man he be seventy-one year old and in a letter of August 22 he remark rather sorrowfully : i feel that i be no longer young that my career whether for good or evil be near its end but i wish to give the energy and influence that remain to I to my country to save it if possible to those who come after I all through the year 1863 he labor to this end with alternation of hope and despair on February 9 1863 he write to he cousin judge sidney breese : a movement be commence in the formation of a society here which promise good it be for the purpose of diffuse useful political knowledge it be back up by millionaire so far as fund go who have assure we that fund shall not be want for this object they have make I its president through the agency of this society he work to bring about peace with honor but as one of they cardinal principle be the abandonment of abolitionism he work in vain he bitterly denounce the emancipation proclamation and president lincoln come in for many hard word from he pen be consider by he weak and vacillate mistaken though i think he attitude be in this he opinion be share by many prominent man of the day and we must admit that for those who believe in a literal interpretation of the bible there be much excuse for instance in a letter of September 21 1863 to martin hauser esq of newbern indiana he go rather deeply into the subject : -- you letter of the 23d of last month i have just receive and i be gratify to see the evidence of a upright honest dependence upon the only standard of right to which man can appeal pervade you whole letter there be no other standard than the bible but we translation though so excellent be defective sometimes in give the true meaning of the original language in which the two testament be write the old testament in hebrew the new testament in greek therefore it be that in word in the english translation about which there be a variety of opinion it be necessary to examine the original hebrew or greek to know what be the meaning attach to these word by the writer of the original bible i make these observation to introduce a remark of yours that the bible do not contain anything like slavery in it because the word ` slave ' and ` slavery ' be not use in it -lrb- except the former twice -rrb- but that the word ` servant ' be use now the word translate ` servant ' in hundred of instance be in the original ` slave ' and the very passage you quote noah 's word -- ` curse be canaan a servant of servant shall he be unto he brethren ' -- in the original hebrew means exactly this -- ` curse be canaan a _ slave _ of _ slave _ shall he be ' the hebrew word be _ ` ebed ' _ which mean a bond slave and the word _ ` ebed ebadim ' _ translate ` slave of slave ' means strictly _ the most abject of slave _ in the new testament too the word translate ` servant ' from the greek be _ ` doula ' _ which be the same as _ ` ebed ' _ in the hebrew and always mean a bond slave we word ` servant ' formerly mean the same but time and custom have change its meaning with we but the bible word _ ` doulo ' _ remain the same ' a slave ' it seem strange that a man of such a gentle kindly disposition should have uphold the outworn institution of slavery but he honestly believe not only that it be ordain of god but that it be calculate to benefit the enslaved race to professor christy of cincinnatus he give on September 12 he reason for this belief : -- you have expose in a masterly manner the fallacy of abolitionism there be a complete coincidence of view between we my ` argument ' which be nearly ready for the press support the same view of the necessity of slavery to the christianization and civilization of a barbarous race my argument for the benevolence of the relation of master and slave draw from the four relation ordain of god for the organization of the social system -lrb- the fourth be the servile relation or the relation of master and slave -rrb- lead conclusively to the recognition of some great benevolent design in its establishment but you have demonstrate in a unanswerable manner by you statistics this benevolent design bring out clearly from the workings of he providence the absolute necessity of this relation in accomplish he gracious design towards even the lowest type of humanity chapter xxxviii February 26 1864 -- November 8 1867 sanitary commission -- letter to dr bellows -- letter on

time i have neither the wish nor the ability to enter into a discussion of the rights and the wrong of the cause underlie that now historic conflict nor be it germane to such a work as this while morse take a prominent part in the political movement of the time while he be fearless and outspoken in he view he name be not now associate historically with those epoch-making event it have seem necessary however to make some mention of he conviction in order to make the portrait a true one he continue to oppose the measure of the administration he do all in he power to hasten the come of peace he work and vote for the election of mcclellan to the presidency and when he and the other eminent man who believe as he do be outvote he bow to the will of the majority with many misgiving as to the future although he be oppose to the war he heart bleed for the wound on both side and he take a prominent part in the national sanitary commission he express himself warmly in a letter of February 26 1864 to its president rev dr bellows : -- there be some who be sufferer great sufferer whom we can reach and relieve without endanger political or military plan and in the spirit of he who ignore the petty political distinction of jew and samaritan and regard both as entitle to he sympathy and relief i can not but think it be within the scope and interest of the great sanitary commission to extend a portion of they christian regard to the unfortunate sufferer from this dreadful war the prisoner in we fortress and to those who dwell upon the border of the contend section in a letter of march 23 to william l ransom esq of litchfield connecticut he perhaps unconsciously enunciate one of the fundamental belief of that great president whom he so bitterly oppose : -- i hardly know how to comply with you request to have a ` short pithy democratic sentiment ' in glance at the thousand mystification which have befog so many in we presumed intelligent community i note one in relation to the new-fangled application of a common foreign word import from the monarchy of europe i mean the word ' _ loyalty _ ' upon which the change be daily and hourly sing _ ad nauseam _ i have no objection however to the word if it be rightly apply it signify ` fidelity to a prince or sovereign ' now if _ loyalty _ be require of we it should be to the _ sovereign _ where be this sovereign he be not the president nor he cabinet nor congress nor the judiciary nor any nor all of the administration together we sovereign be on a throne above all these he be the _ people _ or _ people _ of the state he have issue he decree not to private individual only but to president and to all he subordinate servant and this sovereign decree he servant the be the constitution he who adhere faithfully to this write will of the sovereign be _ loyal _ he who violate the embodiment of the will of the sovereign be _ disloyal _ whether he be a constitution this president a secretary a member of congress or of the judiciary or a simple citizen as a firm believer in the democratic doctrine of state ' rights morse with many other hold that lincoln have override the constitution in he emancipation proclamation it be a source of grief to he just at this time that he brother richard have change he political faith and have announce he intention of vote for the reelection of president lincoln in a long letter of September 24 1864 gently chide he for thus go over to the abolitionist the elder brother again state he reason for remain firm in he faith : -- i suppose dear brother that on that subject you be on the same platform with sidney and myself have there be any new light any new aspect of it which have render it less odious less the ` child of satan ' than when you and sidney edit the new york observer before lincoln be president i have see no reason to change my view respect abolition you well know i have ever consider it the logical progeny of unitarianism and infidelity it be characterize by subtlety hypocrisy and pharisaism and one of the most melancholy mark of its speciousness be its influence in benumb the gracious sensibility of many christian heart and blind they eye to they sad defection from the truth of the bible i know indeed the influence by which you be surround but they be neither stronger nor more artful than those which we brave father manfully withstand in combate the monster in the cradle i hope there be enough of father 's firmness and courage in battle with error however specious to keep you through god 's grace from fall into the embrace of the body-and-soul-destroying heresy of abolitionism in another long letter to he brother richard of November 5 he firmly but gently uphold he view that the constitution have be violate by lincoln 's action and that the manner of amend the constitution be provide for in that instrument itself and that : if that change be make in accordance with its provision no one will complain and then he add : -- but it be too late to give you the reason of the political faith that i hold when the excitement of the election be over let it result as it may i may be able to show you that my opinion be form from deep study and observation now i can only announce they comparatively unsustained by the reason for form they i be interrupt by a call from the committee request I to conduct general mcclellan to the balcony of the fifth avenue hotel this evening to review the mcclellan legion and the procession after my return i will continue my letter _ 12 o'clock midnight _ i have just return and never have i witness in any gathering of the people either in europe or in this country such a magnificent and enthusiastic display i conduct the general to the front of the balcony and present he to the assemblage -lrb- a dense mass of head as far as the eye could reach in every direction -rrb- and such a shout which continue for many minute i never hear before except it may have be at the reception in london of blücher and platoff after the battle of waterloo i leave the papers to give you the detail the procession be pass from nine o'clock to a quarter to twelve midnight and such be the denseness of the crowd within the hotel every entry and passageway jam with people that we be near be crushed three policeman before I could scarcely open a way for the general who hold my arm to pass only a few yard to we room after take my leave i succeed with difficulty in press my way through the crowd within and without the hotel and have just get into my quiet library and must now retire for i be too fatigue to do anything but sleep good-night a short time after this the election be hold and this enthusiastic advocate of what he consider the right learn the bitter lesson that crowd and shout and surface enthusiasm do not carry a election the voice of that sovereign to whom he have swear loyalty speak in no uncertain tone and lincoln be overwhelmingly choose by the vote of the people morse be outvote but not convinced and i shall make but one quotation from a letter of November 9 to he brother richard who have also remain firm in spite of he brother 's plead : my consolation be in look up and i pray you may be so enlighten that you may be deliver from the delusion which have ensnare you and from the judgment which i can not but feel be in store for this section of the country when i can believe that my bible read ` curse ' instead of ` bless ' be the ` peacemaker ' i also shall cease to be a peace man but while they remain as they do in the category of those that be bless i can not be frighten at the name of ` copperhead ' and ` traitor ' so lavishly bestow with threat of hang etc by those whom you have assist into power in a letter of mr george wood 's of June 26 1865 i find the following sentence : i have to acknowledge you very carefully write letter on the divine origin of slavery i hope you have keep a copy of this letter for the time will come when you will have a biography write and the defense you have make of you position take in you pamphlet be unquestionably far better than he -lrb- you biographer -rrb- will make for you the letter to which mr wood refer be begin on march 5 1865 but finish some time afterwards it be very long too long to be include here but in justice to myself that future biographer i wish to state that i have already give the main argument bring forward in that letter in quotation from previous letter and that i have attempt no defense further than to emphasize the fact that right or wrong morse be intensely sincere and that he have the courage of he opinion return to a earlier date and turn from matter political to the gentler art of peace we find that the one-time artist have always hope that some day he could resume he brush which the labor incident to the invention of the telegraph have compel he to drop but it seem that he hand through long disuse have lose its cunning he bewail the fact in a letter of January 20 1864 to n jocelyn esq : -- i have many yearning towards painting and sculpture but that rigid faculty call reason so opposed often to imagination read I a lecture to which i be compel to bow to explain : i make the attempt to draw a short time ago everything in the draw seem properly proportion but upon put it in another light i perceive that every perpendicular line be awry in other word i find that i could place no confidence in my eye no i have make the sacrifice of my profession to establish a invention which be do mankind a great service i pursue it long enough to find a institution which i trust be to flourish long after i be go and be the means of educate a noble class of man in art to be a honor and praise to we beloved country when peace shall once more bless we throughout all we border in one grand brotherhood of state the many letter to he child be model of patient exhortation and cheerful optimism when sometimes the temptation to indulge in pessimism be strong i shall give as a example one write on may 9 1864 to two of he son who have return to school at newport : -- now we hope to have good report of you progress in you study in spring you know the farmer sow they seed which be to give they they harvest at the close of the summer if they be not careful to put the seed in the ground think it would do just as well about August or September or if they put in very little seed you can see that they can not expect to reap a good or abundant crop now it be just so in regard to you life you be in the springtime of life it be seed time you must sow now or you will reap nothing by-and-by or if anything only weed you teacher be give you the seed in you various study you can not at present understand the use of they but you must take they on trust you must believe that you parent and teacher have have experience and they know what will be for you good hereafter what study will be most useful to you in after life therefore buckle down to you study diligently and very soon you will get to love you study and then it will be a pleasure and not a task to learn you lesson we miss you _ noise _ but although agreeable quiet have come in place of it we should be willing to have the noise if we could have we dear boy near we you be indeed troublesome pleasure but after all pleasant trouble when you be settle in life and have a family around you you will better understand what i mean in spite of the disorganization of business cause by the war the value of telegraphic property be rapidly increase and new line be be constantly build or propose morse refer to this in a letter of June 25 1864 to he old friend george wood : -- to you as well as to myself the rapid progress of the telegraph throughout the world must seem wonderful and with I you will doubtless often recur to we friend annie 's inspired message -- ` what have god work ' it be indeed he marvellous work and to he be the glory early in the history of the invention in forecast its future i be accustom to predict with confidence ` it be destine to go round the world ' but i confess i do not expect to live to see the prediction fulfil it be quite as wonderful to I also that with the thousand attempt to improve my system with the mechanical skill of the world concentrate upon improve the mechanism the result have be beautiful complication and great ingenuity but no improvement i have the gratification of know that my system everywhere know as the ` morse system ' be universally adopt throughout the world because of its simplicity and its adaptedness to universality this remain true to the present day and be one of the remarkable feature of this great invention the germ of the morse system as jot down in the 1832 sketch-book be the basic principle of the universal telegraph of to-day in another letter to mr wood of September 11 1864 refer to the sad death of the son of a mutual friend he touch on two of the great enigma of life which have puzzle many other mind : -- it be one of those mystery of providence one of those deep thing of god to be unfold in eternity with the perfect vindication of god 's wisdom and justice that child of pious parent child of daily anxiety and prayer dedicate to god from they birth and train to all human appearance ` in the way they should go ' should yet seem to falsify the promise that ` they should not depart from it ' it be a subject too deep to fathom it be my daily i may say hourly thought certainly my constant wakeful thought at night how to resolve the question : ` why have god see fit so abundantly to shower he earthly blessing upon I in my latter day to bless I with every desirable comfort while so many so much more deserving -lrb- in human eye at least -rrb- be deprive of all comfort and have heap upon they suffering and trouble in every shape ' the memory of he student day in london be always dear to he and on January 4 1865 he write to william cullen bryant : -- i have this moment receive a print circular respect the propose purchase of the portrait of allston by leslie to be present to the national academy of design there be association in my mind with those two eminent and beloved name which appeal too strongly to I to be resist now i have a favor to ask which i hope will not be deny it be that i may be allow to present to the academy that portrait in my own name you can appreciate the argument which have influence my wish in this respect allston be more than any other person my master in art leslie be my life-long cherish friend and fellow pupil whom i love as a brother we all live together for year in the closest intimacy and in the same house be there not then a fitness that the portrait of the master by one distinguished pupil should be present by the survive pupil to the academy over which he preside in its infancy as well as assist in its birth and although divorce from art can not so easily be divorce from the memory of a intercourse with these distinguish friend a intercourse which never for one moment suffer interruption even from a shadow of estrangement it be needless to say that this generous offer be accept and morse at the same time present to the academy the brush which allston be use when stricken with he fatal illness as he means permit he make generous donation to charity and to educational institution and on may 20 1865 he endowed by the gift of $ 10000 a lectureship in the union theological seminary make the follow request in the letter which accompany it : -- if it be think advisable that the name of the lectureship as be suggest should be the morse lectureship i wish it to be distinctly understand that it be so name in honor of my venerated and distinguished father whose zealous labor in the cause of theological education and in various benevolent enterprise as well as of geographical science entitle he memory to preservation in connection with the effort to diffuse the knowledge of we lord and savior jesus christ and he gospel throughout the world curiously enough i find no reference in the letter of the year 1865 to the assassination of president lincoln but i well remember be take a boy of eight to we stable on the corner of fifth avenue and twenty-first street from the second-floor window of which we watch the impose funeral cortège pass up the avenue the fifty-fifth reunion of he class of 1810 take place in this year and morse reluctantly decide to absent himself the reason why he feel that he could not go be give in a long letter of August 11 to he cousin professor e salisbury and it be such a clear statement of he conviction that i be tempt to give it almost in its entirety : -- i should have be most happy on many personal account to have be at the periodical meeting of my survive classmate of 1810 and also to have renew my social intercourse with many esteemed friend and relation in new haven but as i could not conscientiously take part in the propose martial sectional glorification of those of the family who fall in the late lamentable family strife and could not in any brief way or time explain the discrimination that be necessary between that which i approve and that which i most unqualifiedly condemn without the risk of misapprehension i prefer the only alternative leave I to absent myself altogether you well know i never approve of the late war i have ever believe and still believe if the warning of far-seeing statesman -lrb- washington clay and webster among they -rrb- have be heed if during the last thirty year of persistent stir up of strife by angry word the calm and christian counsel of intelligent patriot have be follow at the north and a strict observance of the letter and spirit of the constitution have be sustain as the supreme law instead of the insidious violation of its provision especially by new england we should have have no war as i contribute nothing to the war so now i see no reason specially to exult in the display of brave quality in a isolate portion of the family quality which no true american ever doubt be possess by both section of we country in a equal degree why then discriminate between alumnus from the north and alumnus from the south at a gathering in which alumnus from both section be expect to meet no my dear cousin the whole era of the war be one i wish not to remember i would have no other memorial than a black cross like those over the grave of murder traveller to cause a shudder whenever it be see it would be well if history could blot from its page all record of the past four year there be no glory in they for victor or vanquish the only event in which i rejoice be the restoration of peace which never should have be interrupted i have no doubt that they who originate the recent demonstration honestly believe it to be _ patriotic _ for every movement nowadays must take that shape to satisfy the morbid appetite of the popular mind i can not think it either in good taste or in conformity with sound policy for we collegiate institution to foster this depraved appetite surely there be enough of this in the political harangue of the day for those who require such aid to patriotism without its be administer to by we college that patriotism be of rather a suspicious character which need such prop i love to see my child well clad and take a proper pride in they attire but i should not think they well instruct if i find they everywhere boast of they fine clothes a true nobleman be not forever boast of he nobility for fear that he rank may not be recognize the loudest boast of patriotism do not come from the true possessor of the genuine spirit patriotism be not sectional nor local it comprehend in its grasp the whole country i have say the demonstration at commencement be in bad taste why you will say because commencement day bring together the alumnus of the college from all part of the union from the south as well as the north they be to meet on some common ground and that common ground be the love that all be suppose to bear to the old alma mater cherish by memory of past friendship in they college association the late commencement be one of peculiar note it be the first after the return of peace the country have be sunder the tie of friendship and of kindred have be break the bond of college affection be weaken if not destroy what a opportunity for inaugurate the healing process what a occasion for the display of magnanimity of mollify the pain of humiliation of throw a veil of oblivion over the past of water the perish root of fraternal affection and foster the spirit of genuine union but no the southern alumnus may come but he come to be humiliate still further can he join in the plaudit of those by whom he have be humble you may applaud but do not ask he to join in you acclamation he may be mourn the death of father brother yes of mother and sister by the very hand of those you be glorify do not aggravate he sorrow by require he to join you in such a demonstration no my dear cousin it be in _ bad taste _ to say the least of it and it be equally _ impolitic _ to intercalate such a demonstration into the usual and appropriate exercise of the week you expect i presume to have pupil from the south as heretofore will such a sectional display be likely to attract they or to repel they if they can go elsewhere they will not come to you they will not be attract by a perpetual memento before they eye of you triumph over they it be not politic it be no improvement for christian america to show less humanity than heathen rome the roman never make demonstration of triumph over the defeat of they countryman in a civil war it be no proof of superior civilization that we refuse to follow roman example in such case my dear cousin i have write you very frankly but i trust you will not misunderstand I as have any personal reproach to make for the part you have take in the matter we undoubtedly view the field from different standpoint i concede to you conscientious motive in what you do you be sustain by those around you man of intellect man of character i respect they while i differ from they i appeal however to a higher law and that i think sustain I he strong and outspoken stand for what he believe to be the right make he many enemy and he be call hard name by the majority of those by whom he be surround at the north and yet the very fearlessness with which he advocate a unpopular point of view undoubtedly compel increase respect for he a proof of this be give in a letter to he daughter mr lind of December 28 1865 : -- i also send you some clipping from the papers give you a account of some of the doings respect a statue propose to I by the common council the mayor who be a personal friend of mine you see have veto the resolution not from a disapproval of they character but because he do not like the locality propose he propose the central park and in this opinion all my friend concur i doubt if they will carry the project through while i be alive and it would really seem most proper to wait until i be go before they put up my monument i have nothing however to say on the subject i be gratify of course to see the manifestation of kindly feel but as the tinder of vainglory be in every human heart i rather shrink from such a propose demonstration lest a spark of flattery should kindle that tinder to a unseemly and destructive flame i be not blind to the popularity world-wide of the telegraph and a sober forecast of the future foreshadow such a statue in some place if ever erect i hope the prominent motto upon the pedestal will be : ' _ not unto we not unto we but to god be the glory _ ' and the first message or telegram : ' _ what have god work _ ' he say very much the same thing in a letter to he friend george wood of January 15 1866 and he also say in this letter refer to some instance of benevolent generosity by mr kendall : -- be it not a noticeable fact that the wealth acquire by the telegraph have in so many conspicuous instance be devote to benevolent purpose mr kendall be prominent in he expenditure for great christian enterprise and think of cornell always esteem by I as a ingenious and shrewd man when employ by I to set the post and put up the wire for the first line of telegraph between washington and baltimore yet think to be rather close and narrow-minded by those around he but see when he wealth have increase by he acquisition of telegraph stock to million -lrb- it be say -rrb- what enlarged and noble plan of public benefit be conceive and bring forth by he i have view he course with great gratification as the evidence of god 's blessing on _ what he have work _ it have be make plain i think that morse be essentially a leader in every movement in which he take a interest whether it be artistic scientific religious or political this be emphasize by the number of request make to he to assume the presidency of all sort of organization and these request multiply as he advance in year most of they he feel compel to decline for as he say in a letter of march 13 1866 decline the presidency of the geographical and statistical society : i be at a age when i find it necessary rather to be relieve from the care and responsibility already rest upon I than to take upon I additional one in many other case he allow he name to be use as vice-president or member when he consider the object of the organization a worthy one and he benefaction be only limit by he means he do however accept the presidency of one association just at this time the american asiatic society in which be interested such man as gorham abbott dr forsyth eh champlin thoma harrison and morse 's brother-in-law william m goodrich the aim of this society be rather vast include a international congress to be call by the emperor napoleon iii for the purpose of open up and control the great highway from the east to the west through the isthmus of suez and that of panama also the colonization of palestine by the jew and other commercial and philanthropic scheme i can not find that anything of lasting importance be accomplish by this society so i shall make no further mention of it although there be much correspondence about it the follow from a letter to mr kendall of march 19 1866 explain itself : if i understand the position of we telegraph interest they be now very much as you and i wish they to be in the outset not cut up in o'reilly fashion into irresponsible part but make one grand whole like the post-office system it be become doubtless a _ monopoly _ but no more so than the post-office system and its unity be in reality a public advantage if properly and uprightly manage and this of course will depend on the character of the manager confidence must be repose somewhere and why not in upright and responsible man who be impel as well by they own interest to have they matter conduct with fairness and with liberality as a curious commentary on he misplace faith in the integrity of other i shall quote from a letter of January 4 1867 to e sanford esq which also show he abhorrence of anything like crooked dealing in financial matter : -- i wish when you again write I you would give I _ in confidence _ the name of those in the board of the western union who be act in so dishonorable and tricky a manner i think i ought to know they in order to avoid they and resist they in the public interest it be a shame that a enterprise which honestly conduct be more than usually profitable should be conduct on the principle of sharper and trickster -lrb- illustration : telegram show morse 's characteristic deadhead which he always use to frank he message -rrb- so far as the russian extension be concerned i should judge from you representation that as a stockholder in that enterprise to the amount of $ 30000 the plan would conduce to my immediate pecuniary benefit but so would the _ robbery of the safe of a bank _ if wealth can be obtain only by such swindle i prefer poverty you have my proxy and i have the utmost confidence in you management do by I as you would do for yourself and i shall be satisfy in regard to any honorable proposition make in the board be conciliatory and compromise but any scheme to oppress the smaller stockholder for the benefit of the larger resist to the death i prefer to sacrifice all my stock rather than have such a stigma on my character as such mean and i will add villainous conduct would be sure to bring upon all who engage in it in this connection i shall also quote from another letter to mr sanford of February 15 1867 : if government think seriously of purchase the telegraph and at this late day adopt my early suggestion that it ought to belong to the post-office department be it so if they will now pay for it they must now pay million for that which i offer to they for one hundred thousand dollar and give they a year for consideration ere they adopt it there be but few reference to politics in the letter of this period but i find the follow in a letter of march 20 1866 to a cousin : you ask my opinion of we president i do not vote for he but i be agreeably surprise at he masterly statesmanship and hope by he firmness in resist the extreme radical he will preserve the union against now the greatest enemy we have to contend against i mean those who call themselves abolitionist president johnson deserve the support of all true patriot and he will have it against all the ` traitor ' in the country by whatever soft name of loyalty they endeavor to shield themselves appeal of all kind keep pour in on he and in courteously refuse one on April 17 he use the follow language : i be unable to aid you i can not indeed answer a fiftieth part of the hundred of application make to I from every section of the country _ daily _ -- i might say _ hourly _ -- for yours be the third this morning and it be not yet 12 o'clock after settle he affair at home in he usual methodical manner morse sail with he wife and he four young child and colonel john r leslie they tutor for europe on the 23d of June 1866 prepare for a extended stay he wish to give he child the advantage of travel and study in europe and he be very desirous of be in pari during the universal exposition of 1867 there be a gap in the letter-book until October 1866 but from the few letter to member of the family which have be preserve and from my own recollection we know that the summer of 1866 be most delightfully spend in journey through france germany and switzerland the child be now old enough not to be the nuisance they seem to have be in 1858 for we find no note of complaint on that account in September he return with he wife he daughter and he youngest son to pari leave he two older son with they tutor in geneva as he wish to make pari he headquarters for nearly a year he seek and find a furnished apartment at no 10 avenue du roi de rome -lrb- now the avenue du trocadero -rrb- and he write to he mother-in-law on September 22 : we be fortunate in have apartment in a new building or rather one newly and completely repair throughout all the apartment be newly furnish with elegant furniture we have the first use of it we have ample room not large but promise more comfort for winter residence than if they be larger the situation be on a wide avenue and central for many purpose close to the champ elysées near also to the bois de boulogne and within a few minute walk of the champ de mar so that we shall be most eligibly situate to visit the great exposition when it open in April he wife 's sister mr goodrich with she husband and daughter occupy a apartment in the same build he grandson charle lind be also in pari study painting and before the summer of the next year other member of he family come to pari so that at one time eighteen of those related to he by blood or marriage be around he to a man of morse 's affectionate nature and loyalty to family this be a source of peculiar joy and those parisian day be some of the happiest of he life the rest of the autumn and early winter be spend in sight-seeing and in settle he child in they various study the brilliance of the court of napoleon iii just before the _ débâcle _ of 1870 be a matter of history and it reach its high-water mark during the exposition year of 1867 when emperor king and prince journey to pari to do homage to the man of the hour court ball reception gala performance at opera and theater and military review follow each other in bewildering but well-ordered confusion and morse as a man of worldwide celebrity take part in all of they he and he wife and he young daughter a girl of sixteen be present at court and be fêted everywhere in a letter to he mother-in-law he give a description of he court costume on the occasion of he first presentation when he be accompany only by he brother-in-law mr goodrich : -- we receive we card invite we to the soirée and to pass the evening with they majesty on the 16th of January -lrb- Wednesday evening -rrb- ' _ en uniforme _ ' be stamp upon the card so we have to procure court dress mr goodrich as be the custom in most case hire he i have a full suit make for I a _ chapeau bra _ with gold lace loop a blue coat with stand collar single breasted richly embroidered with gold lace the american eagle button white silk lining vest light cashmere with gilt button pantaloons with a broad stripe of gold lace on the outside seam a small sword and patent-leather shoe or boot complete the dress of ordinary mortal like brother goodrich but for _ extra_ordinary mortal like my humble republican self i be bedizen with all my order seven decoration cover my left breast if thus accoutr i should be see on broadway i should undoubtedly have a numerous escort of a character not the most agreeable but as it be i find myself in very good and numerous company none of whom could consistently laugh at he neighbor after describe the ceremony of presentation he continue : -- occasionally both the emperor and empress say a few word to particular individual when my name be mention the emperor say to I ` you name sir be well know here ' for which i thank he and the empress afterwards say to I when my name be mention ` we be greatly indebted to you sir for the telegraph ' or to that effect afterwards mr bennett the winner of the yacht race engage for a moment they particular regard -lrb- i wonder if the modest inventor appreciate the irony of this juxtaposition -rrb- after the dancer be fully engage the refreshment-room the salon of diana be open and as in we less aristocratic country the table attract a great crowd so that the door be guard so as to admit the company by instalment i have in vain for some time endeavor to gain admittance and be wait patiently quite at a distance from the door which be throng with lady and high dignitary when a gentleman who guard the door and who have he breast cover with order address I by name ask I if i be not professor morse upon reply in the affirmative quite to my surprise he make way for I to the door and open it admit I before all the rest i can not yet divine why this special favor be show to I the table be richly furnished i look for bonbon to carry home to the child but when i see some tempting look almond and candy and motto to my surprise i find they be all compose of fish put up in this form and the motto be of salad it be good to know that morse ever willing to forgive and forget be again on term of friendly intercourse with cyrus w field who be then in london as the follow letter to he date march 1 1867 will show : -- singular as it may seem i be in the midst of you speech before the chamber of commerce reception to you in new york peruse it with deep interest when my valet hand I you letter of the 27th ulto i regret exceedingly that i shall not have the great pleasure i have anticipate with other friend here who be prepare to receive you in pari with the welcome you so richly deserve you invite I to london i have the matter under consideration march wind and that boisterous channel have some weight in my decision but i so long to take you by the hand and to get post upon telegraph matter at home that i feel disposed to make the attempt but without positively say ` yes ' i will see if in a few day i can so arrange my affair as to have a few hour with you before you sail on the 20th -lrb- illustration : morse in old age -rrb- i send you by book post the proceedings of the banquet give to we late minister bigelow in which you will see my remark on the great enterprise with which you name will forever be so honorably associate and justly immortalize it will be remember that the atlantic cable be finally successfully lay on July 27 1866 and that to cyrus field more than to any other man be this wonderful achievement due in a letter of march 4 1867 to john sc abbott esq morse give the follow interesting incident in the life of napoleon iii : -- in 1837 i be one of a club of gentleman in new york who be associate for social and informal intellectual converse which hold weekly meeting at each other 's house in rotation most of these distinguish man be now decease the club consist of such man as chancellor kent albert gallatin peter augustus jay reporter johnson dr -lrb- afterwards bishop -rrb- wainwright the president and professor of columbium college the chancellor and professor of the new york city university dr augustus smith messr goodhue and de rham of the mercantile class and john c hamilton esq and ex-governor wb lawrence from the literary rank among the rule of the club be one permit any member to introduce to the meeting distinguish stranger visit the city at one of the reunion of the club the place of meeting be at chancellor kent 's on assemble the chancellor introduce to we loui napoleon a son of the ex-king of holland a young man pale and contemplative somewhat reserve this reserve we generally attribute to a suppose imperfect acquaintance with we language at supper he sit on the right of the chancellor at the head of the table mr gallatin be opposite the chancellor at the foot of the table and i be on he right in the course of the evening while the conversation be general i draw the attention of mr gallatin to the stranger observe that i do not trace any resemblance in he feature to he world-renowned uncle yet that he forehead indicate great intellect ` yes ' reply mr gallatin ` there be a great deal in that head of he but he have a strange fancy can you believe it he have the impression that he will one day be the emperor of the french can you conceive of anything more ridiculous ' certainly at that period even to the sagacious eye of mr gallatin such a idea would naturally seem too improbable to be entertain for a moment but in the light of later event and the actual state of thing at present do not the fact show that even in he darkest hour there be in this extraordinary man that unabated faith in he future which be a harbinger of success a faith which pierce the dark cloud which surround he and realize to he in marvellous prophetic vision that which we see at this day and hour fully accomplish morse must have pen these word with peculiar satisfaction for they epitomize he own sublime faith in he future in 1837 he also be pass through some of he darkest hour but he too have have faith and now thirty year afterwards he dream of glory have be triumphantly realize he be a honor guest of that other man of destiny and he name be forever immortalize the spring and early summer of 1867 be enjoy to the full by the now venerable inventor and he family the exposition be a source of never-ending joy to he and he say of it in a letter to he son-in-law edward lind : -- you will hear all sort of story about the exposition the english papers -lrb- some of they -rrb- in john bull style call it a humbug let I tell you that imperfect as it be in its present condition go on rapidly to completion it may without exaggeration be pronounce the eighth wonder of the world it be the world in epitome i come over with my child to give they the advantage of thus study the world in anticipation of what i now see and i can say that the two day only in which i have be able to glance through part of its vast extent have amply repay I for my voyage here i believe my child will learn more of the condition of the art agriculture custom manufacture and mineral and vegetable product of the world in five week than they could by book at home in five year and as many year ' travel he be make a honorary commissioner of the united state to the exposition and he prepare a elaborate and careful report on the electrical department for which he receive a bronze medal from the french government writing of this report to he brother sidney he say : this keep I so busy that i have no time to write and i have so many iron in the fire that i fear some must burn but father 's motto be -- ` better wear out than rust out ' -- so i keep at work in a letter to he friend the honorable john thompson of poughkeepsie he describe one of he dissipation : -- pari now be the great center of the world such a assemblage of sovereign be never before gather and i and mine be in the midst of the great scene and fêtes we be honor a few evening ago with card to a very select fête give by the emperor and empress at the tuillery to the king and queen of the belgian the prince of wale and prince alfr to the queen of portugal

but in the description of the arabian night we do not see half the display for the immense series of gorgeous hall light by seventy thousand candle with fountain and flower at every turn make one

prince and other distinguished person of they suite i must tell you -lrb- for family use only -rrb- that the emperor napoleon make to I a marked recognition as he pass along sarah and i be stand upon two chair overlook the front rank of those range on each side the emperor give he usual bow on each side but as he come near we he give a unusual and special bow to I which i return and he then with a smile give I a second bow so marked as to draw the attention of those around who at once turn to see to whom this courtesy be show i should not mention this but that sarah and other observe it as a unusual mark of courtesy feel the need of rest after all the gayety and excitement of paris morse and part of he family retire to shanklin on the isle of wight where in a neat little furnished cottage -- florence villa -- they spend part of two happy month then with he wife and daughter and youngest son he journey in leisurely fashion through england and scotland return to paris in October here he spend some time in work on he report to the united state government as commissioner to the exposition among he note i find the follow which seem to I worthy of record : -- _ the sounder _ mr prescott i perceive be quote as a authority he be not reliable on many point and he work should be use with caution he work be originally write in the interest of those oppose my patent and he statement be many of they grossly unjust and strongly color with prejudice be he now to reprint he work i be convinced he would find it necessary for the sake of he reputation to expunge a great deal and to correct much that he have misstate and misapprehend he manifest the most unpardonable ignorance or wilful prejudice in regard to the _ sounder _ now so-called the possibility of reading by sound be among the earliest mode notice in the first instrument of 1835 and it be in consequence of observe this fact that in my first patent specification draw up in 1837-1838 i distinctly specify these _ sound _ of the sign and they be secure in my letter patent yet mr prescott make it a accidental discovery and in 1860 -lrb- the date of he publication -rrb- he wholly ignore my agency in this mode the sounder be but the pen-lever deprive of the pen in everything else it be the same the sound of the letter be give with and without the pen on November 8 1867 he write from pari to he friend the honorable john thompson : -- i be still hold in pari for the completion of my labor but hope in a few day to be relieve so that we may leave for dresden where my boy be pursue they study in the german language i be yet doubtful how long a sojourn we may make in dresden and whether i shall winter there or in pari but i be incline to the latter we wish to visit italy but i be not satisfy that it will be pleasant or even safe to be there just now the garibaldian inroad upon the pontifical state be indeed for the moment suppress but the end be not yet alas for poor italy how hard to rid herself of evil that have become chronic why can not statesman of the old world learn the great truth that most of they perplexity in settle the question of international peace arise from the unnatural union of church and state he who say ` my kingdom be not of this world ' utter a truth pregnant with consequence the attempt to rule the state by the church or the church by the state be equally at war with he teaching and until these be make the rule of conduct whether for political body or religious body there will be the sword and not peace i see by the papers that the reaction i have long expect and hope for have commence in we country it be hail here by intelligent and cool-headed citizen as a good omen for the future the radical have have they way and the people disgust have at length give they

on the continent he be receive in special audience by the king and queen of saxony and man of note in the scientific world eagerly seek he counsel and advice but apart from so much that be gratify to he he be just then call upon to bear many trial and affliction of various kind and degree and it be marvellous in read he letter to note with what great serenity and christian fortitude yet withal with what solicitude he endeavor to bear he cross and solve he problem as he advance in year a increase number of those near and dear to he be take from he by death and he letter of christian sympathy fill many page of the letter book there be trial of a domestic nature too intimate to be reveal which cause he deep sorrow but which he bravely and optimistically strive to meet cloud too obscure he financial horizon investment in certain mining venture enter into with high hope turn out a dead loss the repayment of loan cheerfully make to friend and relative be either delay or entirely default and to cap the climax the western union telegraph company in which most of he fortune be invest pass one dividend and threaten to pass another he have provide for this contingency by a deposit of surplus fund before he departure for europe but he be fearful of the future in spite of all this he could not refrain from treat the matter lightly and humorously in a letter to mr e sanford of November 28 1867 write from dresden : you letter give I both pleasure and pain i be glad to hear some particulars of the condition of my ' _ basket _ ' but be pained to learn that the _ hen ' _ egg instead of swell to _ goose _ egg and even to _ ostrich _ egg -lrb- as some that lay they so enthusiastically anticipate when they be so closely packed -rrb- have shrink to _ pigeon ' _ egg if not to the diminutive _ sparrow ' _ to keep up the figure i be thankful there be any leave not addle he be all the time absorb in the preparation of he report as commissioner to the pari exposition and it be of course a source of great gratification to he to learn from the answer to he question send to the telegraph officer of the whole world that the morse system be practically the only one in general use as one of he correspondent put it -- the cry be ` give we the morse ' the necessity for the completion of this work and he desire to give he child every advantage of study keep he longer in europe than he have expect and he write to he brother sidney on December 1 1867 : i long to return for age creep on apace and i wish to put my house in order for a longer and better journey to a better home in the early part of February 1868 he and he wife and daughter and youngest son leave dresden for paris stop however a few day in berlin mr george bancroft be we minister at the prussian court and he do all that courtesy could suggest to make the stay of he distinguished countryman a pleasant one he urge he to stay longer so that he might have the pleasure of present he at court but this honor morse feel oblige to decline the inventor do however find time to visit the government telegraph office of which colonel -lrb- afterwards general -rrb- von chauvin be the head and here he receive a ovation from all the operator several hundred in number who be seat at they instrument in what be then the largest operating-room in the world another incident of he visit to berlin i shall give in the word of mr prime : -- not to recount the many tribute of esteem and respect pay he by dr siemen and other gentleman eminent in the specialty of telegraphy one other unexpected compliment may be mention the professor be present to the accomplished general director of the post of the north german bund privy councillor von phillipsborn in whose department the telegraph have be comprise before prussium become so great and the center of a powerful confederation at the time of they visit the director be so engage and that too in another part of the post-amt that the porter say it be useless to trouble he with the card the name have not be long send up however before the director himself come hurriedly down the corridor into the antechamber and scarcely wait for the hastiest of introduction enthusiastically grasp both the professor 's hand in he own ask whether he have ` the honor of speak to dr morse ' or as he pronounce it ` morzey ' when after a brief conversation mr morse rise to go the director say that he have just leave a conference over a new post and telegraph treaty in negotiation between belgium and the bund and that it would afford he great pleasure to be permit to present he guest to the assemble gentleman include the belgian envoy and the belgian postmaster-general there follow accordingly a formal presentation with a introductory address by the director who in excellent english thank mr morse in the name of prussium and of all germany for he great service and speech by the principal person present -- the belgian envoy baron de nothomb very felicitously compliment the professor in french succeed the hand-shaking the director speak again and in reply mr morse gratefully acknowledge the courtesy show to he add : ` it be very gratifying to I to hear you say that the telegraph have be and be a means of promote peace among man believe I gentleman my remain day shall be devote to this great object ' the director then lead he visitor into a small cosily furnished room say as they enter : ` here i have so often think of you mr morse but i never think i should have the honor of receive you in my own private room ' after they be seat the host tap upon a small table continue : ` over this pass the important telegram of the war of 1866 ' then approach a large telegraph map on the wall he add : ` upon this you can see how invaluable be the telegraph in the war here ' -- point with the forefinger of he right hand -- ` here the crown prince come down through silesium this ' indicate with the other forefinger a passage through bohemia ` be the line of march of prince friedrich carl from this station the crown prince telegraph prince friedrich carl always over berlin where be you the answer from this station reach he also over berlin the austrian be here ' place the thumb on the map below and between the two finger ` the next day prince friedrich carl come here ' -- the left forefinger join the thumb -- ' and telegraph the fact always over berlin to the crown prince who hurry forward here ' the forefinger of the right hand slip quickly under the thumb as if to pinch something and the narrator look up significantly perhaps the patriotic director thought of the July afternoon when eagerly listen at the little mahogany-topped table over which pass so many momentous message he learn that the royal cousin have effect a junction at königgrätz a junction that decide the fate of germany and secure prussium its present proud position a junction which but for he modest visitor 's invention the telegraph ` always over berlin ' would have be impossible return to pari with he family he spend some month at the hôtel de la place du palais royal principally in collect all the datum necessary to the completion of he report which have be much delay owe to the dilatoriness of those to whom he have apply for fact and statistics on April 14 1868 he say in a letter to the honorable john thompson : pleasant as have be we european visit with its advantage in certain branch of education we heart yearn for we american home we can appreciate i hope the good in european country be grateful for european hospitality and yet be thorough american as we all profess to be notwithstanding the display of so many defect which tend to disgrace we in the eye of the world on may 18 he write to senator michel chevalier : and now my dear sir farewell i leave beautiful pari the day after to-morrow for my home on the other side of the atlantic more deeply impressed than ever with the grandeur of france and the liberality and hospitality of she courteous people so kindly manifest to I and mine i leave pari with many regret for my age admonish I that in all probability i shall never again visit europe sailing from havre on the st laurent on may 22 he and he family reach without untoward incident the home on the hudson and on June 21 he write to he son arthur who have remain abroad with he tutor : -- you see by the date where we all be once more i be seat at my table in the half octagon study under the south verandah never do the grove look more charming its general feature the same but the growth of the tree and shrubbery greatly increase faithful thoma devoy have prove himself to be a truly honest and efficient overseer the whole farm be in fine condition on Thursday last i be much gratify with mr leslie 's letter from copenhagen with he account of you reception by the king of denmark how gratify to I that the portrait of thorwaldsen have give such pleasure to the king and that he regard it as the best likeness of the great sculptor the story of morse 's presentation to the king of denmark of the portrait paint in rome in 1831 have already be tell in the first volume of this work the king as we learn from the above quotation be greatly please with it and in token of he gratification raise morse to the rank of knight commander of the dannebrog the rank of knight have be already confer on the inventor by the king 's predecessor on the throne in another letter to colonel leslie of November 2 1868 brief reference be make to matter political : -- to-morrow be the important day for decide we next four year ' ruler i be glad we continental brethren can not read we newspaper of the present day otherwise they must infer that we choice of ruler be make from a class more fit for the state 's prison than the state throne and elevation to a scaffold be more suit to the character of the individual candidate than elevation to office but in a few day matter will calm down and the business of the nation will assume its wonted aspect i have not engage in this warfare as a citizen i have my own view and give my vote on general principle but be prepare to learn that my vote be on the defeat side i presume that grant will be the president and i shall defer to the decision like a peaceable citizen the day after to-morrow you will know as well as we shall the probable result the telegraph be tell upon the world and its effect upon human affair be yet but faintly appreciate in this letter he also speak of the death of he youngest brother richard c morse who die at kissingen on September 22 1868 and in a letter to he son arthur of October 11 he again refer to it and add : it be a sad blow to all of we but particularly to the large circle of he child you two uncle and you father be a three-fold cord strongly unite in affection it be now sunder the youngest be take first and we that remain must soon follow he in the natural course of thing farther on in this letter he say : i attend the funeral of mr l -- a few week ago i be tell that he die of a broken heart from the conduct of he graceless son frank and i can easily understand that the course he have pursue and he drunken habit may have kill he father with as much certainty as if he have shoot he child have little conception of the effect of they conduct upon they parent they never know fully these anxiety until they be parent themselves but he sky be not all gray for in addition to he satisfaction in be once more at home in he own beloved country and in he quiet retreat on the hudson he be soon to be the recipient of a signal mark of respect and esteem by he own countryman which prove that this prophet be not without honor even in he own country new york November 30th 1868 professor sfb morse lld sir -- many of you countryman and numerous personal friend desire to give definite expression to the fact that this country be in full accord with european nation in acknowledge you title to the position of father of modern telegraphy and at the same time in a fitting manner to welcome you to you home they therefore request that you will name a day on which you will favor they with you company at a public banquet with great respect we remain very truly you friend here follow the name of practically every man of prominence in new york at that time morse reply on December 4 : -- to the hon hamilton fish hon john t hoffman hon wm dennison hon ag curtin hon wm e dodge peter cooper esq daniel huntington esq wm orton esq aa low esq jame brown esq cyrus w field esq john j cisco esq and other gentleman -- i have receive you flattering request of the 30th November propose the compliment of a public banquet to I and ask I to appoint a day on which it would be convenient for I to meet you do you proposal intend simply a personal compliment i should feel no hesitation in thank you cordially for this evidence of you personal regard while i decline you proffer honor but i can not fail to perceive that there be a paramount patriotic duty connect with you proposal which forbid I to decline you invitation in accept it therefore i would name -lrb- in view of some personal arrangement -rrb- Wednesday the 30th inst as the day which would be most agreeable to I accept gentleman the assurance of the respect of you obedient servant samuel fb morse the banquet be give at delmonico 's which be then on the corner of fifth avenue and fourteenth street and be preside over by chief justice salmon p chase who have be the leading counsel _ against _ morse in he first great lawsuit but who now cheerfully acknowledge that to morse and america the great invention of the telegraph be due about two hundred man sit down at the table among they some of the most eminent in the country morse sit at the right of chief justice chase and sir edward thornton british ambassador on he leave when the time for speechmaking come cyrus field read letter from president andrew johnson from general grant president-elect from speaker colfax admiral farragut and many other he also read a telegram from governor alexander h bullock of massachusett : massachusett honor she two son -- franklin and morse the one conduct the lightning safely from the sky the other conduct it beneath the ocean from continent to continent the one tame the lightning the other make it minister to human want and human progress from london come another message : -- cyrus w field new york the member of the joint committee of the anglo-american and atlantic telegraph company hear with pleasure of the banquet to be give this evening to professor morse and desire to greet that distinguished telegraphist and wish he all the compliment of the season mr field add : this telegram be send from london at four o'clock this afternoon and be deliver into the hand of you committee at 1250 this naturally elicit much applause and laughter speech then follow by other man prominent in various walk of life sir edward thornton say that he have great satisfaction in be able to contribute he mite of that admiration and esteem for professor morse which must be feel by all for so great a benefactor of he fellow creature and of posterity chief justice chase introduce the guest of the evening in the follow graceful word : -- many shine name will at once occur to any one at all familiar with the history of the telegraph among they i can pause to mention only those of volta the italian to whose discovery the battery be due oerst the dane who first discover the magnetic property of the electric current ampere and arago the frenchman who prosecute still further and most successfully similar research then sturgeon the englishman who may be say to have make the first electro-magnet next and not least illustrious among these illustrious man we countryman henry who first show the practicability of produce electro-magnetic effect by means of the galvanic current at distance infinitely great and finally steinheil the german who after the invention of the telegraph in all its material part be complete teach in 1837 the use of the ground as part of the circuit these be some of those searcher for truth whose name will be long hold in grateful memory and not among the least of they title to gratitude and remembrance will be the discovery which contribute to the possibility of the modern telegraph but these discovery only make the telegraph possible they offer the brilliant opportunity there be need a man to bring into be the new art and the new interest to which they point and it be the providential distinction and splendid honor of the eminent american who be we guest to-night that happily prepare by previous acquirement and pursuit he be quick to seize the opportunity and give to the world the first recording telegraph fortunate man thus to link he name forever with the greatest wonder and the greatest benefit of the age -lrb- great applause -rrb- i give you ` we guest professor sfb morse the man of science who explore the law of nature wrest electricity from she embrace and make it a missionary in the cause of human progress ' as the venerable inventor rise from he chair overcome with profound emotion which be almost too great to be control the whole assembly rise with he and cheer after cheer resound through the hall for many minute when at last quiet be restore he address the company at length give a resumé of he struggle and pay tribute to those who have befriend and assist he in he time of need -- to amo kendall who sit at the board with he and whose name call forth more cheer to alfred vail to leonard gale and in the largeness of he heart to foj smith it will not be necessary to give he remark in full as the history of the invention have already be give in detail in the course of this work but he conclude remark be worthy of record : -- in cast my eye around i be most agreeably greet by face that carry I back in memory to the day of my art struggle in this city the early day of the national academy of design brother -lrb- for you be yet brother -rrb- if i leave you rank you well know it cost I a pang i do not leave you until i see you well establish and enter on that career of prosperity due to you own just appreciation of the important duty belong to you profession you have a institution which now hold and if true to yourselve will continue to hold a high position in the estimation of this appreciative community if i have step aside from art to tread what seem another path there be a good precedent for it in the life of artist science and art be not oppose leonardo da vincus could find congenial relaxation in scientific research and invention and we own fulton be a painter whose scientific study result in steam navigation it may not be generally know that the important invention of the _ percussion cap _ be due to the scientific recreation of the english painter shaw but i must not detain you from more instructive speech one word only in close i have claim for america the origination of the modern telegraph system of the world impartial history i think will support that claim do not misunderstand I as disparage or disregard the labor and ingenious modification of other in various country employ in the same field of invention gladly do time permit would i descant upon they great and vary merit yet in trace the birth and pedigree of the modern telegraph ` american ' be not the highest term of the series that connect the past with the present there be at least one higher term the highest of all which can not and must not be ignore if not a sparrow fall to the ground without a definite purpose in the plan of infinite wisdom can the creation of a instrumentality so vitally affect the interest of the whole human race have a origin less humble than the father of every good and perfect gift i be sure i have the sympathy of such a assembly as be here gather if in all humility and in the sincerity of a grateful heart i use the word of inspiration in ascribe honor and praise to he to whom first of all and most of all it be preëminently due ` not unto we not unto we but to god be all the glory ' not what have man but ` what have god work ' more applause follow as morse take he seat and other speech be make by such man as professor goldwin smith the honorable william m evart aa low william cullen bryant william orton david dudley field the honorable william e dodge sir hugh allan daniel huntington and governor curtin of pennsylvanium while many of these speech be most eloquent and appropriate i shall quote from only one give as a excuse the word of jame d reid in he excellent work the telegraph in america : as mr huntington 's address contain some special thought show the relationship of the painter to invention and be besides a most affectionate and interesting tribute to he beloved master mr morse it be deem no discourtesy to the other distinguished speaker to give it nearly entire i shall however omit some portion which mr reid include in fact however every studio be more or less a laboratory the painter be a chemist delving into the secret of pigment varnish mixture of tint and mysterious preparation of grounds and overlay of color occult art by which the inward light be make to gleam from the canvas and the warm flesh to glow and palpitate the studio of my beloved master in whose honor we have meet to-night be indeed a laboratory vigorous life-like portrait poetic and historic group occasionally grow upon he easel but there be many hour -- yes day -- when absorb in study among galvanic battery and mysterious line of wire he seem to we like a alchemist of the middle age in search of the philosopher 's stone i can never forget the occasion when he call he pupil together to witness one of the first if not the first successful experiment with the electric telegraph it be in the winter of 1835-36 i can see now that rude instrument construct with a old stretching-frame a wooden clock a home-made battery and the wire stretch many time around the wall of the studio with eager interest we gather about it as we master explain its operation while with a click click the pencil by a succession of dot and line record the message in cypher the idea be bear the word circle that upper chamber as they do now the globe but we have little faith to we it seem the dream of enthusiasm we grieve to see the sketch upon the canvas untouch we long to see he again call into life event in we country 's history but it be not to be god 's purpose be be accomplish and now the world be witness to he triumph yet the love of art still live in some inner corner of he heart and i know he can never enter the studio of a painter and see the artist silently bring from the canvas form of life and beauty but he feel a tender twinge as one who catch a glimpse of the beautiful girl he love in he youth whom another have snatch away finally my dear master and father in art allow I in this moment of you triumph in the field of discovery to greet you in the name of you brother artist with ` all hail ' as a artist you might have spend life worthily in turn god 's bless daylight into sweet hue of rainbow color and into breathing form for the delight and consolation of man but it have be he will that you should train the lightning the sharp arrow of he anger into the swift yet gentle messenger of peace and love morse 's wife and he daughter and other lady have be present during the speech but they begin to take they leave after mr huntington 's address although the toastmaster arise to announce the last toast which be the lady so he say : this be the most inspiring theme of all but the theme itself seem to be vanish from we indeed -lrb- after a pause -rrb- have already vanish -lrb- after another pause and a glance around the room -rrb- and the gentleman who be to have respond seem also to have vanish with he theme i may assume therefore that the duty of the evening be perform and its enjoyment be at a end the unsought honor of this public banquet in he own country organize by the most eminent man of the day call forth eulogy of he in the public press of the whole world be justly esteem by morse as one of the crowning event of he long career but a even greater honor be still in store for he which will be describe in due season the early month of 1869 be almost entirely devote to he report as commissioner which be finally complete and send to the department of state in the latter part of march in this work he receive great assistance from professor wp blake who be in charge of publication and who write to he on march 29 : i have have only a short time to glance at it as it be deliver towards the close of the day but i be most impress by the amount of labor and care you have so evidently bestow upon it professor blake write another letter on August 21 which i be tempt to give almost in its entirety : -- i feel it to be my duty to write to you upon another point regard you report upon which i know that you be sensitive but as i think you will see that my motive be good and that i sincerely express they i believe you will not be offend with I although my view and opinion may not coincide exactly with yours i allude to the mention which you make of some of the eminent physicist who have contribute by they discovery and experiment to we knowledge of the phenomenon of electro-magnetism on page 9 of the manuscript you observe : ` the application of the electro-magnet the invention of arago and sturgeon -lrb- first combined and employ by morse in the construction of the generic telegraph -rrb- to the purpose also of the semaphore etc ' frankly i be pained not to see the name of henry there associate with those of arago and sturgeon for it be know and generally concede among man of science that he research and experiment and the result which he reach be of radical importance and value and that they deservedly rank with those of ampere arago and sturgeon i be aware that by some unfortunate combination of circumstance the personal relation of yourself and professor henry be not pleasant i deplore this and it would be a intense satisfaction to I if i could be the humble means of bring about a harmonious and honorable adjustment of the difference which separate you i write this without conference with professor henry or he friend i do it impartially first in the line of my duty as editor -lrb- but not now officially -rrb- second as a lover of science third with a patriotic desire to secure as much as justly can be for the scientific reputation of the country and fourth with a desire to promote harmony between all who be concern in increase and disseminate knowledge and particularly between such sincere lover of truth and justice as i believe both yourself and professor henry to be i do not find that professor henry anywhere make a claim which trench upon you claim of first use the electro-magnet for write or print at a distance -- the telegraph as distinguish from the semaphore this he can not claim for he acknowledge it to be yours you on the other hand do not claim the semaphoric use of electricity i therefore do not see any obstacle to a honorable adjustment of the difference which separate you and which perhaps make you disincline to freely associate professor henry 's name with those of other promoter of electrical science you report present a fitting opportunity to effect this result a magnanimous recognition by you of professor henry 's important contribution to the science of electro-magnetism appear to I to be all that be necessary they can be most appropriately and gracefully acknowledge in you report and you will gain rather than lose by so do such action on you part would do more than anything else could to secure for you the good will of all man of science and to hasten a universal and generous accord of all the credit for you great gift to civilization that you can properly desire now my dear sir with this frank statement of my view on this point i accept you invitation and will go to see you at you house to talk with you upon this point and other perhaps more agreeable but if after this expression of my inclination you will not deem I a welcome guest telegraph I not to come -- i will not take it unkindly to this morse reply on August 23 : you most acceptable letter with the tone and spirit of which i be most gratified be just receive for which accept my thanks i shall be most happy to see you and freely to communicate with you on the subject mention and with the sincere desire of a satisfactory result the visit be pay but the detail of the conversation have not be preserve however we find in morse 's report on page 10 the following : in 1825 mr sturgeon of england make the first electro-magnet in the horseshoe form by loosely wind a piece of iron wire with a spiral of copper wire in the united state as early as 1831 the experimental research of professor joseph henry be of great importance in advance the science of electro-magnetism he may be say to have carry the electro-magnet in its lifting power to its greatest perfection reflect upon the principle of professor schweigger 's galvanometer he construct magnet in which great power could be develop by a very small galvanic element he publish paper in 1831 show that he experiment with wire of different length and he note the amount of magnetism which could be induce through they at various length by means of battery compose of a single element and also of many element he state that the magnetic action of ' a current from a trough compose of many pair be at least not sensibly diminish by pass through a long wire ' and he incidentally note the bearing of this fact upon the project of a electro-magnetic telegraph -lrb- semaphore -rrb- in more recent papers first publish in 1857 it appear that professor henry demonstrate before he pupil the practicability of ring a bell by means of electro-magnetism at a distance whether professor blake be satisfy with this change from the original manuscript be not record morse evidently think that he have make the _ amende honorable _ but henry coldly proud man that he be still hold aloof from a reconciliation for i have be inform that he even refuse to be present at the memorial service hold in washington after the death of morse in a letter of may 10 1869 to dr leonard gale some interesting fact concern the reading by sound be give : -- the fact that the lever action of the earliest instrument of 1835 by its click give the sound of the numeral as embody in the original type be well know nor be there anything so remarkable in that result when you first see the instrument in 1836 this be so obvious that it scarcely excite more than a pass remark but after the adaptation of the dot and space with the addition of the line or dash in form the alphabetic sign -lrb- which as well as i can remember be about the same date late in 1835 or early in 1836 -rrb- then i notice that the different letter have each they own individual sound and could also be distinguish from each other by the sound the fact do not then appear to I to be of any great importance seem to be more curious than useful yet in reflect upon it it seem desirable to secure this result by specify it in my letter patent lest it might be use as a _ evasion _ in indicate my novel alphabet without record it hence the _ sound _ as well as the imprinted sign be specify in my letter patent as to the time when these sound be _ practically _ use i be unable to give a precise date i have a distinct recollection of one case and proximately the date of it the time of the incident be soon after the line be extend from philadelphium to washington have a way station at wilmington delaware the washington office be in the old post-office in the room above it i be in the operating room the instrument be for a moment silent i be stand at some distance near the fireplace converse with mr washington the operator who be by my side presently one of the instrument commence write and mr washington listen and smile i ask he why he smile ` oh ' say he ` that be zantzinger of the philadelphium office but he be operate from wilmington ' ` how do you know that ' ` oh i know he touch but i must ask he why he be in wilmington ' he then go to the instrument and telegraph to zantzinger at wilmington and the reply be that he have be send from philadelphium to regulate the relay magnet for the wilmington operator who be inexperienced in operate i give this instance not because it be the _ first _ but because it be one which i have specially treasured in my memory and frequently relate as illustrative of the practicality of reading by _ sound _ as well as by the write record this must have occur about the year 1846 a serious accident befall the aged inventor now seventy-nine year old in July 1869 he slip on the stair of he country house and fall with all he weight on he left leg which be break in two place this mishap confine he to he bed for three month and many fear that owe to he advanced age it would be fatal but thanks to he vigorous constitution and he temperate life he recover completely he bear this affliction with christian fortitude in a letter to he brother sidney of August 14 he say : the healing process in my leg be very slow the doctor who have just leave I condemn I to a fortnight more of close confinement i have other trouble for they come not singly but all be for the best trouble indeed come not singly for in addition to sorrow of a domestic nature he friend one by one be take from he by death and on November 12 1869 he write to william stickney esq son-in-law of amo kendall : -- although prepare by recent notice in the papers to expect the sad news which a telegram this moment receive announce to I of the death of my excellent long-tried friend mr kendall i confess that the intelligence have come with a shock which have quite unnerved I i feel the loss as of a _ father _ rather than of a brother in age for he be one in whom i confide as a father so sure be i of affectionate and sound advice i need not tell you how deeply i feel this sad bereavement i be truly and severely bereave in the loss of such a friend a friend indeed upon whose faithfulness and unswerving integrity i have ever repose with perfect confidence a confidence which have never be betray and a friend to whose energy and skill in the conduct of the agency which i have confide to he i owe -lrb- under god -rrb- the comparative comfort which a kind providence have permit I to enjoy in my advanced age in the following year he be call upon to mourn the death of still another of he good friend for on August 24 1870 george wood die very suddenly at saratoga while much of sadness and sorrow cloud the evening of the life of this truly great man the sun ere it sink to rest tinge the cloud with a glory seldom vouchsafe to a mortal for he be to see a statue erect to he while he be yet living of many man it have be say that -- want bread they receive only a stone and not even that until long after they have be starve to death it be morse 's good fortune not only to see the child of he brain grow to a sturdy manhood but to be honor during he lifetime to a truly remarkable degree the project of a memorial of some sort to the inventor of the telegraph be first broach by robert b hoover manager of the western union telegraph office allegheny city pennsylvanium the idea once start spread with the rapidity of the electric fluid itself and under the able management of jame d reid a fund be raise partly by dollar subscription largely make by telegraph operator all over the country include canada and it be decide that the testimonial should take the form of a bronze statue to be erect in central park new york byron m pickett be choose as the sculptor and the park commission readily grant permission to place the statue in the park it be at first hope that the unveiling might take place on the 27th of April 1871 morse 's eightieth birthday but unavoidable delay arise and it be not until the 10th of June that everything be in readiness it be a perfect June day and the hundred of telegrapher from all part of the country with they family spend the forenoon in a steamboat excursion around the city in the afternoon crowd flock to the park where near what be now call the inventor 's gate the statue stand in the angle between two platform for the invite guest morse himself refuse to attend the ceremony of the unveiling of he counterfeit presentment as be too great a strain on he innate modesty some person and some papers say that he be present but as mr jame d reid say in he telegraph in america mr morse be incapable of such a indelicacy man of refinement and modesty would justly have marvel have they see he in such a place at about four o'clock the governor of new york john t hoffman deliver the opening address say in the course of he speech : in we day a new era have dawn again for the second time in the history of the world the power of language be increase by human agency thanks to samuel fb morse man speak to one another now though separate by the width of the earth with the lightning 's speed and as if stand face to face if the inventor of the alphabet be deserving of the highest honor so be he whose great achievement mark this epoch in the history of language -- the inventor of the electric telegraph we intend so far as in we lie that the man who come after we shall be at no loss to discover he name for want of record testimony governor claflin of massachusett and william orton president of the western union telegraph company then draw aside the drapery amidst the cheer and applause of the multitude while the governor 's island band play the star-spangled banner william cullen bryant who be a early friend of the inventor then present the statue to the city in a eloquent address from which i shall quote the follow word : -- it may be say i know that the civilized world be already full of memorial which speak the merit of we friend and the grandeur and utility of he invention every telegraphic station be such a memorial every message send from one of these station to another may be count among the honor pay to he name every telegraphic wire string from post to post as it hum in the wind murmur he eulogy every sheaf of wire lay down in the deep sea occupy the bottom of soundless abyss to which human sight have never penetrate and carry the electric pulse charge with the burden of human thought from continent to continent from the old world to the new be a testimonial to he greatness the latin inscription in the church of st paul 's in london refer to sir christopher wren its architect -- ` if you would behold he monument look around you ' -- may be apply in a far more comprehensive sense to we friend since the great globe itself have become he monument the mayor of new york a oakey hall accept the statue in a short speech and after a prayer by the reverend stephen h tyng dd the assemble multitude join in sing the doxology and the ceremony at the park be end but other honor still await the venerable inventor for on the evening of that day the old academy of music on fourteenth street be pack with a dense throng gather together to listen to eulogy on this benefactor of he race and to hear he bid farewell to he child of the telegraph a table be place in the center of the stage on which be the original instrument use on the first line from washington to baltimore this be connect with all the line of telegraph extend to all part of the world the honorable william orton preside and after the reverend howard crosby have open the ceremony with prayer speech be deliver by mr orton dr george b loring of salem and the reverend dr george w samson at nine o'clock mr orton announce that all line be clear for the farewell message of the inventor to he child that this message would be flash to thousand of wait operator all over the world and that answer would be receive during the course of the evening the pleasant task of send the message have be delegate to miss sadie e cornwell a skilful young operator of attractive personality and morse himself be to manipulate the key which send he name in the dot and dash of he own alphabet over the wire the vast audience be hush into absolute silence as miss cornwell click off the message which morse have compose for the occasion : greet and thanks to the telegraph fraternity throughout the world glory to god in the highest on earth peace good will to man as mr orton escort morse to the table a tremendous burst of applause break out but be silence by a gesture from the preside officer and again the great audience be still slowly the inventor spell out the letter of he name the click of the instrument be clearly hear in every part of the house and as clearly understand by the hundred of telegrapher present so that without wait for the final dot which typify the letter e the whole vast assembly rise amid deafening cheer and the wave of handkerchief it be a inspiring moment and the venerable man be almost overcome by he emotion and sit for some time with he head bury in he hand strive to regain he self-control when the excitement have somewhat subside mr orton say : thus the father of the telegraph bid farewell to he child the current be then switch to a instrument behind the scene and answer come pour in first from near-by town and city and then from new orlean quebec san francisco halifax havana and finally from hongkong bombay and singapore mr reid have give a detailed account of these message in he telegraph in america but i shall not pause to reproduce they here neither shall i quote from the eloquent speech which follow deliver by general np bank the reverend hm gallagher gk walcott and jame d reid after miss antoinette sterling have sing auld lang syne to the great delight of the audience who recall she several time chief justice charle p daly introduce professor morse in a appropriate address as the white-haired inventor in whose honor this great demonstration have be organize step forward to deliver he valedictory he be greet with another round of cheer and applause at first almost overcome by emotion he soon recover he self-control and he read he address in a clear resonant voice which carry to every part of the house the address be a long one and as most of it be but a recapitulation of what have be already give i shall only quote from it in part : -- friend and child of the telegraph -- when i be solicit to be present this evening in compliance with the wish of those who with such zeal and success respond to the suggestion of one of you number that a commemorative statue should be erect in we unrivaled park and which have this day be place in position and unveil i hesitate to comply not that i do not feel a wish in person to return to you my heartfelt thanks for this unique proof of you personal regard but truly from a fear that i could use no term which would adequately express my appreciation of you kindness whatever i say must fall short of express the grateful feeling or conflict emotion which agitate I on a occasion so unexampled in the history of invention gladly would i have shrink from this public demonstration be it not that my absence to-night under the circumstance might be construe into a apathy which i do not feel and which you overpowering kindness would justly rebuke you have choose to impersonate in my humble effigy a invention which cradle upon the ocean have its birth in a american ship it be nurse and cherish not so much from personal as from patriotic motive forecast its future even at its birth my most powerful stimulus to perseverance through all the peril and trial of its early day -- and they be neither few nor insignificant -- be the thought that it must inevitably be world-wide in its application and moreover that it would everywhere be hail as a grateful american gift to the nation it be in this aspect of the present occasion that i look upon you proceedings as intend not so much as homage to a individual as to the invention ` whose line -lrb- from america -rrb- have go out through all the earth and they word to the end of the world ' in the carrying-out of any plan of improvement however grand or feasible no single individual could possibly accomplish it without the aid of other we be none of we so powerful that we can dispense with the assistance in various department of the work of those whose experience and knowledge must supply the need aid of they expertness it be not sufficient that a brilliant project be propose that its mode of accomplishment be foresee and properly devise there be in every part of the enterprise other mind and other agency to be consult for information and counsel to perfect the whole plan the chief justice in deliver the decision of the supreme court say : ` it can make no difference whether he -lrb- the inventor -rrb- derive he information from book or from conversation with man skilled in the science ' and : ` the fact that morse seek and obtain the necessary information and counsel from the best source and act upon it neither impair he rights as a inventor nor detract from he merit ' the inventor must seek and employ the skilled mechanician in he workshop to put the invention into practical form and for this purpose some pecuniary means be require as well as mechanical skill both these be at hand alfr vail of morristown new jersey with he father and brother come to the help of the unclothed infant and with they fund and mechanical skill put it into a condition to appear before the congress of the nation to these new jersey friend be due the first important aid in the progress of the invention aid also by the talent and scientific skill of professor gale my esteemed colleague in the university the telegraph appear in washington in 1838 a suppliant for the means to demonstrate its power to the honorable foj smith then chairman of the house committee of commerce belong the credit of a just appreciation of the new invention and of a zealous advocacy of a experimental essay and the inditing of a admirably write report in its favor sign by every member of the committee to ezra cornell whose noble benefaction to he state and the country have place he name by the side of cooper and peabody high on the roll of public benefactor be due the credit of early and effective aid in the superintendence and erection of the first public line of telegraph ever establish after pay tribute to the name of amo kendall cyrus field volta oerst arago schweigger gauss and weber steinheil daniell grove cooke dana henry and other he continue : -- there be not a name i have mention and many whom i have not mention whose career in science or experience in mechanical and engineering and nautical tactic or in financial practice might not be the theme of volume rather than of brief mention in a ephemeral address to-night you have before you a sublime proof of the grand progress of the telegraph in its march round the globe it be but a few day since that we veritable antipode become telegraphically unite to we we can speak to and receive a answer in a few seconds of time from hongkong in china where ten o'clock to-night here be ten o'clock in the day there and it be perhaps a debatable question whether they ten o'clock be ten to-day or ten to-morrow china and new york be in interlocutory communication we know the fact but can imagination realize the fact but i must not further trespass on you patience at this late hour i can not close without the expression of my cordial thanks to my long-known long-tried and honor friend

excitement cause by all these enthusiastic demonstration in he honor tell upon the inventor both physically and mentally as we learn from a letter of June 14 1871 to he daughter mr lind and she husband : -- so fatigued that i can scarcely keep my eye open i nevertheless before retire to my bed must drop you a line of enquiry to know what be you condition we have only hear of you arrival and of you first unfavorable impression i hope these latter be remove and that you be both benefit by change of air and the water of the clifton spring you know how in the last few day we have all be overwhelm with unusual care the grand ceremony of the park and the academy of music be over but have leave I in a good-for-nothing condition everything go off splendidly indeed as you will learn from the papers i find it more difficult to bear up with the overwhelming praise that be pour out without measure than with the trial of my former life there be something so remarkable in this universal laudation that the effect on I strange as it may seem be rather depressing than exhilarating when i review my past life and see the way in which i have be lead i be so convinced of the faithfulness of god in answer to the prayer of faith which i have be enable in time of trial to offer to he that i find the temper of my mind be to constant praise : ` bless the lord oh my soul and forget not all he benefit ' be ever recur to I it be doubtless this continue refer all to he that prevent this universal demonstration of kindly feel from puff I up with the false notion that i be anything but the feeblest of instrument i can not give you any idea of the peculiar feeling which gratify and yet oppress I he have plan to cross the ocean once more partly as a delegate to russium from the evangelical alliance and partly to see whether it would not be possible to induce prussium and switzerland and other european nation from whom he have as yet receive no pecuniary remuneration to do he simple justice but for various reason this trip be abandon and from those nation he never receive anything but medal and praise so the last summer of the aged inventor 's life be spend at he beloved locust grove not free from care and anxiety as he so well deserve but nevertheless thanks to he christian philosophy in comparative serenity and happiness he pastor in poughkeepsie the reverend fb wheeler say of he in a letter to mr prune : in he whole character and in all he relation he be one of the most remarkable man of he age he be one who draw all who come in contact with he to he heart disarm all prejudice silence all cavil in he family he be light life and love with those in he employ he be ever considerate and kind never exact and harsh but honorable and just seek the good of every dependent in the community he be a pillar of strength and beauty command the homage of universal respect in the church he walk with god and man that he be a man of great versatility have be show in the recital of he activity as artist inventor and writer that he have no mean ability as a poet be also on record on January 6 1872 he say in a letter to he cousin mr thoma r walker : some year ago when both of we be younger i remember address to you a trifle entitle ` the serenade ' which on be show to mr verplanck be request for publication in the ` talisman ' edit and conduct by he and mr sand i have not see a copy of that work for many year and have preserve no copy of ` the serenade ' if you have a copy i should be please to have it he be delicately discreet in say some year ago for this poem be write in 1827 as the result of a wager between morse and he young cousin he have assert that he could write poetry as well as paint picture and request she to give he a theme it seem that the young lady have be pay the compliment of a serenade a few night previously but she have most unromantically sleep through it all so she give as she theme the serenade and the next day morse produce the follow poem : -- the serenade haste ' t be the stillest hour of night the moon shed down she palest light and sleep have chained the lake and hill the wood the plain the babble rill and where yon ivied lattice show my fair one slumber in repose come ye that know the lovely maid and help prepare the serenade hither before the night be fly bring instrument of every tone but lest with noise ye wake not lull she dream fancy ye must cull such only as shall soothe the mind and leave the harshest all behind bring not the thunder drum nor yet the harshly-shrieking clarionet nor scream hautboy trumpet shrill nor clang cymbal but with skill exclude each one that would disturb the fairy architect or curb the wild creation of they mirth all that would wake the soul to earth choose ye the softly-breathing-flute the mellow horn the loving lute the viol you must not forget and take the sprightly flageolet and grave bassoon choose too the fife whose warbling in the tuneful strife mingle in mystery with the word may seem like note of blithest bird be ye prepared now lightly tread as if by elfin minstrel lead and fling no sound upon the air shall rudely wake my slumbering fair softly now breathe the symphony so gently breathe the tone may vie in softness with the magic note in vision hear music that float so buoyant that it well may seem with strain ethereal in she dream one song of such mysterious birth she doubt it come from heaven or earth play on my loved one slumber still play on she wake not with the thrill of joy produce by strain so mild but fancy mould they gay and wild now as the music low decline ' t be sigh of the forest pine or ' t be the fitful varied war of distant fall or troubled shore now as the tone grow full or sharp ' t be whisper of the æolian harp the viol swell now low now loud ' t be spirit chant on a cloud that pass by it die away so gently die she scarce can say ' t be go listen ' t be lose she fear listen and think again she hear as dew drop mingle in a stream to she ' t be all one blissful dream a song of angel thron in light softly away fair one good-night in the autumn of 1871 morse return with he family to new york and it be record that with a apparent premonition that he should never see he beloved locust grove again he order the carriage to stop as he drive out of the gate and stand up look long and lovingly at the familiar scene before tell the coachman to drive on and as he pass the rural cemetery on the way to the station he exclaim : beautiful beautiful but i shall not lie there i have prepare a place elsewhere not long after he return to the city death once more lay its heavy hand upon he in the loss of he sole survive brother sidney while this be a crush blow for these two brother have be peculiarly attach to each other he bear it with christian resignation confident that the separation would be for a short time only -- we must soon follow i also be over eighty year and be wait till my change come but he mind be active to the very end and he never cease to do all in he power for the welfare of mankind one of the last letter write by he on a subject of public importance be send on December 4 1871 to cyrus field who be then attend a important telegraphic convention in rome : -- excuse my delay in write you the excitement occasion by the visit of the grand duke alexi have but just cease and i have be wholly engross by the various duty connect with he presence i have wish for a few calm moment to put on paper some thought respect the doings of the great telegraphic convention to which you be a delegate the telegraph have now assume such a marvellous position in human affair throughout the world its influence be so great and important in all the varied concern of nation that its efficient protection from injury have become a necessity it be a powerful advocate for universal peace not that of itself it can command a ` peace be still ' to the angry wave of human passion but that by its rapid interchange of thought and opinion it give the opportunity of explanation to act and to law which in they ordinary wording often create doubt and suspicion be there no means of quick explanation it be readily see that doubt and suspicion working on the susceptibility of the public mind would engender misconception hatred and strife how important then that in the intercourse of nation there should be the ready means at hand for prompt correction and explanation could there not be pass in the great international convention some resolution to the effect that in whatever condition whether of peace or war between the nation the telegraph should be deem a sacred thing to be by common consent effectually protect both on the land and beneath the water in the interest of human happiness of that ` peace on earth ' which in announce the advent of the savior the angel proclaim with ` good will to man ' i hope that the convention will not adjourn without adopt a resolution asking of the nation they unite effective protection to this great agent of civilization richly as he deserve that he sun should set in a unclouded sky this be not to be sorrow of a most intimate nature crowd upon he he be also make the victim of a conscienceless swindler who fleece he of many thousand dollar and to crown all he old and indefatigable enemy foj smith administer a cowardly thrust in the back when he weakening power prevent he from defend himself with he oldtime vigor from a very long letter write by smith on December 11 1871 to henry j roger in washington i shall quote only the first sentence : -- dear sir -- in my absence you letter of the 11th ult be receive here with the print circular of the national monumental society in reply to which i feel constrain to say if that highly laudable association resolve to erect at the national capital of the united state a memorial monument to symbolize in statuary of colossal proportion the history of the electromagnetic telegraph before that history have be authentically write it be my conviction : that the statue most worthy to stand upon the pedestal of such monument would be that of the man of true science who explore the law of nature ahead of all other man and be the first to wrest electron-magnetism from nature 's embrace and make it a missionary to the cause of human progress and that man be professor joseph henry of the smithsonian institution professor morse and he early coadjutor would more appropriately occupy in group of high relief the side of that pedestal symbolize by they established merit and cooperative work the grandeur of the research and result discovery of they leader and chief who be the first to announce and to demonstrate to a despairing world by actual mechanical agency the practicability of a electro-magnetic telegraph through any distance much more of the same flatulent bombast follow which it will not be necessary to introduce here while morse himself naturally feel some delicacy in notice such a attack as this he find a willing and efficient champion in he old friend -lrb- and the friend of henry as well -rrb- professor leonard d gale who write to he on January 22 1872 : -- i have lately see a mean unfair and villainous letter of foj smith address to hj roger -lrb- officer of the morse monumental association -rrb- allege that the place on the monument design to be occupy by the statue of morse should be award to henry that morse be not a scientific man etc etc it be write in he own peculiar style the allegation be so outrageous that i feel it my duty to reply to it without delay as smith 's letter be to roger as a officer of the association i send my reply to the same person i enclose a copy herewith mr gale suggest a additional figure to the group on the monument -- a serpent with the face of foj bite the heel of morse but with the fang extract professor gale 's letter to henry j roger be worthy of be quote in full : -- i have just read a letter from foj smith date December 11 1871 address to you and design to throw discredit on morse 's invention of the telegraph the burden of which seem to be rebuke to the designer of the monument for elevate morse to the apex of the monument and claim for professor j henry of the smithsonian institution that high distinction the first question of a impartial inquirer be : ` to which of these gentleman be the honor due ' to ascertain this we will ask a second question : ` be the subject of the invention a _ machine _ or be it _ a new fact in science _ ' the answer be : ` it be a _ machine _ ' the first be morse 's the latter be henry 's henry state that electric current might be send through long distance applicable to telegraphic purpose morse take the fact as they then exist invent a machine harness the steed therein and set the creature to work there be honor due to henry for he great discovery of the scientific principle there be honor also due to morse for he invention of the ingenious machine which accomplish the work man of science regard the discovery of a new fact in science as a higher attainment than the application of it to useful purpose while the world at large regard the _ application _ of the principle or fact in science to the useful art as of paramount importance all honor to the discoverer of a new fact in science equal honor to he who utilize that fact for the benefit of mankind have the world forget what robert fulton do for the navigation of the water by steamboat it be he who first apply steam to propel a vessel and navigate the hudson for the first time with steam and paddle-wheel and vessel in 1807 do not we honor he as the father of steamboat yet fulton do not invent steam nor the steam-engine nor paddle-wheels nor the vessel he merely adapt a steam-engine to a vessel arm with paddle-wheel the combination be he invention there be another example on record cyrus h mccormick the father of the reap and mow machine take out the first successful patent in 1837 and be justly acknowledge the world over as the inventor of this great machine although one hundred and forty-six patent be grant in england previous to mccormick 's time they be but so many unsuccessful effort to perfect a practical machine the cut apparatus the device to raise and lower the cutter the lever the platform the wheel the framework have all be use before mccormick 's time but mccormick be the first genius able to put these separate device together in a practical harmonious operation the combination be he invention morse do more he invent the form of the various part of he machine as well as they combination he be the first to put such a machine into practical operation and for such a purpose who can question he title as the inventor of the electric telegraph to the letter of professor gale morse reply on January 25 : -- thank you sincerely for you effective interference in my favor in the recent but not unexpected attack of foj i will so soon as i can free myself from some very press matter write you more fully on the subject yet i can add nothing to you perfectly clear exposition of the difference between a discovery of a principle in science and its application to a useful purpose as for smith 's suggestion of put henry on the top of the propose monument i can hardly suppose professor h would feel much gratification on learn the character of he zealous advocate it be simply a matter of spite carry out he intense and smother antipathy to I and not for any particular regard for professor h as i have have nothing to do with the propose monument i have no feeling on the subject if they who have the direction of that monument think the put of professor h on the apex will meet the applause of the public include the express opinion of the entire world by all means put he there i certainly shall make no complaint the monument be never erect and this effort of smith 's to humiliate morse prove abortive but he spite do not end there as we learn from the follow letter write by morse on February 26 1872 to the reverend aspinwall hodge of hartford connecticut the husband of one of he niece : -- some unknown person have send I the advance sheet of a work -lrb- the page between 1233 and 1249 -rrb- publishing in hartford the title of which be not give but i think be something like ` the great industry of the united state ' the page send I be entitle ` the american magnetic telegraph ' they contain the most atrocious and vile attack upon I which have ever appear in print i shall be glad to learn who be the publisher of this work what be the character of the publisher and whether they will give I the name or name of the author or author of this diatribe and whether they vouch for the character of those who furnish the article for they work i know well enough indeed who the libeller be and they motive which arise from pure spite and revenge for have be legally defeat party in case relate to the telegraph before the court to you i can say the concocter of this tirade be foj smith of bad notoriety and henry o'reilly be the publisher responsible man and be they aware of the character of those who have give they that article particularly the moral character of smith notorious for he debauchery and condemn in court for subornation of perjury and one of the most revengeful man who have artfully get up this tirade because my agent the late honorable amo kendall be compel to resist he unrighteous claim upon I for some $ 25000 which after repeat trial last some twelve year be at length by a decision of the supreme court of the united state decide against he and he be adjudge to owe I some $ 14000 mr kendall previous to he decease manage the case which have thus result the necessity of seize some property of he in the city of williamsburg through the course of the legal proceedings have arouse he revengeful feeling and he have openly threaten that he would be revenge upon I for it and he have for two or three year past with o'reilly be concoct this mode of revenge if the publisher be respectable man i think they will regret that they have be the dupe of these arch conspirator if not too late to suppress that article i should be glad of a interview with they in which i will satisfy they that they have be most egregiously impose upon this be the last flash of that old fire which when he be sufficiently arouse by righteous indignation at unjust attack have enable he to strike out vigorously in self-defense and have win he many a victory he be now near the end of he physical resource he have fight the good fight and he have no misgiving as to the verdict of posterity on he achievement he could fight no more willing and mentally able though he be to confound he enemy again he must leave it to other to defend he fame and good name in the future the last letter which be copy into he letter-press book be write on march 14 not three week before the last summons come to he and it refer to he old enemy who thus pursue he even to the brink of the grave it be address to fj mead esq : -- although forbid to read or write by my physician who find I prostrate with a severe attack of neuralgia in the head i yet must thank you for you kind letter of the 12th inst i should be much gratified to know what part professor henry have take if any in this atrocious and absurd attack of foj i have no fear of the result but no desire either to suspect any agency on the part of professor henry it be difficult for I to conceive that a man in he position should not see the true position of the matter this vicious attack have no effect upon he fame die as soon as it be bear choke by its own venom it be overwhelm by the wave of sorrow and sympathy which sweep over the earth at the announcement of the death of the great inventor he last public appearance be on January 17 1872 when he in company with horace greeley unveil the statue of benjamin franklin in printing house square new york it be a very cold day but against the advice of he physician and he family he insist on be present as he drive up in he carriage and escort by the committee

devotion to the interest of universal humanity be the seed of further fruit for the good of the world morse be to have be a honor guest at the banquet in the evening where in the speech he name be couple with that of franklin as one of the great benefactor of mankind but yield to the wish of he family he remain at home he have all he life be a sufferer from severe headache and now these neuralgic pain increase in severity no doubt aggravate by he exposure at the unveiling when the paroxysm be upon he he walk the floor in agony press he hand to he temple but these seizure be mercifully not continuous and he still write voluminous letter and try to solve the problem which be thrust upon he even to the end one of the last act of he life be to go down town with he youngest son whose birthday be the 29th of march to purchase for he he first gold watch and that watch the son still carry a precious memento of he father gradually the pain in the head grow less severe but great weakness follow and he be compel to keep to he bed sink into a peaceful painless unconsciousness relieve by a occasional flash of he old vigor to he pastor reverend dr william adam he express he gratitude for the goodness of god to he but add : the best be yet to come he rouse himself on the 29th of march the birthday of he son kiss he and gaze with pleasure on a drawing send to the boy by he cousin mary goodrich pronounce it excellent shortly before the end pneumonia set in and one of the attend physician tap on he chest say this be the way we doctor telegraph and the die man with a momentary gleam of the old humor light up he fading eye whisper very good these be the last word speak by he from a letter write by one who be present at he bedside to another member of the family i shall quote a few word : he be fast pass away it be touch to see he so still so unconscious of all that be pass wait for death he have suffer much with neuralgia of the head increase of late by a miserable pamphlet by foj poor dear man strange that they could not leave he in peace in he old age but now all sorrow be forget he lie quiet infant heaven be open to he with its peace and perfect rest the doctor call he sickness ` exhaustion of the brain ' he look very handsome the light of heaven seem shine on he beautiful eye on April 1 consciousness return for a few moment and he recognize he wife and those around he with a smile but without be able to speak then he gradually sink to sleep and on the next day he gently breathe he last he faithful and loving friend jame d reid in the journal of the telegraph of which he be editor pay tribute to he memory in the follow touching word : -- in the ripeness and mellow sunshine of the end of a honor and protracted life professor morse the father of the american telegraph system we own beloved friend and father have go to he rest the telegraph the child of he own brain have long since whisper to every home in all the civilized world that the great inventor have pass away man as they pass each other on the street say with the subdue voice of personal sorrow ` morse be dead ' yet to we he live if he be dead it be only to those who do not know he it be not the habit of ardent affection to be garrulous in the excitement of such a occasion as this it would fain gaze on the dead face in silence the pen conscious of its weakness hesitate in its work of endeavor to reveal that which the heart can alone interpret in a language sacred to itself and by tear no eye may ever see for such reason we who have so much enjoy the sweetness of the presence of this venerable man now so calm in he last sacred sleep to whom he often come with he cheerful and gentle way as to a son so confide of he heart 's tenderest thought so free in the expression of he hope of the life beyond find difficulty in make the necessary record of he decease we can only tell what the world have already know by the everywhere present wire that on the evening of Tuesday April 2 professor morse in the beautiful serenity of christian hope after a life extend beyond fourscore year fold he hand upon he breast and bid the earth and generation and nation he have honor farewell in the evening post probably from the pen of he old friend william cullen bryant be the following : -- the name of morse will always stand in the foremost rank of the great inventor each of whom have change the face of society and give a new direction to the growth of civilization by the application to the art of one great think it will always be read side by side with those of gutenberg and schoeffer or watt and fulton this eminence he fairly earn by one splendid invention but none who know the man will be satisfy to let this world-wide and forever grow monument be the sole record of he greatness have he never think of the telegraph he would still receive in death the highest honor friendship and admiration can offer to distinguished and vary ability associate with a noble character in early life he show the genius of a truly great artist in after year he exercise all the power of a masterly scientific investigator throughout he career he be eminent for the loftiness of he aim for he resolute faith in the strength of truth for he capacity to endure and to wait and for he fidelity alike to he conviction and to he friend he intellectual eminence be limit to no one branch of human effort but in the judgment of man who know he best he have endowment which might have make he have he not be the chief of inventor the most powerful of advocate the boldest and most effective of artist the most discerning of scientific physician or a administrative officer worthy of the highest place and of the best day in american history the new york herald say : -- morse be perhaps the most illustrious american of he age look over the expanse of the age we think more earnestly and lovingly of cadmus who give we the alphabet of archimede who invent the lever of euclid with he demonstration in geometry of faust who teach we how to print of watt with he development of steam than of the resonant orator who inflamed the passion of mankind and the gallant chieftain who lead mankind to war we decorate history with we napoleon and wellington but it be better for the world that steam be demonstrate to be a active manageable force than that a french emperor and he army should win the battle of austerlitz and when a napoleon of peace like the dead morse have pass away and we come to sum up he life we gladly see that the world be better society more generous and enlarged and mankind nearer the ultimate fulfillment of its earthly mission because he live and do the work that be in he the louisville courier-journal go even higher in its praise : -- if it be legitimate to measure a man by the magnitude of he achievement the greatest man of the nineteenth century be dead some day ago the electric current bring we the intelligence that sfb morse be smite with paralysis since then it have bring we the bulletin of he condition as promptly as if we have be live in the same square entertaining we with hope which the mournful sequel have prove to be delusive for the magic wire have just thrill with the tiding to all nation that the father of telegraphy have pass to the eternal world almost as quietly as the all-seeing eye see the soul depart from that venerable form mortal man thousand of mile distant be apprise of the same fact by the swift messenger which he win from the unknown -- speak as it go around its world-wide circuit in all the language of earth professor morse take no royal road to this discovery indeed it be never a characteristic of genius to seek such road he be dependent necessarily upon fact and principle bring to light by similar diligent patient mind which have go before he volta galvani morcel grove faraday franklin and a host of other have lay a basis of law and theory upon which he humbly and reverently mount and arrange he great problem for the hoped-for solution but to he be reserve the sole undivided glory of discover the priceless gem ` richer than all its tribe ' which lay just beneath the surface and around which so many _ savan _ have blindly grope he be dead but he mission be fully complete it have be no man 's fortune to leave behind he a more magnificent legacy to earth or a more absolute title to a glorious immortality to the honor of be one of the most distinguished benefactor of the human race he add the personal and social grace and virtue of a true gentleman and a christian philosopher the memory of he private worth will be keep green amid the immortal of sorrowing friendship for a lifetime only but he life monument will endure among man as long as the human race exist upon earth the funeral service be hold on Friday April 5 at the madison square presbyterian church at eleven o'clock the long procession enter the church in the follow order : -- rev wm

whose fame we celebrate it be in god 's good providence vouchsafe otherwise the little thread of wire place as a timid experiment between the national capital and a neighboring city grow and lengthen

memorial service be hold in faneuil hall boston at which the mayor of the city preside and address be make by josiah quincy professor en horsford the honorable richard h dana and other other city all over the country and in foreign land hold commemorative service and every telegraph office in the country be drape in mourning in sad remembrance of he whom all delighted to call father mr prime in he closing review of morse 's character use the follow word : -- it be not give to mortal to leave a perfect example for the admiration and imitation of posterity but it be safe to say that the life and character of few man whose history be leave on record afford less opportunity for criticism than be find in the conspicuous career of the inventor of the telegraph have follow he step by step from the birth to the grave in public social and private relation in struggle with poverty enemy and wrong in court of law the press and hall of science have see he tempt assail defeat and again in victory honor and renown have read thousand of he private letter he essay and pamphlet and volume in which he claim be canvass he merit discuss and he character review have have access to he most private papers and confidential correspondence in which all that be most secret and sacred in the life of man be hide -- it be right to say that in this mass of testimony by friend and foe there be not a line that require to be erase or change to preserve the lustre of he name it be the device and purpose of those who seek to rob he of he honor and he rights to depreciate he intellectual ability and he scientific attainment but among all the man of science and of learn in the law there be not one who be a match for he when he give he mind to a subject which require he perfect mastery he draw up the brief with he own hand for one of the distinguished counsel in a great lawsuit involve he patent rights and he lawyer say it be the argument that carry conviction to every unprejudiced mind such be the versatility and variety of he mental endowment that he would have be great in any department of human pursuit he wonderful rapidity of thought be associate with patient plodding perseverance a combination rare but mightily effective he leap to a possible conclusion and then slowly develop the successive step by which the end be gain and the result make secure he cover thousand of page with he pencil note annotated large and numerous volume fill huge folio with valuable excerpt from newspaper illustrate process of think with diagram and be thus fortify and enrich with store of knowledge and mass of fact so digested combine and arrange that he have they at he easy command to defend the past or to help he onward to fresh conquest in the field of truth yet such be he modesty and reticence in regard to himself that none outside of he household be aware of he resource and he attainment be only know when display in self-defense then they never fail to be ample for the occasion as every opponent have reason to remember yet he be gentle as he be great many think he weak because he be simple childlike and unworldly often he suffer wrong rather than resist and this disposition to yield be frequently he loss the firmness tenacity and perseverance with which he fight he foe be the fruit of he integrity principle and profound conviction of right and duty he nature be a rare combination of solid intellect and delicate sensibility thoughtful sober and quiet he readily enter into the enjoyment of domestic and social life indulge in sally of humor and readily appreciate and greatly enjoy the wit of other dignified in he intercourse with man courteous and affable with the gentler sex he be a good husband a judicious father a generous and faithful friend he have the misfortune to incur the hostility of man who would deprive he of he merit and the reward of he labor but this be the common fate of great inventor he live until he rights be vindicate by every tribunal to which they could be refer and acknowledge by all civilized nation and he die leave to he child a spotless and illustrious name and to he country the honor of have give birth to the only electro-magnetic recording telegraph whose line be go out through all the earth and its word to the end of the world and now my pleasant task be end after the lapse of so many year it have be possible for I to introduce much more evidence of a personal nature to reveal the character of those with whom morse have to contend than would have be discreet or judicious during the lifetime of some of the actor in the drama many attempt have be make since the death of the inventor to minimize he fame and to exalt other at he expense but while these attempt have seem to triumph for a time while they may have influence a few mind and cause erroneous attribution to be make in some publication they effect be ephemeral for truth be mighty and will prevail and the more carefully and exhaustively this complicated subject be study the more apparent will it be that morse never claim more than be he due that he upright truthloving character as reveal in he intimate correspondence and in the testimony of he contemporary forbid he ever stoop to deceit or wilful appropriation of the idea of other a summary in as few word as possible of what morse actually invent or discover may be at this point appropriate in 1832 he conceive the idea of a true electric telegraph -- a write at a distance by means of the electromagnet the use of the electro-magnet for this purpose be original with he it be entirely different from any form of telegraph devise by other and he be not aware at the time that any other person have even combine the word electric and telegraph the mechanism to produce the desire result roughly draw in the 1832 sketch-book be elaborate and make by morse alone and produce actual result in 1835 1836 and 1837 still further perfect by he with the legitimate assistance of other it become the universal telegraph of to-day hold its own and successfully contend with all other plan of telegraph devise by other he devise and perfect the dot-and-dash alphabet in 1836 he discover the principle of the relay in 1838 he receive a french patent for a system of railway telegraph which also embody the principle of the police and fire-alarm telegraph at the same time he suggest a practical form of military telegraph in 1842 he lay the first subaqueous cable in 1842 he discover with dr fisher the principle of duplex telegraphy and he be also the first to experiment with wireless telegraphy in addition to he electrical invention and discovery he be the first to experiment with the daguerreotype in america and with professor draper be the first in the world to take portrait by this mean daguerre himself not think it possible the verdict of the world as pronounced at the time of he death have be strengthen with the lapse of year he be one of the first to be immortalize in the hall of fame he name like those of volta galvani ampere and other have be incorporate into everyday speech and be now use to symbolize the language of that simple but marvellous
