produce by ted garvin dave morgan and the online distribute proofread team joy and power three message with one meaning by henry van dyke 1903 dedicate to my friend john huston finley president of the college of the city of new york the preface the three message which be bring together in this book be give not far apart in time though at some distance from one another in space the one call joy and power be deliver in lo angele californium at the opening of the presbyterian general assembly may 21 1903 the one call the battle of life be deliver on baccalaureate Sunday at princeton university June 7 the one call the good old way be deliver on baccalaureate Sunday at harvard university June 14 at the time i be think chiefly of the different quality and need of the people to whom i have to speak this will account for some thing in the form of each message but now that they be put together i can see that all three of they say about the same thing they point in the same direction urge the same course of action and appeal to the same motive it be nothing new -- the meaning of this threefold message -- but it be the best that i have learn in life and i believe it be true -- so true that we need often to have it bring to remembrance henry van dyke avalon July 5 1903 contents i joy and power ii the battle of life iii the good old way joy and power <i> st john viii 17 : if ye know these thing happy be ye if ye do they </i> i ask you to think for a little while about the religion of christ in its relation to happiness this be only one point in the circle of truth at the center of which jesus stand but it be a important point because it mark one of the line of power which radiate from he to look at it clearly and steadily be not to disregard other truth the mariner take the whole heaven of astronomy for grant while he shape he course by a single star in the wish for happiness all man be strangely alike in they explanation of it and in they way of seek it they be singularly different shall we think of this wish as right or wrong as a true star or a will-o ' - the-wisp if it be right to wish to be happy what be the condition on which the fulfilment of this wish depend these be the two question with which i would come to christ seek instruction and guidance i the desire of happiness beyond all doubt be a natural desire it be the law of life itself that every be seek and strive toward the perfection of its kind the realization of its own specific ideal in form and function and a true harmony with its environment every drop of sap in the tree flow toward foliage and fruit every drop of blood in the bird beat toward flight and song in a conscious be this movement toward perfection must take a conscious form this conscious form be happiness -- the satisfaction of the vital impulse -- the rhythm of the inward life -- the melody of a heart that have find its keynote to say that all man long for this be simply to confess that all man be human and that they thought and feeling be a essential part of they life virtue mean a complete manhood the joyful welfare of the soul belong to the fulness of that ideal holiness be wholeness in strive to realize the true aim of we be we find the wish for happiness implant in the very heart of we effort now what do christ say in regard to this natural human wish do he say that it be a illusion do he condemn and deny it would he have accept goethe 's definition : religion be renunciation surely such a notion be far from the spirit of jesus there be nothing of the hardness of stoicism the coldness of buddhism in christ 's gospel it be humane sympathetic consoling unrest and weariness the fever of passion and the chill of despair soul-solitude and heart-trouble be the very thing that he come to cure he begin he great discourse with a series of beatitude bless be the word happy be the meaning nine time he ring the change on that word like a silver bell sound from he fair temple on the mountain-side call all who long for happiness to come to he and find rest for they soul christ never ask we to give up merely for the sake of give up but always in order to win something better he come not to destroy but to fulfil -- to fill full -- to replenish life with true inward lasting riches he gospel be a message of satisfaction of attainment of felicity its voice be not a sigh but a song its final word be a benediction a good-saying these thing have i speak unto you that my joy might remain in you and that you joy might be full if we accept he teaching we must believe that man be not wrong in wish for happiness but wrong in they way of seek it earthly happiness -- pleasure that belong to the sens and perish with they -- earthly happiness be a dream and a delusion but happiness on earth -- spiritual joy and peace blossoming here fruit hereafter -- immortal happiness be the keynote of life in christ and if we come to he he tell we four great secret in regard to it i it be inward and not outward and so it do not depend on what we have but on what we be ii it can not be find by direct seek but by set we face toward the thing from which it flow and so we must climb the mount if we would see the vision we must tune the instrument if we would hear the music iii it be not solitary but social and so we can never have it without share it with other iv it be the result of god 's will for we and not of we will for ourselves and so we can only find it by give we life up in submission and obedience to the control of god for this be peace -- to lose the lonely note of self in love 's celestial order strain : and this be joy -- to find one 's self again in he whose harmony forever float through all the sphere of song below above -- for god be music even as god be love this be the divine doctrine of happiness as christ teach it by he life and with he lip if we want to put it into a single phrase i know not where we shall find a more perfect utterance than in the word which have be teach we in childhood -- word so strong so noble so cheerful that they summon the heart of manhood like marching-music : man 's chief end be to glorify god and enjoy he forever let we accept without reserve this teaching of we divine lord and master in regard to the possibility and the duty of happiness it be a essential element of he gospel the atmosphere of the new testament be not gloom but gladness not despondency but hope the man who be not glad to be a christian be not the right kind of a christian the first thing that commend the church of jesus to the weary and disheartened world in the early year of she triumph be she power to make she child happy -- happy in the midst of affliction happy in the release from the burden of guilt happy in the sense of divine fatherhood and human brotherhood happy in christ 's victory over sin and death happy in the assurance of a endless life at midnight in the prison paul and sila sing praise and the prisoner hear they the lateral force of joy -- that be the power of the church ` poor world ' she cry ` so deep accurst thou runn ` st from pole to pole to seek a draught to slake thy thirst -- go seek it in thy soul ' \* \* \* \* \* tear wash the trouble from she face she change into a child ` mid weed and wreck she stand -- a place of ruin -- but she smile much have the church lose of that pristine and powerful joy the furnace of civilization have wither and harden she she have become anxious and troubled about many thing she have seek earthly honor earthly power richer she be than ever before and probably better organize and perhaps more intelligent more learn -- but not more happy the one note that be most often miss in christian life in christian service be the note of spontaneous joy christian be not as much calmer steadier stronger and more cheerful than other people as they ought to be some christian be among the most depressing and worryful people in the world -- the most difficult to live with and some indeed have adopt a theory of spiritual ethic which put a special value upon unhappiness the dark morbid spirit which mistrust every joyful feeling and depreciate every cheerful virtue and look askance upon every happy life as if there must be something wrong about it be a departure from the beauty of christ 's teaching to follow the dark-browed philosophy of the orient the religion of jesus tell we that cheerful piety be the best piety there be something finer than to do right against inclination and that be to have a inclination to do right there be something nobler than reluctant obedience and that be joyful obedience the rank of virtue be not measure by its disagreeableness but by its sweetness to the heart that love it the real test of character be joy for what you rejoice in that you love and what you love that you be like i confess frankly that i have no admiration for the phrase disinterested benevolence to describe the main-spring of christian moral i do not find it in the new testament : neither the word nor the thing interested benevolence be what i find there to do good to other be to make life interesting and find peace for we own soul to glorify god be to enjoy he that be the spirit of the first christian be not st paul a happier man than herod do not st peter have more joy of he life than nero it be say of the first disciple that they do eat they meat with gladness and singleness of heart not till that pristine gladness of life return will the church regain she early charm for the soul of man every great revival of christian power -- like those which come in the time of st franci of assisus and of john wesley -- have be mark and herald by a revival of christian joy if we want the church to be mighty in power to win man to be a source of light in the darkness a fountain of life in the wilderness we must remember and renew in the spirit of christ the relation of religion to human happiness ii what then be the condition upon which true happiness depend christ tell we in the text : if ye know these thing happy be ye if ye do they this be the blessing with a double if if ye know -- this be the knowledge which christ give to faith if ye do -- this be the obedience which faith give to christ know and do -- these be the twin pillar jachin and boaz on which the house of happiness be build the harmony of faith and life -- this be the secret of inward joy and power you remember when these word be speak christ have kneel to wash the disciple ' foot peter in penitence and self-reproach have hesitate to permit this lowly service of divine love but christ answer by reveal the meaning of he act as a symbol of the cleanse of the soul from sin he remind the disciple of what they know by faith -- that he be they savior and they lord by deed and by word he call up before they the great spiritual truth which have give new meaning to they life he summon they to live accord to they knowledge to act upon the truth which they believe i be sure that he word sweep out beyond that quiet upper room beyond that beautiful incident to embrace the whole spiritual life i be sure that he be reveal to we the secret of happy living which lie at the very heart of he gospel when he say : if ye know these thing happy be ye if ye do they i if ye know -- there be then a certain kind of knowledge without which we can not be happy there be question arise in human nature which demand a answer if it be deny we can not help be disappointed restless and sad this be the price we have to pay for be conscious rational creature if we be mere plant or animal we might go on live through we appoint year in complete indifference to the origin and meaning of we existence but within we as human being there be something that cry out and rebel against such a blind life man be bear to ask what thing mean he be possess with the idea that there be a significance in the world beyond that which meet he sens john fiske have bring out this fact very clearly in he last book through nature to god he show that in the morning twilight of existence the human soul vaguely reach forth toward something akin to itself not in the realm of fleeting phenomenon but in the eternal presence beyond he argue by the analogy of evolution which always presuppose a real relation between the life and the environment to which it adjust itself that this forth-reaching and unfold of the soul imply the everlasting reality of religion the argument be good but the point which concern we now be simply this the forth-reaching question soul can never be satisfy if it touch only a dead wall in the darkness if its seek meet with the reply you do not know and you never can know and you must not try to know this be agnosticism it be only another way of spelling unhappiness since christianity be not true write ernest renan nothing interest I or appear worthy my attention that be the logical result of lose the knowledge of spiritual thing -- a life without real interest without deep worth -- a life with a broken spring but suppose renan be mistaken suppose christianity be true then the first thing that make it precious be that it answer we question and tell we the thing that we must know in order to be happy christianity be a revealing religion a teaching religion a religion which convey to the inquire spirit certain great and positive solution of the problem of life it be not silent nor ambiguous nor incomprehensible in its utterance it reply to we question with a knowledge which though limit be definite and sufficient it tell we that this order of nature which constitute the world 's experience be only one portion of the total universe that the ruler of both world see and unseen be god a spirit and the father of we spirit that he be not distant from we nor indifferent to we but that he have give he eternal son jesus christ to be we savior that he spirit be ever present with we to help we in we conflict with evil in we effort toward goodness that he be make all thing work together for good to those that love he that through the sacrifice of christ every one who will may obtain the forgiveness of sin and everlasting peace that through the resurrection of christ all who love he and they fellow-men shall obtain the victory over death and live forever now these be doctrine and it be just because christianity contain such doctrine that it satisfy the need of man the first and the most essential condition of true happiness write professor carl hilty the eminent swiss jurist be a firm faith in the moral order of the world what be the happy life it be a life of conscious harmony with this divine order of the world a sense that be to say of god 's companionship and wherein be the profoundest unhappiness it be in the sense of remoteness from god issue into incurable restlessness of heart and finally into incapacity to make one 's life fruitful or effective what shall we say then of the proposal to adapt christianity to the need of the world to-day by eliminate or ignore its characteristic doctrine you might as well propose to fit a ship for service by take out its compass and its chart and cut off its rudder make christianity silent in regard to these great question of spiritual existence and you destroy its power to satisfy the heart what would the life of christ mean if these deep truth on which he rest and from which he draw he strength be uncertain or illusory it would be the most pathetic mournful heartbreaking of all phantom what consoling cheer power would be leave in the word of jesus if he doctrine be blot out and he precept left to stand alone try the experiment if it may be do without irreverence : read he familiar discourse in the shadow of agnosticism ` bless be the poor in spirit for theirs be a hopeless poverty bless be the pure in heart for they know not whether they shall see god bless be ye when man shall revile you and persecute you for ye have no promise of a heavenly reward ` enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut the door keep silence for thou canst not tell whether there be one to hear thy voice in secret take no thought for the morrow for thou knowest not whether there be a father who careth for thee ` god be unknown and they that worship he must worship he in ignorance and doubt no man have ascend up into heaven neither have any man come down from heaven for the son of man have never be in heaven that which be bear of the flesh be flesh and that which be bear of the spirit be a dream man shall not live by bread alone neither shall he listen for any word from the mouth of god i proceed forth and come from darkness i come of myself i know not who send I my sheep hear my voice and i know they and they follow I but i can not give unto they eternal life for they shall perish and death shall pluck they out of my hand let not you heart be trouble ye believe not in god ye need not believe in I keep my commandment and i will not pray for you and ye shall abide without a comforter in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer for ye know not whether there be a world to come i come forth from darkness into the world and again i leave the world and return to darkness peace i leave with you if ye love I ye would rejoice because i say i go into darkness and where i be there shall ye be also ' be it conceivable that any suffer sorrowing human soul should be comfort and strengthen by such a message as this could it possibly be call a gospel glad tiding of great joy to all people and yet what have be omit here from the word of christ nothing but what man call doctrine : the personality of god the divinity of christ the atonement the presence and power of the holy spirit the sovereignty of the heavenly father the truth of the divine revelation the reality of the heavenly world the assurance of immortal life but it be just from these doctrine that the teaching of jesus draw its peculiar power to comfort and inspire they be the ray of light which disperse the gloom of uncertainty they be the tone of celestial music which fill the heart of man with good cheer let we never imagine that we can strengthen christianity by leave out the great doctrine which have give it life and power faith be not a mere matter of feel it be the acceptance of truth positive unchanging reveal truth in regard to god and the world christ and the soul duty and immortality the first appeal to faith lie in the clearness and vividness the simplicity and joy with which this truth be present there have not be too much preaching of doctrine in this age there have be too little and what there have be have be too dull and cold and formal too vague and misty too waver and uncertain what the world want and wait for to-day be a strong true vital preaching of doctrine the church must realize anew the precious value of the truth which christ have give she she must not conceal they or cast they away she must bring they out into the light press they home upon the mind and heart of man she must simplify she statement of they so that man can understand what they mean she must not be content with repeat they in the language of past century she must translate they into the language of to-day first century text will never wear out because they be inspire but seventeenth century sermon grow obsolete because they be not inspire text from the word of god preaching in the word of live man -- that be what we need we must think about the doctrine of christianity more earnestly and profoundly we must renew we christian evidence as a army fit itself with new weapon the old-fashioned form of the argument from design in nature have go out with the old-fashioned book of science which it use but there be a new and more wonderful proof of god 's presence in the world -- the argument from moral end in evolution every real advance of science make the intelligent order of the universe more sublimely clear every century of human experience confirm the divine claim and add to the divine triumph of jesus christ social progress have follow to a hair 's breadth the line of he gospel and he lay he hand to-day with heavenly wisdom on the social want that still trouble we the social lie that warp we from the living truth christ 's view of life and the world be as full of sweet reasonableness now as it be in the first century every moral step that man have take upward have bring a wider clearer vision of he need of such a religion as that which christ teach let not the church falter and blush for she doctrine let she not turn and go down the hill of knowledge to defend she position in the valley of ignorance let she go up the hill welcome every wider outlook rejoice in every new discovery gathering fresh evidence of the truth which man must believe concern god and new motive to the duty which god require of man but in do this we must put the emphasis of we preach to-day where it belong where christ put it on the doctrine that be most important to human life and happiness we can afford to let the fine metaphysical distinction of theology rest for a while and throw all we force on the central fundamental truth which give steadiness and courage and cheer to the heart of man i will not admit that it make no difference to a man of this age whether or not he believe in the personal god and the divine christ if he really believe it make all the difference between spiritual strength and spiritual weakness between optimism and pessimism i will not admit that it make no difference to a learn scholar or a simple labourer to-day whether he accept or ignore the doctrine of the atonement the doctrine of personal immortality if he know that christ die for he that there be a future beyond the grave it make all the difference between despair and hope between misery and consolation between the helpless frailty of a be that be puff out like a candle and the joyful power of a endless life my brethren we must work and pray for a true revival of christian doctrine in we age we must deepen we own hold upon the truth which christ have teach we we must preach they more simply more confidently more reasonably more earnestly we must draw from they the happiness and the help the comfort and the inspiration that they have to give to the soul of man but most of all we must keep they in close and live touch with the problem of daily duty and experience for no doctrine however high however true can make man happy until it be translate into life ii here be the second if on which the power of religion to confer happiness depend : if ye know happy be ye if ye do these thing between the know and the do there be a deep gulf into that abyss the happiness of many a man slip and be lose there be no peace no real and lasting felicity for a human life until the gulf be close and the continent of conduct meet the continent of creed edge to edge lip to lip firmly join forever it be not a blessing to know the thing that christ teach and then go on living as if they be false or doubtful it be a trouble a torment a secret misery to know that god be we father and yet to withhold we love and service from he to know that christ die for we and yet to deny he and refuse to follow he to know that there be a immortal life and yet to waste and lose we soul in the pursuit of sensual pleasure and such small portion of the world as we may hope to gain -- surely that be the deepest of all unhappiness but the right kind of know carry in its heart the do of the truth and the right kind of do lead to a fuller and happier know if any man will do god 's will declare christ he shall know of the doctrine let a man take the truth of the divine fatherhood and begin to conform he life to its meaning let he give up he anxious worrying he murmuring he complaining and trust himself completely to he father 's care let he do he work from day to day as well as he can and leave the result to god let he come to he father every day and confess he fault and ask for help and guidance let he try to obey and please god for love 's sake let he take refuge from the trial and confusion and misunderstanding of the world from the wrath of man and the strife of tongue in the secret of he father 's presence surely if he learn the truth thus by do it he will find happiness or take the truth of immortality let a man live now in the light of the knowledge that he be to live forever how it will deepen and strengthen the meaning of he existence lift he above petty care and ambition and make the thing that be worth while precious to he heart let he really set he affection on the spiritual side of life let he endure affliction patiently because he know that they be but for a moment let he think more of the soul than of the body let he do good to he fellow-men in order to make they sharer of he immortal hope let he purify he love and friendship that they may be fit for the heavenly life surely the man who do these thing will be happy it will be with he as with lazarus in robert browning 's poem the epistle of karshish other will look at he with wonder and say : whence have the man the balm that brighten all this grown man eye the world now like a child yes my brethren this be the sure result of follow out the doctrine of christ in action of live the truth that he teach -- a simple life a childlike life a happy life and this also the church need to-day as well as a true revival of doctrine a revival of simplicity a revival of sincerity a revival of work : this will restore unto we the joy of salvation and with the joy of salvation will come a renewal and expansion of power the inconsistency of christian be the stronghold of unbelief the lack of vital joy in the church be the chief cause of indifference in the world the feeble energy the falter and reluctant spirit the weariness in well-doing with which too many believer impoverish and sadden they own heart make other man question the reality and value of religion and turn away from it in cool neglect what then be the duty of the church what must she do to win the confidence of the world what be the best way for she to prove she doctrine all divine first she must increase she labor in the love of man : second she must practice the simple life deepen she trust in god suppose that a fresh flood of energy brave cheerful joyous energy should be pour into all the form of christian work suppose that foreign mission and home mission should no longer have to plead and beg for support but that plenty of money should come flow in to send out every missionary that want to go and that plenty of the strongest and best young man should dedicate they life to the ministry of christ and that every household where he gospel be believe should find its highest honor and its greatest joy in help to extend he kingdom and then suppose that the christian life in its daily manifestation should come to be marked and know by simplicity and happiness suppose that the follower of jesus should really escape from bondage to the evil spirit of avarice and luxury which infect and torment so much of we complicated tangled artificial modern life suppose that instead of increase they want and they desire instead of load themselves down on life 's journey with so many bag and parcel and box of superfluous luggage and bric-a-brac that they be force to sit down by the roadside and gasp for breath instead of wear themselves out in the dusty way of ostentation and vain show or embitter they heart because they can not succeed in get into the weary race of wealth and fashion -- suppose instead of all this they should turn to quiet way lowly pleasure pure and simple joy plain live and high thinking suppose they should truly find and show they happiness in the knowledge that god love they and christ die for they and heaven be sure and so set they heart free to rejoice in life 's common mercy the light of the sun the blue of the sky the splendor of the sea the peace of the everlasting hill the song of bird the sweetness of flower the wholesome savor of good food the delight of action and motion the refreshment of sleep the charm of music the blessing of human love and friendship -- rejoice in all these without fear or misgiving because they come from god and because christ have sanctify they all by he presence and touch suppose i say that such a revival of the joy of living in christ and work for christ should silently sweep over the church in the twentieth century what would happen great would be the peace of she child greater still would be they power this be the message which i have to bring to you my brethren in this general assembly of the presbyterian church you may wonder that it be not more distinctive more ecclesiastical more specially adapt to the peculiarity of we own denomination you may think that it be a message which could just as well be bring to any other church on any other occasion with all my heart i hope that be true the thing that i care for most in we church be not those which divide we from other christian but those which unite we to they the thing that i love most in christianity be those which give it power to save and satisfy to console and cheer to inspire and bless human heart and live the thing that i desire most for presbyterianism be that it should prove its mission and extend its influence in the world by make man happy in the know and the do of the thing which christ teach the church that the twentieth century will hear most gladly and honor most sincerely will have two mark it will be the church that teach most clearly and strongly the truth that jesus teach it will be the church that find most happiness in live the simple life and do good in the world the battle of life <i> roman vii 21 : overcome evil with good </i> the battle of life be a ancient phrase consecrate by use in commencement oration without number two modern expression have take they place beside it in we own day : the strenuous life and the simple life each of these phrase have its own significance and value it be when they be overemphasize and drive to extreme that they lose they truth and become catch-word of folly the simple life which blandly ignore all care and conflict soon become flabby and invertebrate sentimental and gelatinous the strenuous life which do everything with set jaw and clenched fist and fierce effort soon become strained and violent a prolonged nervous spasm somewhere between these two extreme must lie the golden mean : a life that have strength and simplicity courage and calm power and peace but how can we find this golden line and live along it some truth there must be in the old phrase which speak of life as a battle no conflict no character without strife a weak life but what be the real meaning of the battle what be the vital issue at stake what be the thing worth fight for in what spirit with what weapon be we to take we part in the warfare there be a answer to these question in the text : <i> overcome evil with good </i> the man who know this text by heart know the secret of a life that be both strenuous and simple for here we find the three thing that we need most : a call to the real battle of life a plan for the right campaign and a promise of final victory i every man like the knight in the old legend be bear on a field of battle but the warfare be not carnal it be spiritual not the east against the west the north against the south the haves against the have-not but the evil against the good -- that be the real conflict of life the attempt to deny or ignore this conflict have be the stock in trade of every false doctrine that have befog and bewilder the world since the day of eden the fairy tale that the old serpent tell to eve be a poetic symbol of the lie fundamental -- the theory that sin do not mean death because it have no real existence and make no real difference this ancient falsehood have a infinite wardrobe of disguise you will find it prank out in philosophic garb in the doctrine of those who teach that all thing be link together by necessity of nature or divine will and that nothing could ever have happen otherwise than just as it have come to pass such a theory of the universe blot out all difference between good and evil except in name it leave the fence-posts standing but it take away the rail and throw everything into one field of the inevitable you will find the same falsehood in a more crude form in the popular teaching of what man call the spirit of the age the secular spirit accord to these doctrine the problem of civilization be merely a problem of way and mean if society be better organize if wealth be more equally distribute if law be change or perhaps abolish all would be well if everybody have a full dinner-pail nobody need care about a empty heart human misery the secular spirit recognize but it absolutely ignore the fact that nine-tenth of human misery come from human sin you will find the same falsehood disguise in sentimental costume in the very modern comedy of christian science which dress the denial of evil in pastoral garb of white frock and pink ribbon like a innocent shepherdess among she lamb evil be nothing say this wonderful science it do not really exist it be a illusion of mortal mind shut you eye and it will vanish yes but open you eye again and you will see it in the same place in the same form do the same work a most persistent nothing a most powerful nothing not the shadow cast by the good but the cloud that hide the sun and cast the shadow not the silence imply sound but the discord break the harmony evil be as real as the fire that burn you as the flood that drown you evil be as real as the typhoid germ that you can put under a microscope and see it squirm and grow evil be negative -- yes but it be a real negative -- as real as darkness as real as death there be two thing in every human heart which bear witness to the existence and reality of evil : first we judgment of regret and second we judgment of condemnation how often we say to ourselves would that this have not come to pass how often we feel in regard to we own action would that i have do differently this be the judgment of regret and it be a silent witness of the heart to the conviction that some thing be not inevitable it be the confession that a battle have be lose which might have be win it be the acknowledgment that thing which be but be not right need not have be if we and we fellow-man have see more clearly and follow more faithfully the guide star of the good and then out of the judgment of regret spring the deeper judgment of condemnation if the failure in duty be not inevitable then it be base the false word the unjust deed the foul action see as a surrender to evil appear hateful and guilty it deserve the indignation and the shame which attach to all treason and the spirit which lie behind all these form of disloyalty to the good -- the spirit which issue in selfishness and sensuality cruelty and lust intemperance and covetousness -- this animate spirit of evil which work against the divine will and mar the peace and order of the universe be the great adversary against whom we must fight for we own life and the life of the world all around we lie he dark secret kingdom tempting threatening assault the soul to ignore it be to walk blindfold among snare and pitfall try if you will to shut it out by wrap you heart in dream of beauty and joy living in the fair region of art or philosophy reading only the book which speak of evil as if it do not exist or be only another form of goodness soon you will be shake out of the dream into the reality you will come into contact with evil so close so loathsome that you can not deny it you will see that it have its soldier its servant its emissary as ardent and enthusiastic in its cause as if they be serve the noblest of master it inspire literature and support newspaper now intelligent and culture draw the art into its service now coarse and vulgar with picture that shock the taste as much as they debase the conscience it win adherent and turn they into advocate it organize the dealer in drunkenness and debauchery into powerful society for mutual protection it create lobby and control legislature it corrupt the government of great city and rot out the social life of small town even when its outward manifestation be repress and its grosser form resist it steal its way into man 's heart eat out the root of human trust and brotherhood and kindness and fill the air with gossip and spite envy malice and all uncharitableness i be glad that since we have to live in a world where evil exist we have a religion which do not bandage we eye the first thing that we need to have religion do for we be to teach we to face the fact no man can come into touch with the divine personality of jesus christ no man can listen to he teaching without feeling that the distinction between good and evil to he be vital and everlasting the choice between they be to he the great choice the conflict between they be to he the great conflict evil be the one thing that god have never will good be the one thing that he will forever evil be first and last a rebellion against he will he be altogether on the side of good much that be be contrary to he will there be a mighty strife go on a battle with eternal issue but not a eternal battle the evil that be against he shall be cast out and shall perish the good that overcome the evil shall live forever and those who yield they life to god and receive he righteousness in christ be make partaker of everlasting life this be the teaching of jesus : and i thank god for the honesty and virility of he religion which make we face the fact and call we to take a man 's part in the real battle of life ii but what be the plan of campaign which christianity set before we in what spirit and with what weapon be we to enter the great conflict against the evil that be in the world the natural feeling of the heart in the presence of evil be wrath and the natural weapon of wrath be force to punish crime to avenge wrong to put down wickedness with a strong hand -- that be the first impulse of every one who have the instinct of manhood and as this be natural so it be also within a certain sphere needful and to a certain extent useful army and navy exist at least in theory to prevent injustice among nation law be make to punish wrong-doer court police-force and prison be maintain to suppress evil with power but while we recognize this method of deal with evil as useful to a certain extent and necessary within a certain sphere we must remember that it have its strict limitation first it belong to the state and not to the individual when the private man assume to punish evil with force he sanction lynch-law which be a terror to the innocent as well as to the guilty then we have the blood-feud and the vendetta mob-rule and anarchy second the suppression of evil by force be only a temporary relief a protection for the moment it do not touch the root of the matter you send the murderer out of the world by a regulate flash of lightning but you do not send murder out of the world to do that you must reach and change the heart of cain you put the thief in prison but when he come out he will be ready to steal again unless you can purify he conscience and control he will you assault and overthrow some system of misgovernment and turn the rascal out but unless you have something better to substitute all you have do be to make room for a new set of rascal -- a new swarm of mosquito with fresh appetite and larger capacity third the method of fight evil with force on its own ground often have a bad effect on those who follow it wrestle with a chimney-sweep and you will need a bath throw back the mud that be throw at you and you will have dirty hand answer shimeus when he curse you and you will echo he profanity many a man have enter a crusade against intemperance and prove himself as intemperate in he language as other man be in they potation many a man have attack a bad cause with righteous indignation and end in a personal squabble with most unrighteous anger no my brother-man the best way to fight against evil be not to meet it on its own ground with its own weapon there be a nobler method of warfare a divine plan of campaign give to we in the religion of christ overcome evil with good this be the secret of the battle of life evil be potent not so much because it have command of money and the big battalion but because it have control of the heart of man it spread because human heart be lie fallow and ready to welcome the seed of all kind of weed it persist because too much of what we call virtue be negative and selfish and frost-bound -- cold storage virtue -- the poor piety which terminate in a tremble anxiety to save we own soul the way to counteract and conquer evil in the world be to give we own heart to the dominion of good and work the work of god while it be day the strongest of all obstacle to the advance of evil be a clean and generous man do he duty from day to day and win other by he cheerful fidelity to serve the same master disease be not the only thing that be contagious courage be contagious kindness be contagious manly integrity be contagious all the positive virtue with red blood in they vein be contagious the heaviest blow that you can strike at the kingdom of evil be just to follow the advice which the die sir walter scott give to he son-in-law lockhart : be a good man and if you want to know how there be but one perfect and supreme example -- the life of he who not only do no evil but go about do good now take that thought of fight evil with good and apply it to we world and to ourselves here be monstrous evil and vice in society let intemperance be the type of they all because so many of the other be its child drunkenness ruin more home and wreck more life than war how shall we oppose it i do not say that we shall not pass resolution and make law against it but i do say that we can never really conquer the evil in this way i hold with phillip brook that all prohibitory measure be negative that they have they use no one can doubt that they have they limit be just as clear the stronghold of intemperance lie in the vacancy and despair of man 's mind the way to attack it be to make the sober life beautiful and happy and full of interest teach you boy how to work how to read how to play you father before you send they to college if you want to guard they against the temptation of strong drink and the many shame and sorrow that go with it make the life of you community cheerful and pleasant and interesting you reformer provide man with recreation which will not harm they if you want to take away the power of the gilded saloon and the grimy boozing-ken park and play-grounds library and music-room clean home and cheerful church -- these be the efficient foe of intemperance and the same thing be true of gambling and lubricity and all the other vice which drag man down by the lower side of they nature because the higher side have nothing to cling to nothing to sustain it and hold it up what be you go to do my brother-man for this higher side of human life what contribution be you go to make of you strength you time you influence you money you self to make a cleaner fuller happier larger nobler life possible for some of you fellow-men i do not ask how you be go to do it you may do it in business in the law in medicine in the ministry in teaching in literature but this be the question : what be you go to give personally to make the human life of the place where you do you work purer stronger brighter better and more worth live that will be you best part in the warfare against vice and crime the positive method be the only efficient way to combat intellectual error and spiritual evil false doctrine be never argue out of the world they be push back by the incoming of the truth as the darkness be push back by the dawn phillip brook be right it be not worth while to cross the street to break a man 's idol it be worth while to cross the ocean to tell he about god the skilful fencer who attack you doubt and drive you from corner to corner of unbelief and leave you at last in doubt whether you doubt or not do you a certain service he give you exercise take the conceit out of you but the man who lay hold of the real faith that be hide underneath you doubt -- the silent longing for god and goodness the secret attraction that draw you heart toward jesus christ as the only one who have the word of everlasting life -- the man who take hold of this bury faith and quicken it and make you dare to try to live by it -- ah that be the man who help you indeed my brother if any of you be go to be preacher remember this what we man need be not so much a answer to we doubt as more nourishment for we faith the positive method be the only way of victory in we struggle with the evil that dwell in we own nature and beset we own heart the reason why many man fail be because they thrust the vice out and then forget to lay hold on the virtue they evict the unclean spirit and leave a vacant house to cease to do evil be important but to learn to do good be far more important reformation never save a man transformation be the only way and to be transform a man must welcome the spirit of good the holy spirit into he heart and work with he every day do the will of god there be two way of fight fever one be to dose the sick people with quinine and keep the fever down the other be to drain the marsh and purify the water and cleanse the house and drive the fever out try negative repressive religion and you may live but you will be a invalid try positive vital religion and you will be well there be a absorption of good that guard the soul against the infection of evil there be a life of fellowship with christ that can pass through the furnace of the world without the smell of fire on its garment -- a life that be full of interest as he be be ever about he father 's business a life that be free and generous and bless as he be be spend in do good and refresh by the sense of god 's presence and approval last summer i see two stream empty into the sea one be a sluggish niggardly rivulet in a wide fat muddy bed and every day the tide come in and drown out that poor little stream and fill it with bitter brine the other be a vigorous joyful brimming mountain-river feed from unfailing spring among the hill and all the time it sweep the salt water back before it and keep itself pure and sweet and when the tide come in it only make the fresh water rise higher and gather new strength by the delay and ever the living stream pour forth into the ocean its tribute of live water -- the symbol of that influence which keep the ocean of life from turn into a dead sea of wickedness my brother-man will you take that living stream as a type of you life in the world the question for you be not what you be go to get out of the world but what you be go to give to the world the only way to meet and overcome the inflow tide of evil be to roll against it the outflow river of good my prayer for you be that you may receive from christ not only the watchword of this nobler life but also the power to fulfil it the good old way <i> jeremiah vi 16 stand ye in the way and see and ask for the old path where be the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for you soul </i> this advice be give to people who be in peril and perplexity the kingdom of judah be threaten with destruction which could be avert only by wise and prompt action but the trouble be to decide in which direction that action should be take the nation be divide into loud party and these party into noisy wing every man have a theory of he own or a variation of some other man 's theory some favor a alliance with the east some prefer the friendship of the west other a course of diplomatic dalliance a few stand out for honest independence some say that what the country need be a increase of wealth some hold that a splendid and luxurious court like that of pharaoh or nebuchadnezzar would bring prosperity other maintain that the trouble of the land could be heal only by a return to simpler manners purer law among the nobility and they follower all kind of novelty in the worship of idol be in fashion and new god be import every season the philosopher cultivate a discreet indifference to all religious question the prophet teach that the only salvation for the nation lay in the put away of idolatry and the revival of faith in the living and true god judah be like a man standing at the cross-road on a stormy night with all the guide-post blow down meantime the babylonian foe be close in around jerusalem and it be necessary to do something or die the liberty of choice be a embarrassment the mind of man alternate between that rash haste which be ready to follow any leader who make noise enough and that skeptical spirit which doubt whether any line of action can be right because so many line be open into this atmosphere of fever and fog come the word of the prophet let we consider what it mean stand ye in the way and see : that mean deliberation when you be at a junction it be no time to shut you eye and run at full speed where there be so many way some of they be likely to be wrong a turning-point be the place for prudence and forethought ask for the old path what be the good way : that mean guidance no man be force to face the problem of life alone other man have try the different way peace prosperity victory have be win by the nation in former time inquire of the past how these blessing be secure look for the path which have already lead to safety and happiness let history teach you which among all these cross way be the best to follow and walk therein : that mean action when you have deliberate when you have see the guide light upon the way of security and peace then go ahead prudence be worthless unless you put it into practice when in doubt do nothing but as long as you do nothing you will be in doubt never man or nation be save by inaction the only way out of danger be the way into work gird up you loin tremble judah and push along you choose path steadily bravely strenuously until you come to you promise rest now i be sure this be good counsel that the prophet give to he people in the day of perplexity it would have be well for they if they have follow it i be sure it be also good counsel for we a word of god to steady we and stimulate we amid life 's confusion let I make it a personal message to you stand in the way : ask for the good way : walk therein : -- deliberation guidance action -- will you take these word with you and try to make they a vital influence in you life i first i ask you to stand in the way and see i do not mean to say that you have not already be do this to a certain extent the great world be cross by human footstep which make path lead in all direction man travel through on different way and i suppose some of you have notice the fact and think a little about it there be the way of sensuality those who walk in it take appetite as they guide they main object in life be to gratify they physical desire some of they be delicate and some of they be coarse that be a matter of temperament but all of they be hungry that be a matter of principle whether they grub in the mire for they food like swine or browse daintily upon the tree-top like the giraffe the question of life for those who follow this way be the same how much can we hold how can we obtain the most pleasure for these five sens of ours before they wear out and the watchword of they journey be let we eat and drink and be merry for we do not expect to die to-morrow there be the way of avarice those who follow it make haste to be rich the almighty dollar roll before they along the road and they chase it some of they plod patiently along the highway of toil other be always leap fence and try to find short cut to wealth but they be alike in this : whatever they do by way of avocation the real vocation of they life be to make money if they fail they be hard and bitter if they succeed they be hard and proud but they all bow down to the golden calf and they motto be lay up for yourselve treasure upon earth there be the way of social ambition those who walk in it have they eye fix on various prize such as title of honor public office large acquaintance with prosperous people the reputation of lead the fashion but the real satisfaction that they get out of it all be simply the feeling of notoriety the sense of belong to a circle to which ordinary people be not admit and to whose doings the world just for this reason pay envious attention this way be less like a road than like a ladder most of the people who be on it be climber there be other way less clearly mark more difficult to trace -- the way of moral indifference the way of intellectual pride the way of hypocrisy the way of indecision this last be not a single road it be a net-work of sheep-tracks cross and recross the great highway lead in every direction and end nowhere the man who wander in these aimless path go up and down through the world change they purpose follow one another blindly forever travel but never arrive at the goal of they journey through all this tangle there run another way -- the path of faith and duty those who walk in it believe that life have a mean the fulfilment of god 's will and a goal the attainment of perfect harmony with he they try to make the best of themselves in soul and body by training and discipline they endeavor to put they talent to the noblest use in the service of they fellow-men and to unfold they faculty to the highest joy and power in the life of the spirit they seek a education to fit they for work and they do they work well because it be a part of they education they respect they conscience and cherish they ideal they put forth a honest effort to be good and to do good and to make the world better they often stumble they sometimes fall but take they life from end to end it be a faithful attempt to walk in the way of righteousness which be the way of peace such be some of the way that lead through the world and they be all open to we we can travel by the road that please we heredity give we we outfit environment supply we company but when we come to the cross-road the question be boy which way will you ride deliberation be necessary unless we wish to play a fool 's part no amount of energy will take the place of think a strenuous life with its eye shut be a kind of wild insanity a drift life with its eye open be a kind of mild idiocy the real question be how will you live after what rule and pattern along what way toward what end will you let chance answer that question for you will you let yourself be lead blindfold by the first guide that offer or run stupidly after the crowd without ask whither they be go you would not act so in regard to the shortest earthly journey you would not rush into the railway station and jump aboard of the first train you see without look at the sign-board surely if there be anything in regard to which we need to exercise deliberation it be the choice of the way that we be to take through the world you have think a good deal about what business what profession you be to follow think more deeply i beg you about how you be to follow it and what you be to follow it for stand in the way and see ii second i earnestly advise you to ask for the old path where be the good way i do not regard this as a mere counsel of conservatism a unqualified commendation of antiquity true it imply that the good way will not be a new discovery a track that you and i strike out for ourselves among the path of conduct that which be entirely original be likely to be false and that which be true be likely to have some footprint on it when a man come to we with a scheme of life which he have make all by himself we may safely say to he as the old composer say to the young musician who bring he a symphony of the future it be both new and beautiful but that which be new be not beautiful and that which be beautiful be not new but this be by no mean the same as say that everything ancient be therefore beautiful and true or that all the old way be good the very point of the text be that we must discriminate among antiquity -- a thing as necessary in old chair and old book as in old way evil be almost if not quite as ancient as good folly and wisdom among man at least be twin and we can not distinguish between they by the gray hair adam 's way be old enough and so be the way of cain and of noah 's vile son and of lot 's lewd daughter and of balaam and of jezebel and of manasseh juda iscariot be as old as st john anania and sapphira be of the same age with st peter and st paul what we be to ask for be not simply the old way but that one among the old way which have be test and try and prove to be the good way the spirit of wisdom tell we that we be not to work this way out by logarithm or evolve it from we own inner consciousness but to learn what it be by look at the life of other man and mark the lesson which they teach we experience have be compare to the stern-light of a ship which shine only on the road that have be traverse but the stern-light of a ship that sail before you be a head-light to you you do not need to try everything for yourself in order to understand what it mean the writer of ecclesiaste tell we that he give he heart to know madness and folly and that it be all vanity and vexation of spirit it will be a wise economy for we to accept he lesson without pay he tuition-fee over again it be perfectly safe for a man to take it as a fact that fire burn without put he hand into the flame he do not need to try perilous experiment with he own soul in order to make sure that lust defile that avarice harden that frivolity empty that selfishness canker the heart he may understand the end of the way of sensuality by look at any old pleasure-seeker gray and gap-toothed and lean as death mumble the dainty that he can no longer enjoy and glower with bleared eye at the indulgence which now mock he even while they tempt he the goal of the path of covetousness may be discern in the face of any old money-worshipper keep guard over he pile of wealth like a surly watch-dog or if perchance he have fail haunt the place where fortune have deceive he like a unquiet ghost inquire and learn consider and discern there need be no doubt about the direction of life 's various way which be the nation that have be most peaceful and noble and truly prosperous those that have follow pride and luxury and idolatry or those that have cherish sobriety and justice and acknowledge the divine law of righteousness which be the family that have be most serene and pure and truly fortunate those in which there have be no discipline no restraint no common faith no mutual love or those in which sincere religion have sway life to its stern and gracious law those in which parent and child have walk together to the house of god and kneel together at he altar and rejoice together in he service i tell you my brother-man it have become too much the fashion in these latter day to sneer and jeer at the old-fashioned way of the old-fashioned american household something too much of iron there may have be in the puritan 's temper something too little of sunlight may have come in through the narrow window of he house but that house have foundation and the virile virtue live in it there be plenty of red corpuscle in he blood and he heart beat in time with the eternal law of right even though its pulsation sometimes seem a little slow and heavy it would be well for we if we could get back into the old way which prove itself to be the good way and maintain as we father do the sanctity of the family the sacredness of the marriage-vow the solemnity of the mutual duty bind parent and child together from the household that follow this way have come man that could rule themselves as well as they fellow woman that could be trust as well as loved read the history of such family and you will understand the truth of the poet 's word : -- self-reverence self-knowledge self-control -- these three alone lead life to sovereign power look around you in the world and see what way it be that have bring you fellow-man to peace and quietness of heart to security and honor of life be it the way of unbridled self-indulgence of unscrupulous greed of aimless indolence or be it the way of self-denial of cheerful industry of fair dealing of faithful service if true honor lie in the respect and grateful love of one 's fellow-men if true success lie in a contented heart and a peaceful conscience then the man who have reach the highest goal of life be those who have follow most closely the way to which jesus christ point we and in which he go before we iii walk therein and ye shall find rest for you soul right action bring rest rest rest how that word ring like a sweet bell through the turmoil of we age we be rush to and fro destroy rest in we search for it we drive we automobile from one place to another at furious speed not know what we shall do when we get there we make haste to acquire new possession not know how we shall use they when they be ours we be in a fever of new discovery and theory not know how to apply they when they be make we feed ourselves upon novel speculation until we head swim with the vertigo of universal knowledge which change into the paresis of universal doubt but in the hour of silence the spirit of wisdom whisper a secret to we heart rest depend upon conduct the result of you life depend upon you choose the good way and walk in it and to you i say my brother-men choose christ for he be the way all the strength and sweetness of the best possible human life be embody in he all the truth that be need to inspire and guide man to noble action and fine character be reveal in he he be the one master altogether worthy to be serve and follow take he yoke upon you and learn of he and ye shall find rest unto you soul end of the project gutenberg ebook of joy & power by henry van dyke
