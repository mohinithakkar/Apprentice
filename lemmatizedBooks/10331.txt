gunpowder sir walter scott write a sermon or a scotch minister invent a safety gun and as we be tell _ present _ the same to the king in person be this as it may since we first acquaintance with the prince of piscator the patriarch of angler isaak walton it have seldom be we lot to meet with so pleasant a volume as _ salmonium or day of fly fishing _ to whose contents we be about to introduce we reader in we last number we give a _ fly _ extract entitle superstition on the weather be a fair specimen of the very agreeable manner of the digression in the above work which be perhaps less practical than it might have be but this defect be more than atone for in the author 's felicitous mode of intermingle with the main subject some of the most curious fact and phenomenon in natural history and philosophy so as to familiarize the angler with many cause and effect which altogether belong to a higher class of reading than that of mere amusement all this too be do in a simple graceful and flowing style always amusive and sometimes humorously illustrative -- advantage which we philosophical writer do not generally exhibit but which be more or less evident in every page of sir humphry davy 's writings _ salmonium _ consist of a series of conversation between four character -- halieus -lrb- 3 -rrb- poiete physicus ornither in the first day we have a ingenious vindication of fly fishing against the well-known satire of johnson -lrb- 4 -rrb- and lord byron and the following : -- _ halieus _ -- a noble lady long distinguish at court for pre-eminent beauty and grace and whose mind possess undying charm have write some line in my copy of walton which if you will allow I i will repeat to you : -- albeit gentle angler i delight not in thy trade yet in thy page there doth lie so much of quaint simplicity so much of mind of such good kind that none need be afraid catch by thy cunning bait this book to be ensnare on thy hook gladly from thee i be lur would to bear with thing that seem would most vile before for thou didst on poor subject rear matter the wisest sage might hear and with a grace that doth efface more labor work thy simple lore can teach we that thy skilful _ line _ more than the scaly brood _ confines _ we heart and sens too we see rise quickly at thy master hand and ready to be catch by thee be lure to virtue willingly content and peace with health and ease walk by thy side at thy command we bid adieu to worldly care and joy in gift that all may share gladly with thee i pace along and of sweet fancy dream wait till some inspired song within my memory cherish long come fairer forth with more of worth because that time upon its stream feather and chaff will bear away but give to gem a brighter ray and though the charming and intellectual author of this poem be not a angler herself yet i can quote the example of she lovely daughter to vindicate fly fishing from the charge of cruelty and to prove that the most delicate and refined mind can take pleasure in this innocent amusement gay 's passionate love for angling be well know it be he principal occupation in the summer at amesbury and the late excellent john tobin author of the _ honey moon _ be a ardent angler among hero trajan be fond of angling nelson be a good fly-fisher and continue the pursuit even with he left hand and say the author i have know a person who fish with he at merton in the wandle dr paley be so much attach to this amusement that when the bishop of durham inquire of he when one of he most important work would be finish he say with great simplicity and good-humour ` my lord i shall work steadily at it when the fly-fishing season be over ' -- then we have a poetical description of river scenery till two of the party arrive at the follow conclusion : -- i have already admit the danger of analyze too closely the moral character of any of we field sport yet i think it can not be doubt that the nervous system of fish and cold-blooded animal in general be less sensitive than that of warm-blooded animal the hook usually be fix in the cartilaginous part of the mouth where there be no nerve and a proof that the suffering of a hooked fish can not be great be find in the circumstance that though a trout have be hook and play for some minute he will often after he escape with the artificial fly in he mouth take the natural fly and feed as if nothing have happen have apparently learn only from the experiment that the artificial fly be not proper for food and i have catch pike with four or five hook in they mouth and tackle which they have break only a few minute before and the hook seem to have have no other effect than that of serve as a sort of _ sauce piquante _ urge they to seize another morsel of the same kind -- the advocate for a favorite pursuit never want sophism to defend it i have even hear it assert that a hare enjoy be hunt yet i will allow that fly-fishing after you vindication appear amongst the least cruel of field sport we must however confine ourselves to a few colloquial extract from the _ practical _ portion of the volume as _ fly on the wandle & c _ _ orn _ -- surely the may-fly season be not the only season for day-fishing in this river -lrb- the wandle -rrb- -- _ hal _ certainly not there be as many fish to be take perhaps in the spring fishing but in this deep river they be seldom in good season till the may-fly have be on and a fortnight hence they will be still better than even now in September there may be good fish take here but the autumnal fly be less plentiful in this river than the spring fly -- _ phy _ pray tell I what be the species of fly which take in these two season -- _ hal _ you know that trout spawn or deposit they ovum & c in the end of the autumn or beginning of winter from the middle of November till the beginning of January they maturity depend upon the temperature of the season they quantity of food & c they be at least six week or two month after they have spawn before they recover they flesh and the time when these fish be at the worst be likewise the worst time for fly-fishing both on account of the cold weather and because there be fewer fly on the water than at any other season even in December and January there be a few small gnat or water-fly on the water in the middle of the day in bright day or when there be sunshine these be generally black and they escape the influence of the frost by the effect of light on they black body and probably by the extreme rapidity of the motion of they fluid and generally of they organ they be find only at the surface of the water where the temperature must be above the freezing point in February a few double-winged water-fly which swim down the stream be usually find in the middle of the day such as the willow-fly and the cow-dung-fly be sometimes carry on the water by wind in march there be several fly find on most river the grannam or green-tail-fly with a wing like a moth come on generally morning and evening from five till eight o'clock be in mild weather in the end of march and through April then there be the blue and the brown both ephemerae which come on the first in dark day the second in bright day these fly when well imitate be very destructive to fish the first be a small fly with a palish yellow body and slender beautiful wing which rest on the back as it float down the water the second call the cob in wale be three or four time as large and have brown wing which likewise protrude from the back and its wing be shaded like those of a partridge brown and yellow brown these three kind of fly lay they egg in the water which produce larva that remain in the state of worm feed and breathe in the water till they be prepare for they metamorphosis and quit the bottom of the river and the mud and stone for the surface and light and air the brown fly usually disappear before the end of April likewise the grannam but of the blue dun there be a succession of different tint or species or variety which appear in the middle of the day all the summer and autumn long these be the principal fly on the wandle -- the best and clearest stream near london in early spring these fly have dark olive body in the end of April and the beginning of may they be find yellow and in the summer they become cinnamon color and again as the winter approach gain a darker hue i do not however mean to say that they be the same fly but more probably successive generation of ephemera of the same species the excess of heat seem equally unfavourable as the excess of cold to the existence of the smaller species of water-insect which during the intensity of sunshine seldom appear in summer but rise morning and evening only the blue dun have in June and July a yellow body and there be a water-fly which in the evening be generally find before the moth appear call the red spinner towards the end of August the ephemera appear again in the middle of the day -- a very pale small ephemera which be of the same color as that which be see in some river in the beginning of July in September and October this kind of fly be find with a olive body and it become darker in October and paler in November there be two other fly which appear in the end of September and continue during October if the weather be mild a large yellow fly with a fleshy body and wing like a moth and a small fly with four wing with a dark or claret color body that when it fall on the water have its wing like the great yellow fly flat on its back this or a claret body fly very similar in character may be likewise find in march or April on some water in this river i have often catch many large trout in April and the beginning of may with the blue dun have the yellow body and in the upper part of the stream below st alban and between that and watford i have sometimes even as early as April catch fish in good condition but the _ true _ season for the colne be the season of the may-fly the same may be say of most of the large english river contain large trout and abound in may-fly -- such as the test and the kennett the one run by stockbridge the other by hungerford but in the wandle at carshalton and beddington the may-fly be not find and the little blues be the constant and when well imitate kill fly on this water to which may be join a dark alder-fly and a red evening fly in the avon at ringwood and fordingbridge the may-fly be likewise a kill fly but as this be a grayle river the other fly particularly the grannam and blue and brown be good in spring and the alder-fly or pale blue later and the blue dun in September and October and even November in the stream in the mountainous part of britain the spring and autumnal fly be by far the most kill the usk be formerly a very productive trout-stream and the fish be well feed by the worm wash down by the winter flood be often in good season cut red in march and the beginning of April : and at this season the blues and brown particularly when the water be a little stain after a small flood afford the angler good sport in herefordshire and derbyshire where trout and grayle be often find together the same period be generally best for angle but in the dive lathkill and wye with the natural may-fly many fish may be take and in old time in peculiarly windy day or high and troubled water even the artificial may-fly accord to cotton be very kill here we must end at least _ for the present _ but there be so much anecdotical pleasantry in _ salmonium _ that we might continue we extract through many column and we be persuade to the gratification of the majority of we reader even when we announce the publication of this work a few week since we be lead to anticipate the delight it would

hundred of woman be employ to carry that delicate fruit to market on they head and they industry in perform this task be as wonderful as they remuneration be unworthy of the opulent class who derive enjoyment from they labor they consist for the most part of shropshire and welsh girl who walk to london at this season in drove to perform this drudgery just as the irish peasantry come to assist in the hay and corn harvest i learn that these woman carry upon they head basket of strawberry or raspberry weigh from forty to fifty pound and make two turn in the day from isleworth to market a distance of thirteen mile each way three turn from brentford a distance of nine mile and four turn from hammersmith a distance of six mile for the most part they find some conveyance back but even

altogether correct i beg leave therefore to point out the error to you and to add a fact or two more relate to that distinguished philanthropist and he family which perhaps will not be unacceptable to many of you reader mr reynold be by no mean the _ original _ nor i believe ever the _ sole _ proprietor of the iron-works in colebrook-dale as state by mr bakewell he derive he right in they from he

a old and respectable family of the society of friend and a pair of the elder branch of it be the original darby and joan whose name be so well know throughout the whole kingdom i have this anecdote from one of the son of mr reynold -lrb- 7 -rrb- and have no doubt of its authenticity it may not be generally know to you reader perhaps that the first iron bridge in england be project at and cast from the furnace of colebrook-dale and erect over the severn near that place about the year 1779 and consider it to be the _ first _ bridge of the kind i feel little hesitation in state it to be even now the most beautiful one this structure at that time think to be a wonderful attempt be the entire offspring of mr reynold ' genius it be plan cast and erect under he immediate care and superintendance i can not suppose the reason give by you author for the discontinuance of the work at colebrook-dale to be correct as there be another large furnace in the immediate neighborhood call madeley wood furnace -lrb- also belong to mr reynold 's family -rrb- which be allow to make and i believe still make the best iron and steel in the unite kingdom mr reynold have also other great iron-works at ketley since carry on by he two son william and joseph and still in high reputation as to the quality of the iron make there these be not more distant from colebrook-dale than six or seven mile and between the two there be the extensive and highly valuable work of old park & c belong to mr botfield -lrb- so that the whole district abound in the material -rrb- which not have the advantage of the immediate vicinity of the severn for conveyance would have be more likely to have stop from the circumstance state in you extract _ viz _ the failure in quality or quantity of

volume of a novel or the conclusion of the fifth act of a play -- though that connexion in some modern novel and in most english tragedy seem to be assume nor do it seem to follow that because death be the object of universal dread and aversion and because terror be one of the object of tragedy death must therefore necessarily be represent and not only so but the more death the better if it be true that familiarity have a tendency to create indifference if not contempt it must be consider prudent to have recourse to this strong exhibition as to drastic remedy in medicine with caution and discrimination and with a view to the continuance of its effect we can not help wish that we own shakspeare who lay down such excellent rule for the guidance of actor and caution they so earnestly against overstep the modesty of nature and the danger of tear passion to rag have remember that the poet himself have certain limit impose upon he which he can not transgress with impunity we should
