endurance the submarine danger be defeat introduction owe to the peculiar nature and demand of naval warfare but few dispatch correspond to those describe the work and achievement of we great army be issue during the progress of the war in a former volume i attempt to supply this defect in the historical record which will be available for future generation so far as the grand fleet be concern during my period as its commander-in-chief the present volume which be commence and nearly complete in 1918 be to have be publish at the same time my departure on a naval mission early in 1919 prevent I however from put the finish touch to the manuscript until my return this spring i hesitate as to the publication of this portion of what be in effect one complete narrative but eventually decide not to depart from my original purpose there be some reason to believe that the account of the work of the grand fleet give the nation a fuller conception of the service which the officer and man of that force render in circumstance which be necessarily not easily appreciate by landsman this second volume deal with the defeat of the enemy 's submarine campaign the gravest peril which ever threaten the population of this country as well as of the whole empire may not be unwelcome as a statement of fact they have be set down in order that the sequence and significance of event may be understand and that the nation may appreciate the debt which it owe in particular to the seaman of the royal navy and the mercantile marine who keep the sea during the unforgettable day of the intensive campaign this book therefore give the outline of the work accomplish by the navy in combate the unrestricted submarine warfare institute by the central power in February 1917 it would have be a labor of love to tell at greater length and in more detail how the menace be gradually overcome by the gallantry endurance and strenuous work of those serve afloat in ship fly the white or the red ensign but i have not the necessary material at my disposal for such a exhaustive record the volume be consequently largely concern with the successive step take at the admiralty to deal with a situation which be always serious and which at time assume a very grave aspect the ultimate result of all naval warfare must naturally rest with those who be serve afloat but it be only just to the naval officer and other who do such fine work at the admiralty in prepare for the sea effort that they share in the navy 's final triumph should be know the writing of this book appear also to be the only way in which i could show my keen appreciation of the loyalty and devotion to duty of the naval staff of the many clever ingenious and audacious scheme develop and carry through for the destruction of submarine and the safeguard of ocean-borne trade and of the skilful organization which bring into be and manage with such success that great network of convoy by which the sea communication of the ally be keep open the volume show how the officer who accompany I to the admiralty from the grand fleet at the end of 1916 in association with those already serve in whitehall and other who join in 1917 with the necessary and valuable assistance of we comrade of the mercantile marine gradually produce the measure by which the sea service conquer the gravest danger which have ever face the empire there be at time inevitable set-back as the enemy gain experience of we method and new one have then to be devise and we be always most seriously handicapped by the strain impose upon the fleet by we numerous military and other commitment overseas and by the difficulty of obtain supplies of material owe to the pre-occupation of we industry in meet the need of we army in equipment and munitions but generally speak it may be say that in April 1917 the loss reach they maximum and that from the follow month and onward the battle be be slowly but gradually win by the end of the year it be become apparent that success be assure the volume describe the change carry out in the admiralty staff organization the position of affair in regard to submarine warfare in the early part of 1917 and the numerous anti-submarine measure which be devise and bring into operation during the year the introduction and working of the convoy system be also deal with the entry of the united state of america into the war mark the opening of a new phase of the operation by sea and it have be a pleasure to give particulars of we cordial co-operation with the united state navy the splendid work of the patrol craft and minesweeper be describe all too briefly and i have have to be content to give only a brief summary of the great service of the dover and harwich force finally a effort have be make to suggest the range and character of the work of the production department at the admiralty it be impossible to tell this part of the story without convey some suggestion of criticism since the output never satisfied we requirement i have endeavor also to indicate where it seem to I that change in organization be not justify by result so that in future year we may benefit by the experience gain but i would not like it to be think that i do not and do not realize the difficulty which handicap production or that i do not appreciate to the full the work do by all concerned it be unfortunate that attempt to draw attention to the lesson teach we by the war be regard by many people either as complaint of lack of devotion to the country 's interest on the part of some or as criticism of other who in the year before the war or during the war be responsible for the administration of the navy in anticipation of such a attitude i wish to state emphatically that where mention be make of apparent shortcoming or of action which judge by result do not seem to meet a particular situation this be do solely in order that on any future occasion of a similar character -- and may the day be long postpone -- the nation may profit by experience those who be incline to indulge in criticism should ever bear in mind that the navy be face with problem which be never foresee and could not have be foresee by anyone in this country who for instance would have ever have the temerity to predict that the navy confront by the second greatest naval power in the world would be call upon to maintain free communication across the channel for many month until the month become year in face of the naval force of the enemy establish on the belgian coast pass million of man across in safety as well as vast quantity of store and munitions who would have prophesy that the navy would have to safeguard the passage of hundred of thousand of troops from the dominion to europe as well as the movement of ten of thousand of labourer from china and elsewhere or who moreover would have be believe have he state that the navy would be require to keep open the sea communication of huge army in macedonium egypt palestine mesopotamium and east africa against attack by surface vessel submarine and mine whilst at the same time protect the merchant shipping of ourselves we ally and neutral power against similar peril and assist to ensure the safety of the troops of the united state when they in due course be bring across the atlantic compare those varied task with the comparatively modest duty which in pre-war day be generally assign to the navy and it will be see how much there may be to learn of the lesson of experience and how spare we should be of criticism wisdom distil from event which be unforeseeable should find expression not in criticism of those who do they duty to the best of they ability but in the taking of wise precaution for the future little mention be make in this volume of the work of the grand fleet during the year 1917 but although that fleet have no opportunity of show its fight power it must never be forget that without the grand fleet under the distinguished officer who succeed I as commander-in-chief at the end of 1916 all effort would have be of no avail since every operation by sea as well as by land be carry out under the sure protect shield of that fleet which the enemy could not face i be conscious of many shortcoming in the book but it may prove of interest to those who desire to know something of the measure which gradually wear down the german submarine effort and at any rate it be the only record likely to be available in the near future of the work of fight the submarine in 1917 June 1920 chapter i admiralty organization the change in 1917 it be perhaps as well that the nation generally remain to a great extent unconscious of the extreme gravity of the situation which develop during the great war when the german be sink a increase volume of merchant tonnage week by week the people of this country as a whole rise superior to many disheartening event and never lose they sure belief in final victory but full knowledge of the supreme crisis in we history might have tend to undermine in some quarter that confidence in victory which it be essential should be maintain and in any event the fact could not be disclose without benefit the enemy but the position at time be undoubtedly extremely serious at the opening of the war we possess approximately half the merchant tonnage of the world but experience during the early part of the struggle reveal that we have not a single ship too many for the great and increase oversea military liability which we be steadily incur over and above the responsibility of bring to these shore the greater part of the food for a population of forty-five million people as well as nearly all the raw material which be essential for the manufacture of munitions the whole of we war effort ashore as well as afloat depend first and last on a adequate volume of merchant shipping it be small wonder therefore that those who watch from day to day the increase toll which the enemy take of the country 's sea-carrying power be sometimes fill with deep concern for the future particularly be this the case during the early month of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 for if the menace have not be master to a considerable extent and that speedily not only would the victory of the ally have be imperil but this country would have be bring face to face with condition approach starvation in pre-war day the possibility of these island be blockade be frequently discuss but during the dark day of the unrestricted submarine campaign there be ample excuse for those with imagination to picture the implication of event which be happen from week to week the memory of those day be already become somewhat dim and as a matter of history and a guide to the future it be perhaps well that some account should be give however inadequate of the danger which confront the country and of the means which be adopt to avert the worst consequence of the enemy 's campaign without cease to exert the increase pressure of we sea power upon he fight efficiency and without diminish we military effort overseas the latter point be of great importance it be always necessary to keep the grand fleet at a strength that would ensure its instant readiness to move in water which might be infested by submarine in large number should the german decide upon some operation by the high sea fleet the possibility of action between the fleet necessitate the maintenance of very strong destroyer force with the grand fleet similarly we oversea military expedition with the consequent large number of merchant ship in use as transport or supply ship require a considerable force of destroyer and other small craft these commitment greatly reduce the means at we disposal for deal with the hostile submarine that be attempt to prevent the import of food and raw material into the country reader of book and particularly book deal with war show a natural avidity for what may be describe as the human side of a contest as well as for the dramatic event but whether it be prosecute by sea or by land war be largely a matter of efficient and adequate organization it be a common say that we muddle through we war but we could not afford to muddle in face of the threat which the enemy 's unrestricted submarine campaign represent it be impossible therefore to approach the history of the successful effort make by sea to overcome this menace without describe in some detail the work of organization which be carry out at the admiralty in order to enable the fleet to fulfil its new mission in effect those responsible for the naval policy of the country conduct two war simultaneously the one on the surface and the other under the surface the strategy tactic and weapon which be appropriate to the former be to a large extent useless in the contest against mine and submarine which the enemy employ with the utmost persistency and no little ingenuity even in the russo-japanese war where the mine be little use it exert a marked influence on the course of the war the german base they hope of victory in the early day of the struggle entirely on a war of attrition wage against men-of-war as well as merchant ship the submarine which be throw into the struggle in increase number represent a entirely new development for the submarine be a vessel which can travel unseen beneath the water and while still unseen except for a possible momentary glimpse of a few inch of periscope can launch a torpedo at long or short range and with deadly accuracy in these circumstance it become imperative to organize the admiralty administration to meet new need and to press into the service of the central administration a large number of officer charge with the sole duty of study the new form of warfare which the enemy have adopt and of evolve with scientific assistance novel method of defeat he tactic whilst the enemy 's campaign against merchant shipping always give rise to anxiety there be certain period of greatly increase activity during the summer month of 1916 the loss from submarine attack and from submarine-laid mine be comparatively slight and in fact less than during the latter half of 1915 but in the autumn of 1916 they assume very serious proportion this will be see by reference to the follow table which give the monthly loss in british neutral and ally mercantile gross tonnage from submarine and mine attack _ alone _ for the month of may to November inclusive : may 122793 June 111719 July 110757 August 160077 September 229687 October 352902 November 327245 another disturbing feature be the knowledge that we be not sink enemy submarine at any appreciable rate whilst we know that the german have under construction a very large number of these vessel and that they be thus rapidly add to they fleet it be a matter also of common knowledge that we output of new merchant ship be exceedingly small and i in common with other have urge a policy of greatly increase mercantile ship construction these fact combine with the knowledge that we reserve of food and essential raw material for war purpose be very low lead I when command the grand fleet to the inevitable conclusion that it be essential to concentrate all we naval effort so far as possible on the submarine menace and to adopt the most energetic measure for the protection of we sea communication and the destruction of the enemy 's submarine although it be not easy to see the exact means by which this could be achieve it appear necessary as a first step to form a organization have as its sole duty the study of the question comprise such officer as would be most likely to deal effectively with the problem support by the necessary authority to push forward they idea another necessity be the rapid production of such material as be find to be require for anti-submarine measure with these idea in my mind i have write letter to the admiralty on the subject and be summon to a conference in london on November 1 by mr balfor the first lord the whole question of the submarine warfare be fully discuss with mr balfor and sir henry jackson -lrb- then first sea lord -rrb- during the two day spend in london i have at that time form and express the view that there be very little probability of the high sea fleet put to sea again to risk a fleet action until the new submarine campaign have be give a thorough trial with the high sea fleet in be we could not afford to deplete the grand fleet of destroyer which could under other condition be employ in anti-submarine work and therefore the probable german strategy in these circumstance be to keep the fleet in be at the same time the situation appear so serious that i go so far as to suggest that one grand fleet flotilla of destroyer might under certain condition be withdraw for anti-submarine duty in southern water the misgiving which i entertain be of course share by all those in authority who be acquaint with the fact of the case include the board of admiralty on November 24 mr balfor telegraph offer I the post of first sea lord and in the event of acceptance request I to meet he in edinburgh to discuss matter after consultation with sir charle madden my chief of staff i reply that i be prepare to do what be consider best for the service during the conference with mr balfor in edinburgh on November 27 1916 and after i have agree to go to the admiralty he inform I of the consequent change which he propose to make in flag officer ' appointment in the grand fleet amongst the change he include admiral sir cecil burney who would be relieve of he post as second in command of the grand fleet and commander of the 1st battle squadron as he have practically complete he term of two year in command i thereupon ask that he might be offer the post of second sea lord and that commodore lionel halsey who have be serve as captain of the fleet might be offer that of fourth sea lord in my view it be very desirable that a officer with the great experience in command possess by sir cecil burney should occupy the position of second sea lord under the condition which exist and that one who have serve afloat during the war in both a executive and administrative capacity should become fourth sea lord i also inform mr balfor of my desire to form a anti-submarine division of the war staff at the admiralty and ask that rear-admiral al duff cb should be offer the post of director of the division with captain fc dreyer cb my flag captain in the _ iron duke _ as he assistant all these appointment be make although i arrive in london on November 29 i do not actually take office as first sea lord until December 5 owe to a attack of influenza on that day i relieved sir henry jackson but only hold office under mr balfor for two or three day as the change of government take place just at this period and sir edward carson come to the admiralty in place of mr balfor this book be intend to record fact and not to touch upon personal matter but i can not forbear to mention the extreme cordiality of sir edward carson 's relation with the board in general and myself in particular he devotion to the naval service be obvious to all and in he the navy possess indeed a true and a powerful friend the earliest conversation between the first lord and myself have relation to the submarine menace and sir edward carson throw himself wholeheartedly into the work this be before the day of the unrestricted submarine campaign and although ship be frequently torpedo very large number be still be sink by gun-fire the torpedo do not come into general use until march 1917 one of the most pressing need of this period of attack by gun-fire be consequently a great increase in the number of gun for use in defensively armed merchant vessel and here sir edward carson 's assistance be of great value he fully realize the urgent necessity of the case and be constant in he effort to procure the necessary gun the work carry out in this connection be give in detail in chapter iii -lrb- p 68 -rrb- during sir edward 's tenure of office the reorganization of the naval staff be take in hand change from which great benefit result be effect in the staff organization sir edward very quickly see the necessity for a considerable strengthening of the staff in addition to the newly form and rapidly expand anti-submarine division of the naval staff he realize that the operation division also need increase strength and that it be essential to relieve the first sea lord of the mass of administrative work fall upon he shoulder which have unfortunately be greatly magnify by the circumstance already describe it be as well at this point to describe the condition in regard to staff organization that exist at the admiralty at the end of 1916 and to show how those condition have be arrive at prior to 1909 there be no real staff although the organization at the admiralty include a intelligence department and a mobilization division the director of naval intelligence at that time act in a advisory capacity as chief of the staff indeed prior to 1904 there be but few naval officer at the admiralty at all beyond those in the technical department of the director of naval ordnance and torpedo and the member of the board itself the sea lord be even without naval assistant and depend entirely on the help of a secretary provide by the civilian staff at the admiralty in 1910 a new branch be form term the mobilization and movement department under a director this branch be a first step towards a operation division under mr churchill 's regime at the admiralty in 1911 a more regular staff organization be introduce and a chief of the war staff act under the first sea lord be appoint the organization introduce during he term of office be thus show graphically : chief of staff | ------------------------------------------------------------ | | | director of director of director of operation division intelligence division mobilization division in addition to other duty the mobilization division be charge with the responsibility for the supply of fuel to the fleet from the staff point of view in the organization introduce in 1911 the duty of the chief of the staff be define as be of a advisory nature he possess no executive power consequently all order affect the movement of ship require the approval of the first sea lord before issue and the consequence of this over-centralization be that additional work be throw on the first sea lord the resultant inconvenience be not of much account during peace but become of importance in war and as the war progress the chief of the staff gradually exercise executive function order which be not of the first importance be issue by the staff in accordance with the policy approve generally by the first sea lord the fault in the organization appear to I to lie in non-recognition of the fact that the first sea lord be in reality the chief of the naval staff since he be charge with the responsibility for the preparation and readiness of the fleet for war and for all movement another anomaly exist at the admiralty which be not alter in the 1911 reorganization of the war staff be that the order to the fleet be not draft and issue by the war staff but by the military branch of the secretary 's department the system be only workable because the very able civil servant of the military branch be possess of wide admiralty experience and work in the closest co-operation with the naval officer they work be of the most strenuous nature and be carry out with the greatest devotion but the system be manifestly wrong in principle on the outbreak of war the necessity for place the war registry -lrb- a part of the military branch -rrb- directly under the chief of the staff become apparent and this be do in December 1916 when i take up the post of first sea lord the admiralty war staff be still be work on the general line of the organization introduce by mr churchill in 1911 but it have of course expand to a very considerable extent to meet war condition and a most important trade division which deal with all question connect with the mercantile marine have be form at the outbreak of war under the charge of captain richard webb this division under that very able officer have carry out work of the greatest national importance with marked success the successive change in the staff organization carry out during the year 1917 be as follow : in December 1916 a anti-submarine division of the staff be form this division do not for some reason appear in the navy list as part of the staff organization until some month have elapse although it start work in December 1916 the officer who compose the division be show as bear on the book of hm _ president _ the division relieve the operation division of the control of all vessel include aircraft which be engage in anti-submarine offensive and defensive work and take over also the control of mine-sweeping operation the division be also charge with the duty of examine and perfect all experimental device for combate the submarine menace and of produce fresh scheme for the destruction of enemy submarine this organization be open to the criticism that matter concern operation and material come under the same head but they be so closely ally at this stage that it be deem advisable to accept this departure from correct staff organization the personnel of the division come with I from the grand fleet and at the outset consist of one flag officer -- rear-admiral al duff cb -- two captain four commander three lieutenant-commander and two engineer officer in addition to the necessary clerical staff the small staff of four officer already at the admiralty engage in anti-submarine experimental work which have do much to develop this side of warfare be absorb the new division work directly under I but in close touch with the then chief of the war staff vice-admiral sir henry oliver in the early spring of 1917 the illogical nature of the war staff organization become apparent in that it have no executive function and as the result of discussion between sir edward carson and myself the decision be take that the duty of the naval staff -lrb- the term decide upon in place of that of war staff -rrb- should be make executive and that the first sea lord should assume he correct title as chief of the naval staff as he have in fact already assume the position at the same time the operational work of the staff be group under two head the first mainly concern with operation against the enemy 's surface vessel and the second with the protection of trade and operation against the enemy 's under-water warfare whether the means he employ be submarine or mine the officer vice-admiral sir henry oliver kcb charge with the supervision of the first-named work be style deputy chief of the naval staff -lrb- dcn -rrb- and the officer connect with the second rear-admiral al duff cb be give the title of assistant chief of the naval staff -lrb- acn -rrb- the duty of director of the anti-submarine division of the staff hitherto carry out by admiral duff be at this time take over by captain ww fisher cb who be bring down from the grand fleet for the purpose captain dreyer who have be admiral duff 's original assistant have in the meantime be appoint director of naval ordnance and have be succeed by captain h walwyn dso the mine-sweeping division of the staff be also form and the importance of the question of signal communication be recognize by form a signal section of the staff the adoption of the title of chief of the naval staff by the first sea lord necessarily make the function of the staff executive instead of advisory the staff organization at this period be show graphically below cn | + -- dcn | | | + -- operation division | | | | | + -- home | | + -- foreign | + -- mobilization

memorandum issue by I on the fact that the various division be on no account to work in watertight compartment but be to be in the closest touch with one another the dot line connect the dcn and the acn in the graph be define as indicate that there should be the fullest co-operation between the different portion of the staff in the summer of 1917 the growth of the convoy system necessitate further expansion of the naval staff and a mercantile movement division be add the duty of this division be to organize and regulate the movement of convoy of merchant ship a staff of officer have be by this time send abroad to the port from which convoy be direct to sail and the mercantile movement division act in close touch with the ministry of shipping arrange the assembly and movement of the convoy and they protection the organization of the portion of the staff under the acn at this stage be show below acn | ------------------------------------------------ | | | | director of director of

officer with a clerical staff of this number practically the whole of the mercantile movement and anti-submarine division be add during the year 1917 whilst large addition be also make to the trade division owe to the great increase of work during the first half of the year 1917 the operation division of the naval staff receive a much needed increase of strength by the appointment of additional officer charge under the director of the operation division with the detailed preparation of plan for operation further addition to this branch of the staff be make in the latter half of the year matter be in this position with the reorganization of the naval staff in hand and work towards a definite conclusion when to the intense regret of those who have be privileged to work with he sir edward carson leave the admiralty to become a member of the war cabinet before leave the subject of work at the admiralty during sir edward carson 's administration mention should be make of the progress make in the difficult task of provide officer for the rapidly expand fleet the large program of small craft start in the early part of 1917 involve the eventual provision of a great number of additional officer admiral sir cecil burney the second sea lord take this matter in hand with conspicuous success and the measure which he introduce tide we over a period of much difficulty and make provision for many month ahead sir cecil burney by reason of he intimate knowledge of the personnel -- the result of year of command afloat -- be able to settle also many problem relate to personnel which have be the cause of dissatisfaction in the past sir edward carson on leave the admiralty be succeed by sir eric gedde as first lord sir eric have be bring into the admiralty in may 1917 in circumstance which i will describe later -lrb- _ vide _ chapter x -rrb- one of he first step as first lord which affect admiralty organization be the appointment of a deputy first sea lord this appointment be frankly make more as a matter of expediency than because any real need have be show for the creation of such a office it be unnecessary here to enter into the circumstance which lead to the appointment to which i see objection owe to the difficulty of fitting into the organization a officer bear the title of deputy first sea lord vice-admiral sir rosslyn wemyss -- who have come to england for the purpose of confer with the admiralty before take up the post of british commander-in-chief in the mediterranean -- be select by the first lord as deputy first sea lord shortly after assume office as first lord sir eric gedde express a wish for a further consideration of the question of admiralty organization to this end he appoint a joint war office and admiralty committee to compare the two organization have receive the report of the committee the first lord and i both formulate idea for further reorganization my proposal so far as they concern the naval staff be conceive on the general line of a extension of the organization already adopt since my arrival at the admiralty but i also state that the time have arrive when the whole admiralty organization should be divide more distinctly into two side viz the operational side and the _ materiél _ or administrative side and indicate that the arrangement exist in the time of the old navy board might be largely follow in order that question of operation and _ materiél _ should be quite clearly separate this indeed be the principle of the staff organization which i have adopt in the grand fleet and i be anxious to extend it to the admiralty this principle be accept -- although the term navy board be not reinstitute -- the admiralty board be divide into two committee one for _ operation _ and one for _ materiél _ the whole board meeting at least once a week as require to discuss important question affect both side whilst it be necessary that the maintenance committee should be keep acquaint with the requirement in the shape of material need for operation in which the fleet be engage -- and to the deputy chief of naval staff be assign this particular liaison duty -- i be not in favor of _ discuss _ question affect ordinary operation with the whole board since in addition to the delay thereby involve member of the maintenance committee could not keep in sufficiently intimate touch with such matter and opinion might be form and conclusion express on a incomplete knowledge of fact question of broad policy or of propose major operation be of course in a different category and the above objection do not apply the further alteration in naval staff organization be not adopt without considerable discussion and some difference of opinion as to detail particularly on the subject of the organization of the operation division of the naval staff which i consider should embrace the plan division as a sub-section in order to avoid overlap and delay in my view it be undesirable for a body of officer not work under the authority of those in close touch with the daily operation of the fleet to put forward plan for operation which necessarily involve the use of the same vessel and material as such a procedure must inevitably lead to impracticable suggestion and consequent waste of time the system which i favor be that in use in the army where the operation section of the staff deal also with the work out of plan the admiralty staff organization necessarily differ somewhat from that at the war office because during the war the admiralty in a sense combine so far as naval operation be concern the function both of the war office and of general headquarters in france this be due primarily to the fact that intelligence be necessarily centre at the admiralty and secondly because the admiralty act in a sense as commander-in-chief of all the force work in the vicinity of the british isle it be not possible for the commander-in-chief of the grand fleet to assume this function since he could not be provide with the necessary knowledge without great delay be cause and further when he be at sea the other command would be without a head the admiralty therefore necessarily assume the duty whilst supply each command with all the information require for operation the general line of the staff organization at the war office and at general headquarters in france be here give for the sake of comparison with the naval staff organization 1 -- _ the british war office _ the approximate organization be show as concisely as possible in the follow diagram : chief of imperial general staff director of staff duty staff duty organization and training war organization of force general question of training signal and communication director of military operation operation on all front director of military intelligence intelligence espionage the press the other important department of the war office on the administration side be those of the adjutant-general and the quartermaster-general the former deal with all question relate to the personnel of the army under the various heading of organization mobilization pay and discipline and the latter with all question of supply and transport a deputy chief of the imperial general staff be attach to the chief of the imperial general staff he main duty be to act as a liaison between the general staff and the

now be carry a stage further and apply systematically to the organization of the operation side of the board and that of the naval staff in future the general distribution of duty between the member of the board belong to the naval staff will be as follow : -- first sea lord and chief naval policy and general direction of naval staff of operation deputy chief of naval war operation in home staff water assistant chief of naval trade protection and staff anti-submarine operation deputy first sea lord general policy question and operation outside home water the detailed arrangement have be carefully work out so as to relieve the first three of these officer of the necessity of deal with any question not directly connect with the main operation of the war and the great mass of important paper work and administrative detail which be inseparably and necessarily connect with staff work but which have hitherto tend to compete for attention with operation work generally will under the new organization be divert to the deputy first sea lord the grouping of the director of the naval staff division will be govern by the same principle the only two director that will work immediately under the first sea lord will be the director of intelligence division -lrb- rear-admiral sir reginald hall -rrb- and the director of training and staff duty -lrb- rear-admiral j c ley -rrb- whose function obviously affect all the other staff division alike under the deputy chief of naval staff will be group three director whose duty will relate entirely to the planning and direction of operation in the main sphere of naval activity viz : -- director of operation division captain adp pound -lrb- home -rrb- director of plan division captain ctm fuller cmg dso director of air division wing captain fr scarlett dso together with the director of signal division acting-captain rl nicholson dso whose duty relate to the system of fleet communication under the assistant chief of naval staff will be group four director whose duty relate to trade protection and anti-submarine operation viz : -- director of anti-submarine captain ww fisher cb division director of mine-sweeping captain lg preston cb division director of mercantile movement captain fa whitehead division director of trade division captain ag hotham under the deputy first sea lord there will be one _ director of operation division -lrb- foreign -rrb- _ -- captain cpr coode dso the chief change on the maintenance side of the board relate to the distribution of duty amongst the civil member the continuance of the war have cause a steady increase in the number of case in which necessary development of admiralty policy due to the war or experience result from war condition give rise to administrative problem of great importance and complexity of which a solution will have to be forthcoming either immediately upon or very soon after the conclusion of the war the difficulty of concentrate attention on these problem of the future in the midst of current administrative work of great urgency may easily be appreciate and the civil lord have consent to take charge of this important matter with suitable naval and other assistance he will therefore be relieve by the second civil lord of the administration of the program of naval work include the question of priority of labor and material requirement arise therefrom and the superintendence of the director of work department it have further be decide that the exceptional labor and other difficulty now attend upon the execution of the very large program of urgent naval work in progress have so greatly transform the function of the director of work department of the admiralty that it be desirable whilst these abnormal condition last to place that department under the charge of a expert in the rapid execution of large engineering work the army council have consent at the request of the first lord of the admiralty to lend for this purpose the service of colonel alexander gibb kbe cb re chief engineer port construction british army in france colonel gibb -lrb- of the firm of easton gibb son and company which build rosyth naval base -rrb- will have the title of civil engineer-in-chief and will be assist by the director of work who retain he status as such and the exist staff of the department which will be strengthen as necessary another important change have reference to the organization of the admiralty board of invention and research and have the object at once of secure greater concentration of effort in connection with scientific research and experiment and ensure that the distinguished scientist who be give they assistance to the admiralty be more constantly in and amongst the problem upon which they be advise mr charle h merz minstce the well-known electrical consulting engineer who have be associate with the board of invention and research -lrb- bir -rrb- since its inception have consent to serve as director of experiment and research -lrb- unpaid -rrb- at the admiralty to direct and supervise all the executive arrangement in connection with the organization of scientific research and experiment mr merz will also be a member of the central committee of the bir under the presidency of admiral of the fleet lord fisher the function of the central committee will as hitherto be to initiate investigate develop and advise generally upon proposal in respect to the application of science and engineering to naval warfare but the distinguished scientific expert at present give they service will in future work more much closely with the technical department of the admiralty immediately concern with the production and use of apparatus require for specific purpose the general arrangement in regard to the organization of scientific research and experiment will in future come under the direct supervision of the first lord possibly by reason of the manner in which the announcement be make the press appear to assume that the whole of this admiralty organization be new such be not the case apart from the change in the personnel of the board itself and a slight rearrangement of they duty and those due to the establishment of a air ministry -lrb- which have be arrange by the cabinet before December 1917 -rrb- there be but slight alteration in the organization show in table a -lrb- above -rrb- as will be see by compare it with table c on p 27 -lrb- below -rrb- which indicate graphically the organization give in the admiralty communique table c first sea lord and chief of naval staff deputy chief of naval staff director of signal division director of operation division -lrb- home -rrb- director of plan division director of air division deputy first sea lord director of operation division -lrb- foreign -rrb- and administrative detail work director of intelligence division director of training and staff duty assistant chief of naval staff director of trade division director of mercantile movement director of mine-sweeping director of anti-submarine division it will be see that the alteration in naval staff organization be as follow : -lrb- a -rrb- the new deputy first sea lord -- rear-admiral hope -- who since the spring of 1917 have be director of the operation division be give the responsibility for operation in foreign water with a director of operation -lrb- foreign -rrb- under he and be also definitely charge with the administrative detail involve technical matter the special gift experience and aptitude of this particular officer for such work enable he no doubt to relieve the pressure on the first sea lord for administrative detail very materially -lrb- b -rrb- the operation division be separate into two part -lrb- home and foreign -rrb- with a director for each instead of there be a deputy director for home and a assistant director for foreign work both work under the director this be a change in name only as the same officer continue the foreign work under the new arrangement -lrb- c -rrb- the director of the intelligence division and the director of training and staff duty be show as work immediately under the first sea lord and chief of the naval staff -lrb- d -rrb- a director of the air division be introduce as a result of the naval air service have be separate from the admiralty and place under the air ministry a larger admiralty staff organization for aerial matter thus become necessary since the staff could no longer refer to the naval air service there be no other change in the staff organization as regard the general admiralty organization there be no change except that cause by the disappearance of the separate naval air service the addition of a second civil lord and some reorganization of the board of invention and research which have be under discussion for some month previously it be probable that in 1918 the chief of the naval staff have more time at he disposal than be the case in 1917 owe to the change in organization initiate in the later year have reach some finality and to the fact that the numerous anti-submarine measure put in hand in 1917 have become effective in 1918 the future admiralty naval staff organization which be in my mind at the end of 1917 be a development of that show in table a p 20 subject to the follow remark : in the organization then adopt the personality and experience during the war of many of the officer in high position be of necessity consider and the organization to that extent adapt to circumstance this result in somewhat overload the staff at the head and the principle on which the board of admiralty work ie that its member be colleague one of another and seniority in rank do not theoretically give greater weight in council be not altogether follow thus the deputy chief of the naval staff the assistant chief of the naval staff and the deputy first sea lord be by the nature of they duty subordinate to the chief of the naval staff and yet be member of the board the well-known loyalty of naval officer to one another tend to minimize any difficulty that might have arise from this anomaly but the arrangement might conceivably give rise to difficulty and be best avoid if the board system be to remain the situation would be clearer if two of the three officer concern be remove altogether from the board viz the deputy first sea lord and the assistant chief of the naval staff leave only the deputy chief of the naval staff as a member of the board to act in the absence of the chief of the naval staff and to relieve he of the administrative and technical work not immediately connect with operation the work of the two officer thus remove should under these condition be undertake by officer who should preferably be flag officer with experience in command at sea have the title of director of operation whose emolument should be commensurate with they position and responsibility i do not consider it advisable to carry out this alteration during the war and it be also difficult under the hour to hour stress of war to rearrange all the duty of the naval staff in the manner most convenient to the conduct of staff business although its desirability be recognize during 1917 it may be as well to close this chapter by a few remark on staff work generally in the navy in the first place it be necessary in the navy to give much weight to the opinion of specialist officer and for this reason it be desirable that they should be include in the staff organization and not attach to it as be the case with we army in pre-war day the reason for this be that in the army there be except in regard to artillery little specialization the training receive by a officer of any of the fight branch of the army at the staff college may fit he to assist in the planning and execution of operation provide due regard be pay to question of supply transport housing etc this be not so in a navy a ship and all that she contain be the weapon and very intimate knowledge of the different factor that go to make a ship a efficient weapon be necessary if the ship be to be use effectively and if operation in which the ship take so prominent a part be to be successfully plan and execute or if a sound opinion be to be express on the training necessary to produce and maintain she as a efficient weapon the particular point in which this specially intimate knowledge be require be : -lrb- a -rrb- the science of navigation and of handle ship of all type and class -lrb- b -rrb- gunnery -lrb- c -rrb- torpedo and mine it be the case at present -lrb- and the condition be not likely to alter -rrb- that each one of these subject be a matter for specialist training every executive officer have a general knowledge of each subject but it be not possible for any one officer to possess the knowledge of all three which be gain by the specialist and if attempt be make to plan operation without the assistance of the specialist grave error may be make and indeed such error be make during the late war perhaps from this cause in my view therefore it be desirable that specialist officer should be include in a naval staff organization and not be merely attach to it it may be say that a staff can take the advice of specialist officer who be _ attach _ to it for that purpose but there be a danger that the specialist advice may never reach the head of the staff human nature be what it be the safest procedure be to place the specialist officer where he voice must be hear ie to give he a position on the staff for one must legislate for the _ average _ individual and for normal condition of work the chief of a staff _ might _ have specialist knowledge himself or he _ might _ assure himself that due weight have be give to the opinion of specialist attach to a staff but on the other hand it be possible that he might not have that knowledge and that he might ignore the opinion of the specialist the procedure suggest be at least as necessary when consider the question of training as it be in the case of operation in pass from this point i may say that i have hear the opinion express by military staff officer that the war have show that artillery be so all important that it would be desirable to place the major-general of the royal artillery now _ attach _ to general headquarters on the staff for operational matter finally great care should be exercise to prevent the staff become larger than be necessary and there be some danger that the ignorant may gauge the value of the staff by its size von schellendorff say on this subject : the principle strictly follow throughout the german service of reduce all staff to the smallest possible dimension be moreover vindicate by restrict every staff to what be absolutely necessary and by not attach to every army army corps and divisional staff representative of all the various branch and department accord to any fixed rule there can not be the slightest doubt that the addition of every individual not absolutely require on a staff be in itself a evil in the first place it unnecessarily weaken the strength of the regiment from which a officer be take again it increase the difficulty of provide the staff with quarter which affect the troops that may happen to be quarter in the same place and these be quite ready enough as it be occasionally to look with a certain amount of dislike -- though in most case it be entirely uncalled for -- on the personnel of the higher staff finally it should be remember -- and this be the most weighty argument against the proceeding -- that _ idleness be at the root of all mischief _ when there be too many officer on a staff they can not always find the work and occupation essential for they mental and physical welfare and they superfluous energy soon make themselves feel in all sort of objectionable way experience show that whenever a staff be unnecessarily numerous the ambitious before long take to intrigue the litigious soon produce general friction and the vain be never satisfy these failing so common to human nature even if all present be to a great extent counteract if those concern have plenty of hard and constant work besides the number of a staff be few there be all the greater choice in the selection of the man who be to fill post on it in form a staff for war the qualification require include not only great professional knowledge and acquaintance with service routine but above all thing character self-denial energy tact and discretion chapter ii the submarine campaign in the early part of 1917 the struggle against the depredation of the enemy submarine during the year 1917 be two-fold _ offensive _ in the direction of anti-submarine measure -lrb- this be partly the business of the anti-submarine division of the naval staff and partly that of the operation division -rrb- _ defensive _ in the direction of protective measure for trade whether carry in we own ship or in ship belong to we ally or to neutral this be the business of the trade and mercantile movement division prior to the formation of the mercantile movement division the whole direction of trade be in the hand of the trade division of the staff the difficulty with which we be constantly face in the early part of 1917 when the effective means of fight the submarine be very largely confine to the employment of surface vessel be that of provide a sufficient number of such vessel for _ offensive _ operation without incur too heavy risk for we trade by the withdrawal of vessel engage in what might be term _ defensive _ work there be always great doubt whether any particular offensive operation undertake by small craft would produce any result particularly as the number necessary for success be not available whilst there be the practical _ certainty _ that withdrawal of defensive vessel would increase we loss the situation be so serious in the spring of 1917 that we could not carry out experiment involve grave risk of considerably increase loss on the other hand the sinking of one enemy submarine mean the possible saving of a considerable number of merchant ship it be difficult to draw the line between the two class of operation the desire of the anti-submarine division to obtain destroyer for offensive use in hunting flotilla in the north sea and english channel lead to continual request be make to I to provide vessel for the purpose i be of course anxious to institute offensive operation but in the early day of 1917 we could not rely much on depth-charge attack owe to we small stock of these charge and my experience in the grand fleet have convince I that for success in the alternative of hunting submarine for a period which would exhaust they battery and so force they to come to the surface a large number of destroyer be require unless the destroyer be provide with some apparatus which would by sound or otherwise locate the submarine this will be realize when the fact be recall that a german submarine could remain submerge at slow speed for a period which would enable she to travel a distance of some 80 mile as this distance could be cover in any direction in open water such as the north sea it be obvious that only a very numerous force of destroyer steam at high speed could cover the great area in which the submarine might come to the surface she would naturally select the dark hour for emergence as be the period of very limited range of vision for those search for she in confine water such as those in the eastern portion of the english channel the problem become simpler request for destroyer constantly come from every quarter such as the commanders-in-chief at portsmouth and devonport the senior naval officer at gibraltar the vice-admiral dover the rear-admiral commanding east coast and the admiral at queenstown the vessel they want do not however exist eventually with great difficulty a force of six destroyer be collect from various source in the spring of 1917 and use in the channel solely for hunting submarine this number be really quite inadequate and it be not long before they have to be take for convoy work evidence of the difficulty of successfully hunting submarine be often furnish by the experience of we own vessel of this type sometimes when hunt by the enemy sometimes when hunt in error by we own craft many of we submarine go through some decidedly unpleasant experience at the hand of we own surface vessel and occasionally at the hand of vessel belong to we ally on several such occasion the submarine be frequently report as have be sink whereas she have escape as a example of a submarine that succeed not only in evade destruction but in get at least even with the enemy the case of one of we vessel of the e class on patrol in the heligoland bight may be cite this submarine run into a heavy anti-submarine net and be drag nose first to the bottom after half a hour 's effort during which bomb be explode in she vicinity the submarine be bring to the surface by she own crew by the discharge of a great deal of water from she forward ballast tank it be find however that the net be still foul of she and that a zeppelin be overhead evidently attract by the disturbance in the water due to the discharge of air and water from the submarine she go to the bottom again and after half a hour succeed in get clear of the net meanwhile the zeppelin have collect a force of trawler and destroyer and the submarine be hunt for fourteen hour by this force assist by the airship during this period she succeed in sink one of the german destroyer and be eventually leave unmolested for a correct appreciation of submarine warfare it be necessary to have a clear idea of the characteristic and quality of the submarine herself of the number possess by the enemy and of the rate at which they be be produce it be also necessary in order to understand the difficulty of introduce the counter measure adopt by the royal navy to know the length of time require to produce the vessel and the weapon which be employ or which it be intend to employ in the anti-submarine war the german submarine may be divide into four class viz : submarine cruiser u-boat ub-boats uc-boat there be several variation of each class the earlier _ submarine cruiser _ of the deutschland class be double-hulled vessel with a surface displacement of 1850 ton and be about 215 foot long they have a surface speed of about 12 knot and a submerged speed of about 6 knot they carry two 59-inch gun two 22 pounder two torpedo tube and 12 torpedo they could keep the sea for quite four month without be dependent on a supply ship or base the later _ submarine cruiser _ be double-hulled 275-320 foot long have a surface speed of 16-18 knot and a submerged speed of about 7 to 8 knot they carry either one or two 59-inch gun six torpedo tube and about 10 torpedo they have a very large radius of action viz from 12000 to 20000 mile at a speed of 6 knot a large number -lrb- some 30 to 40 -rrb- of these boat be under construction at the time of the armistice but very few have be complete there be two or three type of _ u-boat _ the earlier vessel be 210 to 220 foot long double-hulled with a surface displacement of about 750 ton a surface speed of 15 to 16 knot and a submerged speed of about 8 knot they carry one or two 41-inch gun four to six torpedo tube and about 10 torpedo later vessel of the class be 230 to 240 foot long and of 800 to 820 ton surface displacement and carry six torpedo tube and 16 torpedo some of they fit as minelayer carry 36 mine and two torpedo tube but only two torpedo a later and much larger class of minelayer carry a 59-inch gun four torpedo tube 42 mine and a larger number of torpedo the earlier _ u-boat _ could keep the sea for about five week without return to a base or a supply ship the later _ u-boat _ have much greater sea endurance the smaller _ ub-boat _ be single-hulled and about 100 foot long have a surface speed of 7 to 9 knot and a submerged speed of about 5 knot and carry one 22-pounder gun two torpedo tube and four torpedo these boat could keep the sea for about two week without return to a base or supply ship a later class be double-hulled 180 foot long with greater endurance -lrb- 8000 mile at 6 knot -rrb- a surface speed of 13 knot and a submerged speed of 8 knot they carry one 41-inch gun five tube and 10 torpedo the earliest _ uc-boat _ be 111 foot long with a surface displacement of 175 ton a surface speed of 6 - 1\/2 knot and a submerged speed of 5 knot they carry 12 mine but no torpedo tube and as they have a fuel endurance of only 800 mile at 5 - 1\/2 knot they could operate only in southern water the later _ uc-boat _ be 170 to 180 foot long double-hulled have a surface speed of 11 to 12 knot and a submerged speed of about 7 knot carry 18 mine three torpedo tube five torpedo and one 22-pounder gun and they fuel endurance be 8000 to 10000 mile at a speed of 7 to 8 knot at the end of February 1917 it be estimate that the enemy have a total of about 130 submarine of all type available for use in home water and about 20 in the mediterranean of this total a average of between one-half and one-third be usually at sea during the year about eight submarine on the average be add monthly to this total of this number some 50 per cent be vessel of the mine-laying type all the german submarine be capable of prolonged endurance submerge the u-boat could travel under water at the slowest speed for some 48 hour at about 4 knot for 20 hour at 5 knot for about 12 hour and at 8 knot for about 2 hour they be test to depths of at least 180 foot but many submerge to depth exceed 250 foot without injury they do not usually lie on the bottom at depths greatly exceed 20 fathom -lrb- 120 foot -rrb- all german submarine except possibly the _ cruiser class _ could dive from diving trim in from 30 seconds to one minute the _ ub class _ have particularly rapid diving quality and be very popular boat with the german submarine officer perhaps the most noticeable feature of the german submarine as a whole be they excellent engine and they great strength of construction prior to the month of February 1917 it be the usual practice of the enemy submarine in the warfare against merchant ship to give some warning before deliver she attack this be by no mean a universal rule particularly in the case of british merchant vessel as be evidence by the attack on the _ lusitanium arabic _ and score of other ship in the year 1915 and 1916 however only 21 and 29 per cent respectively of the british merchant ship sink by enemy submarine be destroy without warn whilst during the first four month of the unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917 the figure rise to 64 per cent and go higher and higher as the month progress prior to February 1917 the more general method of attack on ship be to bring they to by means of gun-fire they be then sink by gun-fire torpedo or bomb this practice necessitate the submarine be on the surface and so give a merchant ship defensively arm a chance of reply to the gun-fire and of escape and it also give armed decoy ship a good opportunity of successful action if the submarine could be induce to close to very short range the form of attack on commerce know as unrestricted submarine warfare be commence by germany with the object of force great britain to make peace by cut off she supplies of food and raw material it have be acknowledge by german in high position that the german admiralty consider that this form of warfare would achieve its object in a comparatively short time in fact in a matter of some five or six month experience british naval officer aware of the extent of the german submarine building program and above all aware of the shadowy nature of we exist means of defense against such a form of warfare have every reason to hold the view that the danger be great and that the ally be face with a situation fraught with the very gravest possibility the principal doubt be as to the ability of the enemy to train submarine crew with sufficient rapidity to keep pace with he building program however it be ascertain that the german have evidently devote a very great number of they submarine to training work during the period September 1915 to march 1916 possibly in anticipation of the unrestricted warfare since none of they larger boat be operate in we water between these month this fact have a considerable bearing on the problem as event turn out it would appear either that the training give be insufficient or that the german submarine officer be lack in enterprise there be no doubt whatever that have the german craft engage in the unrestricted submarine warfare be man by british officer and man adopt german method there would have be but few ally or neutral merchant ship leave afloat by the end of 1917 so long as the majority of the german submarine attack upon shipping be make by gun-fire the method of defense be comparatively simple in that it merely involve the supply to merchant ship of gun of sufficient power to prevent the submarine engage at range at which the fire could not be return whilst the _ method _ of defense be apparent the problem of _ supply _ suitable gun in sufficient number be a very different matter it involve arm all we merchant ship with gun of 4-inch calibre and above in January 1917 only some 1400 british ship have be so armed since the outbreak of war it will be see therefore that so long as ship sail singly very extensive supplies of gun be require to meet gun attack and as there be most pressing need for the supply of gun for the army in france as well as for the anti-aircraft defense of london the prospect of arm merchant ship adequately be not promising when the enemy commence unrestricted submarine warfare attack by gun-fire be gradually replace by attack by torpedo and the problem at once become infinitely more complicated gun-fire be no longer a protection since the submarine be rarely see the first intimation of she presence would be give by the track of a torpedo come towards the ship and no defense be then possible beyond a endeavor to maneuver the ship clear of the torpedo since however a torpedo be always some distance ahead of the bubble which mark its track -lrb- the speed of the torpedo exceed 30 knot a hour -rrb- the track be not as a rule see until the torpedo be fairly close to the ship unless the sea be absolutely calm the chance of a ship of low speed avoid a hit by a timely alteration of course after the torpedo have be fire be but slight further the only difficulty experience by a submarine in hit a move vessel by torpedo-fire once she have arrive in a position suitable for attack lie in estimate correctly the course and speed of the target in the case of a ordinary cargo ship there be little difficulty in guess she speed since it be certain to be between 8 and 12 knot and she course can be judge with fair accuracy by the angle of she mast and funnel or by the angle present by she bridge it will be see then how easy be the problem before the german submarine officer and how very difficult be that set to we navy and we gallant mercantile marine it will not be out of place here to describe the method which be in force at the end of 1916 and during the first part of 1917 for afford protection to merchant shipping approach we coast from the direction of the atlantic ocean the general idea date from the early month of the war be to disperse trade on passage over wide tract of ocean in order to prevent the successful attack which could be so easily carry out if shipping traverse one particular route to carry out such a system it be necessary to give each vessel a definite route which she should follow from she port of departure to she port of arrival unless this course be adopt successive ship would certainly be find to be follow identical or practically identical route thereby greatly increase the chance of attack in the early year of the war master of ship be give approximate track but when the unrestricted submarine campaign come into be it become necessary to give exact route the necessary order be issue by officer station at various port at home and abroad who be designate shipping intelligence or report officer it be of course essential to preserve the secrecy of the general principle govern the issue of route order and of the route order themselves for this reason each master be only inform of the order affect he own ship and be direct that such order should on no account fall into the hand of the enemy the route order be compile on certain principle of which a few may be mention : -lrb- a -rrb- certain definite position of latitude and longitude be give through which the ship be require to pass and the order be discuss with the master of each vessel in order to ensure that they be fully understand -lrb- b -rrb- direction be give that certain locality in which submarine be know to operate such as the approach to the coast of the unite kingdom be if possible to be cross at night it be point out that when the speed of the ship do not admit of traverse the whole danger area at night the portion involve the greatest danger -lrb- which be the inshore position -rrb- should as a rule be cross during dark hour -lrb- c -rrb- similarly the order state that ship should as a rule leave port so as to approach the dangerous area at dusk and that they should make the coast at about daylight and should avoid as far as possible the practice of make the land at point in general use in peace time -lrb- d -rrb- order be definite that ship be to zigzag both by day and at night in certain area and if keep wait outside a port -lrb- e -rrb- master be caution to hug the coast as far as navigational facility admit when make coastal passage the order -lrb- b -rrb- -lrb- c -rrb- and -lrb- d -rrb- be those in practice in the grand fleet when circumstance permit during my term in that command a typical route order from new york to liverpool might be as follow : after pass sandy hook hug the coast until dark then make a good offing before daylight and steer to pass through the follow position viz : lat 38 ° n long 68 ° w lat 41 ° n long 48 ° w lat 46 ° n long 28 ° w lat 51 ° 30 ' n long 14 ° w thence make the coast near the skellig approximately at daylight hug the irish coast to the tuskar up the irish coast -lrb- inside the bank if possible -rrb- and across the irish channel during dark hour thence hug the coast to you port zigzag by day and night after pass long 20 ° w sometimes ship be direct to cross to the english coast from the south of ireland and to hug the english coast on they way north the traffic to the unite kingdom be so arrange in the early part of 1917 as to approach the coast in four different area which be know as approach a b c and d approach a be use for traffic bind towards the western approach to the english channel approach b for traffic make for the south of ireland approach c for traffic make for the north of ireland approach d for traffic make for the east coast of england via the north of scotland the approach area in force during one particular period be show on chart a -lrb- in pocket at the end of the book -rrb- they be change occasionally when suspicion be arouse that they limit be know to the enemy or as submarine attack in a area become intense -lrb- transcriber 's note : chart a be a navigational map of the water southwest of england with approach route marked -rrb- the approach area be patrol at the time so far as number admit by patrol craft -lrb- trawler torpedo-boat destroyer and sloop -rrb- and ship with specially valuable cargo be give direction to proceed to a certain rendezvous on the outskirts of the area there to be meet by a destroyer or sloop if one be available for the purpose the area be necessarily of considerable length by reason of the distance from the coast at which submarine operate and of considerable width owe to the necessity for a fairly wide dispersion of traffic throughout the area consequently with the comparatively small number of patrol craft available the protection afford be but slight and loss be correspondingly heavy in the early spring of 1917 captain hw grant of the operation division at the admiralty whose work in the division be of great value propose a change in method by which the traffic should be bring along certain definite line in each approach area typical line be show in chart b -lrb- transcriber 's note : chart b be a navigational map of the water southwest of ireland with approach route marked -rrb- the idea be that the traffic in say approach route b should commence on a certain date be order by the routee officer to pass along the line alpha traffic would continue along the line for a certain period which be fix at five day when it would be automatically divert to another line say gamma but the traffic along gamma would not commence until a period of 24 hour have elapse since discontinuance of the use of the line alpha this be necessary in order to give time for the patrol craft to change from one line to the other during this period of 24 hour the arrangement for routee at the port of departure ensure that no traffic would reach the outer end of any of the approach line and consequently that traffic would cease on line alpha 24 hour before it commence on line gamma after a further period of five day the line would again change automatically it be necessary that ship intelligence officer should have in they possession the order for direct traffic on to the various line for some considerable time ahead and the master of ship which be likely to be for some time at sea be inform of the date between which the various line be to be use up to a date sufficient to cover the end of they voyage there be therefore some danger of this information reach the enemy if a vessel be capture by a submarine and the master fail to destroy he instruction in time there be also some danger in give the information to neutral however the system which be adopt do result in a reduction of loss during the comparatively short time that it be in use and the knowledge that patrol craft on the line would be much closer together than they would be in a approach area certainly give confidence to the personnel of the merchant ship and those who have be force to abandon they ship by take to the boat be afford a better chance of be pick up various arrangement be in existence for effect rapidly a diversion of shipping from one route to another in the event of submarine be located in any particular position and a continual change of the signal for this purpose be necessary to guard against the possibility of the code be compromise by have fall into enemy hand a event which unfortunately be not infrequent elaborate order be necessary to regulate coastal traffic and fresh direction be continually be issue as danger especially danger from mine be located generally speak the traffic in home water be direct to hug the coast as closely as safe navigation permit two reason exist for this -lrb- a -rrb- in water of a depth of less than about eight fathom german submarine do not care to operate and -lrb- b -rrb- under the procedure indicate danger from submarine attack be only likely on the side remote from the coast here be a example of the instruction for pass up channel : _ from falmouth to portland bill _ -- hug the coast follow round the bay except when pass torbay -lrb- direction follow as to the procedure here -rrb- _ from portland bill to st catherine _ -- pass close south of the shambles and steer for anvil point thence hug the coast follow round the bay and so on as it be not safe navigationally to follow round the bay during darkness the instruction direct that ship be to leave the daylight route at dusk and to join the dark period route show dimmed bow light whilst do so two dark period route be lay down one for vessel bind up channel and another for vessel bind down channel and these route be some five mile apart in order to minimize the danger of collision ship be direct not to use they navigation light except for certain portion of the route during which they cross the route of transport and store ship bind between certain southern british port -lrb- portsmouth southampton and devonport -rrb- and french port route be similarly lay down for ship to follow when navigate to or from the bristol channel and for ship navigate the irish sea any system of convoy be at this time out of the question as neither the cruiser to marshal the convoy to the submarine area nor the destroyer to screen it when there be available there be one very important factor in the situation viz the comparative rate at which the german could produce submarine and at which we could build vessel suitable for anti-submarine warfare and for defense of commerce the vary estimate give cause for grave anxiety we average output of _ destroyer _ be four to five per month indeed this be put the figure high and of course we suffer loss the french and italian be not produce any vessel of this type whilst the japanese be in the early part of 1917 not able to spare any for work in european water although later in the year they lend twelve destroyer which give valuable assistance in the mediterranean the united state of america be not then in the war consequently measure for the defense of the ally trade against the new menace depend on we own production we _ submarine _ be be produce at a average rate of about two per month only and -- apart from motor launch which be only of use in the finest weather and near the coast -- the only other vessel suitable for anti-submarine work that be build at the time besides some sloop and p-boat be trawler which whilst useful for protection patrol be too slow for most of the escort work or for offensive duty the german ' estimate of they own submarine production be about twelve per month although this figure be never realize the average be nearer eight but each submarine be capable of sink many merchant ship thus necessitate the employment of a very large number of we destroyer and therein lay the gravity of the situation as we realize at the admiralty early in 1917 that no effort of ours could increase the output of destroyer for at least fifteen month the shortest time then take to build a destroyer in this country and here it be interesting to compare the time occupy in the production of small craft in great britain and in germany during the war in pre-war day we rarely build a destroyer in less than twenty-four month although shortly before the war effort be make to reduce the time to something like eighteen to twenty month submarine occupy two year in construction in start the great building program of destroyer and submarine at the end of 1914 lord fisher increase very largely the number of firm engage in construct vessel of both type hope be hold out of the construction both of destroyer and of submarine in about twelve month but labor and other difficulty intervene and although some firm do complete craft of both class during 1915 in less than twelve month by 1916 and 1917 destroyer _ average _ about eighteen month and submarine even longer for completion the german have always build they small craft rapidly although they heavy ship be longer in construction than we own they destroyer be complete in a little over twelve month from the official date of order in pre-war day during the early year of the war it would seem that they maintain this figure and they succeed in build they smaller submarine of the ub and uc type in some six to eight month as ub and uc boat begin to be deliver as early as April 1915 and it be certain that they be not order before August 1914 the time take by the german to build submarine of the u type be estimate by we at twelve month and that of submarine cruiser at eighteen month german submarine officer give the time as eight to ten month for a u-boat and eighteen month for a submarine cruiser -lrb- it be to be observe that captain persius in a recent article give a much longer period for the construction of the german submarine it be not state whether he have access to official figure and he statement be not in agreement with the figure give by german submarine officer -rrb- it be of interest to note here the rate of ship production attain by some firm in the united state of america during the war as i mention later -lrb- _ vide _ chapter vi p 157 -rrb- the bethlehem steel company under mr schwab 's guidance produce ten submarine for we in five month from the date of the order mr schwab himself inform I that towards the end of the war he be turn out large destroyer in six week the ford company as be well know produce submarine chaser of the eagle type in even a shorter period but these vessel be of special design and construction i have deal so far with the question of anti-submarine measure involve only the use of destroyer and other small surface craft there be of course other method both in use and under consideration early in 1917 when we take stock of the situation for some time we have be use _ decoy vessel _ and with some success it be possible to increase the number of these ship at the cost of take merchant ship off the trade route or by build a very considerable increase be arrange the use of we own _ submarine _ offensively against enemy submarine have also be try and have meet with occasional success but we number be very limited -lrb- the total in December 1916 fit for oversea or anti-submarine work be about forty -rrb- they be much need for reconnaissance and offensive work against surface man-of-war in enemy water and only a few be at the time available for anti-submarine operation and then only at the cost of other important service the _ hydrophone _ have be in the experimental stage and under trial for a considerable period but it have not so far develop into a effective instrument for locate submarine and although trial of the different pattern which have be devise be push forward with energy many month elapse before it become a practicable proposition one of the best offensive measure against the enemy submarine it be realize be the _ mine _ if lay in sufficiently large number unfortunately in January 1917 we do not possess a mine that be satisfactory against submarine we deficiency in this respect be clearly show in the course of some trial which i order when one of we own submarine be run against a number of we mine with the result that only about 33 per cent of the mine -lrb- fit of course only with small charge -rrb- explode the german be well aware that we mine be not very effective against submarine we possess at the time mine of two pattern and whilst prove unsatisfactory against submarine they be also find to be somewhat unreliable when lay in minefield design to catch surface vessel owe to a defect in the mooring apparatus this defect be remedy but valuable time be lose whilst the necessary alteration be be carry out and although we possess in April 1917 a stock of some 20000 mine only 1500 of they be then fit for lay the position therefore be that we mine be not a satisfactory anti-submarine weapon a _ new pattern mine _ which have be design on the model of the german mine during sir henry jackson 's term of office as first sea lord in 1916 be experiment with at the commencement of 1917 and as soon as drawing could be prepared order for upward of 100000 be place in anticipation of its success there be some initial difficulty before all the detail be satisfactory and in spite of the greatest pressure on manufacturer it be not until November 1917 that mine of this pattern be be deliver in large number the earliest minefield lay in the heligoland bight in September and October 1917 with mine of the new pattern meet with immediate success against enemy submarine as do the minefield compose of the same type of mine the lay of which commence in November 1917 in the strait of dover when it become possible to adopt the system of bring merchant ship in convoy through the submarine zone under the escort of a screen of destroyer this system become in itself to a certain extent a offensive operation since it necessarily force the enemy submarine desirous of obtain result into position in which they themselves be open to violent attack by depth charge drop by destroyer during the greater part of the year 1917 however it be only possible to supply destroyer with a small number of _ depth charge _ which be they principal anti-submarine weapon as it become feasible to increase largely the supply of these charge to destroyer so the violence of the attack on the submarine increase and they loss become heavier the position then as it exist in the early day of the year 1917 be describe in the foregoing remark the _ result _ measure in loss of shipping -lrb- british ally and neutral -rrb- from submarine and mine attack in the first half of the year be as follow in gross tonnage : January - 324016 February - 500573 march - 555991 April - 870359 may - 589754 June - 675154 because of the time require for production it be a sheer impossibility to _ put into effect _ any fresh device that might be adopt for deal with submarine warfare for many month and all that could be do be to try new method of approach to the coast and as the number of small craft suitable for escort duty increase to extend gradually the convoy system already in force to a certain extent for the french coal trade and the scandinavian trade in the chapter which follow the further step which be take to deal with the problem and the degree of success which attend they will be describe chapter iii anti-submarine operation the previous chapter have deal with the change in organization carry out at the admiralty during the year 1917 largely with the object of be able to deal more effectively with the submarine warfare against merchant ship mention have also be make of the submarine problem with which the navy have to deal particulars of the anti-submarine and other work carry out will now be examine a very large proportion of the successful anti-submarine device bring into use during 1917 and continue throughout the year 1918 be the outcome of the work of the anti-submarine division of the naval staff and it be but just that the high value of this work should be recognize when the history of the war come to be write by future historian as have be state in chapter i rear-admiral ac duff cb be the original head of the division with captain fc dreyer cb commander yeat brown and commander reginald henderson as he immediate assistant captain ht walwyn take the place of captain dreyer on march 1 1917 when the latter officer become director of naval ordnance when admiral duff be appoint assistant chief of the naval staff with a seat on the board in may 1917 captain ww fisher cb become head of the division which still remain one of the division of the staff work immediately under the acn it be to these officer with they most zealous clever and efficient staff that the institution of many of the successful anti-submarine measure be largely due they be indefatigable in they search for new method and in work out and perfect fresh scheme and they keep they mind open to _ new idea _ they receive much valuable assistance from the great civilian scientist who give such ready help during the war the function of the naval officer work with the scientist be to see that the effort be be direct along practical line they be also greatly indebted to captain ryan rn for the exceedingly valuable work carry out by he at the experimental establishment at hawkcraig many brilliant idea be due to captain ryan 's clever brain i doubt whether the debt due to admiral duff and captain fisher and they staff for they great work can ever be thoroughly appreciate but it be certainly my duty to mention it here since i be better able to speak of it than any other person in say this i do not wish to detract in the least from the value of the part perform by those to whose lot it fall to put the actual scheme into operation without they of course nothing could have be accomplish when the anti-submarine division start in December 1916 the earlier device to which attention be devote be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the design and manufacture of howitzer firing shell fit to explode some 40 to 60 foot under water with which to attack submarine when submerge -lrb- 2 -rrb- the introduction of a more suitable projectile for use against submarine than that supply at the time to the gun of destroyer and patrol craft -lrb- 3 -rrb- the improvement of and great increase in the supply of smoke apparatus for the screening of merchant ship from submarine attack by gunfire -lrb- 4 -rrb- a great increase in the number of depth charge supply to destroyer and other small craft -lrb- 5 -rrb- the development of the hydrophone for anti-submarine work both from ship and from shore station -lrb- 6 -rrb- the introduction of the otter for the protection of merchant ship against mine -lrb- 7 -rrb- a very great improvement in the rapidity of arm merchant ship defensively -lrb- 8 -rrb- the extend and organize use of air craft for anti-submarine work -lrb- 9 -rrb- a great development of the special service or decoy ship -lrb- 10 -rrb- the introduction of a form of net protection for merchant ship against torpedo fire other device follow many of which be the outcome of work in other admiralty department particularly the department of the director of naval ordnance and the director of torpedo and mine work in conjunction with the anti-submarine or the operation division of the naval staff some of the new feature be the development of depth-charge thrower the manufacture and use of fast coastal motor-boat for anti-submarine work the production of mine of a improve type for use especially against submarine very considerable development in the use of minefield especially deep minefield include persistent mining in the heligoland bight and the lay of a complete minefield at vary depths in the strait of dover also after the united state enter the war the lay of a very extensive minefield right across the northern part of the north sea the provision of flare for illuminating minefield at night and a system of submarine detection by the use of electrical apparatus be also matter which be take up and press forward during 1917 during the year the system of dazzle painting for merchant ship be bring into general use on the operational side of the naval staff the work of deal with enemy submarine before they pass out of the north sea be take in hand by organize hunting operation by destroyer and other patrol craft and by the more extended use offensively of we own submarine as vessel become available considerable development be effect in the matter of the control of mercantile traffic and much be do to train the personnel of the mercantile marine in matter relate to submarine warfare take these subject in detail it will be of interest to examine the progress make during the year howitzer the _ howitzer _ as a weapon for use against the submarine when submerge be almost non-existent at the beginning of 1917 only thirty bomb-thrower on the line of trench-mortar be on order by April of that year design for seven different kind of bomb-thrower and howitzer have be prepare and approve and order place for 1006 weapon of which number the first 41 be due for delivery in may by the end of may the number of bomb-thrower and howitzer on order have be increase to 2056 of eight different pattern over 1000 of these weapon fire a bomb or shell carry a burster exceed 90 lb in weight and with a range vary between 1200 and 2600 yard later in the war as we gain experience of the value of this form of attack heavier bomb be introduce for use in the exist bomb-thrower and howitzer the howitzer as a anti-submarine weapon be handicap by the comparatively small weight of the burst charge of its shell this apply more particularly to the earlier pattern and to inflict fatal injury it be necessary to burst the shell in close proximity to the submerge submarine this weapon although not very popular at first soon however prove its value when employ both from patrol craft and from merchant ship one curious instance occur on march 28 1918 of a merchant ship be save by a 75-inch howitzer a torpedo be see approach at a distance of some 600 yard and it appear certain to hit the ship a projectile fire from the howitzer explode under water close to the torpedo deflect it from its course and cause it to come to the surface some 60 yard from the ship a second projectile cause it to stop and apparently damage the torpedo which when pick up by a escort vessel be find to be minus its head delivery of howitzer commence in June 1917 and continue as follow : total complete no of howitzer include those date actually issue under proof July 24 1917 35 48 October 1 1917 92 167 December 10 1917 377 422 the slow rate of delivery in spite of constant pressure which be show by these figure give some idea of the time require to bring new device into existence projectile for use against submarine in January 1917 the director of naval ordnance be request by the anti-submarine division of the naval staff to carry out trial against a target represent the hull of a german submarine so far as the detail be know to we to ascertain _ the most suitable type of projectile _ amongst those then in existence for the attack of submarine by gun of 47-inch calibre and below the result be publish to the fleet in march 1917 they afford some useful knowledge and demonstrate the ineffectiveness of some of the shell and fuse commonly in use against submarine from 12-pounder gun the weapon with which so many of we patrol craft be arm the target at which the shell be fire do not however fully represent a german submarine under the condition of service the trial be therefore continue and as a result in June 1917 a further order be issue to the fleet give direction as to the type of projectile to be use against submarine from all nature of gun pend the introduction of delay action fuse for the smaller gun this be the temporary solution of the difficulty until a new type of shell evolve from the experience gain at the trial could be produce and issue the trial which be exhaustive be press forward vigorously and continuously throughout the year 1917 and meanwhile more accurate information as to the exact form of the hull and the thickness of the plating of german submarine become available early in 1918 the first supplies of the new fuse be ready for issue smoke apparatus the earlier _ smoke apparatus _ for supply to merchant ship be design towards the end of 1916 one description of smoke apparatus consist of a arrangement for burn phosphorus at the stern of a ship in other case firework composition and other chemical be use a dense smoke cloud be thus form and with the wind in a suitable direction a vessel could hide she movement from a enemy submarine or other vessel and thus screen herself from accurate shell fire in another form the apparatus be throw overboard and form a smoke cloud on the water the rate of supply of set of the smoke apparatus to ship be show by the follow figure : April 1 1917 - 1372 set July 3 1917 - 2563 set October 5 1917 - 3445 set November 26 1917 - 3976 set depth charge _ depth charge _ as supply to ship in 1917 be of two pattern : one type d contain a charge of 300 lb of tnt and the other type d \* carry 120 lb of tnt at the commencement of 1917 the allowance to ship be two of type d and two of type d \* and the supply be insufficient at that time to keep up the stock require to maintain on board four per destroyer the number for which they be fit or to supply all trawler and other patrol craft with they allowance the great value of the depth charge as a weapon against submarine and the large number that be require for successful attack become apparent early in 1917 and the allowance be increase difficulty be experience throughout the year in maintain adequate stock owe to the shortage of labor and the many demand on we industry make by the war but the improvement be show by the fact that while the average output _ per week _ of depth charge be only 140 in July it have become over 500 by October and that by the end of December it be raise to over 800 and be still increase very rapidly as a consequence early in 1918 it be find possible to increase the supply very largely as many as 30 to 40 per destroyer be carry improvement in the detail of depth charge be effect during 1917 one such improvement be the introduction of a pistol capable of firing at much greater depths than have be in use before the result be that all vessel whether fast or slow could safely use the 300-lb depth charge if set to a sufficient depth this lead to the abolition of the type d \* charge and the universal supply of type d in spite of the difficulty of drop depth charge so close to submarine as to damage they sufficiently to cause they to come to the surface very good result be obtain from they use when destroyer carry enough to form so to speak a ring round the assume position at which the submarine have dive in order to encourage scientific attack on submarine a system of depth charge battle practice be introduce towards the end of 1917 it be as well to correct a common misapprehension as to the value of depth charge in destroy submarine many people hold very exaggerated idea on this subject even to the extent of suppose that a depth charge would destroy a submarine if drop within several hundred yard of she this be unfortunately very far indeed from be the case it be on the contrary necessary to explode the charge near the submarine in order to effect destruction take the depth charge with 300 lb weight of explosive ordinarily supply to destroyer in 1917 it be necessary to explode it within fourteen foot of a submarine to ensure destruction at distance up to about twenty-eight foot from the hull the depth charge might be expect to disable a submarine to the extent of force she to the surface when she could be sink by gun-fire or ram and at distance up to sixty foot the moral effect on the crew would be considerable and _ might _ force the submarine to the surface a consideration of these figure will show that it be necessary for a vessel attack a submarine with depth charge to drop they in very close proximity and the first obvious difficulty be to ascertain the position of a submarine that have dive and be out of sight unless therefore the attack vessel be fairly close to the submarine at the moment of the latter diving there be but little chance of the attack be successful hydrophone the _ hydrophone _ for use in locate submerge submarine although first evolve in 1915 be in its infancy so far as supply to ship be concern at the commencement of 1917 experiment be be carry out by the board of invention and research at harwich and by captain ryan rn at hawkcraig and although very useful result have be obtain and a considerable number of shore station as well as some patrol vessel have be fit with hydrophone which have a listen range of one or two mile all the device for use afloat suffer from the disadvantage that it be not possible to use they whilst the ship carry they be move since the noise of the vessel 's own machinery and of the water pass along the side prevent the noise make by other vessel be located what be require be a listen instrument that could be use by a ship move at least at slow speed otherwise the ship carry the hydrophone be herself when stop a easy target for the submarine 's torpedo it be also essential before a attack could be deliver to be able to locate the _ direction _ of the enemy submarine and prior to 1917 all that these instrument show be the presence of a submarine somewhere in the vicinity much research and experimental work be carry out during the year 1917 under the encouragement and supervision of the anti-submarine division of the naval staff two hydrophone be invent in the early part of 1917 one by captain ryan rn and one by the board of invention and research which could be use from ship at very slow speed and which give some indication of the _ direction _ of the sound finally in the summer of 1917 the ability and patience of one inventor mr nash be reward and a instrument be devise term the fish hydrophone which to a considerable extent fulfil the required condition mr nash whose invention have be consider but not adopt by the board of invention and research before he bring it to the anti-submarine division of the naval staff labor under many difficulty with the greatest energy and perseverance various modification in the design be effect until in October 1917 the instrument be pronounced satisfactory and supplies be put in hand the next step be to fit the fish hydrophone in certain auxiliary patrol vessel as well as some destroyer p boat and motor launch to enter and train man to work it and finally to organize these vessel into submarine hunting flotilla drill they and then set they to they task this work which occupy some time be carry out at portland where a regular establishment be set up for develop the fish hydrophone and for organize and train the hunting flotilla in its use a considerable amount of training in the use of the hydrophone be require before man become efficient and only those with a very keen sense of hearing be suit to the work the chance of the success of the hunting flotilla have be promise in the early experiment and the fitting out of patrol craft and organize and drill they proceed as rapidly as the vessel could be obtain but largely owing to the slow production of trawler it be not until November that the first hunting flotilla fit with the fish hydrophone be actually at work the progress make after this date be illustrate by the fact that in December 1917 a division of drifter with a p boat fit with this fish hydrophone hunt a enemy submarine for seven hour during darkness cover a distance of fifty mile keep touch with she by sound throughout this period and finish by drop depth charge in apparently the correct position since a strong smell of oil fuel result and nothing further could be hear of the submarine although the drifter listen for several hour on another occasion in the same month a division of drifter hunt a submarine for five hour the number of hydrophone be increase as rapidly as possible until by the end of the year the system be in full operation within a limited area and only required expansion to work as be intend on a large scale in the north sea and the english channel meanwhile during 1917 _ directional _ hydrophone which have be successfully produce both by captain ryan and by the board of invention and research have be fit to patrol craft in large number and hunting flotilla be operate in many area a good example of the working of one of these flotilla occur off dartmouth in the summer of 1918 when a division of motor launch fit with the mark ii hydrophone under the general guidance of a destroyer carry out a successful attack on a german submarine early in the afternoon one of the motor launch drop a depth charge on a oil patch and shortly afterwards one of the hydrophone pick up the sound of a internal combustion engine a line of depth charge be run on the bearing indicate by the hydrophone the motor launch and the destroyer remain listen until at about 60 pm a submarine come to the surface not far from motor launch no 135 which fire two round at the submarine before the latter submerge other motor launch close in and depth charge be drop by they in close proximity to the wash of the submarine oil come to the surface and more depth charge be drop in large number on the spot for the ensue forty-eight hour eventually object come to the surface clearly indicate the presence of a submarine further charge be drop and a obstruction on the bottom be locate by means of a sweep this engagement hold peculiar interest for I since during my visit to canada in the winter of 1919 the honor fall to I of present to a canadian -- lieutenant gl cassady rnvr -- at vancouver the distinguished service cross award he by he majesty for he work in motor launch no 135 on this occasion _ motor launch _ be organize into submarine hunting flotilla during the year 1917 these vessel be equip with the directional hydrophone as soon as its utility be establish and be supply with depth charge in the summer of 1917 four such hunting flotilla be busy in the channel the work of one of these i have describe already and they certainly contribute towards make the channel a uneasy place for submarine operation these result be of course greatly improve on in 1918 as the number of ship fit with the fish and other hydrophone increase and further experience be gain the progress in supply of hydrophone be show by the follow table : supply of directional date general service mark i and shark fin fish 1917 portable type mark ii type type jul 31 2750 500 - - aug 31 2750 700 - - sep 30 2750 850 - - oct 31 3500 1000 - - dec 31 3680 1950 870 37 hydrophone station and training school at the beginning of 1917 four _ shore hydrophone station _ be in use during the year eight additional station be complete and several more be near completion the first step necessary be a considerable increase in the instructional facility for training listener both for the increase number of shore station and for the large number of vessel that be fit for hydrophone work during the year the greater part of this training take place at the establishment at hawkcraig near rosyth at which captain ryan rn carry out so much exceedingly valuable work during the war i be not able to give exact figure of the number of officer and man who be instruct in hydrophone work either at hawkcraig or at other station by instructor send from hawkcraig but the total be certainly upward of 1000 officer and 2000 man in addition to this extensive instructional work the development of the whole system of detect the presence of submarine by sound be very largely due to the work originally carry out at hawkcraig by captain ryan the first hydrophone station which be establish in the spring of 1915 be from oxcar lighthouse in the firth of forth it be later in the year transfer to inchcolm experimental work under captain ryan continue at hawkcraig during 1915 and in 1916 a section of the board of invention and research go to hawkcraig to work in conjunction with he this station produce the mark ii directional hydrophone of which large number be order in 1917 for use in patrol craft it be a great improvement on any hydrophone instrument previously in use hawkcraig also produce the directional plate fit to we submarine as well as many other invention use in detect the presence of submarine in addition to the work at hawkcraig a experimental station under the board of invention and research be establish near harwich in January 1917 the mark i directional hydrophone be design at this establishment in 1917 and other exceedingly valuable work be carry out there connect with the detection of submarine at malta a experimental station with a hydrophone training school be start in the autumn of 1917 and good work be do both there and at a hydrophone station establish to the southward of otranto at about the same time as well as at a hydrophone training school start at gallipolus at the end of the year otter and paravane _ the otter system _ of defense of merchant ship against mine be devise by lieutenant denni burney dso rn -lrb- a son of admiral sir cecil burney -rrb- and be on similar line to he valuable invention for the protection of warship the latter system have be introduce into the grand fleet in 1916 although for a long period considerable opposition exist against its general adoption partly on account of the difficulty experience in its early day of development and partly owe to the extensive outlay involve in fitting all ship however this opposition be eventually overcome and before the end of the war the system have very amply justified itself by save a large number of warship from destruction by mine it be compute that there be at least fifty case during the war in which paravane fit to warship have cut the mooring of mine thus possibly save the ship it must also be bear in mind that the cutting of the mooring of a mine and the bringing of it to the surface may disclose the presence of a hitherto unknown minefield and thus save other ship similarly the otter defense in its early stage be not introduce without opposition but again all difficulty be overcome and the rate of progress in its use be show in the follow statement give the number of british merchant ship fit with it at different period of 1917 : by July 1 95 ship have be fit by September 1 294 ship have be fit by December 1 900 ship have be fit the system be also extend to foreign merchant ship and supplies of otter be send abroad for this purpose a considerable number of merchant ship be know to have be save from destruction by mine by the use of this system defensive arming of merchant ship the _ defensive arm _ of merchant ship be a matter which be press forward with great energy and rapidity during the year 1917 the matter be take up with the cabinet immediately on the formation of the board of admiralty preside over by sir edward carson and arrangement make for obtain a considerable number of gun from the war office from japan and from france besides surrender some gun from the secondary and anti-torpedo boat armament of we own men-of-war principally those of the older type pend the manufacture of large number of gun for the purpose order for some 4200 gun be place by captain dreyer the director of naval ordnance with we own gun maker in march April and may 1917 in addition to nearly 3000 gun already on order for this purpose 400 90-mm gun be obtain from france the mounting be make in england special arrangement be also make by captain dreyer for the rapid manufacture of all gun include the provision of the material and of extra manufacturing plant these order for 4200 gun and the order for 2026 howitzer place at the same time bring the total number of gun and howitzer under manufacture in england for naval and merchant service purpose in may 1917 up to the high figure of 10761 at the end of the year 1916 the total number of merchant ship that have be arm since the commencement of the war -lrb- exclude those which be work under the white ensign and which have receive _ offensive _ armament -rrb- be 1420 of this number 83 have be lose during the first six month of 1917 armament be provide for a additional 1581 ship and during the last six month of that year a further total of 1406 ship be provide with gun a aggregate number of 2987 ship be thus furnish with armament during the year this total be exclusive of howitzer the progress of the work be show by the follow figure : number or gun that have be date provide for british merchant ship exclude howitzer January 1 1917 1420 April 1 1917 2181 July 1 1917 3001 October 1 1917 3763 January 1 1918 4407 the figure give include the gun mount in ship that be lose through enemy action or from marine risk it should be state that the large majority of the gun manufacture during 1917 be 12-pounder or larger gun as experience have show that smaller weapon be usually outrange by those carry in submarine and the projectile of even the 12-pounder be smaller than be desirable of the 2987 new gun mount in merchant ship during the year 1917 only 190 be smaller than 12-pounder aircraft for anti-submarine work _ anti-submarine work by aircraft _ be already in operation round we coast by the beginning of 1917 and during the year the increase in number and improvement in type of machine render possible considerable expansion of the work closer co-operation between surface vessel and aircraft be also secure and as the convoy system be extend aircraft be use both for escort and observation work as well as for attack on submarine for actual escort work airship be superior to heavier-than-air machine owe to they greater radius of action whilst for offensive work against a submarine that have be sight the high speed of the seaplane or aeroplane be of great value in 1916 and the early part of 1917 we be but ill provide with aircraft suitable for anti-submarine operation at any considerable distance from the coast and such aircraft as we possess do not carry sufficiently powerful bomb to be very effective in attack submarine although they be of use in force these vessel to submerge and occasionally in bring we surface craft to the spot to press home the attack the royal naval air service under commodore godfrey paine devoted much energy to the provision of suitable aircraft and the anti-submarine side of the naval staff co-operate in the matter of they organization with the advent of the large america type of seaplane and the handley-page type of aeroplane both of which carry heavy bomb successful attack on enemy submarine become more frequent they be assist by the airship particularly those of the larger type improvement which be effect in signalling arrangement between ship and aircraft be instrumental in add greatly to they efficiency and by the early summer of 1917 aircraft have commence to play a important part in the war against submarine and in the protection of trade thereafter progress become rapid as the follow figure show : in June 1917 aeroplane and seaplane patrolling for anti-submarine operation cover 75000 mile sight 17 submarine and be able to attack 7 of they in September 1917 the distance cover by anti-submarine patrol of aeroplane and seaplane be 91000 mile 25 submarine be sight of which 18 be attack in the four week end December 8 1917 in spite of the much shorter day and the far less favourable fly weather experience the mileage cover be again 91000 mile 17 submarine be sight of which 11 be attack during this period as regard airship the figure again show the increase anti-submarine work carry out : in June 1917 airship engage in anti-submarine patrol cover 53000 mile sight and attack 1 submarine in September 1917 they cover 83000 mile and sight 8 submarine of which 5 be attack in the four week end December 8 1917 they cover 50000 mile sight 6 submarine and attack 5 of they the airship be more affect by short day and particularly by bad weather than the heavier than air craft and the fact that they cover practically the same mileage in the winter day of December as in the summer day of June show clearly the development that take place in the interval during the whole of 1917 it be estimate that we heavier than air craft sight 135 submarine and attack 85 of they and we lighter than air craft sight 26 and attack 15 the figure give in chapter ix of the number of submarine sink during the war by aircraft -lrb- viz 7 as a minimum -rrb- when compare with the number of attack during 1917 alone suggest the difficulty of successful attack in September 1917 as extensive a program as be consistent with manufacture capability in view of the enormous demand of the army be draw up by the naval staff for the development of aircraft for anti-submarine operation during 1918 the main development be in machine of the large america type and heavy bombing machine for attack enemy basis as well as other anti-submarine machine and aircraft for use with the grand fleet include in the anti-submarine operation of aircraft during 1917 be the bombing attack on bruge since the german submarine and the shelter in which they take refuge be part of the objective these attack be carry out from the aerodrome establish by the royal naval air service at dunkirk during 1917 the naval air force of the dover command which include the squadron at dunkirk be under the command of captain cl lambe rn and the operation of this force be of a very strenuous character and of the utmost value bombing operation prior to the year of 1917 have be carry out by various type of machine but the introduction of the handley-page aeroplane in the spring of 1917 enable a much greater weight of bomb -- viz some 1500 lb -- to be carry than have hitherto be possible these machine be generally use for night bombing and the weight of bomb drop on the enemy basis in belgium rise with great rapidity as machine of the handley-page type be deliver as do the number of night on which attack be make it be no uncommon occurrence during the autumn of 1917 for six to eight ton of bomb to be drop in one night i have not the figure for 1918 but feel no doubt that with the great increase in aircraft that become possible during that year this performance be constantly exceed special service or decoy ship the story of the work of these vessel constitute a record of gallantry endurance and discipline which have never be surpass afloat or ashore the earliest vessel be fit out during the year 1915 at scapa rosyth queenstown and other port and from the very first it be apparent that they would win for themselves a place in history the earliest success against a enemy submarine by one of these vessel be achieve by the _ prince charle _ fit out at scapa and command by lieutenant mark-wardlaw a officer on the staff of admiral sir stanley colville then admiral command the orkney and shetland in the early month of 1917 it be decide to augment greatly the force of these special service vessel and step be take to organize a separate admiralty department for the work special experience be need both for the selection of suitable ship and for fitting they out and care be take to select officer who have be personally connect with the work during the war the advice of successful commander of decoy ship be also utilize at the head be captain alexander farrington under whose direction several ship have be fit out at scapa with great ingenuity and success every class of ship be bring into the service : steam cargo vessel trawler drifter sail ship ketch and sloop specially design to have the appearance of cargo ship these latter vessel be know as convoy sloop to distinguish they from the ordinary sloop they design which be very clever have be prepare in 1916 by sir eustace t d'eyncourt the director of naval construction the enemy submarine commander however become so wary owe to the success of decoy ship that they would not come to the surface until they have inspect ship very closely in the submerged condition and the fine line of the convoy sloop give they away under close inspection in the early spring of 1917 the director of naval construction be ask whether the p class of patrol boat then under construction could be alter to work as decoy vessel as owe to they light draught they would be almost immune from torpedo attack a very good design be produce and some of the later patrol boat be convert and call p q 's these vessel have the appearance of small merchant ship at a cursory glance they would not however stand close examination owe again to they fine line but be better sea boat than the p 's by reason of they greater freeboard the design be continue and they meet with considerable success against submarine -lrb- especially in the irish sea -rrb- by ram and depth charge tactic the submarine when submerge probably not realize when observe the p q 's through a periscope the speed of which they be capable during 1917 when the unrestricted submarine warfare be in progress many of the decoy vessel be fit with torpedo tube either above water or submerge since as the submarine commander become more wary they show great dislike to come to the surface sufficiently close to merchant ship to admit of the gun armament be use with certainty of success a torpedo on the other hand could of course be use effectively against a submarine whilst still submerge the use also become general of cask or cargo of wood to give additional flotation to decoy ship after be torpedo so as to prolong they life in case the submarine should close near enough to allow of effective gunfire another ruse adopt be that of change the disguise of a decoy ship during the night so that she could not be identify by a submarine which have previously make a attack upon she in all case of disguise or of change disguise it be essential that the decoy ship should assume the identity of some class of vessel likely to be meet with in the particular area in which she be work and obviously the course steer be choose with that object in view again since for success it be essential to induce the submarine to come within close range so that the decoy ship 's gunfire should be immediately effective it be necessary that she disguise should stand the closest possible examination through the periscope of a submarine german submarine commander after a short experience of decoy ship be most careful not to bring they vessel to the surface in proximity to craft that be apparently merchant ship until they have subject they to the sharpest scrutiny at short range through the periscope and the usual practice of a experienced submarine commander be to steer round the ship keep submerge all the time not only be it essential that there should be no sign of a armament in the decoy ship or a man-of-war-like appearance in any respect but when the panic signal be make to lead the submarine commander to think that he attack have succeed precaution have to be take against the presence of more than the ordinary number of man in the boat lower and send away with the suppose whole ship 's company also the sight of any man leave on board would at once betray the real character of the decoy ship and result in the disappearance of the submarine and the probable sinking of the disguise craft by torpedo fire during the late summer of 1917 it become evident that the submarine commander have become so suspicious of decoy craft that the chance of success by the larger cargo vessel be not sufficient to justify any further addition to exist number in view of the increase shortage of ship a considerable fleet of steamer build for this purpose be therefore divert to trade purpose the number of smaller vessel particularly sail craft be however increase especially in mediterranean water where they have not be previously operate on a extensive scale it be impossible to close these remark on this class of vessel without testify once more to the splendid gallantry self-sacrifice skilful resource and magnificent discipline show by those on board this be illustrate by description of a few typical action fight during 1917 the first which i relate take place on February 17 1917 when a decoy vessel a steamship arm with five 12-pounder gun command by that most gallant officer captain gordon campbell rn be torpedo by a submarine in a position lat 5134 n long 1123 w captain campbell see the torpedo come and manoeuvre to try and avoid be hit in the engine-room but as he purposely always select a very slow ship for decoy work he attempt be only partially successful and the engine-room begin to fill no signal for assistance be make however as captain campbell fear that such a signal might bring another vessel on the scene and this would naturally scare the submarine away the usual procedure of abandon the ship in the boat with every appearance of haste be carry out only sufficient hand remain hide on board to work the gun the periscope of the submarine be next sight on the quarter within 200 or 300 yard and she come slowly past the ship still submerge and evidently examine the vessel closely through the periscope she pass within a few yard of the ship then cross the bow and come to the surface about 200 yard off and pass down the port side again close to captain campbell wait until every gun would bear before give the signal for action the decoy ship 's true character be then reveal conceal gunport be throw open color be hoist and a hot fire open from all gun the submarine be hit at once and continue to be hit so rapidly that it be evidently impossible for she to submerge she sink in a very short time one officer and one man be pick up a signal be then make for assistance and help arrive within a couple of hour the decoy ship be rapidly fill but effort be make to tow she into port and with the greatest difficulty and entirely owe to the splendid manner in which all hand stick to the work she be bring into berehaven with she stern under water thirty-six hour later and beach the great restraint show by captain campbell in withholding fire as the submarine pass she in a submerged condition and the truly wonderful discipline and steadiness and ingenuity which baffle so close a examination of the ship be the outstanding feature of this great exploit on April 22 1917 a decoy ship know as q22 a small sailing vessel with auxiliary power arm with two 12-pounder gun and command by lieutenant irvine rnr while in a position about fifty mile south of kinsale head sight a submarine on the surface which open fire immediately at a range of about 4000 yard the fire be accurate and the decoy ship be hit frequently two man be kill and four wound in a few minute and the vessel considerably damage as further concealment appear useless the gun be then unmask and the fire return with apparently good result several hit be claim the enemy 's fire then fall off in accuracy and she increase the range and after about one and a half hour ' fight the light become too bad to continue the action it be think that the submarine be sink but there be no positive evidence of sink on April 30 1917 a decoy ship -- hm _ prize _ -- a small schooner with auxiliary power arm with two 12-pounder gun and command by lieutenant we sander rnr a new zealand officer sight when in position lat 4944 n long 1142 w a submarine about two mile away on the port beam at 830 pm at 845 pm the submarine open fire on the _ prize _ and the abandon ship party leave in a small boat the submarine gradually approach continue to pour in a heavy fire and make two hit on the _ prize _ which put the motor out of action wreck the wireless office and cause much internal damage besides let a great deal of water into the ship the crew of the _ prize _ remain quietly hide at they conceal gun throughout this punishment which continue for forty minute as the submarine close come up from right astern a position no doubt which she consider one of safety when close to she sheer off and pass to the port beam at a distance of about one hundred yard at this moment lieutenant sander give the order for action the gun be expose and a devastating fire open at point blank range but not before the submarine have fire both she gun obtain two more hit and wound several of the crew of the _ prize _ the first shell fire from the _ prize _ hit the foremost gun of the submarine and blow it overboard and a later shot knock away the con tower the submarine go ahead and the _ prize _ try to follow but the damage to she motor prevent much movement the firing continue as the submarine move away and after a interval she appear to be on fire and to sink this occur shortly after 90 pm when it be nearly dark the _ prize _ send she boat to pick up survivor three be take out of the water include the commander and one other officer the prisoner on come on board express they willingness to assist in take the _ prize _ into port it do not at this time seem likely that she would long remain afloat but by great exertion and good seamanship the leak be get under to a sufficient extent to allow of the ship be keep afloat by pump the prisoner give considerable help especially when the ship catch fire whilst start the motor again on may 2 she meet a motor launch off the coast of ireland and be tow into port in spite of the undoubted great damage to the submarine damage confirm by the survivor who be apparently blow overboard with the con tower and who have no thought other than that she have be sink later intelligence show that she succeed in reach germany in a very disabled condition this incident accentuate still further the recurrent difficulty of make definite statement as to the fate of enemy submarine for the evidence in this case seem absolutely conclusive the commander of the submarine be so impressed with the conduct of the crew of the _ prize _ that when examine subsequently in london he state that he do not consider it any disgrace to have be beat by she as he could not have believe it possible for any ship 's company belong to any nation in the world to have be imbue with such discipline as to stand the shell to which he subject the _ prize _ without any sign be make which would give away she true character lieut-commander sander be award the victorium cross for he action and many decoration be give to the officer and ship 's company for they conduct in the action it be sad that so fine a commander and so splendid a ship 's company should have be lose a little later in action with another submarine which she engage unsuccessfully during daylight and which follow she in a submerged condition until nightfall and then torpedo she all hand be lose it be my privilege during my visit to new zealand in 1919 to unveil a memorial to the gallant sander which be place in he old school at takapuna near auckland on June 7 1917 a decoy ship the ss _ pargust _ arm with one 4-inch gun four 12-pounder gun and two torpedo tube command by captain gordon campbell rn who have meanwhile be award the victorium cross be in a position lat 5150 n long 1150 w when a torpedo hit the ship abreast the engine-room and in detonate make a hole through which water pour fill both engine-room and boiler-room the explosion of the torpedo also blow one of the boat to piece the usual procedure of abandon ship be carry out and shortly after the boat have leave the periscope of a submarine be sight steer for the port side the submarine pass close under the stern steer to the starboard side then recross the stern to the port side and when she be some fifty yard off on the port beam she conning tower appear on the surface and she steer to pass round the stern again and towards one of the ship 's boat on the starboard beam she then come completely to the surface within one hundred yard and captain campbell disclose he true character open fire with all gun hit the submarine at once and continue to hit she until she sink one officer and one man be save the decoy ship lose one man kill and one officer be wound by the explosion of the torpedo as in the case of the action on February 17 the distinguish feature of this exploit be the great restraint show by captain campbell in withhold he fire although he ship be so seriously damage the gallantry and fine discipline of the ship 's company they good shooting and splendid drill contribute largely to the success the decoy ship although seriously damaged reach harbor on July 10 1917 a decoy ship hm _ glen _ a small schooner with auxiliary power and arm with one 12-pounder and one 6-pounder gun command by sub-lieutenant k morri rnr be in a position about forty mile south-west of weymouth when a submarine be sight on the surface some three mile away she close to within two mile and open fire on the _ glen _ the usual practice of abandon ship be follow the submarine closing during this operation to within half a mile and remain at that distance examine the _ glen _ for some time after about half a hour she go ahead and submerge and then pass round the ship at about 200 yard distance examine she through the periscope finally come to the surface about 50 yard off on the port quarter almost immediately she again start to submerge and fire be at once open the submarine be hit three or four time before she turn over on she side and disappear there be every reason to believe that she have sink although no one be on deck when she disappear no survivor be rescue the feature of this action be again the restraint show by the commanding officer of the _ glen _ and the excellent discipline of the crew on August 8 1917 the decoy ship hm _ dunraven _ in lat 480 n long 737 w arm with one 4-inch and four 12-pounder gun and two torpedo tube command by captain gordon campbell vc rn sight a submarine on the surface some distance off the submarine steer towards the ship and submerge and soon afterwards come to the surface some two mile off and open fire the _ dunraven _ in she character of a merchant ship reply with a after gun firing intentionally short make a smoke screen and reduce speed slightly to allow the submarine to close when the shell from the submarine begin to fall close to the ship the order to abandon she be give and as usual with the splendidly train ship 's company work under captain campbell the operation be carry out with every appearance of disorder one of the boat be purposely leave hang vertical with only one end lower meanwhile the submarine close several shell from she gun hit the after part of the _ dunraven _ cause a depth charge to explode and set she on fire aft blow the officer in charge of the after gun out of he control station and wound severely the seaman station at the depth charge the situation now be that the submarine be pass from the port to the starboard quarter and at any moment the 4-inch magazine and the remain depth charge in the after part of the _ dunraven _ might be expect to explode the 4-inch gun 's crew aft know the imminence of this danger but not a man move although the deck beneath they be rapidly become red hot and captain campbell be so certain of the magnificent discipline and gallantry of he crew that he still hold on so that the submarine might come clearly into view on the starboard side clear of the smoke of the fire aft in a few minute the anticipated explosion occur the 4-inch gun and gun 's crew be blow into the air just too soon for the submarine to be in the best position for be engage the explosion itself cause the electrical apparatus to make the open fire signal whereupon the white ensign be hoist and the only gun bearing commence firing but the submarine submerge at once fifteen minute later a torpedo hit the ship and captain campbell again order abandon ship and send away a second party of man to give the impression that the ship have now be finally abandon although she true character have be reveal meanwhile he have make a wireless signal to other ship to keep away as he still hope to get the submarine which now keep submerged move round the ship for three quarter of a hour during which period the fire gain on the _ dunraven _ and frequent explosion of ammunition take place the submarine then come to the surface right astern where no gun could bear on she and recommence she shellfire on the ship hit she frequently during this period the officer and man still remain on board give no sign of they presence captain campbell by he example imbue this remnant of he splendid ship 's company with he own indomitable spirit of endurance the submarine submerge again soon afterwards and as she pass the ship captain campbell from he submerged tube fire a torpedo at she which just miss probably the range be too short to allow the torpedo to gain its correct depth she go right round the ship and a second torpedo be fire from the other tube which again miss this torpedo be evidently see from the submarine as she submerge at once the ship be sink and it be obviously of no use to continue the deception which could only lead to a useless sacrifice of life wireless signal for assistance be therefore make and the arrival of some destroyer bring the action to a conclusion the wound be transfer to the destroyer and the ship take in tow but she sink whilst in tow forty-eight hour later this action be perhaps the finest feat amongst the very many gallant deed perform by decoy ship during the war it display to the full the quality of grim determination gallantry patience and resource the splendid training and high standard of discipline which be necessary to success in this form of warfare lieutenant charle g bonner rnr and petty-officer ernest pitcher rn be award the vc for they service in this action and many medal for conspicuous gallantry be also give to the splendid ship 's company captain campbell as will be readily realize meet with great success in he work and he be the first to acknowledge how this success be due to those who work so magnificently under he command and he also realize the magnitude of the work perform by other decoy ship in all area since he know better than most people the difficulty of entice a submarine to she doom on September 17 1917 in position lat 4942 n long 1318 w the decoy ship _ stonecrop _ a small steamer command by commander m blackwood rn arm with one 4-inch one 6-pounder gun and some stick-bomb thrower and carry four torpedo tube sight a submarine which open fire on she at long range the fire be return by the 6-pounder mount aft after the shell have continue for some time the usual order be give to abandon ship and a little later the periscope of the submarine be sight some distance away the submarine gradually close keep submerge until within about a quarter of a mile when she pass slowly round the ship and finally come to the surface at a distance of about 500 yard on the starboard quarter she do not close nearer so the order be give to open fire and hit start after the third round have be fire and continue until the submarine sink stern first no survivor be pick up but all the indication point to the certainty of the destruction of the submarine patrol gunboat mention may here be make of another vessel of a special class design in 1917 in the early summer in consequence of the shortage of destroyer of the delay in the production of new one and the great need for more small craft suitable for escort merchant ship through the submarine zone arrangement be make to build a larger and faster class of trawler which would be suitable for convoy work under favourable condition and which to a certain extent would take the place of destroyer trawler could be build with much greater rapidity than destroyer and trawler builder who could not build destroyer could be employ for the work thus supplement the activity of the yard which could turn out the bigger craft accordingly a 13-knot trawler be design and a large number order great delay occur however in they construction as in that of all other class of vessel owe to the pressure of various kind of war work and other cause and only one be deliver during 1917 instead of the twenty or so which have be promise whilst i believe that by July 1918 not more than fourteen have be complete instead of the anticipated number of forty i be inform that they prove to be a most useful type of vessel for the slower convoy be excellent sea boat with a large radius of action be a great relief to the destroyer and even to light cruiser for convoy work it be understand that some fifty be complete by the end of the war net protection for merchant ship this idea originate in 1915 or 1916 with captain edward c villier of the _ actaeon _ torpedo school ship experiment be carry out by a battleship at rosyth in the first instance and later at scapa they be at that time unsuccessful at the end of 1916 i give direction for a reconsideration of the matter and fresh trial be make but early in 1917 there seem to be no prospect of success and the trial be again abandon however captain villier display great confidence in the idea and he introduce modification with the result that later in the year 1917 direction be give for fresh trial to be undertake at the end of the year success be first obtain and this be confirm early in 1918 and the device finally adopt a curious experience during the trial be that the vessel carry they out be actually fire at by a german submarine with the result that the net protection save the ship from be torpedo it be not often that a inventor receive such a good advertisement depth charge thrower the first proposal for this device come from portsmouth where the commander-in-chief admiral the hon sir stanley colville be indefatigable in he effort to combat the submarine thrower manufacture by messr thornycroft of southampton be try and give good result the arrangement be one by which depth charge could be project to a distance of 40 yard from a vessel and the thrower be usually fit one on each quarter so that the charge could be throw out on the quarter whilst other be be drop over the stern and the chance of damaging or sink the submarine attack be thus greatly increase as soon as the earliest machine have be try order be place for large number and the supplies obtain be as follow : delivery commence in July 1917 by September 1 30 have be deliver by October 1 97 have be deliver by December 1 238 have be deliver coastal motor boat at the end of 1916 we possess 13 fast coastal motor boat carry torpedo and have a speed of some 36 knot they have be build to carry out certain operation in the heligoland bight work from harwich but the preliminary air reconnaissance which it have be decide be necessary have not be effect by the end of 1916 owe to bad weather and the lack of suitable machine when winter set in it become impossible with the type of aircraft then exist to carry out the intended reconnaissance and early in 1917 i abandon the idea of the operation for the winter and send the boat to the dover command for sir r bacon to use from dunkirk in operation against enemy vessel operate from ostend and zeebrugge they quickly prove they value and it become evident that they would also be useful for anti-submarine work a large number be order some for anti-submarine work and some for certain contemplated operation in enemy water include a night attack on the enemy 's light cruiser know to lie occasionally in the em river a operation that it be intend to carry out in the spring of 1918 a daylight operation in this neighborhood which be carry out during 1918 do not from the publish report meet with success the coastal motor boat be attack by aircraft vessel against which they be defenceless the new boat be of a improve and larger type than the original 40-feet boat delay occur in construction owe principally to the difficulty in obtain engine by reason of the great demand for engine for aircraft and but few of the new boat be deliver during the year 1917 mining operation the policy which be carry out during 1917 in this respect so far as the supply of mine admit aim at prevent the exit of submarine from enemy port incidentally the fact that we lay large number of mine in the heligoland bight render necessary such extensive sweeping operation before any portion of the high sea fleet could put to sea as to be very useful in give we some indication of any movement that might be intend in view of the distance of the grand fleet from german basis and the short time available in which to intercept the high sea fleet if it come out for such a purpose as a raid on we coast or on convoy the information thus gather would have prove of great value in plan mining operation in the heligoland bight it be necessary to take into consideration certain fact the _ first _ be the knowledge that the german themselves have lay minefield in some portion of the bight and it be necessary for we minelayer to give such suspect area a wide berth _ secondly _ it be obvious that we could not lay minefield in area very near those which we ourselves have already mine since we should run the risk of blow up we own ship with we own mine mine operation have necessarily to be carry out at night and as there be no navigational aid in the way of light etc in the heligoland bight the position in which we mine be lay be never know with _ absolute _ accuracy consequently a area in which we have direct mine to be lay and to which a minelayer have be send could not safely be approach within a distance of some five mile on a subsequent occasion the use in mining operation of the device know as taut wire gear introduce by vice-admiral sir henry oliver be of great help in ensure accuracy in lay minefield and consequently in reduce the danger distance surround we own minefield as we mining operation increase in number we be drive farther and farther out from the german port for subsequent operation this naturally increase the area to be mine as the heligoland bight be bell-mouthed in shape but it have the advantage of make the operation of german minesweeper and mine-bumper more difficult and hazardous as they have to work farther out thus give we light force better chance of catch they at work and engage they such action as that on November 17 1917 between we light force and the german light cruiser and minesweeper be the result we do not of course lay mine in either the danish or dutch territorial water and these water consequently afford a exit for german vessel as we minefield become most distant from german basis broadly speak the policy be to lay mine so thoroughly in the heligoland bight as to force enemy submarine and other vessel to make they exit along the danish or dutch coast in territorial water at the end of the exit we station submarine to signal enemy movement and to attack enemy vessel we know of course that the enemy would sweep other channel for he ship but as soon as we discover the position of these channel which be not a very difficult matter more mine be lay at the end in order to give neutral fair warn certain area which include the heligoland bight be proclaimed dangerous in this respect german and british method may be contrast : we never lay a minefield which could possibly have be dangerous to neutral without issue a warning state that a certain area -lrb- which include the minefield -rrb- be dangerous the german never issue such a warning unless the proclamation state that half the atlantic ocean most of the north sea and nine-tenth of the mediterranean be dangerous could be consider as such it be also intend as mine become available to lay more deep minefield in position near we own coast in which enemy submarine be know to work these minefield would be safe for the passage of surface vessel but we patrol craft would force the submarine to dive into they this system to a certain extent have already be in use during 1915 and 1916 scheme be also be devise by admiral of the fleet sir arthur wilson who devote much of he time to mining device by which mine some distance below the surface would be explode by a enemy submarine even if navigate on the surface such be the policy its execution be difficult the first difficulty lay in the fact that we do not possess a thoroughly satisfactory mine a percentage only of we mine explode when hit by a submarine and they fail sometimes to take up they intended depth when lay betray they presence by appear on the surface energetic measure be adopt to overcome this latter defect but it take time and but few mine be available for lay in the early month of 1917 the result of we minelay effort be show in the follow table : mine lay deep mine lay year in the heligoland off we own coast bight to catch submarine 1915 4498 983 1916 1679 2573 first quarter of 1917 4865 -rrb- second quarter of 1917 6386 -rrb- 3843 third quarter of 1917 3510 -rrb- in the strait of dover thame estuary and off the belgian coast we lay 2664 mine in 1914 6337 in 1915 9685 in 1916 and 4669 in the first three quarter of 1917 these last mine be lay as fast as the alteration make with a view to increase they efficiency could be carry out during the early part of the year 1917 the new pattern of mine know as the h type evolve in 1916 have be try and although not perfectly satisfactory at the first trial the success be sufficient to warrant the placing of order for 100000 mine and in make arrangement for the quickest possible manufacture this be do by the director of torpedo and mine rear-admiral the hon edward fitzherbert under the direction of the then fourth sea lord rear-admiral lionel halsey delivery commence in the summer of 1917 but by the end of September only a little over 1500 be ready for lay some 500 of these be lay in September in the heligoland bight and be immediately successful against enemy submarine more be lay in the bight during October November and December and the remainder as they be produce be prepare for lay in the new minefield in the strait of dover _ in the fourth quarter of the year a total of 10389 mine be lay in the heligoland bight and in the strait of dover _ during this last quarter delivery of h pattern mine be as follow : in October 2350 November 5300 December 4800 total 12450 so that it will be see that the mine be lay as fast as delivery be make the great increase in project minelaying operation during the year 1917 make it necessary also to add considerably to the number of minelay vessel in January 1917 the only vessel equip for this service be four merchant ship and the flotilla leader _ abdiel _ with a total minelaying capacity of some 1200 mine per trip it be not advisable to carry out minelaying operation in enemy water during the period near full moon owe to the liability of the minelayer be see by patrol craft under such condition the position of the minefield would be know to the enemy as the operation of place the mine on board occupy several day it be not passible to depend on a average of more than three operation per ship per month from the larger minelayer consequently with the intended policy in view it be obvious that more minelayer must be provide it be inadvisable to use merchant ship since every vessel be urgently require for trade or transport purpose and the alternative be to fit men-of-war for minelay the only old vessel of this type suitable for mining in enemy water be ship of the ariadne class and although they machinery be not too reliable two of these vessel that be seaworthy be convert to minelayer in addition a number of the older light cruiser be fit with portable rail on which mine could be carry when minelay operation be contemplate in place of a portion of the armament which could be remove a flotilla of destroyer with some further flotilla leader be also fit out as minelayer and several additional submarine be fit for this purpose for a project special scheme of minelay in enemy water a number of lighter be order and some of the motor launch and coastal motor boat be fit out and utilize for mining operation on the belgian coast towards the end of 1917 by the end of that year 12 light cruiser 12 destroyer and flotilla leader and 5 submarine have be fit for minelay two old cruiser have be add to the minelay fleet and several other vessel be in hand for the same purpose the detailed plan of the arrangement be prepare and the work of fitting out minelayer carry out under the supervision of admiral rn ommanney cb whose service in this matter be of great value the rapidity with which ship be add to the minelay fleet be largely due to he effort on the entry of the united state of america into the war a further development of mining policy become feasible the immense manufacturing resource of the united state render a large production of mine a easy matter with the result that as soon as the united state navy produce a reliable type of mine the idea of place a mine barrage across the northern part of the north sea which have be previously discuss become a matter of practical politics with this end in view a still further addition to the minelay fleet become necessary and since the mining would be carry out at leisure in this case and speed be no great necessity for the minelayer owe to the distance of the minefield from enemy water a old battleship be put in hand for conversion with the enormous increase in the number of mine on order the problem of storage become of importance include as it do the storage of the very large number some 120000 require for the northern barrage the third sea lord admiral lionel halsey take this matter in hand with characteristic energy and in conjunction with united state naval officer make all the necessary arrangement the united state mine be store in the vicinity of invergordon and the british mine intend for use in the northern barrage be located at grangemouth near leith where rear-admiral clinton baker be in charge as well as in other place whilst those for use in the heligoland bight and channel water be store at immingham and other southern depot the lay of the north sea mine barrage be not accomplish without very considerable delay and many difficulty be encounter it be originally anticipate that the barrage would be complete in the spring of 1918 but owe to various defect in both british and united state mine which make themselves apparent when the operation commence due partly to the great depth of water as well as to other cause a delay of several month take place and even when near completion the barrage be not so effective as many have hope in spite of the great expenditure of labor and material involve i have not the figure of the number of submarine that the barrage be think to have account for but it be know to be disappointing flare in the late summer of 1917 _ flare _ be experiment with they be intend to be use from kite balloon with the object of sighting submarine when on the surface at night previously searchlight in destroyer have be use for this purpose the flare be not much use however from kite balloon owe to lack of opportunity but trial which be carry out with flare from patrol craft such as trawler and drifter demonstrate that they would be of value from these vessel and when the folkestone-grisnez minefield be lay in November and December 1917 it be apparent that the flare would be of use in force submarine to dive at night into the minefield to escape detection on the surface and attack by gunfire manufacture on a large scale be therefore commence and during 1918 the flare be in constant use across the strait of dover electrical submarine detector the existence of this very valuable device be due to the work of certain distinguished scientist and experiment be carry out during 1917 it be bring to perfection in the late autumn and order be give to fit it in certain locality some difficulty be experience in obtain the necessary material but the work be well in hand by the end of the year and quickly prove its value submarine against submarine prior to the year 1917 the only area in which we own submarine operate against enemy vessel of the same type be in the north sea or occasionally in the vicinity of the hebride grand fleet submarine be use in the northern area during 1916 and harwich submarine operate farther south but the number of underwater craft available be insufficient for any extended method of attack early in 1917 when we mercantile loss be very heavy some submarine be withdraw from the harwich and humber district and form into a flotilla off the coast of ireland for this form of operation some risk have to be accept in thus reduce we submarine strength in southern water at the same time some grand fleet submarine be organize into a watch patrol in the area off the shetland island through which enemy submarine be expect to pass the watch off the horn reef and in the heligoland bight which have previously be in force be also maintain a little later the submarine flotilla off the irish coast be strengthen and a regular patrol institute near the north channel between ireland and scotland the next step be the withdrawal of some c class submarine from coastal work on we east coast to work in the area between england and holland near the north hinder lightship a locality much frequent by enemy submarine on passage still later some submarine be attach to the portsmouth command where work under sir stanley colville they have some striking success other go to the dover command the latter be fit with occult light on top of the conning-tower and be moor at night to buoy in the dover net barrage in place where enemy submarine be likely to pass in order that they might have a chance of torpedo they a division of submarine be also send to gibraltar to operate against enemy cruiser submarine work in that vicinity or near the canary success against enemy submarine be also obtain in the latter locality finally the arrival of some united state submarine enable the area in which this form of attack be in force to be still further extend after the american personnel have be train to this form of warfare there be a great increase in the number of enemy submarine sink by this method of attack during 1917 as compare with previous year the number of vessel sink do not however convey a complete appreciation of the effect of this form of anti-submarine warfare the great value of it lay in the feeling of insecurity that it breed in the mind of the enemy submarine commander the moral effect of the constant apprehension that one be be stalk be considerable indeed the combination of we aircraft and we submarine patrol lead to we vessel report regretfully that it be very seldom that german submarine be find on the surface in daylight and towards the end of 1917 quite a large proportion of the attack on merchant ship take place at night the work for we own vessel be very arduous indeed it be only on rare occasion that it be possible to bring off a successful attack on a submarine that have be sight the low underwater speed of submarine make it difficult to get into position when the enemy be only sight at short range which be naturally usually the case in order to obviate this difficulty direction be give in 1917 to design a special type of submarine for this form of warfare and i believe that the first vessel be complete by the autumn of 1918 this account of the development of anti-submarine measure during 1917 would not be complete without mention of the work of the trade division of the staff of which captain richard webb cb be the director until September this division be either partly or wholly responsible for : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the great increase in the rapidity of place the armament on board merchant ship -lrb- 2 -rrb- the establishment of school of instruction for captain and officer of the mercantile marine this training scheme be begin at chatham barracks in February 1917 by commander elb lockyer act under captain webb and later be extend to portsmouth cardiff and greenock its success be so marked and its benefit in assist officer to handle they ship in the manner best calculate to save they from submarine attack so great that the admiralty be continually be press by shipowner and by the officer of the mercantile marine to extend the instruction to more and more port this be do so far as possible we principal difficulty be to provide officer capable of give the instruction require -lrb- 3 -rrb- the provision of wireless plant and operator to the mercantile marine this be another matter take up with energy during 1917 and with excellent result -lrb- 4 -rrb- the drilling of gun crew for the merchant ship man be invite to go through a course of drill and large number respond and be instruct at the royal naval depot at the crystal palace all these matter be additional to the important work upon which the trade division be constantly employ which include all blockade question the routeing of merchant ship examination of ship etc in addition to the instructional anti-submarine course for master and officer gunnery course for cadet and apprentice be start at portsmouth chatham and devonport a system of visit to ship by officer instructor for the purpose of afford instruction and for inspection as well as for the purpose of lecture be institute and arrangement be make for give instruction in signalling some idea of the work carry out will be gather from the follow figure show the instructional work carry out during the year 1917 : master 1929 officer 2149 number of cadet and apprentice pass through the gunnery course 543 number of merchant seaman train in gunnery at the crystal palace 3964 number of ship visit by officer instructor 6927 number attend these lecture : master 1361 officer 5921 number of officer and man instruct in signalling 10487 the keenness show by officer and man of the merchant service contribute in a marked degree to the success of the course institute just one example may be give i visit the royal naval depot at the crystal palace early in 1918 and amongst other most interesting scene witness a large number of man of the merchant service at gun drill i question several of they as to they experience and many of the man have have they ship torpedo under they three four or five time amongst the gun crew be a steward who have be through this experience four time on my ask why he as a steward should be go through the gunnery course he reply that he hope that by so do he might stand a chance of get he own back by assist to sink a submarine the knowledge which i possess of the measure introduce during the year 1917 to combat the german submarine warfare and the continual increase in the efficiency of the anti-submarine work which i know would result from increase production of anti-submarine vessel and weapon lead I in February 1918 to state that in my opinion the submarine menace would be hold by the autumn of the year 1918 the remark which be make at what i understand to be a private gathering be give very wide publicity and be criticize at the time but it be fulfil as the figure will indicate chapter iv the introduction of the convoy system the question of the introduction of convoy for the protection of merchant ship be under consideration at various time during the war the system have be employ during the old war and have prove its value in the case of attack by vessel on the surface and it be natural that thought should be direct towards its reintroduction when the submarine campaign develop there be one inherent disadvantage in this system which can not be overcome although it can be mitigate by careful organization viz the delay involve delay means of course a loss of carrying-power and when tonnage be already short any proposal which must reduce its efficiency have to be very carefully examine the delay of the convoy system be due to two cause -lrb- a -rrb- because the speed of the convoy must necessarily be fix by the speed of the slowest ship and -lrb- b -rrb- the fact that the arrival of a large number of ship at one time may cause congestion and consequent delay at the port of unload however if additional safety be give there be compensation for this delay when the risk be great one danger of a convoy system under modern condition should be mention viz the increase risk from attack by mine if ship be sail singly a minefield will in all probability sink only one vessel -- the first ship enter it the fate of that ship reveal the presence of the field and with adequate organization it be improbable that other vessel will be sink in the same field in the case of a convoy encounter a minefield as in the case of a fleet several ship may be sink practically simultaneously during the year 1916 whilst i be still in command of the grand fleet suggestion as to convoy have be forward to the admiralty for the better protection of the ocean trade against attack by surface vessel but it be point out to I that the number of cruiser available for escort work be entirely insufficient and that consequently the suggestion could not be adopt this objection be one that could only be overcome by remove some of the faster merchant ship from the trade route and arm they to this course there be the objection that we be already -- that be before the intensive campaign begin -- very short of ship shortly after my take up the post of first sea lord at the admiralty at the end of 1916 the question be discuss once more at that time the danger of attack by enemy raider on shipping in the north atlantic be small the protection need be against attack by submarine and the dangerous area commence some 300-400 mile from the british island it be know that unrestricted submarine warfare be about to commence and that this would mean that shipping would usually be subject to torpedo attack from submarine when in a submerged condition against this form of attack the gun armament of cruiser or armed merchant ship be practically useless and however powerfully armed ship of this type be themselves in peril of be torpedo small vessel of shallow draught possess high speed offer the only practicable form of protection shallow draught be necessary in order that the protect vessel should themselves be comparatively immune from successful torpedo fire and speed be essential for offensive operation against the submarine convoy sailing be as have be state the recognize method of trade protection in the old war and this be a strong argument in favor of its adoption in the late war it should however be clearly understand that the condition have entirely change convoy sailing for the protection of merchant ship against torpedo attack by submarine be quite a different matter from such a system as a preventive against attack by surface vessel and involve far greater difficulty in the day of sailing ship especially accurate station keep be not very necessary and the ship comprise the convoy sail in loose order and cover a considerable area of water on a strange vessel also a sailing vessel be sight the protect frigate or frigate would proceed to investigate she character whilst the ship compose the convoy close in towards one another or steer a course that would take they out of danger in the circumstance with which we be deal in 1917 the requirement be quite otherwise it be essential for the protection of the convoy that the ship should keep close and accurate station and should be able to maneuver by signal close station be enjoin by the necessity of reduce the area cover by the convoy accurate station be require to ensure safety from collision and freedom of maneuver it will be realize that a convoy comprise twenty to thirty vessel occupy considerable space even when steam in the usual formation of four five or six column since the number of destroyer or sloop that could be provide for screen the convoy from torpedo attack by submarine be bind to be very limit under any condition it be essential that the column of ship should be as short as possible in other word that the ship should follow one another at close interval so that the destroyer on each side of the convoy should be able as far as possible to guard it from attack by submarine work from the flank and that they should be able with great rapidity to counter-attack a submarine with depth charge should a periscope be sight for a brief moment above the surface or the track of a torpedo be see in fact it be necessary if the protection of a convoy be to be real protection that the ship compose the convoy should be handle in a manner that approach the handling of battleship in a squadron the diagram on p 107 show a ideal convoy with six destroyer protect it disposed in the manner order at the start of the convoy system -lrb- illustration on page 107 with caption diagram illustrate a convoy of 25 merchant ship with a escort of 6 destroyer zigzag at high speed for protection the convoy show in close order and on its normal course -rrb- -lrb- illustration on page 108 show accord to its caption typical convoy and escort of 10 trawler in the early day of convoy -rrb- how far this ideal be attainable be a matter of doubt prior to 1917 we experience of merchant ship sail in company have be confine to troop transport these vessel be well officered and well man carry experienced engine-room staff be capable of attain moderate speed and be generally not comparable to ordinary cargo vessel many of which be of very slow speed and possess a large proportion of officer and man of limited sea experience owe to the very considerable personnel of the mercantile marine which have join the royal naval reserve and be serve in the fleet or in patrol craft moreover even the troop transport have not cross the submarine zone in company but have be escort independently and many naval officer who have be in charge of convoy when question be not convince that sailing in convoy under the condition mention above be a feasible proposition nor moreover be the master of the transport in February 1917 in order to investigate this aspect of the question a conference take place between the naval staff and the master of cargo steamer which be lie in the london dock the master be ask they opinion as to how far they ship could be depend on to keep station in a convoy of 12 to 20 vessel they express a unanimous opinion that it be not practicable to keep station under the condition mention the difficulty be due to two cause : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the inexperience of they deck officer owe to so many of they have be take for the royal naval reserve and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the inexperience of they engineer combine with the impossibility of obtain delicate adjustment of speed by reason of the absence of suitable engine-room telegraph and the poor quality of much of the coal use when press as to the greatest number of ship that could be expect to maneuver together in safety the master of these cargo steamer all experienced seaman give it as they opinion that two or possibly three be the maximum number the opinion thus express be confirm later by other master of merchant ship who be consult on the subject it be to the eternal credit of the british merchant marine which render service of absolutely inestimable value to the empire throughout the war that when put to the test by the adoption of the convoy system officer and man prove that they could achieve far more than they themselves have consider possible at the same time it should be recognize how severe a strain be impose on officer particularly the master of vessel sail in convoy the matter be keep constantly under review in February 1917 the german commence unrestricted submarine warfare against merchant ship of all nationality and as a consequence we shipping loss as well as those of ally and neutral country begin to mount steadily each succeed month the effect of this new phase of submarine warfare be best illustrate by a few figure during the last four month of 1916 the gross tonnage lose by _ submarine attack _ alone give the follow monthly average : british 121500 ally 59500 neutral 87500 total 268500 in the first four month of 1917 the figure become in round number : british ally neutral total January 104000 62000 116000 282000 February 256000 77000 131000 464000 march 283000 74000 149000 506000 April 513000 133000 185000 831000 -lrb- the unite state enter the war on April 6 1917 -rrb- note -- in neither case be the loss of fishing craft include it will be realize that since the loss towards the end of 1916 be such as to give just cause for considerable anxiety the later figure make it clear that some method of counteract the submarine must be find and find quickly if the ally cause be to be save from disaster none of the anti-submarine measure that have be under consideration or trial since the formation of the anti-submarine division of the naval staff in December 1916 could _ by any possibility _ mature for some month since time be necessary for the production of vessel and more or less complicated matériel and in these circumstance the only step that could be take be that of give a trial to the convoy system for the ocean trade although the time be by no means yet ripe for effective use of the system by reason of the shortage of destroyer sloop and cruiser which be still most acute although the situation be improve slowly month by month as new vessel be complete prior to this date we have already have some experience of convoy as a protection against submarine attack the coal trade of france have be bring under convoy in march 1917 the trade between scandinavium and north sea port be also organize in convoy in April of the same year this trade have since December 1916 be carry out on a system of protected sailing it be true that these convoy be always very much scatter particularly the scandinavian convoy which be compose largely of neutral vessel and therefore present exceptional difficulty in the matter of organization and handle the number of destroyer which could be spare for screen the convoy be also very small the protection afford be therefore more apparent than real but even so the result have be very good in reduce the loss by submarine attack the protection of the vessel employ in the french coal trade be entrust very largely to trawler as the ship compose the convoy be mostly slow so that in this case more screening vessel be available although they be not so efficient be themselves of slow speed for the introduction of a system of convoy which would protect merchant ship as far as they port of discharge in the unite kingdom there be two requirement : -lrb- a -rrb- a sufficient number of convoy cruiser or armed merchant ship whose role would be that of bring the ship comprise the convoy to some select rendezvous outside the zone of submarine activity where it would be meet by the flotilla of small vessel which would protect the convoy through the submarine area it be essential that the ship of the convoy should arrive at this rendezvous as a organize unit well practice in station-keeping by day and at night with the ship darken and that the vessel should be capable also of zigzag together and of carry out such necessary movement as alteration of course etc otherwise the convoy could not be safely escort through the danger area -lrb- b -rrb- the other essential be the presence of the escort flotilla in sufficient strength it have be mention that there be a insufficient number of vessel available for use as convoying cruiser it be estimate that about fifty cruiser or armed merchant ship would be require for this service if the homeward-bound trade to the british isle alone be consider a additional twelve vessel would be necessary to deal with the outward-bound trade at the time only eighteen vessel be available and these could only be obtain by denude the north atlantic entirely of cruiser the situation in regard to destroyer or other fast vessel present equal difficulty early in February 1917 we have available for general convoy or patrol work only fourteen destroyer station at devonport and twelve sloop at queenstown and owe to repair and the necessity of rest officer and man periodically only a proportion of these be available at any one time a number of these vessel be require to escort troop transport through the submarine danger zone during the month of February six sloop be divert from they proper work of minesweeping in the north sea and add to the patrol force at queenstown and eight destroyer be take from the grand fleet and send to southern water for patrol and escort duty there be obvious objection to this weakening of the north sea force but it be necessary in the circumstance to ignore they this total of forty destroyer and sloop represent the whole available force at the end of February simultaneously a careful investigation show that for the institution of a system of convoy and escort for homeward-bound atlantic trade alone to the unite kingdom we requirement would be eighty-one destroyer or sloop and forty-eight trawler -lrb- the latter vessel be only suitable for escort the slow 6-7-knot ship of the trade from gibraltar to the unite kingdom -rrb- for the outward atlantic trade from the unite kingdom we estimated requirement be forty-four additional destroyer or sloop the deficiency in suitable vessel of this class be best show by the follow table which reveal the destroyer position at different

-lrb- footnote b : include united state destroyer -rrb- there be the possible alternative of bring only a small portion of the trade under convoy by take all the available fast small craft from patrol duty and utilize they to escort this portion of the trade but it be feel that as this would leave the _ whole _ of the remain trade entirely without protection and no fast patrol craft would be on the trade route to pick up the crew of any merchant ship that might be sink by submarine the step be not justified the next point for consideration be the possibility of obtain destroyer or sloop from other source with which to increase the force for trade protection the only command on which it be possible to draw further be the grand fleet the harwich and dover force the destroyer of old type work on the east coast or the destroyer and p boat protect we cross-channel communication west of the dover command it be out of the question to reduce the harwich or dover flotilla materially as we be already run the gravest risk from the inadequacy of these force to deal with enemy destroyer and submarine operate in southern water from zeebrugge or from german port and in addition the harwich force furnish the sole protection for the weekly convoy run between the thame and dutch port besides be much require for reconnaissance and offensive operation in the heligoland bight so far as it could be spare for this purpose however the emergency be such that destroyer be take from harwich as the force obtain new vessel of a faster and more powerful type the destroyer on the east coast and in the portsmouth command be already inadequate to afford proper protection to the trade and the cross-channel communication as evidence by we loss here again however in order to meet the very serious situation some destroyer be eventually transfer to devonport from portsmouth but at the expense of still less protection and fewer opportunity for offensive action against submarine there remain only the grand fleet destroyer on which we could draw yet further it have always be hold that the grand fleet require a total force of one hundred destroyer and ten flotilla leader for the double purpose of screen the ship from submarine attack when at sea and of counter the enemy 's destroyer and attack he heavy ship with torpedo fire in a fleet action we have gradually build the destroyer force of the grand fleet up to this figure by the early spring of 1917 although of course it fall far short of requirement in earlier month it be well know to we that the high sea fleet would be accompany by at least eight flotilla or eighty-eight destroyer when proceed to sea at its _ select _ moment and it be quite probable that the number might be much higher as many more vessel be available at we _ average _ moment even with a nominal force of one hundred destroyer and ten flotilla leader we could not expect that more than seventy destroyer and eight leader would be present with the fleet since in addition to those absent refit a considerable number be always engage on trade protection or anti-submarine work in northern water which could not join up in time to accompany the fleet to sea when the scandinavian convoy be start in April 1917 one flotilla leader and six destroyer from the grand fleet be use for its protection other vessel in northern water also depend on grand fleet destroyer for protection any further transference therefore of destroyer from the grand fleet to southern water for trade protection be a highly dangerous expedient involve increase risk from submarine attack on the heavy ship in the event of the fleet proceed to sea as well as disadvantage in a fleet action the necessity however be so great that the risk have to be face and for some month of 1917 from eight to twelve grand fleet destroyer be use for trade protection in the atlantic principally from irish port in addition to those protect trade in the north sea it be interesting to note the number of person who claim to have be the first to urge the admiralty to adopt convoy as a method of protect merchant ship against submarine attack the claimant for this distinction be not confine to great britain the great majority of they be people without any knowledge of the sea and naval matter certainly none of they possess any knowledge of the number of vessel need to afford protection to the ship under convoy nor of the vessel which we could produce for the purpose at the time possibly the fact relate above may serve to show that convoy be commence by admiralty direction and that they be start as soon as and extend as rapidly as the necessary protect vessel could be provide those who argue then or who have argue since that we should have reduce the number of destroyer with the grand fleet will not i think meet with any support from those who serve in that fleet especially from the officer upon whom lay the responsibility for counter any move of the high sea fleet the entry of the united state into the war early in April ease the situation somewhat first it be hope that the united state navy would assist we with destroyer and other small craft and secondly it be a fact that the great majority of the material import into country contiguous to germany come from the united state there be reason to anticipate that step would be take by the united state authority in the direction of some form of rationing of these country and in these circumstance it be justifiable to reduce gradually the strength of we blockade squadron of armed merchant vessel know as the 10th cruiser squadron by this mean we could at once provide additional vessel to act as convoying cruiser vice-admiral w sim have arrive in this country in march 1917 after pass through a exciting experience the ship in which he cross -lrb- the unite state steamer _ st loui _ -rrb- be mine outside liverpool he come to visit I at the admiralty immediately after he arrival in london and from that day until i leave the admiralty at the end of the year it be my privilege and pleasure to work in the very closest co-operation with he my friendship with the admiral be of very long standing we have during many year exchange view on different naval subject but principally on gunnery question i in common with other british naval officer who have the honor of he acquaintance have always be greatly strike by he wonderful success in the post of inspector of target practice in the united state navy that success be due not only to he intimate knowledge of gunnery but also to he attractive personality charm of manner keen sense of humor and quick and accurate grasp of any problem with which he be confront it be fortunate indeed for the ally cause that admiral sim should have be select to command the united state force in european water for to the quality mention above he add a habit of speak he mind with absolutely fearless disregard of the consequence this characteristic have lead he on more than one occasion into difficulty but in the circumstance with which we have to deal in 1917 it be just the quality that be need it be a very difficult matter for those in authority in the united state separate as they be by 3000 mile of sea from the theater of war to realize the condition in european water for the admiralty be not concern only with the north sea and atlantic and the terse and straightforward report of admiral sim and he convincing statement go a long way towards bring home to the united state people at that time the extreme gravity of the situation and the need for immediate action he be consistently back up by that great ambassador the late mr wh page who also honor I with he confidence and to whom i speak perfectly freely on all occasion the assistance from the united state that it be hope be now in sight make the prospect of success follow on the adoption of the convoy system far more favourable and preparation be put in hand for the institution of a ocean convoy system on a large scale in order to gain some experience of the difficulty attend the working of cargo ship direction be give for a experimental convoy to be collect at gibraltar the necessary officer be send out to gibraltar with order to assemble the convoy to instruct the master in the work that lay before they and to explain to they the system of sail the manner in which the convoy would be handle and the protection that would be afford this naturally take time and the convoy do not arrive in england until after the middle of may the experience gain show however that the difficulty apprehend by the officer of the mercantile marine be not insuperable and that give adequate protection by cruiser and small fast craft the system be at least practicable it be accordingly decide to put it into operation at once and to extend it as rapidly as the increase in the number of we destroyer and sloop permit the north atlantic homeward-bound trade be bring under convoy in may 1917 and the gibraltar homeward-bound trade in July but for some month it be impossible to provide for the institution of a complete convoy system at first some 40 per cent of the homeward-bound trade be convoy then the system be gradually extend to include first 60 per cent then 80 per cent and finally 100 per cent of the homeward atlantic trade and the trade from gibraltar trawler be use as escort for the gibraltar trade as the majority of the ship therein engage be slow but trawler be unsatisfactory escort vessel in the early stage of the convoy system difficulty be experience from the fact that all the available destroyer and most of the sloop be use as escort with the result that the ship not under convoy be leave with but little protection chapter v the convoy system at work as have be mention in chapter ii the first ship to be bring under a system of convoy be those engage in the french coal trade and in the trade between scandinavium and the unite kingdom in the case of the _ french coal trade _ commence in march 1917 the steamship engage in the trade be sail in group from four different assembly port viz : southend to boulogne and calai st helen to havre portland to cherbourg penzance to brest between southend and boulogne and calai the protection be give by the vessel of the dover patrol in the course of they ordinary duty but for the other three route special escort force be utilize and daily convoy be the rule owe to the great demand for coal in france sailing vessel be also use and sail under convoy from several of the south-west port a large organization be require to deal with the trade and this be build up under the supervision of captain reginald gh henderson cb of the anti-submarine division of the naval staff work under vice-admiral -lrb- then rear-admiral -rrb- sir alexander duff head of the division in conference with the commanders-in-chief portsmouth and plymouth under whose direction and protection the convoy be run the immunity of this trade carry out in the infested water of the english channel from successful attack by submarine be extraordinary no doubt the small size of the vessel concern and they comparatively shallow draught be a contributory cause to this immunity the figure for the period march to August 1917 show that 8825 vessel cross the channel under convoy and that only fourteen be lose the history of the _ scandinavian and east coast convoy _ date back to the autumn of 1916 when heavy loss be be incur amongst scandinavian ship due to submarine attack thus in October 1916 the loss amongst norwegian and swedish ship by submarine attack be more than three time as great as the previous highest monthly loss some fear exist that the neutral scandinavian country might refuse to run such risk and go to the extreme of prohibit sailing towards the end of 1916 before i leave the fleet a system of protected sailing be therefore introduce in this system the commander-in-chief grand fleet fix upon a number of alternative route between norway and the shetland island which be use by all vessel trading between scandinavium and ally country the particular route in use at any given moment be patrol by the local force from the orkney and shetland assist when possible by small craft from the grand fleet the admiral command the orkney and shetland be place in charge of the arrangement which be carry out by the senior naval officer at lerwick in the shetland island at this period the intention be that the shipping from norway should sail at dusk reach a certain rendezvous at dawn and thence be escort to lerwick the shipping from lerwick sail at dawn under protection disperse at dark and reach the norwegian coast at dawn difficulty of course arise in the event of bad weather or when the slow speed of the ship prevent the passage of about 180 mile be make in approximately twenty-four hour and by April 1917 it be evident that further step be necessary to meet these difficulty which be again cause heavy loss early in April then by direction from the admiralty a conference be hold at longhope on the subject admiral sir frederick brock command the orkney and shetland preside and representative from the admiralty and the command affect be present and the adoption of a complete convoy system to include the whole trade between the east coast and norway be recommend this proposal be approve by the admiralty and be put into force as soon as the necessary organization have mature escort vessel have with difficulty be provide although in inadequate number the first convoy sail towards the end of April 1917 the system may be describe briefly as follow the convoy all put into lerwick in the shetland island both on the eastward and westward passage so that lerwick act as a junction for the whole system from lerwick convoy to scandinavium leave in the afternoon under the protection of two or three destroyer and with some armed patrol vessel in company up to a certain stage make the norwegian coast at vary point and there disperse and the destroyer then pick up the west-bound convoy at a rendezvous off the norwegian coast shortly before dark and steer for a rendezvous between norway and the shetland island where a escort of armed patrol vessel join the convoy at daylight to assist in its protection to lerwick from lerwick convoy be dispatch to various point on the coast of the unite kingdom those make for southern port on the east coast be escort by a force compose of some of the old river class or of 30-knot class destroyer and trawler belong to the east coast command base on the humber and those make for more northerly port or port on the west coast be escort merely by armed patrol vessel as the danger of submarine attack to these convoy be not so great the main difficulty be the provision of the destroyer require for the proper protection of the convoy and to a lesser degree the provision of armed patrol vessel of the trawler whaler or drifter type the conference hold early in April 1917 have report that whilst stronger protection be naturally desirable the very least force that could give defense to the convoy between lerwick and the east coast port would be a total of twenty-three destroyer and fifty trawler whilst for each convoy between lerwick and norway at least two destroyer and four trawler be need the destroyer for the latter convoy be provide by the grand fleet although they could ill be spare the total number so utilize be six it be only possible to provide a force of twenty old destroyer and forty-five trawler for the east coast convoy instead of the number recommend by the conference and owe to the age of a large majority of these destroyer and the inevitable resultant occasional breakdown of machinery the number available frequently fall below twenty although it be really marvellous how those old destroyer stick to the work to the eternal credit of they crew and particularly the engineering staff the adoption of the system however result during the comparatively fine summer weather in a considerable reduction in the number of merchant ship lose in spite of the fact that great difficulty be experience in keep the ship of the convoy together particularly at night dawn frequently find the convoy very much scatter it become obvious however that with the approach of winter the old destroyer of the 30-knot class would have the greatest difficulty in face the heavy weather and very urgent representation be make by sir frederick brock for they replacement by more modern vessel before the winter set in all that could be effect in this direction be do though at the expense of some of the channel escort urgent request for good destroyer be be receive at the admiralty from every command and it be impossible to comply with they since the vessel be not in existence certain other step which may be enumerate be take in connection with the scandinavian traffic the convoy receive such additional protection as could be give by the airship which be gradually be station on the east coast during the year 1917 and decoy ship occasionally join the convoy in order to invite submarine attack on themselves this procedure be indeed adopt on all convoy route as they be bring into be the rule be for the decoy ship to drop behind the convoy in the guise of a straggler some of we submarine be also detail to work in the vicinity of convoy route in order that they might take advantage of any opportunity to attack enemy submarine if sight due precaution for they safety be make among the difficulty with which the very energetic and resourceful admiral command the orkney and shetland have to contend in he working of the convoy be the persistent mining of the approach to lerwick harbor by german submarine a second difficulty be the great congestion that take place in that harbor as soon as bad weather set in during the autumn of 1917 the weather during the latter part of 1917 be exceptionally bad and great congestion and consequent delay to shipping occur both at lerwick and in the norwegian port as the result of this congestion it become necessary to increase largely the number of ship in each convoy thereby enhance the difficulty of handle the convoy at the commencement it have be decide to limit the size of a scandinavian convoy to six or eight vessel but as the congestion increase it become necessary to exceed this number considerably occasional convoy compose of as many as thirty to forty ship be form a contributory cause to the increase in the size of convoy be due to the fact that the trade between lerwick and the white sea which have be proceed direct between those place during the first half of 1917 become the target of persistent submarine attack during the summer and in order to afford they protection it be necessary in the autumn to include these ship also in the scandinavian convoy for the passage across the north sea between the coast of norway and the white sea they proceed independently hug territorial water as far as possible it will be realize that the institution of the convoy system of sailing for the scandinavian trade necessitate a extensive organization on the norwegian as well as on the british side of the north sea for this reason captain arthur halsey rn be appoint in march 1917 as naval vice-consul at bergen and the whole of the arrangement in regard to the working of the convoy the issue of order etc from the norwegian side come under he and he staff to which addition be make from time to time the position be peculiar in that british naval officer be work in this manner in a neutral country and it say much for the discretion and tact of captain halsey and he staff and the courtesy of the norwegian government official that no difficulty occur step be also take to appoint officer at british port for the work of control the mercantile traffic and as the organization become perfect so the condition gradually improve by the end of September the bad weather prevalent in the north sea have cause great dislocation in the convoy system ship compose convoy become much scatter and arrive so late off lerwick as to prevent they proceed on they passage without enter harbor owing to the overcrowding of lerwick harbor the system of change convoy escort without enter harbor have be introduce and the delay due to bad weather be cause great difficulty in this respect the question of substitute the tyne for lerwick as the collect port be first discuss at this period but the objection to the tyne as a assembly port be so strong as to prevent the adoption of the proposal the system of convoy outline above continue in force from April to December 1917 during which period some 6000 vessel be convoy between norway and the humber with a total loss of about seventy ship there be always the danger that germany would attack the convoy by means of surface vessel the safeguard against such attack be the constant presence of force from the grand fleet in the north sea in view of the fact however that the distance of the convoy route from the horn reef be only between 300 and 350 mile and that on a winter night this distance could almost be cover at a speed of 20 knot during the fourteen or fifteen hour of darkness that prevail it will be see that unless the convoy be actually accompany by a force sufficient to protect they against operation by surface vessel there be undoubted risk of successful attack it be not possible to forecast the class of vessel by which such a attack might be carry out or the strength of the attack force the german decision in this respect would naturally be govern by the value of the objective and by the risk to be run admiral scheer in he book state that on one occasion in April 1918 the german battle-cruiser support by the battleship and the remainder of the high sea fleet attempt such a attack but find no convoy it be always realize by we that a attack in great force might be make on the convoy but such risk have to be accept the movement of the ship of the grand fleet be a matter for the commander-in-chief provide always that no definite order be issue by the admiralty or no warning of expect attack be give to the commander-in-chief and prior to the first attack on the scandinavian convoy no special force of cruiser or light cruiser accompany the convoy to guard it against attack by surface vessel although a strong deterrent to attack lay in the frequent presence of force from the grand fleet to the southward of the convoy route which force would seriously threaten the return of any raiding german vessel as the enemy would naturally make the northward passage by night we could hardly expect to sight he ship on the outward trip the first attack take place at daylight on October 17 the convoy on this occasion consist of twelve ship two british one belgian one danish five norwegian and three swedish and be under the anti-submarine escort of the destroyer _ mary rise _ and _ strongbow _ and two trawler the _ elsie _ and _ p fannon _ at dawn shortly after 60 be two strange vessel be sight to the southward and be later recognize as german light cruiser they be challenge but reply by open fire at about 615 be disable the _ strongbow _ with the first salvo fire the _ mary rise _ steam gallantly at the enemy with the intention of attack with torpedo but be sink by gunfire before she could achieve she object the enemy vessel then attack the convoy sink all except the british and belgian vessel which escape undamaged the _ strongbow _ shell at close range return the fire use gun and torpedo but be completely overwhelm by the gun of the light cruiser and sink at about 930 be the trawler _ elsie _ effect very fine rescue work amongst the survivor both from the _ strongbow _ and ship of the convoy whilst under fire and both trawler reach lerwick the enemy sheer off soon after 80 be most unfortunately neither the _ strongbow _ nor the _ mary rise _ succeed in get a wireless signal through to we own vessel to report the presence of enemy ship otherwise there can be little doubt that they would have be intercept and sink we have in the north sea during the night before the attack and during the day of the attack a particularly strong force of light cruiser comprise four or possibly five squadron -lrb- a total of not less than sixteen vessel -rrb- all to the southward of the convoy route and have the information of the attack come through from the destroyer these vessel would have be inform at once and would have have a excellent chance of intercept the enemy the extreme difficulty of prevent the egress of raider from the north sea at night even when so large a force be cruise be well illustrate by this incident although a little reflection on the wide area of water to be cover together with a knowledge of the distance that the eye can cover on a dark night -lrb- some 200 to 300 yard -rrb- would show how very great be the chance in favor of evasion this disaster to the scandinavian convoy be bind to bring into prominence the question of afford to it protection against future attack by surface vessel for necessarily the protection against surface vessel differ from that against submarine a point which be sometimes overlook by those who be unfamiliar with the demand of the two war which be be wage -- the one on the surface and the other under the surface it be very difficult to furnish efficient protection against the surface form of attack from the resource of the grand fleet if the practice of run a daily convoy be continue because it be impossible to forecast the strength or exact character -- battle-cruiser cruiser or destroyer -- of the attack and the first step be to reduce the number of convoy and to increase correspondingly the number of ship in each convoy a telegram be send to the admiral command the orkney and shetland on October 26 ask whether the convoy could be conveniently reduce to three per week a reply be receive on the 29th to the effect that the convoy could be run every third day under certain condition the important condition be the use of the tyne instead of the hurnber as a collect port and the provision of eight extra trawler and nine modern destroyer sir frederick brock state that he be assume cruiser protection to the convoy and that the detail would need to be work out before the change could be make he suggest a conference he be request on October 31 to consult the vice-admiral commanding east coast of england as to the practicability of use the tyne as a convoy collect port meanwhile sir f brock have prepare a scheme for give effect to he proposal and on November 5 he send copy of this scheme to the vice-admiral commanding east coast of england and other officer concern for they consideration in forwarding proposal to the admiralty on November 22 the commander-in-chief of the grand fleet state that the destroyer ask for could not be provide from the grand fleet amongst other reason it be point out that the destroyer require for screen the light cruiser protect the convoy would have to be supply from that source thus bring a additional strain on the grand fleet flotilla he suggest the provision of these vessel from other command such as the mediterranean and point out the manifest advantage that would result from provide a force for this convoy work that would be additional to the grand fleet flotilla consideration of the proposal at the admiralty show once again the great difficulty of provide the destroyer it be impossible to spare any from the mediterranean where large troop movement need destroyer protection be in progress and other command be equally unable to furnish they indeed the demand for destroyer from all direction be as insistent as ever the unsuitability of the tyne as a collect port be remark upon by the naval staff as well as other objection to the scheme as put forward from scapa in order to decide upon a workable scheme direction be give that a conference be to assemble at scapa on December 10 a officer from the naval staff be detail to attend the conference to point out the objection which have be raise and amongst other matter to bring to notice the advantage of the firth of forth as a collect port instead of the tyne meanwhile step have be take to furnish as much protection as possible from grand fleet resource to the convoy against attack by enemy surface vessel the conference of December 10 come to the conclusion that the firth of forth be the best assembly place and that the port of methil in that locality would offer great advantage the conference make recommendation as to the provision of destroyer as soon as they be available and amongst other matter mention the necessity for a increase in the minesweep force at rosyth to meet a possible extension of enemy minelaying when the new system be in operation on December 12 a second attack on the convoy take place in this instance the attack be carry out by four german destroyer two convoy be at sea one east-bound and one west-bound the east-bound convoy be attack it be screen against submarine attack by two destroyer -- the _ pellew _ and _ partridge _ -- and four armed trawler and comprise six vessel one be british and the remainder neutral the attack take place in approximately lat 5950 n long 350 e and the action result in the _ partridge _ the four trawler and the whole of the convoy be sink and the _ pellew _ be so severely damage as to be incapable of continue the action at the time of this attack a west-bound convoy be at sea to the westward of the other convoy and two armored cruiser -- the _ shannon _ and _ minotaur _ -- with four destroyer be act as a cover force for the convoy against attack by surface vessel a wireless signal from the _ partridge _ have be intercept this force steam at full speed for the scene of the action the destroyer arrive in time to pick up 100 survivor from the convoy and trawler but not in time to save the convoy the 3rd light cruiser squadron also at sea be some 85 mile to the southward and eastward of the convoy when attack but neither this force nor the _ shannon 's _ force succeed in intercept the enemy before he reach port the short hour of daylight greatly facilitate he escape on receipt of the report of the meeting of December 10 and in view of the attack of December 12 the question of the interval between convoy be specially consider in its relation to the ability of the grand fleet to furnish protection against surface attack it be decide that for this reason it would only be possible to sail convoy from methil every third day so as to avoid have two convoy at sea at a time a situation with which the grand fleet could not deal satisfactorily the organization then draw up actually come into effect on January 20 1918 after my departure from the admiralty and be continue with certain modification to the end of the war the principal modification be a increase of the interval between convoy first to four and later to five day in order to relieve the strain on the grand fleet arise from the provision of cover force the disadvantage of the resultant increase size of the convoy have to be accept under the new system the commander-in-chief coast of scotland at rosyth -- admiral sir cecil burney -- become responsible for the control of the scandinavian convoy the admiralty select the route the introduction of the convoy system for the atlantic trade date from the early day of may 1917 when the prospect -- for it be only then a prospect -- of increase assistance from the we navy in regard to destroyer and other small craft for escort duty as well as convoy cruiser for ocean work make the system possible action take with the we authority for the introduction of a system by which the trade from that country in neutral shipping be control enable the ship of the 10th cruiser squadron to be gradually withdraw from blockade duty and utilize as ocean convoy cruiser even with assistance from the we navy in the shape of old battleship and cruiser the use of the 10th cruiser squadron the withdrawal of the 2nd cruiser squadron of five ship from the grand fleet the use of the ship of the north american and west indy squadron and of some of we older battleship from the mediterranean there be still a shortage of convoy cruiser this deficiency be make up by arm a number of the faster cargo vessel with 6-inch gun for duty as convoy cruiser these vessel usually carry cargo themselves so that no great loss of tonnage be involve on may 17 a committee be assemble at the admiralty to draw up a complete organization for a general convoy system -lrb- the committee be compose of the follow officer : captain hw longden rn fleet paymaster hwe manisty rn commander j wilde rn lieutenant ge burton rn and mr na leslie of the ministry of shipping -rrb- this committee have before it the experience of a experimental convoy which arrive from gibraltar shortly after the commencement of the committee 's work as well as the experience already gain in the scandinavian and french coal trade convoy and the evidence of officer such as captain rg henderson rn who have make a close study of the convoy question on June 6 the report be complete this valuable report deal with the whole organization need for the institution of a complete system of convoy for homeward and outward trade in the atlantic in anticipation of the report step have already be take to commence the system the first homeward bind atlantic convoy start on may 24 a necessary preliminary for the successful working of the convoy be a central organization at the admiralty this organization -- term the convoy section of the trade division of the naval staff -- work directly under rear-admiral al duff who have recently be place on the board of admiralty with the title of assistant chief of the naval staff -lrb- acn -rrb- and who be in immediate control of the anti-submarine trade and minesweeping division of the staff fleet paymaster hwe manisty be appoint as organize manager of convoy and the convoy section comprise at first some ten officer soon increase to a total of fifteen and be in immediate touch with the ministry of shipping through a representative mr leslie he function be to make such arrangement as would ensure co-operation between the loading and discharging of cargo and convoy requirement and generally to coordinate shipping need with convoy need the organize manager of the convoy and he staff control the assembly etc of all convoy and vessel the route of the convoy and they protection both ocean and anti-submarine be arrange under the superintendence of the acn in addition to the central admiralty organization a officer with the necessary staff be appoint to each convoy port of assembly at home and abroad this officer 's duty comprise the collection and organization of the convoy and the issue of sailing order and necessary print instruction to the master of the vessel see that they be properly equip for sailing in company and forwarding information to the admiralty of the movement of the convoy a essential feature of the system be the appointment of a convoy commodore this officer be quite distinct from the commanding officer of the vessel form the ocean escort but act under he order when in company the duty of the convoy commodore whose broad pennant be hoist in one of the ship be subject to instruction from the commanding officer of the escort vessel to take general charge of the convoy the convoy commodore be either naval officer admiral or captain on the active or retired list or experienced merchant captain the duty be most arduous and responsible but there be no lack of volunteer for this work many of the convoy commodore have they ship sink under they the country have every reason for much gratitude to those who undertake this difficult and very responsible task by July we have succeed in increase the strength of the anti-submarine convoy escort force to thirty-three destroyer -lrb- eleven of which belong to the united state navy -rrb- and ten sloop with eleven more destroyer for the screening of troop transport through the submarine zone and for the protection of the convoy eastward from the lizard the position in which the other screen force leave they we have remain twelve sloop which with trawler be engage in protect that considerable portion of the trade make for the south of ireland which we could not yet bring under convoy it be intend to absorb these sloop for convoy protection as soon as circumstance permit at this stage it be consider that a total of thirty-three more destroyer or sloop be need to complete the homeward convoy system the admiralty be press to weaken yet further the grand fleet destroyer force in order to extend the convoy system but do not consider such a course justified in view of the general naval situation in arrange the organization of the atlantic convoy system it be necessary to take into consideration certain other important matter amongst these be the following : 1 the selection of port of assembly and frequency of sailing during the latter half of 1917 the general arrangement be as follow for the homeward trade : port of assembly frequency of sailing destination gibraltar every 4 day alternately to e & w c ` t sierra leone every 8 day either coast dakar every 8 day either coast hampton road -lrb- usa -rrb- every 4 day alternately to e & w c ` t new york every 8 day alternately to e & w c ` t halifax n every 8 day west coast sydney -lrb- cape breton -rrb- every 8 day alternately to e & w c ` t each port serve a certain area of trade and vessel engage in that trade meet at the port of assembly for convoy to the unite kingdom or to france the total number of merchant ship sail thus in convoy every eight day in September 1917 be about 150 in convoy comprise from 12 to 30 ship and the total escorting force comprise : 50 ocean escort vessel -lrb- old battleship cruiser armed merchant ship and armed escort ship -rrb- 90 sloop and destroyer 15 vessel of the p class -lrb- small destroyer -rrb- 50 trawler in addition to a considerable force for local escort near gibraltar consist of sloop yacht torpedo boat we revenue cruiser we tug etc at this period -lrb- September 1917 -rrb- outward convoy be also in operation the arrangement be that the outward convoy be escort by destroyer or sloop to a position 300 to 400 mile from the coast clear of the known submarine area and there disperse to proceed independently there be insufficient ocean escort vessel to take the convoy on about twelve more be need for this work the escort vessel use for the outward convoy be destroyer or sloop which be due to proceed to sea to meet a homeward convoy the routine be that the outward convoy should sail at such a time as would ensure the homeward convoy be meet by the escort without undue delay at the rendezvous since any long period of wait about at a rendezvous be impossible for the escort vessel as they would have run short of fuel it be also undesirable as it reveal to any submarine in the neighborhood the approach of a convoy it will be realize by seaman that this procedure -lrb- which be force upon we by the shortage of escort vessel -rrb- lead to many difficulty in the first place the homeward convoy be frequently delay by bad weather etc on passage across the atlantic and owe to the insufficient range of the wireless installation it be often not possible for the commodore to acquaint the admiralty of this delay in time to stop the sailing of the outward convoy again outward convoy be often delay by bad weather result in the homeward convoy not be meet before enter the submarine zone as the winter draw near this be a source of constant anxiety since so many of the vessel outward bind be in ballast -lrb- empty -rrb- and they speed be consequently quickly reduce in bad weather the ship under these condition become in some case almost unmanageable in a convoy and the responsibility of the escort be much intensify in September 1917 the following be the position in respect to outward bind convoy : port of assembly frequency of sailing destination lamlash every 4 day atlantic port milford haven every 4 day gibraltar queenstown every 4 day atlantic port falmouth every 8 day gibraltar plymouth every 4 day atlantic port about 150 vessel sail every eight day in convoy vary in strength from 12 to 30 ship there be still a good deal of atlantic trade that be not sailing under convoy this comprise trade between gibraltar and north and south america between the cape south america and dakar and the coastal trade between north and south america it be estimate that a additional twenty-five to thirty ocean escort and eleven destroyer would be need to include the above trade in convoy the mediterranean trade be deal with later the question of speed be naturally one of great importance in the convoy system as have be state earlier the speed of a convoy like that of a squadron or fleet be necessarily that of the slowest ship and in order to prevent delay to shipping which be equivalent to serious loss of its carry power it be very necessary that convoy should be compose of ship of approximately the same speed in order to achieve this careful organization be need and the matter be not make easier by the uncertainty that frequently prevail as to the actual sea speed of particular merchant ship some master no doubt from legitimate pride in they vessel credit they with speed in excess of those actually attain frequently coal of poor quality or the fact that a ship have a dirty bottom reduce she speed to a very appreciable extent and convoy commodore have occasionally to direct ship under such condition to drop out of the convoy altogether and make they passage alone obviously this action be not take lightly owe to the risk involve decision as to the sea speed of convoy be take by the convoy officer at the collect port and he base this on the result of a examination of the record in the different ship as a rule convoy be class as slow and fast slow convoy comprise vessel of a speed between 8 and 12 - 1\/2 knot fast convoy include ship with a speed between 12 - 1\/2 and 16 knot ship of higher speed than 16 knot do not as a rule sail in convoy but trust to they speed and dark hour for protection in the submarine area the gibraltar convoy -lrb- a exception to the general rule -rrb- contain ship of only 7 knot speed with the introduction of convoy the provision of efficient signal arrangement become a matter of importance the issue of print instruction to each master and the custom introduce of assemble the master to meet the captain of the escort cruiser before sail so that the conduct of the convoy might be explain have the effect of reduce signalling to a minimum but it be necessary that each ship should have a signalman on board and the provision of the number of signalman require be no easy matter a good wireless installation be essential in the escort cruiser and in the commodore 's ship in order that the course of the convoy could be divert by the admiralty if the know or suspect presence of submarine render it necessary and also for the purpose of give to the admiralty early information of the position of a convoy approach the coast so that the escort destroyer could be dispatch in time fortunately for we german submarine constantly use they wireless installation when operate at sea and as a consequence we wireless directional station be able to fix they position by cross bearing this practice on the part of the enemy undoubtedly go far to assist we both in anti-submarine measure and in divert trade to a safe course the introduction of the convoy system render the provision of anti-submarine protection at port of assembly a matter of great importance owe to the very large number of vessel that be collect in they some of the port be already in possession of these defence but amongst those for which net protection be prepare and lay during 1917 be halifax sydney -lrb- cape breton -rrb- falmouth lamlash rosslare -lrb- on the south-east coast of ireland -rrb- milford haven sierra leone and dakar this involve extensive work and be undertake and carry out with great rapidity by captain fc learmonth and he staff whose work in the production of net defence during the war be of inestimable value not only to ourselves but to we ally for whom large supplies of net defence be also provide the usa also adopt we system of net defense for they harbor on entry into the war many anxious month be pass at the admiralty and at the port name until the anti-submarine defence be complete the escort of the convoy through the submarine zone impose very heavy work upon the destroyer sloop and other screening vessel this be due partly to the fact that there be not sufficient vessel to admit of adequate time be spend in harbor to rest the crew and effect necessary repair and partly to the nature of the work itself and the weather condition under which so much of it be carry out it will be realize by those who have be at sea in these small craft that little rest be obtainable in the atlantic between the west coast of ireland and the mouth of the channel and position 800 to 400 mile to the westward except in the finest weather when to this be add the constant strain impose by watch for the momentary appearance of a periscope or the track of a torpedo and the vigilance need especially on dark and stormy night to keep touch with a large convoy of merchant ship show no light with the inevitable whipping up of occasional straggler from the convoy some idea may be gather of the arduous and unceasing work accomplish by the anti-submarine escort it have be my practice during 1917 to call for return from all command of the number of hour that vessel of the destroyer and light cruiser type be actually under way per month and these return show how heavy be the strain on the destroyer particularly those engage in convoy work for several month for instance the destroyer in the flotilla station at devonport be under way on a average for just under 50 per cent of the month this mean that several destroyer in these flotilla average quite 60 per cent or even 70 per cent of they time under way as other vessel of the flotilla be lay up during the period under review for long refit due to collision or other damage in addition to the necessary four-monthly refit anyone familiar with the delicate nature of the machinery of destroyer -- which need constant attention -- and the condition of life at sea in they will appreciate the significance of these figure and the strain which the condition impose on those on board as well as on the machinery it be evident in November 1917 that the personnel and the machinery whilst stand the strain in a wonderful manner be approach the limit of endurance and anxiety be feel as to the situation during the winter report come in from the grand fleet indicate that the work of the destroyer engage in protect the ship of the scandinavian convoy be tell heavily on the personnel particularly on the commanding officer and one report state that the convoy work produce far greater strain than any other duty carry out by destroyer no mean proportion of the officer be suffer from a breakdown in health and since the _ whole _ of the work of the devonport queenstown and north of ireland flotilla consist of convoy duty whilst only a portion of the grand fleet destroyer be engage in this work the opinion express be very disquieting in they relation to the work of the southern flotilla however the destroyer hold on here as elsewhere but it be only just to the splendid endurance of the young officer and the man who man they to emphasize as strongly as i can the magnificent work they carry out in the face of every difficulty and without even the incentive of the prospect of a fight with a foe that could be see this be the compensation give in they work to the gallant personnel of the dover harwich and grand fleet flotilla the convoy flotilla know that they only chance of action be with a submarine submerge a form of warfare in which the result be so very frequently unknown and therefore unsatisfactory under the new condition the admiralty take upon itself responsibility for the control of the ship of the mercantile marine in addition to its control of the movement of the fleet indeed the control of convoy be even more directly under the admiralty than be the control of the fleet in the latter case the proper system be for the admiralty to indicate to the commander-in-chief grand fleet or to other command the objective and to supply all the information possible regard the strength of the enemy he intention and movement and such other information as can be of use to the commander-in-chief but to leave the handling of the force to the commander-in-chief concern this be the course which be usually follow during the late war it be my invariable practice when at the admiralty in the case of convoy however a different system be necessary owe to the difficulty of transmit information the great delay that would be cause be this attempt and the impossibility of control be exercise over all convoy at sea except by the admiralty consequently the actual movement of convoy for the greater part of they passage be direct by the naval staff owe to ship not show light at night convoy be divert clear of one another by wireless signal if they be get into dangerous proximity they be direct to alter course as necessary to avoid area in which submarine have be located and occasionally it become necessary to alter the destination of some ship as they approach home water the movement of all convoy be plot from day to day indeed from hour to hour on a large-scale chart at the admiralty and it be easy to see at a glance the position of all the ship at any give time as the convoy approach home water the ship come within the area of the commanders-in-chief coast of ireland devonport and portsmouth and the vice-admiral command the dover patrol and be take in charge by one or other of they at each port a staff exist which keep a constant record of the movement of ship pass through or work in the command and enable the commander-in-chief to take instant action if occasion arise the success of the convoy system in protect trade be best show by the figure relate to the year 1917 on the succeed page -lrb- p 144 -rrb- in consider these figure the loose station-keeping of the ship in the scandinavian convoy must be bear in mind a large proportion of the ship in this convoy be neutral and it be naturally not possible to bring these vessel under discipline as be the case with convoy compose of purely british ship consequently there be much straggling and the loss be proportionately heavier than in most of the atlantic convoy the comparatively heavy loss in the gibraltar convoy be probably due to these convoy traverse two dangerous submarine zone the extraordinary immunity of the french coal trade convoy from serious loss be remarkable and be probably due to the short passage which enable most of the distance to be traverse at night and to the ship be of light draught the table on the follow page would not be complete be no reference make to the heavy loss which be experience during the year amongst ship which be _ unescorted _ through the danger zone owe to the fact that no escort vessel be available for the work loss in homeward bind convoy 1917 port of departure of convoy | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | | no of | no lose |

there be naturally loud complaint of these loss but these be inevitable in the absence of escort vessel and no one realize the danger run more than those responsible for find protection every available vessel be not only work at highest possible pressure but as have be mention breakdown from overwork amongst escort craft be cause very considerable anxiety the follow figure show the danger which be run by unescorted vessel : loss amongst british merchant steamship in 1917 by submarine attack under separate escort under period convoy or unescorted ship under ship ship separate under unescorted escort convoy quarter end June 30 17 26 158 quarter end September 30 14 29 148 October and November 12 23 90 in consider the above table it should be point out that a large proportion of the loss show under the head ship unescorted take place amongst ship which have either disperse from a convoy or which be on they way to join up with a convoy at the port of assembly it be unfortunately quite impossible to provide escort for all ship either to they port of discharge or from they load port to the port of assembly for the convoy as we have so few vessel available for this work thus in the month of November 1917 out of 13 vessel engage in the main oversea trade that be lose 6 be in convoy 5 have leave or have not join they convoy and 2 be not join a convoy and be unescorted November be the month of smallest british loss during the period of unrestricted warfare in 1917 and it be of interest to examine the loss for that month the total number of ship lose be 51 as many as 1197 vessel enter or leave home water in _ overseas trade _ exclusive of the mediterranean trade of this aggregate 875 per cent be in convoy and the total number of these vessel sink -lrb- 13 -rrb- be divide amongst the follow trade : north america 1 gibraltar 5 west africa and south america 1 the bay of biscay portugal and spanish port west of gibraltar 5 scandinavian 1 in the same month there be 2159 _ cross-channel sailing _ and ten loss nine of these vessel be unescorted particulars of the locality of the total british loss of 51 ship for the month of November be as follow : east coast north of st abb 's 1 east coast between st abb 's and yarmouth 4 east coast yarmouth to the downs 4 -lrb- 2 by mine -rrb- english channel 21 -lrb- 7 by mine -rrb- bristol channel 4 irish sea 2 bay of biscay 2 south of cape st vincent 1 mediterranean 11 east of suez 1 -lrb- by mine -rrb- in order to give some idea of the great volume of traffic on the east coast and the consequent difficulty of afford proper protection it may be mention that in the month of October 1917 the number of vessel pass between spurn head -lrb- river humber -rrb- and st abb 's head -lrb- to the northward -rrb- be 740 go north and 920 go south of this total only 223 of the northward -- and 413 of the southward-bound vessel be in convoy or under escort the total loss be eleven all amongst the unaccompanied ship mention should be make here of the very serious situation which arise during the year 1917 owe to the success attend the attack by enemy submarine on oil tanker bring oil fuel to the unite kingdom for the use of the fleet a great many of these tank vessel be of great length and slow speed and present the easiest of target to the torpedo attack of a submerged submarine so many vessel be sink that we reserve of oil fuel become perilously low instead of a reserve of some five or six month we be gradually reduce to one of about eight week and in order to economize expenditure of fuel it actually become necessary at one time to issue direction that the speed of oil-burning warship be to be limit except in case of the greatest urgency such a order in war be a matter of much gravity the great majority of we light cruiser and destroyer be fit to burn oil fuel only as well as we latest and most powerful battleship the crisis be eventually overcome by draw upon every source -lrb- include the grand fleet -rrb- for destroyer to escort the tanker through the submarine danger area and by the assistance give we by the ministry of shipping in bring supplies of oil fuel to this country in the double bottom of merchant ship by the end of 1917 the situation have greatly improve the loss of shipping during 1917 be particularly heavy in the mediterranean apart from the fact that the narrow water of that sea render difficult a policy of evasion on the part of merchant shipping and give great advantage to the submarine it be think that the heavy loss in the early part of the year be partly due to the method of routee the ship then in force and in reply to representation make to the french admiralty this system be alter by the french commander-in-chief it should be note that the mediterranean outside the adriatic be under french naval control in accordance with the agreement enter into with france and italy the cordial co-operation of the french admiralty with we and the manner in which we proposal be meet form very pleasant memory of my term of office at the admiralty during the greater part of the year 1917 admiral lacaze be minister of marine whilst admiral de bon hold office as chief of the naval staff during the whole year nothing could exceed the courtesy extend to I by these distinguish officer for whom i conceive great admiration and respect the result of the altered arrangement be a decide but temporary improvement and the loss again become serious during the summer month i then deem it desirable that the control of the traffic should be place in the hand of officer station at malta this be a central position from which any necessary change in the arrangement could be make more rapidly and with greater facility than by the french commander-in-chief who be also control fleet movement and who for this reason alone be not in a position to act quickly a unify command in the mediterranean would undoubtedly have be the most satisfactory and efficient system to adopt but the time be not ripe for propose that solution in 1917 and the alternative be adopt of british control of the traffic route throughout the whole mediterranean sea subject to the general charge of the french commander-in-chief which be necessary in such a eventuality arise as a attempt break out of the austrian fleet accordingly with the consent of the french and italian admiralty vice-admiral the hon sir somerset gough-calthorpe kcb be dispatch to the mediterranean as british commander-in-chief he be in control generally of all british naval force in the mediterranean and especially in charge of all the arrangement for the protection of trade and for anti-submarine operation the patrol vessel of all the nationality concern be place under he immediate order for the purpose whilst the whole of the mediterranean remain under the general control of vice-admiral gauchet the french commander-in-chief admiral calthorpe be assist by french and italian officer and the japanese government which have previously dispatch twelve destroyer to the mediterranean to assist in the protection of trade also give to admiral calthorpe the control of these vessel in the request which we address to the japanese admiralty i always receive great assistance from admiral funakoshus the naval attaché in london he co-operation be of a close and most cordial nature the service of the japanese destroyer in the mediterranean be of considerable value to the ally cause a striking instance of the seamanlike and gallant conduct of they officer and man be furnish on the occasion of the torpedoing of a british transport by a enemy submarine off the coast of italy when by the work of the japanese escort destroyer the great majority of those on board be save admiral calthorpe on leave england be charge with the duty of organize convoy in the mediterranean on the line of those already in force in other water as soon as the necessary vessel be available and a conference of ally officer sit at malta soon after he arrival when a definite scheme of convoy be prepare there have always however be a great scarcity of fast patrol vessel in the mediterranean for this work divide control of the force in that area be partly responsible for this the austrian destroyer be consider by the italian admiralty to be so serious a menace in the adriatic as to render it necessary to keep in that sea the great majority of the italian destroyer as well as several french vessel of this class the situation at the eastern end of the mediterranean necessitate a force of some eight british destroyer be keep in the aegean sea to deal with any turkish vessel that might attempt to force the blockade of the dardanelle whilst operation on the syrian coast engage the service of some french and british destroyer continual troop movement in the mediterranean also absorb the sendee of a considerable number of vessel of this type consequently there be a great shortage of fast small craft for escort and mercantile convoy work it be estimate that the escort force require for the protection of a complete system of convoy in the mediterranean be approximately 290 vessel the total number available be about 215 in spite then of the success of admiral calthorpe 's work the result be that convoy be not start in the mediterranean until October and they be then but inadequately protect and loss be heavy both from this cause and from the fact already mention -- that the mediterranean be a sea which by reason of its confine nature be particularly suit for operation by submarine against trade its narrowness at various point such as the strait of gibraltar the malta channel the strait of messina and the passage to the ægean cause such convergence of trade as to make it a very simple matter for a submarine to operate with success evasion by change of route be almost impossible operation design to prevent the exit of submarine from the adriatic be difficult because the depth of water in the strait of otranto militate against the adoption of effective mining and the lay of a effective net barrage for the above reason the admiralty be always very averse to the send of a large volume of we far eastern trade through the mediterranean and strongly urge the cape route instead but the shortage of shipping combine with the increase length of the cape route influence the ministry of ship to press strongly for the mediterranean as oppose to the other route a through convoy from england to port say be start in October and by the end of November two ship have be sink out of the thirty-five that have be under convoy the return convoy port say to england be only start in December the loss of british merchant steamship per quarter in the mediterranean during 1917 be show below : quarter end June 30 69 September 30 29 October and November 28 it be impossible to close this chapter describe the convoy without mention be make of the fine work accomplish by those upon whose shoulder fall the task of organize and work the whole system i can not hope that i have succeed in convey to reader of this volume a adequate conception of the great and marvellously successful performance that it be or a full appreciation of what immense difficulty the staff have to contend with they be very completely realize by I who see they appear day by day and disappear under treatment the head of the organization be of course rear-admiral al duff the member of the board and staff immediately responsible also for the whole anti-submarine organization only those who witness admiral duff 's work at the admiralty during 1917 can realize the immense debt that the country owe to he untiring ability patience energy and resource capt hg henderson who have be associate with the convoy system from its start be a invaluable assistant as also be commander iw carrington capt richard webb the director of the trade division and capt frederic a whitehead the director of the mercantile movement division take a important share in the work of organization whilst the work of convoy manager be carry through with quite exceptional skill by paymaster-commander hwe manisty these officer be assist by most capable staff and the ministry of shipping without whose assistance the work could not possibly have be successfully carry out co-operate most cordially chapter vi the entry of the united state we naval policy explain the entry of the united state of america into the war in April 1917 have a important although not a immediate effect upon we naval policy that the effect be not immediate be due to the fact that the united state navy be at the time indifferently provide with the particular class of vessel which be so greatly need for submarine warfare viz destroyer and other small surface craft submarine and light cruiser further the united state mercantile fleet do not include any considerable number of small craft which could be usefully employ for patrol and escort duty the armed force of the united state of america be also poorly equip with aircraft and have none available for naval work accord to we knowledge at the time the united state navy in April 1917 possess twenty-three large and about twenty-four small destroyer some of which be unfit to cross the atlantic there be about twelve submarine capable of work overseas but not well suit for anti-submarine work and only three light cruiser of the chester class on the other hand about seven armored cruiser be available in atlantic water for convoy duty and the navy include a fine force of battleship of which fourteen be in full commission in April at first therefore it be clear that the assistance which could be give to the ally navy would be but slight even if all available destroyer be send to european water this be presumably well know to the member of the german naval staff and possibly explain they view that the entry of the united state of america would be of little help to the ally cause the german do not however make sufficient allowance for the productive power of the united state and perhaps also it be think in germany that public opinion in the united state would not allow the navy department to send over to european water such destroyer and other vessel of value in anti-submarine warfare as be available at once or would be available as time progress the german staff may have have in mind the situation during the spanish-american war when the fact of admiral cervera 's weak and inefficient squadron be at large be sufficient to affect adversely the naval strategy of the united state to a considerable extent and to paralyze the work of the united state navy in a offensive direction very fortunately for the ally cause a most distinguished officer of the united state navy vice-admiral w sim come to this country to report on the situation and to command such force as be send to european water admiral sim in he earlier career before reach the flag list be a gunnery officer of the very first rank he have assimilate the idea of sir percy scott of we own navy who have revolutionize british naval gunnery and he have succeed in he position as inspector of target practice in the united state navy in produce a very marked increase in gunnery efficiency later when in command first of a battleship then of the destroyer flotilla and finally as head of the united state naval war college he close study of naval strategy and tactic have peculiarly fitted he for the important post for which he be select and he not only hold the soundest view on such subject himself but be able by dint of the tact and persuasive eloquence that have carry he successfully through he gunnery difficulty to impress he view on other admiral sim from the first moment of he arrival in this country be in the closest touch with the admiralty in general and with myself in particular he earliest question to I be as to the direction in which the united state navy could afford assistance to the ally cause my reply be that the first essential be the dispatch to european water of every available destroyer trawler yacht tug and other small craft of sufficient speed to deal with submarine other vessel of these class follow as fast as they could be produce further that submarine and light cruiser would also be of great value as they become available admiral sim respond wholeheartedly to my request he urge the navy department with all he force to send these vessel and send they quickly he frequently telegraph to the united state figure show the tonnage of merchant ship be sink week by week in order to impress on the navy department and government the great urgency of the situation i furnish he with figure which even we ourselves be not publish as i feel that nothing but the knowledge give by these figure could impress those who be remove by 3000 mile of sea from the scene of a naval war unique in many of its feature meanwhile the british naval commander-in-chief in north american water vice-admiral sir montague browning have be direct to confer with the united state navy department and to point out we immediate requirement and explain the general situation on April 6 the united state declare war on germany on April 13 we receive information from washington that the navy department be arrange to co-operate with we force for the protection of trade in the west atlantic should any enemy raider escape from the north sea that six united state destroyer would be send to european water in the immediate future and that the united state would undertake the protection of trade on the west coast of canada and north america as well as in the gulf of mexico it be further indicate that the number of united state destroyer for european water would be increase at a early date the vital importance of this latter step be be constantly urge by admiral sim when mr balfor 's mission leave for the united state in April rear-admiral sir dudley de chair the naval representative on the mission be request to do all in he power to impress on the united state navy department the very urgent necessity that exist for the immediate provision of small craft for anti-submarine operation in european water and for the protection of trade he be inform that the position could not be consider satisfactory until the number of trawler and sloop available for patrol and escort duty be greatly increase and that a total of at least _ another hundred destroyer be require _ it be point out that difficulty might arise from the natural desire of the united state government to retain large number of small craft for the protection of shipping in the vicinity of the united state coast but it be at the same time indicate that we experience show that the number of submarine that the german could maintain on the western side of the atlantic be very small and that the real danger therefore exist in european water admiral de chair be ask amongst other matter to emphasize the assistance which unite state submarine could render on the eastern side of the atlantic where they would be able to undertake anti-submarine operation and he be also direct to endeavor to obtain assistance in the production of mine and the provision of ship for minelay work great stress be of course lay upon the very important question of a large output of merchant ship and the necessity for repair and put into service the german merchant ship intern in we port be urge direction be also give to admiral de chair to ascertain from mr schwab of the bethlehem steel company and other firm to what extent they could build for the british navy destroyer sloop trawler and submarine and the rapidity of such production the need for sloop be so great that i send a personal telegram to mr schwab whose acquaintance i have make in October 1914 on the occasion of the loss of the _ audacious _ beg he to build at once a hundred of these vessel to we order i feel certain from the experience we have gain of mr schwab 's wonderful energy and power as illustrate by the work accomplish by he in provide we in 1915 with ten submarine build in the extraordinarily short period of five month that he would produce sloop at a very rapid rate and that there would be no delay in start if he undertake the work the drawing have already be send over however he be not able to undertake the work as the we government decide that he yard would all be require for they own work this be unfortunate as i have hope that these vessel would have be build in from four to six month see that the drawing be actually ready they would have be invaluable in the latter part of 1917 whilst the mission be in the united state constant communication pass on these subject the heavy loss take place in merchant ship be state and every effort be make to impress upon the navy department the urgency of the situation the tenor of we communication will be gather from these quotation from a personal telegram send by I to admiral de chair on April 26 viz : for rear-admiral de chair from first sea lord you must emphasize most strongly to the united state authority the very serious nature of the shipping position we lose 55 british ship last week approximately 180000 ton and rate of loss be not diminish \* \* \* \* \* press most strongly that the number of destroyer send to ireland should be increase to twenty-four at once if this number be available battleship be not require but concentration on the vital question of defeat of submarine menace be essential urge on the authority that everything should give way to the submarine menace and that by far the most important place on which to concentrate patrol be the sw of ireland \* \* \* \* \* you must keep constantly before the we authority the great gravity of the situation and the need that exist for immediate action we new method will not be effective until July and the critical period be April to July it be very necessary to bring home to the united state navy department the need for early action admiral sim inform I -- as soon as he become aware of the heavy loss to merchant shipping that be take place -- that neither he nor anyone else in the united state have realize that the situation be so serious this be of course largely due to the necessity which we be under of not publish fact which would encourage the enemy or unduly depress we own people further he inform I that a idea be prevalent in the united state that the _ morale _ of the german submarine crew have be completely break by they loss in submarine this impression be the successful result of certain action on we part take with intent to discourage the enemy whatever may have be the case later in the year we have however no evidence in the spring of 1917 of deterioration of _ morale _ amongst german submarine crew nor be there any reason for such a result it be therefore necessary to be quite frank with admiral sim we know quite well that we could not expect new measure to be effective for some few month and we know also that we could not afford a continuance of the heavy rate of loss experience in April without a serious effect be produce upon we war effort we be certainly not in the state of panic which have be ascribe to we in certain quarter but we do want those who be engage in the war on the side of the ally to understand the situation in order that they might realize the value that early naval assistance would bring to the ally cause there be no doubt that great difficulty must be experience by those far remove from the theater of war in understand the condition in the war zone this be exemplify at a time when we have organize the trade in convoy and the system be show itself effective in greatly reduce loss from submarine attack we be press the united state to strengthen we escorting force as far as possible in order to extend the convoy system when a telegram arrive from washington to the effect that it be consider that ship which be arm be safer when sail singly than when in convoy it have also be state that the admiralty hold the view at this time that no solution of the problem create by the enemy 's submarine campaign be in sight this be incorrect we have confidence in the measure -- most of they dependent on the manufacture of material -- which be in course of preparation by the time the united state enter the war but we opinion be that there be no _ immediate _ solution beyond the provision of additional vessel for the protection of shipping and the reason for this view be that time be require before other measure could be put into effective operation this be evident from the final paragraph of my telegram to admiral de chair date April 26 which i have quote the first division of six united state destroyer under the command of lieut-commander tk taussig arrive in british water on may 2 and they be most welcome it be interesting to I personally that lieut-commander taussig should be in command as he when a sub-lieutenant have be wound on the same day as myself during the boxer campaign in china and we have be together for some time subsequently at about this time we advice be seek by the united state navy department as to the best type of anti-submarine craft for the united state to build on this subject a very short experience in the war theater cause admiral sim to hold precisely similar view to myself as a result of the advice tender a great building program of destroyer large submarine-hunting motor launch and other small craft be embark upon although the completion of these vessel be delay considerably beyond anticipate date they do in 1918 exercise a influence on the submarine war the german make one great mistake for which we be thankful as already mention it be anticipate that they would send submarine to work off the united state coast immediately after the declaration of war by that country indeed we be expect to hear of the presence of submarine in the west atlantic throughout the whole of 1917 they do not appear there until may 1918 the moral effect of such action in 1917 would have be very great and might possibly have lead to the retention in the united state of some of the destroyer and other small craft which be of such assistance in european water in start the convoy system admiral sim be himself i think anxious on this head when the german do move in this direction in 1918 it be too late it be by that time realize in the united state that the enemy could not maintain submarine in sufficient number in they water to exercise any decisive effect although the shipping loss might be considerable for a time and consequently no large change of policy be make as be well know admiral sim with the consent of the united state navy department place all vessel which be dispatch to british water under the british flag officer in whose command they be work this step which at once produce unity of command be typical of the manner in which the two navy under the guidance of they senior officer work together throughout the war the destroyer operate from queenstown come under admiral sir lewi bayly captain pringle the senior united state officer on the spot whose service be ever of the utmost value be appoint as chief of the staff to sir lewi bayly whilst on the occasion of sir lewi bayly at my urgent suggestion consent to take a few day ' leave in the summer of 1917 admiral sim at we request take he place at queenstown hoist he flag in command of the british and united state naval force the relation between the officer and man of the two navy in this command be of the happiest possible nature and form one of the pleasantest episode of the co-operation between the two nation the united state officer and man very quickly realize the strong personality of the commander-in-chief at queenstown and become imbue with the same feeling of great respect and admiration for he as be hold by british officer and man also he make the officer feel that admiralty house queenstown be they home when in port and see that everything possible be do for the comfort of the man the very high standard of duty set by sir lewi and very fully sustain by he be cheerfully and willingly follow by the united state force the personnel of which earn he warmest admiration i think it will be agree in year to come that the comradeship between the two navy first initiate in the queenstown command go very far towards cement the bond of union between the two great english-speaking nation this be the first step in co-operation the next be take when the united state navy department as the result of a request make by we to admiral sim send to gibraltar a detachment of three light cruiser and a number of revenue cutter as patrol and escort vessel place the whole force under the british senior naval officer at gibraltar rear-admiral heathcote grant here again the relation between the two navy be of the happiest nature finally later in the year i discuss with admiral sim the desirability of a small force of united state battleship be send to reinforce the grand fleet when the project be first mention my object in ask for the ship be that they might relieve some of we earlier dreadnought which at that time it be desire to use for another purpose i discuss the matter also with admiral mayo the commander-in-chief of the united state atlantic fleet during he visit to this country in August 1917 and with admiral benson the chief of operation in the united state navy department when he come over later in the year admiral benson give direction that four coal-burning battleship should be send over we be oblige to ask for coal-burning battleship instead of the more modern vessel with oil-fired boiler owe to the great shortage of oil fuel in this country and the danger of we reserve be still further deplete these vessel under rear-admiral hugh rodman arrive in british water early in December 1917 and form a division of the grand fleet the co-operation afloat be now complete and all that be need be further co-operation between the british admiralty and the united state navy department this have already form the subject of discussion first between admiral sim and myself and later with admiral mayo and benson during the summer of 1917 admiral sim have be invite to attend the daily meeting of the naval member of the operation side of the board a invitation which he accept and he co-operation be of great value but we both feel it desirable to go a step farther and i have suggest the extreme desirability of the united state navy department send officer of experience of different rank to work in the admiralty both on the operation and material side officer upon whom the navy department could rely to place before we the view of the department and to transmit they view of the situation as the result of they work and experience at the admiralty we have press strongly for the adoption of this course admiral benson after discussion assent to it and the officer on the material side commence work in the admiralty towards the end of 1917 whilst those on the operation side join the war staff early in 1918 it be feel that this course would complete the co-operation between the navy of the two country and further that the united state navy department would be keep in the closest possible touch with the british admiralty in all respects it be particularly to be remember that even before we have establish this close liaison the whole of the united state naval force in british water have be place under the command of british naval officer this step so conducive to good result owe to the unity of command which be thus obtain win we highest admiration show as it do a fine spirit of self-effacement on the part of the senior american naval officer the visit of admiral mayo and benson to this country be productive of very good result the exchange of information which take place be most beneficial as be the experience which the admiral gain of modern naval warfare moreover the utterly baseless suggestion which have unfortunately find expression in some organ of the press of the united state that we be not give the fullest information to the navy department be completely disprove when admiral mayo arrive in england he inform I that the main object of he visit as commander-in-chief of the atlantic fleet be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- to ascertain we present policy and plan -lrb- 2 -rrb- to inquire as to the change if any that be contemplate in the immediate or more distant future -lrb- 3 -rrb- to ascertain what further assistance it be desire that the united state should provide from resource then available or likely to be soon available and the measure that the united state should take to provide future force and material papers be prepare under my direction for admiral mayo give full information of we immediate need of past procedure and of future plan as to we need the main request be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a increase in the number of destroyer in order to enlarge the convoy system and to provide better protection for each convoy a additional 55 destroyer be state to be require for this service -lrb- 2 -rrb- a increase in the number of convoy cruiser for the same reason the total addition of cruiser or old battleship be give as 41 -lrb- 3 -rrb- a increase in the number of patrol craft tug etc for anti-submarine work -lrb- 4 -rrb- the rapid building of merchant ship -lrb- 5 -rrb- the supply of a large number of mine for the propose barrage in the north sea and assistance towards lay they by the provision of united state minelay vessel -lrb- 6 -rrb- aircraft assistance in the shape of three large seaplane station on the coast of ireland with some 36 machine at each station -lrb- 7 -rrb- the provision of four coal-burning battleship of the dreadnought type to replace grand fleet dreadnought battleship which it be desire to use for other purpose admiral mayo be inform that some 100000 mine would be require from the american for form and maintain that portion of the north sea barrage which it be suggest should be lay by they in addition to the large number that it be propose that we ourselves should lay in the barrage and that as the barrage would need patrolling by a large number of small craft great help would be afford if the united state could provide some of these vessel it be estimate at that time that the barrage would absorb the service of some 250 small vessel in order that a sufficient number might be keep constantly on patrol it may be of interest to give the history of the north sea barrage so far as i can recollect it we view on such a scheme be seek by the united state navy department in the spring of 1917 owe to various military circumstance even at that time we have no prospect of obtain mine in adequate number for such work for at least nine to twelve month nor could we provide the necessary craft to patrol the barrage we view be that such mine as become available during the last month of 1917 would be more effective if lay nearer to the german north sea naval basis and in the strait of dover than at such a distance from these basis as the suggestion involve apart from we desire to stop the submarine near they basis the pro and con of the scheme be as follow : the advantage be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- that except for the difficulty of prevent the submarine from use norwegian territorial water for egress a north sea barrage would be a menace to submarine use the kattegat exit as well as those come from north sea basis -lrb- 2 -rrb- that the enemy would be unable to sweep up the minefield owing to its distance -lrb- over 200 mile -rrb- from he basis the disadvantage be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the immense number of mine require -- some 120000 exclude reserve -- and the improbability of produce they in great britain -lrb- 2 -rrb- the great depth of water in which many of they be to be moor a depth in which no mine have ever be successfully lay before time would be require to devise arrangement that would enable the mine to be lay at such depths -lrb- 3 -rrb- the very large number of patrol craft that would be need to force submarine to dive into that portion of the minefield which be safe for surface vessel and the difficulty of maintain they at sea in bad north sea weather -lrb- 4 -rrb- the difficulty of prevent egress by the submarine in norwegian territorial water in which even if mine be lay they would have to be moor at such a depth as not to constitute a danger to vessel on the surface shortly after the subject be broach to we we learn that the united state navy have devise a mine that it be expect would be satisfactory for the purpose of the barrage a experienced mining officer be at once send over by we to inspect the mine and to give to the united state officer such assistance as be possible due to he great knowledge of mining under war condition when he arrive in the united state the mine be still in the experimental stage but later he report that it promise to be successful and in view of the great manufacturing resource in america it appear that a considerable proportion of the mine for the barrage could be provide by the united state navy we own effort to produce a mine suitable for very great depths be also prove successful and anticipation as to manufacture be optimistic accordingly plan be prepare for a barrage across the north sea which be give to admiral mayo before he leave england on he return to the united state without seriously relax we mining operation in the heligoland bight and without interfere with we mine barrage on the folkestone-grisnez line we anticipate at this time that we could provide mine for we portion of the north sea barrage by the time that the united state supply of mine be in readiness to be lay admiral mayo be also furnish with papers deal at length with we naval policy at the time and the intended future policy both in home water and abroad papers be give he relate to we air policy to the attitude of neutral country to the belgian coast problem to the blockade to the defense of trade -lrb- include one on the convoy system -rrb- to such subject as the defensive armament of merchant ship with gun smoke apparatus and mine defense gear the instruction of the personnel in they use and the system of issue route instruction to merchant ship a important statement be also supply give a detailed account of we anti-submarine policy both at the time and in the future these papers give the fullest information on the naval problem and be intend to put the united state naval department in a position to appreciate the whole position and its many embarrassment though we realize that these could be appreciate only by those who like admiral sim be in daily contact with the problem it will possibly be of further interest if mention be make of some of the point to which attention be draw admiral mayo for instance be inform that british naval policy be be direct in 1917 as during the remainder of the war to exert constant economic pressure upon the enemy with a view to force he to come to term we also endeavor to prevent the enemy from interfere with the conduct of the war by ourselves and we ally in the effective pursuit of that policy the duty of the navy involve : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the protection of the sea communication of the ally army and the protection of british and ally trade -lrb- 2 -rrb- the prevention of enemy trade in order to interfere with he military operation and to exert economic pressure -lrb- 3 -rrb- resistance to invasion and raid it be point out that the question at issue in each case be the control of sea communication and in order to attain that control permanently and completely the enemy 's naval force both above and below water have to be destroy or effectually mask as the weaker german fleet not unnaturally refuse decisive action and as its _ destruction _ have hitherto not be achieve we have adopt a policy of guard a area between we vital communication and the enemy 's port and of guard the area through which the trade and transport pass these be the only method of frustrating attack make either by surface vessel or by submarine which succeed in reach open water it be point out that a combination of these two method have be in force during the war of the eighteenth century blockade be combine with the convoy system and the patrol of local area by frigate etc history in fact be repeat itself we mention that a close blockade of the german north sea and baltic port present insuperable difficulty under the condition of modern warfare and the alternative of control the dover and norway-scotland exit to the north sea have be adopt the former protect the communication of the army in france whilst the two combined cover the maritime communication of the world outside the north sea and baltic and if they could be effectively guard we first two object would be attain so far as the dover exit be concern we state that the narrowness of the water with the consequent risk to the enemy from we mine and torpedo have so far act as a deterrent to he capital ship we have to depend on the light force at harwich and dover to deal with any enemy surface craft attack the southern area from german port we point out that the control of the norway-scotland exit depend upon the presence of the grand fleet at rosyth or at scapa this fleet ensure the safety of all the vessel engage in protect trade and in hunting submarine outside the north sea mention be make of the fact that the enemy could not open the sea route for he own war ship without risk a serious action and that so far he have show no inclination to run that risk the battle of jutland have be fight in the previous year any future movement of the high sea fleet into the north sea would probably be merely with the object of draw we capital ship into prepared area so as to bring about a process of attrition by mine and torpedo such a movement have be carry out on August 19 1916 the reason which have lead to the adoption of the orkney-faroe-iceland blockade line be also explain it be point out that in the early stage of the war the foregoing general disposition have suffice to protect the ally ' communication and to throttle those of the enemy outside the baltic although enemy cruiser in foreign water and a few raiding vessel which have evade the blockade have inflict loss on trade loss from such cause could not reach really serious proportion so long as the enemy trust to evasion and refuse to face the grand fleet the danger of serious loss from attack by raiding surface craft have also be greatly minimize by the adoption of the convoy system but as the enemy 's submarine increase in size efficiency and number the situation have be modify for evasion by submarine of the command exercise by the grand fleet be easy and we vital sea communication could be attack by they without the risk of a fleet action so far as the protection of trade be concern the effect therefore of the submarine campaign have be to remove the barrier establish by the grand fleet and to transfer operation to the focal area and approach route as the situation develop a policy of deal with the submarine by armed patrol craft and decoy ship in these area have therefore be put into force merchant ship have be arm as rapidly as possible and in addition effort have be make to intercept the submarine _ en route _ to these area both in the vicinity of german water and farther afield the great area cover by the approach route and the increase radius of submarine operation have make the provision of a sufficient number of patrol vessel a practical impossibility and have lead to a general adoption of the convoy system as rapidly as the supply of fast small craft make this possible the method of attack german submarine before they could reach open water by extensive mining in the heligoland bight with the exception of dutch and danish territorial water be also mention as regard _ future _ naval policy it be point out that the enemy submarine campaign be the dominate factor to such a extent that any sustained increase in the then rate of sink merchant ship might eventually prove disastrous mention be make of the fact that the enemy be still produce submarine faster than the ally be destroy they the policy of cope with submarine after they reach the open sea have not as yet be sufficiently effective to balance construction against loss even in combination with the extensive minefield lay in the heligoland bight the future policy be therefore be direct towards a attempt at a still more concentrated and effective control in the area between the enemy 's port and we trade route and it be propose to form some description of block or barrage through which the enemy submarine would not be able to pass without considerable risk four form have be consider : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a method of block either mechanically or by mine all the exit of the submarine from they north sea or baltic basis -lrb- 2 -rrb- a barrage of mine at different depths from near the surface of the sea to near the bottom -lrb- 3 -rrb- a combination of deep mine with a patrolling force of surface craft and aircraft whose object would be to force the submarine under the surface into the minefield -lrb- 4 -rrb- a force of surface craft and aircraft patrolling a area of sufficient extent to prevent submarine come to the surface to recharge they battery during the hour of darkness admiral mayo be inform that in we opinion the first scheme as give above viz _ that of absolutely seal the exit be the only radical cure for the evil _ but that there be very great difficulty to be overcome before such a operation could be successfully carry out he be show the plan that have be prepare for a mechanical block of all the enemy north sea basis and he entirely concur in the impracticability of carry it out such a plan have be advocate by some officer and by other people it be of course most attractive in theory and appeal strongly to those who look at the question superficially when however a definite operation come to be work out in detail the difficulty become very apparent and even enthusiastic supporter of the _ idea _ be force to change they view it be not a matter for surprise to I that the idea of seal the exit from submarine basis be urge by so many people on both side of the atlantic it be of course the obvious counter to the submarine campaign and it appeal with force to that considerable section which feel vaguely and rightly that _ offensive _ action be need without be quite so clear as to the means by which it be to be carry out in this particular case i inform the clever and able officer to whom the planning of the operation be entrust that they be to proceed on the assumption that we intend to seal the enemy 's port somehow and that they be to devise the best possible scheme draw up all the necessary order for the operation this be do in the most complete detail and with great care and ingenuity but at the end there be no difference of opinion whatever as to the inadvisability of proceed with the operation it be to be observe in connexion with this question that seal the north sea basis would not have be a complete cure since submarine could still make they exit via the kattegat where we could not block channel without violate the neutrality of other nation the final conclusion arrive at _ be to use a combination of the last three alternative _ provide that _ a satisfactory type of mine _ could be produce in sufficient number and a sufficient supply of small craft provide by ourselves and the united state full detail be give to admiral mayo of the propose north sea barrage on a line total 230 mile in length which be divide into three part area a b and c of which area a only would be dangerous to surface vessel it be estimate that area a would require 36300 mine and it be propose that this area should be mine by the united state force with united state mine it be propose that the british should mine area b the requirement be 67500 mine and that the united state should mine area c for which 18000 united state mine would be require the reason govern the selection of the mine barrage area be fully give and the advantage arise from the use of the united state pattern of mine instead of the british mine for area a and c be state admiral mayo be also inform of we intention to establish a mine barrage in the channel on the folkestone-grisnez line as soon as mine be available with a strong force of patrol vessel station there whose duty it would be to compel enemy submarine to dive into the minefield he be further make acquaint with we intended policy of still closer minelaying in the heligoland bight although admiral mayo be not actually inform of the detail of the future policy which it be hope to adopt in the adriatic for the improvement of the otranto barrage various scheme be at the time be work out between the british french and italian admiralty have as they object the prevention or obstruction of the exit of enemy submarine from the adriatic in the same way as it be hope to obstruct german submarine from make they exit from the north sea without incur heavy loss the great depth of water in the southern part of the adriatic constitute the main difficulty face we in the solution of this problem in August 1917 it be however definitely decide to establish a barrage of net and mine across the strait of otranto and the work be put in hand this become effective during 1918 the paper on naval air policy show the aim of the admiralty to be : to provide in sufficient number a type of airship which would be able to scout with the grand fleet and in this respect to perform the duty of light cruiser airship station have be establish on the east coast for this purpose to provide also a type of airship for coastal patrol work and for the escort of merchant ship in convoy for these airship station have be establish on the east south and west coast and at scapa to provide a sufficient supply of kite balloon for the work of the grand fleet fleet kite balloon station have already be establish at rosyth and scapa and the resource of the latter station be supplement by a kite balloon ship it be intend also to provide kite balloon for flotilla or single vessel engage in submarine hunting or in convoy work a large number of kite balloon station for anti-submarine work have be or be be establish round the coast for this work as to the future program of rigid airship admiral mayo be tell that it be under consideration to construct three new rigid station also that three new station for the use of non-rigid for anti-submarine work be to be establish while it be also propose to provide sufficient resource to allow of a number of kite balloon be work in vessel between the north of scotland and norway and to the eastward of the english channel admiral mayo be also inform that it be propose to provide sufficient heavier than air craft of various type for the fleet both to insure adequate air reconnaissance and to drive off hostile aircraft the grand fleet be at the time already provide with three seaplane carrier and the _ furious _ and other special vessel be be fit to carry aircraft many of the armored vessel and light cruiser of the fleet have also be fit to carry aircraft whilst the harwich light cruiser force possess one seaplane carrier two carrier be devote to anti-submarine work and three be employ in the mediterranean it be further state that machine for naval reconnaissance be work from several east coast station and that lighter to carry seaplane for more extended reconnaissance and offensive work be under construction the work carry out by we naval aircraft off the belgian coast comprise the duty of keep the coast under constant observation of spot the gunfire of ship of fight aircraft and bombing objective of importance be also mention as well as the work in the mediterranean where there be four basis in the aegean the extensive anti-submarine patrol work round the british isle and in the mediterranean be touch upon there be heavier than air station at the time at houton bay dundee south shield bembridge calshot portland killingholme yarmouth felixstowe westgate dover newhaven cherbourg plymouth newlyn scilly fishguard step be be take to extend the number of station as soon as possible the new program include station at such place as padstow wexford queenstown berehaven loch foyle loch ryan -lrb- or in the hebride -rrb- shetland peterhead in the event of the united state be in a position to co-operate in the work it be recommend that the three main seaplane station in ireland should be take over by the american and equip manned and controlled entirely by united state personnel in regard to the convoy system a full description of the whole organization be give with the result up to date and detail of the vessel available and still need for its protection full information be afford on the subject of the arming of merchant ship and fitting other defensive measure to they and the routeing system in use for merchant ship be describe in detail in the remark on we anti-submarine warfare it be point out that anti-submarine measure be carry out both on the surface under water and in the air the surface measure be describe as follow : in twelve of the twenty-two area into which the water round the unite kingdom be divide regular _ hunting flotilla _ be at work comprise trawler and motor launch fit with hydrophone before the institution of the convoy system a few fast vessel such as destroyer or p boat have be form into hunting flotilla but the convoy work have necessitate the withdrawal of all these vessel and the work of the flotilla have suffer in consequence the speed of trawler be too slow to offer the same prospect of success in such anti-submarine measure the flotilla of motor launch which have be form be of considerable utility in fine weather but they could only operate in comparatively smooth water at the time of admiral mayo 's visit a force of thirty-two trawler to work with about six sloop or destroyer be be organize as vessel become available to operate in the north sea with a view to engage enemy submarine on passage in those water it be also point out to admiral mayo that the coast patrol vessel which be not actually in the hunting flotilla be all engage in anti-submarine work and do frequently come into action against the german submarine finally admiral mayo be inform that the convoy system itself be look upon as a offensive measure since the german submarine would in order to attack vessel under convoy be force into contact with the fast craft engage in the work of escort and thus place themselves in position in which they could themselves be successfully attack admiral mayo during he stay in european water inspect some of we naval basis and pay a visit to the grand fleet he cross to france in order that he might see the work be carry out at french port by vessel of the united state navy and while return from this visit he honor the british navy by accompany sir reginald bacon and myself in hm _ break _ to witness a bombardment of ostend by the monitor _ terror _ on this occasion admiral mayo 's flag be hoist in the _ break _ and subsequently present to he as a souvenir of the first occasion of a united state admiral have be under fire in a british man-of-war it be satisfactory to record that subsequent aerial photograph show that much damage to workshop etc have be cause by this bombardment the admiral and he staff very quickly establish themselves in the high regard of british naval officer and it be with much regret that we witness they return to the united state my own association with the admiral have lead to a feeling of great friendship he leave behind he he chief of staff captain jackson who to we great regret have be seriously injure in a motor accident admiral benson 's visit take place later in the year i have write to he urge he to come across so that he might have first-hand knowledge of the state of affair and of the policy be follow during he visit the same question be discuss as with admiral mayo and important action be take in the direction of closer naval co-operation between the ally by the formation of a ally naval council consist of the minister of marine and the chief of the naval staff of the ally nation and of the united state this proposal have be under discussion for some little time and indeed naval _ conference _ have be hold on previous occasion the first of these during my tenure of office at the admiralty be on January 23 and 24 1917 and another be hold during the visit of admiral mayo and at the instigation of the government of the united state on September 4 and 5 1917 on this latter occasion important discussion have take place principally on the subject of submarine warfare the method of deal with it in home water and in the mediterranean and such matter as the provision of mercantile shipping for the use of we ally there be however no regular council sit at specify interval and it be this council which come into be in the early part of December its function be to watch over the general conduct of the naval war and to insure co-ordination of the effort at sea as well as the development of all scientific operation connect with the conduct of the war special emphasis be lay upon the fact that the individual responsibility of the respective chief of the naval staff and of the commanders-in-chief at sea towards they government as regard operation in hand as well as the strategical and technical disposition of the force place under they command remain unchanged this proviso be a necessity in naval warfare and be very strongly insist upon by the admiralty the attention of the council be direct at the earliest meeting to the situation in the mediterranean where naval force from the british empire france greece italy japan and the united state be work and where the need for close co-operation be most urgent the real need in the mediterranean as be frequently point out be the inclusion of the naval force of all the ally nation under one single command in 1918 strong effort be make to carry out this policy and indeed the actual admiralissimo be select but the attempt fail in the end both these distinguish american officer be remind as indeed they must have see for themselves that the successful combate of the submarine danger depend largely on the manufacture of material and that the resource of this country with its great fleet and its large and increase army be so seriously tax that the execution of the plan of the admiralty be be constantly and gravely delay the admiralty be indeed seriously embarrassed by difficulty in the adequate supply of mine and other means of destroy submarine as well as of fast craft of various description the admiralty as be point out be do not what they would like to do but what they could do both in the way of offensive and defensive action the supplies of raw material and labor control in large measure the character and extent of the operation at sea chapter vii patrol craft and minesweeping service it be difficult to give a idea of the truly magnificent work achieve by the patrol and minesweeping service during the year 1917 without show how these service expand after the outbreak of war in 1914 when war be declare the only vessel immediately available for the work consist of seven torpedo gunboat man by officer and man of the royal navy and fourteen trawler man by fisherman all these vessel be fit for regular minesweeping work and the crew of the trawler form a part of what be know as the trawler reserve other trawler exceed eighty in number become however almost immediately available at the outbreak of war under the organize trawler reserve which have be set up a year or two precede the outbreak of war man belong to this reserve have be train in the work of minesweeping and be pay a small retain fee as soon as the german method of indiscriminate minelaying and submarine attack upon merchant ship commence a great expansion of this force become necessary the matter be handle energetically by the admiralty at the time and by the end of 1914 over 700 vessel -lrb- yacht trawler and drifter -rrb- be employ on patrol and minesweeping duty and the admiralty have also commence to build vessel of the trawler type specially for this work by the commencement of 1917 there be in use some 2500 yacht trawler and drifter the great majority of they man by fisherman or man of the rnr or rnvr and officer by trawler or drifter skipper or officer of the rnr or rnvr many of they have temporary commission in these service early in the war the coast of the unite kingdom have be divide into area for purpose of patrol and minesweeping and each area be under the command of a naval officer on either the active or retired list the chart d show the respective area at one period no very important change take place in the delimitation of the area during the war and the chart may therefore be consider generally representative of the organization chart e show the zone into which the mediterranean be divide -lrb-

of the stationary boom defense vessel be at this time 3084 of this number 473 be in the mediterranean 824 be in the english channel between the nore and falmouth 557 be in irish water or on the west coast of england and the remain 1230 be on the east coast of england and the east and west coast of scotland and the orkney and shetland the work of these vessel be almost entirely of a anti-submarine or minesweeping nature the trawler be engage in patrol duty convoy escort service and minesweep the drifter work drift net fit with mine as a anti-submarine weapon and also in the case of the dover area they lay and keep efficient a barrage of mine net off the belgian coast some be also fit with hydrophone and form hunting flotilla and some be engage in minesweep duty or in patrolling sweep channel at fleet basis a small number be require to attend on the ship of the fleet and to assist in the work of the base the whaler be faster vessel than the trawler be mostly engage on escort duty or on patrol the motor launch be employ for anti-submarine work fit with hydrophone and work in company with drifter and torpedo-boat destroyer or in minesweeping in area in which they light draught render it advantageous and safer to employ they instead of heavier draught vessel to locate minefield and in the dover area they be largely use to work smoke screen for operation on the belgian coast as the convoy system become more general so the work of the small craft in certain area alter from patrol and escort work to convoy duty these area be those on the east coast and north-west of scotland through which the scandinavian and east coast trade pass and those in the channel frequent by the vessel employ in the french coal trade the majority of these ship be of comparatively slow speed and trawler possess sufficient speed to accompany they but a few destroyer of the older type form a part of the escort force both for the purpose of protection and also for offensive action against submarine attack the convoy the slow speed of trawler handicap they greatly in this respect the difficulty of deal with submarine may be gauge by the enormous number of small craft thus employ but a consideration of the characteristic of a submarine and of the great volume of traffic pass up and down we coast will assist in a realization of the varied and difficult problem set to the british navy for instance the total number of vessel pass lowestoft during the month of April 1917 be 1837 british and ally and 208 neutral give a _ daily _ average of 62 british and ally and 7 neutral ship and as admiral sir reginald bacon have mention in he book the dover patrol 1915-17 -lrb- page 51 -rrb- a average of between 80 to 100 merchant vessel pass dover daily during 1917 a study of these figure give some idea of the number of target offer daily to ordinary submarine and minelay submarine in two of the area off we coast when it be bear in mind that the german have similar chance of inflict heavy loss on we mercantile marine all round the coast of the unite kingdom and that it be obviously impossible to tell where a underwater attack would take place it will be realize that once submarine reach we coast nothing short of a immense number of small craft could deal satisfactorily with the situation and afford any degree of protection to trade minelay by submarine be a particularly difficult problem with which to deal the enemy frequently change he method and such change when discover involve alteration in we own procedure thus for some time after the commencement of minelaying by submarine the whole of the mine of one submarine would be lay in a comparatively small area it be fairly easy to deal with this method as a dangerous area be proclaimed round the spot where a mine be discover and experience soon show the necessary extent of area to proclaim later the submarine lay mine in group of about six this necessitate the proclamation of more than one area and be naturally a more difficult problem at a further stage the submarine scatter they mine in even smaller number and the task of ensure a safe channel be still further increase the most difficult artifice to deal with however be the introduction by the german of a delay action device in they mine which cause they to remain at the bottom for vary period after be lay the ordinary mine-sweep the function of which be to catch the mooring rope of the mine and drag the mine clear of the channel be of course ineffective against the mine on the bottom and there be no guarantee that mine might not be release from the bottom and rise to a depth at which they be dangerous _ after the channel have be sweep and report clear _ to deal with this danger a chain-sweep to work on the bottom be introduce but its use present many difficulty especially over a rocky bottom when a regular sweep and buoy channel be in use the enemy have little difficulty in decide on the position in which to lay mine by reason of the presence of the buoy this fact constitute the principal disadvantage in the use of a buoy channel but in certain place where the traffic be heavy the procedure be inevitable and it greatly simplify the work of the patrol craft and minesweeper the only precaution possible lay in the use of alternative marked channel and in the lay of defensive deep minefield outside the channel in which enemy submarine might compass they own destruction as rapidly as we supply of mine admit this latter device be adopt in position where the minefield could not constitute a danger to we own submarine false buoy channel with mine area round they could also be lay in which to catch the submarine another device be that of alter the position of light vessel and buoy with the object of put a submarine on to a shoal the situation with which we patrol and minesweep craft have to deal have now be state it remain to speak of the magnificent manner in which they accomplish they task i regret very deeply that in spite of a strong desire to undertake the task i have neither the information nor the literary ability to do justice to the many deed of individual gallantry self-sacrifice and resource perform by the splendid officer and man who man the small craft no word of mine can adequately convey the intense admiration which i feel and which i know be share by the whole navy for the manner in which they arduous and perilous work be carry out these fine seaman though quite strange to the hazardous work which they be call upon to undertake quickly accustom themselves to they new duty and the nation should ever be full of gratitude that it breed such a race of hardy skilful and courageous man as those who take so great a part in defeat the greatest menace with which the empire have ever be face there be however just two case in 1917 typical of many other which i can not forbear from mention the first occur off the east coast of england on August 15 the armed fishing craft _ nelson _ and _ ethel and millie _ be attack by gunfire by a german submarine on the surface at a range of four to five mile the submarine first concentrate she fire on the _ nelson _ which immediately slip she trawl and go to action station the third shot from the submarine pierce the trawler 's bow and have establish the range the submarine pour a well-directed fire into the _ nelson _ under which she rapidly begin to settle down the seventh shot strike the skipper thoma crisp dsc rnr take off both he leg and partly disembowel he in spite of the terrible nature of he injury he retain consciousness and give instruction to the mate who be he son to send a message by carrier pigeon to the senior officer of he base report that he be engage with the enemy he then bid he fight to the last the _ nelson _ arm with one small gun reply to the enemy 's fire until the heavy heel which she have assume make it impossible to bring the gun to bear as she be then on the point of sink the mate decide to abandon she and take to the boat and beg he father to give they leave to carry he this however the old man sternly refuse to do and order he son to throw he overboard the nature of he wound be such that he would have die if he have be move they deem it best after consultation to leave he where he lay accordingly yield to he reiterate order to abandon the ship they leave this most gallant seaman lie in he blood and embark in the boat as the _ nelson _ sink the submarine in the meanwhile concentrate she fire on the _ ethel and millie _ and have eventually sink she make the survivor of the crew prisoner and steam away the crew of the _ nelson _ be rescue by a man-of-war after be in they boat for forty-four hour the second case occur in the adriatic on the night in question we drifter patrol in the strait of otranto be attack by a force of austrian light cruiser the drifter be each arm with a 3-pounder gun and the light cruiser with 4-inch and 6-inch gun the drifter be of course quite unable to defend themselves nevertheless the indomitable skipper i watt of the drifter _ gowan lea _ when summon to surrender by a austrian light cruiser which be firing at he craft shout defiance wave he hat to he man and order they to open fire with the 3-pounder gun he order be obey and surprising to relate the light cruiser sheer off and this fine seaman with he gallant ship 's company bring the _ gowan lea _ into port in safety admiral sir reginald bacon in he most interesting narrative of the work of the dover patrol have bring to light many individual instance of work gallantly perform it be much to be hope that before recollection fade those who can speak of the action of individual in other area will tell they countryman something of the great deed perform a feature of the patrol service of much interest be the manner in which a large number of retired officer include many of flag rank -- who have reach mature age -- volunteer for service in the yacht and other small craft engage in the work the late admiral sir alfr paget be one of the first if not the first to come forward and in order to avoid any difficulty in the matter of rank this fine veteran propose to sink he naval status and to accept a commission as captain of the royal naval reserve sir alfr in common with many other officer who take up this work be over sixty but age do not deter these gallant seaman from face the hardship and discomfort of service in small craft in the north sea and elsewhere to name all the officer who undertake this duty or who be in charge of patrol area would be impossible and it may seem invidious to mention name at all but i can not forbear to speak of some of those with whom i come most frequently into contact during 1917 sir jame startin kcb who be the life and soul of the patrol and minesweeper work from granton be frequently at sea in decoy ship fit out there as well as in minesweeper etc and together with he son win the albert medal for save life during the war admiral jl marx cb dso serve also in a decoy ship admiral john denison dso be in charge first at falmouth and later at kingstown admiral tp walker dso have he yacht sink under he admiral sir charle dare kcmg cb win great distinction in command of the patrol etc work from milford haven and rear-admiral ch simpson 's peterhead trawler splendidly man take a heavy toll of enemy submarine a large number of retired naval officer below the rank of admiral serve in minesweeper and patrol craft and in command of various area and they work be of the greatest possible value a few of those with whom i come into personal contact during the year 1917 be the late captain f bird cmg dso who be most conspicuous in command of the drifter of the dover patrol captain w vansittart howard dso who command the dover trawler patrol with such ability commander sir george armstrong bart who so successfully inspire the minesweep force work from havre and commander hf cayley dso whose service in the harwich minesweep force work under he brother rear-admiral cg cayley be invaluable so much for the patrol craft the great work carry out by the minesweeper can be best judge by quote a few figure for 1917 during which year the mine menace attain its maximum intensity owe to the large increase in the number of german submarine minelayer during the year 1916 the average number of mine sweep up per month be 178 statistics for 1917 show the follow number of mine sweep up per month : January 250 February 380 march 473 April 515 may 360 June 470 July 404 August 352 September 418 October 237 November 184 December 188 make the average per month in 1917 355 mine it will be notice how rapidly the figure rise in the early part of the year and how great be the diminution in the figure for the later month this decrease be due to the fact that the extension of anti-submarine measure be begin to take effect and the destruction of german submarine and especially of submarine minelayer of the uc type be become considerable the heavy work involve a great strain on the minesweep service and the greatest possible credit be due to the personnel of that service for the fine response make to the call for additional exertion and heavier risk at the same time the organize work achieve at headquarters by the minesweep section of the naval staff should not be forget at the head of this section be captain lionel g preston cb he have succeed to the post of head of the minesweep service early in 1917 after two and a half year of strenuous and most successful minesweeping work in the grand fleet flotilla and he at once grapple with the task of deal with the large number of mine then be lay by german submarine instruction be issue to fit all patrol craft round the coast for minesweep work in addition to they patrol duty and they be use for sweeping as require many drifter be also fit for minesweep in addition to the trawler hitherto employ and although there be some prejudice against these vessel on account of they slower speed they prove to be of great assistance every available small craft that could be fit for the work be press into the service include a considerable number of motor launch there be unfortunately great delay in the building of the hunt class of minesweeper which be the type order in 1916 and repeat in 1917 and in spite of very large additional order for this class of vessel have be place early in 1917 -lrb- a total of 100 extra vessel be order -rrb- the number complete during that year be only sixteen together with a single paddle sweeper consequently we be dependent for the largely increase work on improvise craft and the very greatest credit be due to all who be concern in this arduous and dangerous duty that the water be keep comparatively clear of mine and that we loss from this cause be so small when the immense number of mine sweep up be consider fortunately the enemy lose very heavily in submarine of the uc or minelaying type largely because they be work of necessity in water near we coast so that we anti-submarine measure have a better chance since they be easier to locate and destroy than submarine work farther afield by the commencement of 1918 the average number of mine sweep up monthly show a very remarkable decrease the average for the first two month of that year be only 159 per month eloquent testimony to the efficiency of the anti-submarine measure in operation during 1917 i have no information as to the figure for the remain month of 1918 the record of minesweeping work would not be complete without figure show the damage cause by mine to minesweep vessel during the last six month of 1916 the average number of these craft sink or damage by mine _ per month _ be 57 while for the first six month of 1917 the figure rise to ten per month for the second six month of 1917 the figure fall to four per month a reduction even on the loss towards the end of 1916 in spite of the fact that more mine be be deal with this reduction may have be due to improvement effect in organization as the result of experience similarly the total number of merchant ship sink or damage by mine which during the first six month of 1917 total 90 drop in the second six month to 49 by far the greater proportion of mine sweep up be lay in area 10 -- ie the nore harwich and lowestoft area this part of the coast be nearest to the german submarine base at zeebrugge and as the greater part of the east coast traffic pass through the area it naturally come in for a great deal of minelay attention out of some 2400 mine sweep up in the first half of 1917 over 800 come from area 10 alone the greatest number of casualty to merchant ship from mine during this same period also occur in area 10 which in this respect be however rival by area 8 -- the tyne many ship also strike mine in area 11 and 12 in the english channel and in both of these area a considerable number of mine be sweep up in addition to the daily risk of be themselves blow up which be run by the vessel engage in this work many very gallant deed be perform by individual officer and man of the minesweep force who be one and all imbue with the idea that they first duty be to keep a clear channel for traffic regardless of the consequence to themselves i must leave to abler pen than mine the task of recording in fitting phrase some of the courageous action of we small craft which will be look upon as amongst the most glorious episode of the naval part of the great war and content myself to mention only one case that of the trawler _ grand duke _ work in the milford area in may 1917 in this instance a flotilla of minesweeper be employ in sweeping when two mine explode in the sweep tow by the second pair of minesweep trawler in the flotilla the wire part and one of the two trawler proceed to heave in the kite the contrivance employ to keep the sweep at the require depth when hove short up it be discover that a mine be foul of the wire and that it have be haul up against the ship 's side just beneath the surface the circular outline of a second mine could also be detect entangled in the wire and swirl round in the current beneath the trawler 's counter in the circumstance since any roll of the ship might suffice to strike one of the horn of either mine and detonate the charge the officer in charge of the trawler choose the best course open to he in view of he responsibility for the life of those under he command and order the trawler to be abandon the senior officer of the division of minesweeper thereupon call for a volunteer and accompany by the engineman board the abandon trawler and disregard the imminent probability of a explosion cause by the contact of the ship and the mine cut the sweep and kite wire the mine fall clear without detonate and by means of a rope pass to another trawler they be tow clear of the spot it be appropriate to close this chapter by give a synopsis of the loss amongst we patrol escort and minesweeping vessel between the commencement of the war and the end of 1917 due -lrb- 1 -rrb- to enemy action and -lrb- 2 -rrb- to the increase navigational danger incidental to service afloat under war condition under the first head -- enemy action -- the loss be 8 yacht 6 motor launch 3 motor boat 150 trawler 59 drifter and 10 paddle minesweeper and the loss due to navigational risk be 5 yacht 55 trawler 7 motor launch 3 motor boat 30 drifter and 1 paddle minesweeper whilst the total loss of life be 197 officer and 1782 man chapter viii the dover patrol and the harwich force vice-admiral sir reginald bacon have give -lrb- the dover patrol 1915-1917 hutchinson & co 1919 -rrb- a most valuable record of the varied work carry out in the strait of dover and on the belgian coast during the period of he command there be little to be add to this great record but it may be of interest to mention the general admiralty policy which govern the naval operation in southern water during the year 1917 and the method by which that policy be carry out the policy which be adopt in southern water and especially in the strait of dover be that so far as the means at we disposal admit the strait should be render impassable for enemy ship of all kind from battleship to submarine with a view to protect the cross-channel communication of we army in france of afford protection to trade in the channel and prevent a military landing by the german either in the south of england or on the left flank of the ally army in france so long as the belgian coast port remain in german possession the naval force that could be base there constitute a very serious menace to the cross-channel traffic this really apply more to destroyer than to submarine and for this reason : submarine have a infinitely larger radius of action than destroyer and if the belgian coast port have not be in german occupation the additional 210 mile from the em would not have be a matter of serious moment to they and if sight on the longer passage they could submerge the case be quite different with destroyer or other surface vessel in the first place they be open to attack by we vessel during the passage to and from the em and in the second the additional distance to be traverse be a matter for consideration since they carry only limited supplies of fuel a fact to which the admiralty frequently direct attention be that although annoyance and even serious inconvenience might be cause to the enemy by sea and air operation against ostend and zeebrugge no _ permanent _ result could be achieve by the navy alone unless back up by a advance on land the admiralty be heart and soul for a audacious policy provide the form of attack and the occasion offer a reasonable prospect of success owe to the preoccupation of the army we have to be satisfy with bombardment of the port by unprotected monitor which have necessarily to be carry out at very long range exceed 25000 yard and necessitate direction of the fire by aircraft bruge about eight mile from the sea be the real base of enemy submarine and destroyer zeebrugge and ostend be merely exit from bruge and the use of the latter could only be deny to the enemy by land attack or by effective block operation at ostend and zeebrugge for if only one port be close the other could be use neither zeebrugge ostend nor bruge could be render untenable to the enemy with the gun available during 1917 although ostend in particular and zeebrugge to a lesser extent could be and be frequently bring under fire when certain condition prevail and some temporary damage cause indeed the fire against ostend be so effective that the harbor fall into disuse as a base towards the end of 1917 we be arrange also in 1917 for mount naval gun on shore that would bring bruge under fire after the enemy have be drive from ostend by the contemplated operation which be mention later when force to abandon this operation in consequence of the military advance be hold up by the weather these gun be mount in monitor in the matter of block the entrance to the port of zeebrugge and ostend the fact have to be recognize that effective _ permanent _ block operation against destroyer and submarine be not practicable mainly because of the great rise and fall above low water at ordinary spring tide which be 14 foot at ostend and 13 foot at zeebrugge for about half the day in each month low water at ostend also last for one hour therefore even if block-ship be sink in the most favourable position the operation of make a passage by cut away the upper work of the block-ship be not a difficult matter and the german be a painstaking people this passage could be use for some time on each side of high water by vessel like destroyer draw less than 14 foot or submarine draw say 14 foot the block would therefore be of a temporary and not a permanent nature although it would undoubtedly be a source of considerable inconvenience at the same time it be realize that although permanent blocking be not practicable a temporary block would be of use and that _ the moral effect alone of such a operation would be of great value _ these consideration together with the abandonment of the propose landing on the belgian coast owe to unfavourable military condition lead to the decision late in 1917 to undertake block operation concurrently with a attack on the vessel alongside the mole at zeebrugge in order to carry out the general policy mention the eastern end of the strait of dover have be heavily mine at interval during the war and these mine have prove to be a sufficient deterrent against any attempt on the part of surface vessel larger than destroyer to pass through owe to the rise of tide enemy destroyer could pass over the minefield at high water without risk of injury and they frequently do so pass many attempt have be make to prevent the passage of enemy submarine by means of obstruction but without much success and at the end of 1916 a mine net barrage -- ie a series of wire net of wide mesh carry mine -- be in process of be place by we right across the strait from the south goodwin buoy to the west dyck bank a length of 28 mile it be arrange that the french would continue the barrage from this position to the french coast the construction of the barrage be much delay by the difficulty in procure mooring buoy and it be not complete until the late summer of 1917 even then it be not a effective barrier owe to the tidal effect as submarine be able to pass over it during strong tide or to dive under the net as a alternative it be not practicable to use net more than 60 foot deep whilst the depth of water in place exceed 120 foot deep mine be lay to guard the water below the net but although these be moor at some considerable distance from the barrage trouble be experienced owing to the mine drag they mooring in the strong tide-way and foul the net one series have to be entirely sweep up for this reason many device be try with the object of improve this barrage and many clever brain be at work on it _ and all the time we drifter with they crew of gallant fisherman with captain bird at they head work day after day at the task of keep the net efficient _ in spite of its deficiency the barrage be believe to be responsible for the destruction of a few submarine and it do certainly render the passage of the strait more difficult and therefore its moral effect be appreciable towards the end of 1917 however evidence come into we possession show that more submarine be actually pass the strait of dover than have be believe to be the case and it become a question whether a proportion of the drifter etc require for the maintenance of the net of the barrage should be utilize instead for patrol work in the vicinity of the mine barrage then be lay between folkestone and cape grisnez this action be take drifter be gradually move to the new area in April 1916 a net barrage with line of deep mine on the belgian side of the net have also be lay along the belgian coast cover the exit from the port of ostend and zeebrugge as well as the coast between those port these net be lay at a distance of some 24000 yard from the shore this plan have prove most successful in prevent minelaying by submarine in the strait of dover and the barrage be maintain from may to October but the weather condition have prevent its continuance from that date the operation be repeat in 1917 the barrage be keep in position until December when the question of withdraw the craft require for its maintenance for patrol work in connection with the minefield lay on the folkestone-grisnez line come under discussion the belgian coast barrage be in the nature of a surprise be probably more useful as a deterrent to submarine activity in 1916 than in 1917 in both year a strong patrol of monitor destroyer minesweeper drifter for net repair and other vessel be maintain in position to the westward of the barrage to prevent interference with the net by enemy vessel and to keep they effective these vessel be patrolling daily within 13 or 14 sea mile of the two enemy destroyer and submarine basis and although occasionally attack be not drive off in spite of the superior destroyer force which the enemy could always bring to bear in 1917 action between we vessel and those of the enemy and between we own and enemy aircraft be of very frequent occurrence the german also introduce a new weapon in the form of fast motor boat control by a cable from the shore and guide by signal from aircraft these boat be heavily load in the fore part with explosive which detonate on contact with any vessel attack on only one occasion in four attack be the boat successful in hit they mark and the monitor _ terror _ which be strike in this instance although considerably damage in she bulge protection be successfully bring back to port and repair whilst we monitor be on patrol near the barrage as well as on other occasion every favourable opportunity be take of bombard the basis at zeebrugge and ostend in the former case the target fire at be the lock gate and in the latter the workshop to which considerable damage be frequently occasion as well as to vessel lie in the basin these bombardment be carry out in 1917 at distance exceed 25000 yard the long range be necessary on account of the net barrage and also because of the rapidity with which the knocke and tirpitz shore battery obtain the range of monitor attack they one hit on a unprotected monitor be sufficient to sink she they be also invariably carry out under the protection of a smoke screen in the autumn of 1917 the enemy commence to start a smoke screen himself as soon as we open fire thus interfere with we observation of fire even from aircraft but in spite of this much damage result from the bombardment we observation of fire be necessarily carry out by aircraft and the enemy attempt similar measure in he return gunfire result in aerial combat over the monitor be a frequent occurrence the carefully organize arrangement make by admiral bacon for these coastal bombardment excite my warm admiration he leave nothing to chance and everything that ingenuity could devise and patient preparation could assist be do to ensure success he receive assistance from a staff which though small in number be imbue with he own spirit and he bring to great perfection and achieve wonderful success in method of warfare of which the navy have have no previous experience during the year 1917 aerial bombing attack be persistently carry out on the german naval basis in belgium by the royal naval air force at dunkirk which come within the sphere of the dover command these attack have as they main object the destruction of enemy vessel lie in these basis and of the means for they maintenance and repair the attack under the very skilful direction of captain lambe rn be as incessant as we resource and the weather admit and we gallant and splendidly efficient airman of the rna be veritable thorn in the side of the german we bombing machine as well as we fight aircraft be often require to attack military instead of naval objective and several squadron of we fight machine be lend to the military for the operation carry out during the year on the western front they do most excellent work and earn the high commendation of sir dougla haig -lrb- now earl haig -rrb- but we be still able to work against naval objective zeebrugge for instance be bomb on seven night during April and five night during may and during September a total weight of 86 ton of bomb be drop on enemy objective by the dunkirk naval aircraft and we have good reason to be satisfy with the result achieve during this same month 18 enemy aircraft be destroy and 43 drive down attack upon enemy aerodrome be very frequent and this form of aerial offensive undoubtedly exercise a very deterrent influence upon enemy aerial activity over england two submarine also be attack and be think to be destroy all by we machine from dunkirk to commodore godfrey paine the fifth sea lord at the admiralty who be in charge of the rna and to the staff assist he we thanks be due for the great work they accomplish in develop new and efficient type of machine and in overcome so far as be possible the difficulty of supply the amount of bombing work carry out in 1917 can not of course compare with that accomplish during 1918 when production have get into its stride and the number of machine available be consequently so very much larger whether it be due to we aerial attack on bruge that the german destroyer in the autumn month frequently leave that base and lay at zeebrugge can not be know but they do so and as soon as we discover this fact by aerial photograph plan be lay by sir reginald bacon for a combined naval and aerial night operation the idea be for the aircraft to bomb zeebrugge heavily in the vicinity of the mole as we ascertain by trial that on such occasion the enemy 's destroyer leave the mole and proceed outside the harbor there we have we coastal motor boat lie off wait for the destroyer to come out and on the first occasion that the operation be carry out one german destroyer be sink and another believe to have be damage if not also sink by torpedo fire by the coastal motor boat to which very great credit be due for they work not only on this but on many other occasion these boat be man by a very gallant and enterprising personnel numerous other operation against enemy destroyer torpedo boat and submarine be carry out during the year as recount in sir reginald bacon 's book and in the autumn when supplies of the new pattern mine be become available some minelaying destroyer be send to dover these vessel as well as coastal motor boat and motor launch be continually lay mine in the vicinity of zeebrugge and ostend with excellent result a considerable number of german destroyer and torpedo boat work from zeebrugge be know to have be mine and a fair proportion of they sink by these measure in addition to the operation carry out in the vicinity of the belgian coast the dover force constantly lay trap for the enemy destroyer and submarine in water through which they be know to pass line of mine net lay across the expect track of enemy vessel be a device frequently employ submarine as have be state be use on the cross-channel barrage to watch for the passage of enemy submarine and destroyer and everything that ingenuity could suggest be do to catch the german craft if they come out such measure be supplementary to the work of the destroyer engage on the regular dover patrol the indomitable sixth flotilla a great deal depend upon the work of these destroyer they form the principal indeed practically the only protection for the vast volume of trade pass the strait of dover as well as for we cross-channel communication when the nearness of zeebrugge and ostend to dover be consider -lrb- a matter of only 72 and 62 mile respectively -rrb- and the fact that one and sometimes two german flotilla each comprise eleven large and heavily armed torpedo-boat destroyer be usually base on bruge together with a force of large modern torpedo boat and a very considerable number of submarine it will be realize that the position be ever one of considerable anxiety it be further always possible for the enemy to send reinforcement of additional flotilla from german port or to send heavier craft with minesweeper to sweep a clear channel time they arrival to coincide with a intended attack and thus to place the german force in a position of overwhelming superiority we own dover force at the commencement of 1917 consist of one light cruiser three flotilla leader eighteen modern destroyer include several of the old tribal class eleven old destroyer of the 30-knot class -lrb- the latter be unfit to engage the german destroyer -rrb- and five p boat of this total the average number not available at any moment may be take as at least one-third this may seem a high estimate but in addition to the ordinary refit and the time require for boiler clean the vessel of the dover patrol work in very dangerous foggy and narrow water suffer heavy casualty from mine and collision the work of the dover force include the duty of escort the heavy traffic between dover and folkestone and the french port this be mostly carry on during daylight hour owe to the prevalence of submarine-laid mine and the necessity for sweep the various channel before the traffic -- which include a very large troop traffic -- be allow to cross a average of more than twenty transport and hospital ship cross the strait daily during 1917 irrespective of other vessel the destroyer which be engage during daylight hour in this work and those patrolling the barrage across the strait and off the belgian coast obviously require some rest at night and this fact reduce the number available for duty in the dark hour the only time during which enemy destroyer attack take place up to the spring of 1917 the examination service of all vessel pass the strait of dover have be carry out in the downs this lead to a very large number of merchant ship be at anchor in the downs at night and these vessel be obviously open to attack by enemy craft of every description it be always a marvel to I that the enemy show such a lack of enterprise in fail to take advantage of these condition in order to protect these vessel to some extent a light cruiser from dover and one usually borrow from harwich together with a division of destroyer either from dover or borrow also from harwich be anchor off ramsgate and back by a monitor if one be available necessitate a division of strength and a weakening of the force available for work in the strait of dover proper the result of this conflict of interest in the early part of the year be that for the patrol of the actual strait in the darkness of night on a line some 30 mile in length the number of vessel available rarely if ever exceed six -- viz two flotilla leader and four destroyer with the destroyer rest in dover -lrb- four to six in number -rrb- with steam ready at short notice as a reserve a attack have be make on the dover patrol in October 1916 which have result in the loss by we of one destroyer and six drifter and serious damage to another destroyer a consideration of the circumstance of this attack after my arrival at the admiralty lead I to discuss with sir reginald bacon the question of keep such force as we have in the strait at night concentrate as far as possible this disposition naturally increase the risk of enemy vessel pass unobserved but ensure that they would be encounter in greater although not equal force if sight step be also take to reduce the tempting bait represent by the presence of so many merchant ship in the downs at night sir reginald bacon propose that the portion of the examination service which deal with south-going ship should be move to southend and the transfer be effect as rapidly as possible and without difficulty thereby assist to free we from a source of anxiety during the early part of 1917 the enemy carry out a few destroyer raid both on english coast town in the vicinity of dover and the french port of dunkirk and calai as a result of these raid which though regrettable be of no military importance a good deal of ill-informed criticism be level at the admiralty and the vice-admiral command at dover to anyone conversant with the condition the wonder be not that the raid take place but that the enemy show so little enterprise in carry out -- with the great advantage he possess -- operation of real if not vital military value the only explanation be that he foresee the moral effect that he tip-and-run raid would produce and he consider that the effect of the result agitation might be of no inconsiderable value to himself the actual damage do be almost negligible apart from the loss of some eight life which we all deplore it be perhaps natural that people who have never experienced war at close quarter should be impatient if its consequence be bring home to they a visit to dunkirk would have show what war really mean and the bearing of the inhabitant of that town would have teach a valuable lesson the condition in the strait have already be mention but too much emphasis can not be lay on they the enemy who possess the incalculable advantage of the initiative have at he disposal whenever he take heart to plan a attack a force of at least twenty-two very good destroyer all unfortunately of higher speed than anything we could bring against they and more heavily armed than many of we destroyer this force be base within seventy mile of dover and as the german have no traffic of any sort to defend be always available for offensive operation against we up and down or cross-channel traffic we dover force be inferior even at full strength but owe to the inevitable absence of vessel under repair or refit and the manifold duty impose upon it be bind to be in a position of marked inferiority in any night attack undertake by the german against any objective in the strait the enemy have a great choice of objective these be : first the traffic in the channel or the destroyer watch the strait -lrb- the most important military objective -rrb- second the merchant ship anchor in the downs third the british monitor anchor off dunkirk fourth the french port dunkirk boulogne and calai and the british port of dover and fifth the british undefended town of ramsgate margate lowestoft etc which german mentality do not hesitate to attack a glance at chart f -lrb- transcriber 's note : not preserve in book -rrb- will show how widely separate be these objective and how impossible it be for the small dover force to defend they all simultaneously especially during the hour of darkness any such attempt would have lead to a dispersion of force which would have be criminal the distance from dunkirk along the french coast to calai thence to dover and along the english coast to the north foreland be 60 mile the distance at which a enemy destroyer can be see at night be about a quarter of a mile and the enemy could select any point of the 60 mile for attack or could vary the scene of operation by bombard lowestoft or town in the vicinity which be only 80 mile from zeebrugge and equally vulnerable to attack since the enemy 's destroyer could leave they base before dark carry out they hurry bombardment and return before daylight in whatever quarter he attack he could be certain of great local superiority of force although of course he know full well that the first sign of a attack would be a signal to we force to try to cut he off from he basis therein lay the reason for the tip-and-run nature of the raid which last for a few minute only the enemy realize that we should endeavor to intercept he force as soon as it have disclose its presence the german have naturally to take the risk of encounter we vessel on the way to he objective but at night this risk be but slight as it be obviously impossible to prevent bombardment by station destroyer in adequate force for the protection of each town the only possible alternative unless such bombardment be ignore be to give the most vulnerable point protection by artillery mount on shore this be a war office not a admiralty responsibility but as the war office have not the means available the admiralty decide to take the matter in hand and in the spring of 1917 some 6-inch naval gun take from we reserve be mount in the vicinity of the north foreland further a old monitor which be of no use for other work owe to she machinery be unfit be moor to the southward of ramsgate and she gun command the downs searchlight be also mount on shore but more reliance be place on the use of star shell of which the earliest supplies be send to these gun the result be immediately apparent german destroyer appear one night later on off the north foreland and open fire which be return by the monitor and the shore gun the enemy immediately withdraw and never appear again in 1917 in this neighborhood meanwhile effort have be make to increase the strength of the dover force and by the end of June it stand at 4 flotilla leader 29 modern destroyer -lrb- include tribal class -rrb- 10 old 30-knotter and 6 p boat the increase in strength be render possible owe to the relief of destroyer of the m and l class at harwich by new vessel recently complete and by the weakening of that force numerically the flotilla leader be a great asset to dover as although they be coal-burning ship and lack the speed of the german destroyer they powerful armament make it possible for they to engage successfully a numerically greatly superior force this be clearly show on the occasion of the action between the _ break _ and _ swift _ and a german force of destroyer on the night of April 20-21 1917 the flotilla leader on that occasion be as be customary patrolling at the dover end of the cross-channel barrage the enemy 's destroyer be in two detachment one detachment consist apparently of four boat pass it be think round the western end of the barrage at high tide close to the south goodwin buoy and fire a few round at dover the other detachment of two boat go towards calai and the whole force seem to have meet at a rendezvous prior to its return to its base the _ break _ and _ swift _ intercept they on they return and after a hot engagement succeed in sink two of the enemy vessel one be very neatly ram by the _ break _ -lrb- captain ergr evan cb -rrb- and the second sink by torpedo some of the remain four boat undoubtedly suffer serious damage we flotilla leader be handle with conspicuous skill and the enemy be teach a lesson which result in he display even greater caution in lay he plan and evince a greater respect for the dover force for many month the success of the _ break _ and _ swift _ be receive with a chorus of praise and this praise be undoubtedly most fully deserve but once again a example be furnish of the manner in which public attention become rivet upon the dramatic moment of naval warfare whilst the long and patient labor by which the dramatic moment be bring about be ignore thus in this case but little attention be draw to the year of arduous work perform by the sixth flotilla in the strait of dover by day and by night in dense fog heavy gale and blind snowstorm in water which be constantly mine and in the face of a enemy who be bind to be in greatly superior force whenever he choose to attack little thought be give either to the wonderful and most gallant work carry out by the drifter of the patrol man largely by fisherman and practically defenceless against attack by the german destroyer the careful organization which conduce to the successful action be forget sir reginald bacon have tell the story of all this work in he book and i need not repeat it but let it be add that victory depend less on such enhearten incident welcome as they be than on the patient and usually monotonous performance of duty at sea by day and by night in all weather and on the skill in organization of the staff ashore in foresee and forestall enemy activity on a hundred and one occasion of which the public necessarily know nothing it have be state that reliable information reach we in the autumn of 1917 that enemy submarine be pass the strait of dover in much greater number than we have hitherto believe to be the case and the inefficiency of the net barrage in prevent the passage be apparent early in the year -lrb- in February -rrb- sir reginald bacon have put forward a proposal for a deep minefield on the line folkestone -- cape grisnez but confine only to the portion of the line to the southward of the varne shoal it be know that enemy submarine as a rule make this portion of they passage submerge and the minefield be design to catch they the proposal be approve after personal discussion with admiral bacon and direction be give that the earliest supplies of the new pattern mine be to be allocate for this service these mine commence to become available early in the follow November and be immediately lay admiral bacon suggest later the extension of the minefield to the westward of the varne shoal so as to make it a complete barrier across the channel this be also approve and measure be take to provide the necessary mine the question of illuminate at night the area cover by the deep minefield be also discuss at length with sir reginald bacon various proposal be consider such as the use of searchlight on cape grisnez and at folkestone together with the provision of small light-ship fit with searchlight and moor at interval across the channel and also the use of flare from patrol craft flare have already be experiment with from kite balloon by the anti-submarine division of the war staff and they be find on trial to be efficient when use from drifter and of great use in illuminate the patrol area so that the patrol craft might have better opportunity for sighting submarine and the latter be force to dive into the minefield a committee have be meanwhile appoint by the first lord to consider the question of the dover barrage in the light of the information we then possess as to the passage of enemy submarine through the strait of dover this committee visit dover on several occasion and its member some of whom be naval officer and some civilian engineer be show the exist arrangement the committee which consider at first the question of provide a _ obstruction _ end by report that the exist barrage be inefficient -lrb- a fact which have become apparent -rrb- and make proposal for the establishment of the already approve minefield on the folkestone-grisnez line i do not recollect that any definite new idea be evolve as the outcome of the labor of this committee some idea regard the detail of the minefield particularly as to the best form of obstruction that would catch submarine or other vessel on the surface be put forward as also some proposal for erect tower in certain position in the strait i do not think that these latter ever mature the manner in which the minefield should be illuminate at night be discuss by the committee and arrangement be make for the provision of the vessel propose by admiral bacon some disagreement arise on the subject of the provision of the necessary number of vessel for patrolling the minefield with a view to force the submarine to dive in my view a question of this nature be one to be leave in the hand of the vice-admiral at dover with experience on the spot after i have emphasize to he the extreme importance attach to the provision of a ample number of patrol craft at the earliest possible moment interference by the admiralty in such a detail of a flag officer 's command would in my opinion have be dangerous and incorrect for so long as a flag officer retain the confidence of the board he must be leave to work he command in the manner consider best by he after have be inform of the approve general policy since he be bind to be acquaint with the local situation to a far greater extent than any officer serve at the admiralty or elsewhere i discuss the matter personally with sir reginald bacon and be satisfy that he be aware of the view hold by I and of the necessity for provide the patrol craft even at the expense of other service as soon as he could make the requisite arrangement sir reginald bacon 's three year ' experience at dover be a great asset in deal with this matter as with other question connect with the command more especially the difficult and embarrassing operation on the belgian coast he ingenuity originality patience power of organization and he methodical preparation for carry out operation be always a great factor in ensure success these quality be never show more clearly than during the preparation make for land a force of some 14000 officer and man with tank artillery and transport on the coast of belgium under the very muzzle of the german heavy coast artillery it be estimate that the whole force would be put on shore in a period of twenty minute the scheme be describe in full in chapter ix of the first volume of sir reginald bacon 's book on the dover patrol he have put the proposal before admiral sir henry jackson my predecessor who have express he concurrence so far as the naval portion of the scheme be concern and provide that the army make the necessary advance in flander when the scheme be show to I shortly after take office as first sea lord i confess that i have some doubt as to the possibility of manoeuvre two monitor with a pontoon 550 foot in length secure ahead of and between the bow of the monitor but in view of the immense importance of drive the german from the belgian coast and the fact that this scheme if practicable promise to facilitate greatly such a operation approval be give for the construction of a pontoon and after witness the first trial of the pontoon secure between two monitor which be themselves lash together i become convinced that this part of the operation be perfectly feasible the remain pontoon be therefore construct and preparation commence in the greatest secrecy for the whole operation the next matter for trial be the arrangement devise by sir r bacon for make it possible for tank to mount the sea wall these trial be carry out with great secrecy against a model of the sea wall build at the headquarters of the tank corps in france and be quite successful it be necessary to see actual photograph of the tank mount the coping at the top of the sea wall to be convince of the practicability of the scheme a matter of great importance be the necessity for obtain accurate information of the slope of the beach at the project landing place in order that the practicability of ground the pontoon could be ascertain this information sir r bacon with he characteristic patience and ingenuity obtain by means of aerial photograph take at various state of tide finally to gain exact knowledge of the rise and fall of the tide admiral bacon employ a submarine which submerge in the vicinity of nieuport and register the height of water above she hull for a period of twenty-four hour under condition of spring and neap tide the preparation for the landing involve much collaboration with the military authority and sir reginald bacon be frequently at ghq for the purpose as soon as it be decide that the 1st division be to provide the landing party conference take place between admiral bacon and general sir henry rawlinson -lrb- now lord rawlinson -rrb- and i take the opportunity of a visit pay by sir h rawlinson to london to confer with he myself subsequently a conference take place at the war office at which sir dougla haig be present there be entire unanimity between the navy and army over the propose operation and we greatly admire the manner in which the sister service take up the work of prepare for the landing secrecy be absolutely vital to success as the whole scheme be dependent on the operation be a surprise more particularly in the selection of the landing place admiral bacon describe in he book the method by which secrecy be preserve as time pass and the atrocious weather in flander during the summer of 1917 prevent the advance of we army it become more and more difficult to preserve secrecy but although the fact that some operation of the kind be in preparation gradually become know to a increase number of people it be safe to say that the enemy never realize until long after the operation have be abandon its real nature or the locality select for it some officer with experience of the difficulty encounter during the landing at gallipolus express doubt of the practicability of the operation in the face of the heavy fire from large gun and from machine gun which might be expect but the circumstance be so different from those at gallipolus that neither sir reginald bacon nor i share these doubt the heavy bombardment of the coast battery by we own shore gun which have be greatly strengthen for the purpose the rapidity of the landing the use of a dense smoke screen the fact of the landing be a complete surprise the use of tank for deal with hostile machine gun the interruption to the enemy 's shore communication by heavy artillery fire and the bombardment by monitor of the coast well to the eastward of the landing place as a feint be all new factor and all promise to assist towards success of the supreme importance of the operation there could be no question ever since 1914 the navy have be press for the recapture of the port on the belgian coast and they could only be take by means of a combined operation sir john french -lrb- now field-marshal viscount french -rrb- himself have in the early day of the war point out the great importance of secure the coast but circumstance beyond he control be too powerful for he it be in these circumstance that the decision to undertake the operation be make and when it become necessary to abandon it owe to the inability of the army to co-operate the intense disappointment feel by all those who have work so hard to ensure its success can be realize the harwich force consist of the 5th light cruiser squadron and the flotilla of destroyer be the only other british force station in south-eastern water if we except the local craft at the nore the 5th light cruiser squadron and the flotilla be under the command of commodore -lrb- now rear-admiral -rrb- sir reginald tyrwhitt a officer whose vessel be if we except the dover patrol more frequently in contact with the enemy than any other british force in home water sir reginald tyrwhitt have several function to perform : -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be always hope that he would be able to join force with the grand fleet should event foreshadow a meeting with the high sea fleet -lrb- 2 -rrb- we depend very largely on he for reconnaissance work in the southern part of the north sea and into the german bight -lrb- 3 -rrb- it fall to he lot as a rule to provide the cover force for aerial operation carry out from seaplane carrier in southern water -lrb- 4 -rrb- he force be best place to cut off any enemy light craft that might be locate in southern water and to attack zeppelin at sea on they return from raid over england -lrb- 5 -rrb- he be call upon almost weekly to cover the passage of the convoy of merchant ship between the thame and holland know as the dutch convoy -lrb- 6 -rrb- he be constantly call upon the provide reinforcement for the dover patrol or to assist in operation carry out by the latter force these miscellaneous duty involve a great deal of work for the harwich force and particularly for the destroyer the necessity for continually provide reinforcement from the harwich force for the dover patrol be a standing handicap to sir reginald tyrwhitt 's operation he take the matter philosophically although i always realize how difficult it make he work at time and whenever as be frequent combined operation be carry out by the two force the greatest harmony prevail between the command at the commencement of 1917 the harwich force comprise 8 light cruiser 2 flotilla leader and 45 destroyer during the year new vessel be either add to it or replace older craft which be withdraw for other service and at the end of the year the force include 9 light cruiser 4 flotilla leader and 24 destroyer the force be constantly operate in the outer water of the heligoland bight to seaward of we minefield the object of the presence of we ship in these water in addition to reconnaissance work and aerial operation be : -lrb- a -rrb- to intercept any enemy light force which might be intend to operate off we coast or which might be on passage between german port -lrb- b -rrb- to surprise and attack enemy minesweeping vessel -lrb- c -rrb- to destroy zeppelin either on reconnaissance or raiding work -lrb- d -rrb- to capture enemy merchant ship trade between dutch and german port or neutral with contraband trading to germany the opportunity that be give to the force under head -lrb- a -rrb- be exceedingly rare during the year 1917 when even the light force of the high sea fleet be content to remain almost constantly in port except when engage in the operation in the baltic and excepting also on the two occasion on which attack be make on the scandinavian convoy but a portion of the harwich force succeed on one occasion in intercept a flotilla of german destroyer _ en route _ to zeebrugge from german port with the result that one destroyer be seriously damage and force into the dutch port of ymuiden and another either sink or badly damaged force from harwich also succeed in capture or sink twenty-four merchant ship trade between antwerp and dutch port and germany during the year but the main result of the operation of this force be show in the refusal of the enemy to risk he vessel except under cover of darkness in the area in which the harwich force work the duty of protect the dutch convoy impose a heavy strain upon the harwich force during the year 1917 520 eastbound and 511 westbound vessel be convoy between dutch and british port with the loss of only four ship by submarine attack one by destroyer attack and one by mine the price pay by the force for this success be the loss of four destroyer by mine and one by collision and the damage of three destroyer by mine or torpedo and of five destroyer and one light cruiser by collision the frequent collision be due to the condition under which the traffic be carry out at night without light and to the prevalence of fog the procedure adopt by the force be frequently change as it necessarily become know to the german the extraordinarily small loss in the convoy be a very great tribute to the handling of the protect force and to the organization in holland for arrange sailing when it be bear in mind that it be almost impossible to prevent leakage of information to german agent once the time of sailing be give out and that the convoy be open to attack from destroyer and submarine operate either from zeebrugge or from the em or other german port the order of course emanate from the admiralty and of all the great work achieve by vice-admiral sir henry oliver the deputy chief of the naval staff during he service at the admiralty in the year 1917 and indeed in the two precede year the success attend the work of this convoy be certainly not the least it be difficult to put into word the great admiration which i feel for sir henry oliver 's work throughout the war we association commence during my command of the grand fleet but become of course much closer at the admiralty and during my service there he assistance be of immense help to I and of incalculable value to the nation it be fortunate indeed for the ally cause that he hold such important staff appointment during the most critical period of the war chapter ix the sequel the foregoing chapter have be devote to describe the measure that be devise or put into force or that be in course of preparation during the year 1917 to deal with the unrestricted submarine warfare against merchant shipping adopt by germany and austrium in February of that year it now remain to state so far as my information admit the effect of those measure british anti-submarine measure be almost non-existent at the commencement of the war sir arthur wilson when in command of the channel fleet in the early day of the submarine have experiment with net as a anti-submarine measure and shortly before the war submarine be exercise at stalk one another in a submerged condition also the question of employ a light gun for use against the same type of enemy craft when on the surface have be consider and some of we submarine have actually be provide with such a gun of small calibre two pattern of towed explosive sweep have also be try and adopt but it can not be say that we have succeed in find any satisfactory anti-submarine device although many brain be at work on the subject and therefore the earliest success against enemy submarine be principally achieve by ram tactic gradually other device be think out and adopt these comprise drift and stationary net fit with mine the depth charge decoy ship of various nature gunfire from patrol craft and gunfire from armed merchant ship as well as the numerous device mention in chapter iii except at the very commencement of the war when production of craft in germany be slow presumably as a result of the comparatively small number under construction when war break out the british measure fail until towards the end of 1917 in sink submarine at a rate approach in any degree that at which the german be produce they thus germany start the war with 28 submarine five be add and five be lose during 1914 leave the number still 28 at the commencement of 1915 during 1915 so far as we knowledge go 54 be add and only 19 be lose the total at the commencement of 1916 be therefore 63 during 1916 it be believe that 87 submarine be add and 25 lose leave the total at the commencement of 1917 at 125 during 1917 we information be that 78 submarine be add and 66 lose leave the total at the end of the year at 137 the loss during 1917 give quarterly indicate the increase effectiveness of we anti-submarine measure these loss so far as we know they be : first quarter 10 third quarter 20 second quarter 12 fourth quarter 24 during 1918 accord to admiral scheer -lrb- germany 's high sea fleet in the world war page 335 -rrb- 74 submarine be add to the fleet in the period January to October the loss during this year up to the date of the armistice total 70 exclude those destroy by the german on the evacuation of bruge and those blow up by they at polum and cattaro take quarterly the loss be : first quarter 18 third quarter 21 second quarter 26 fourth quarter -lrb- to date of armistice -rrb- 6 it will be see from the foregoing figure for 1917 and 1918 that the full result of the anti-submarine measure inaugurate in 1917 and previous year be be feel in the last quarter of 1917 the result for 1918 be very little in advance of those for the previous half-year accord to we information as show by the figure give above the german have complete by October 1918 a total of 326 submarine of all class exclusive of those destroy by they in November at bruge polum and cattaro admiral von capelle inform the reichstag committee that a total of 810 be order before and during the war it follow from that statement that over 400 must have be under construction or contemplate at the time of the armistice it be understand that the number of submarine actually build at the end of 1918 be however only about 200 which perhaps be the total capacity of the german shipyard at one time at the risk of repetition it be as well to repeat here the figure give the quarterly loss of merchant ship during 1917 and 1918 as they indicate in another and effective way the influence of the anti-submarine measure these figure be : 1917 british foreign total 1st quarter 911840 707533 1519373 2nd quarter 1361870 875064 2236934 3rd quarter 952938 541535 1494473 4th quarter 782887 489954 1272843 1918 british foreign total 1st quarter 697668 445668 1143336 2nd quarter 630862 331145 962007 3rd quarter 512030 403483 915513 4th quarter 83952 93582 177534 figure for 4th quarter be for month of October only the decline of the loss of british shipping be progressive from the second quarter of 1917 in the third quarter of 1918 the reduction in the tonnage sink become very marked and suggest definitely the approach end of the submarine menace the fact that during the second quarter of 1918 the world 's output of tonnage overtake the world 's loss be another satisfactory feature the output for 1917 and 1918 be show in the follow table : unite dominion kingdom ally and total for output neutral world country 1917 1st quarter 246239 340807 587046 2nd quarter 249331 435717 685048 3rd quarter 248283

will be notice that by the last quarter of 1918 the output of shipping in the unite kingdom alone have overtake the loss of british shipping it be not possible to give exact information as to the particular means by which the various german submarine be dispose of but it be believe that of the 186 vessel mention as have be lose by the german at least thirty-five fall victim to the depth charge large order for which have be place by the admiralty in 1917 and it be probably safe to credit mine of which there be a large and rapidly increase output throughout 1917 with the same number -- thirty-five -- a small proportion of these loss be due to the mine in the north sea barrage we own submarine account for some nineteen we destroyer and patrol craft of all nature sink at least twenty by means of gunfire or the ram and some four or five more by the use of towed sweep of various nature we decoy ship sink about twelve four german submarine be know to have be sink by be ram by men-of-war other than destroyer four by merchant ship and about ten by means of we net it be fairly certain that at least seven be account for by aerial attack six be intern some as the result of injury after action with we vessel the total thus account for be 156 it be always difficult to obtain exact information of the fate of submarine particularly in such case as mine attack and the figure therefore do not cover the whole of the german loss which we estimate at 185 chapter x production at the admiralty during 1917 the anti-submarine measure initiate during the year 1917 and continue throughout the year 1918 as well as those in force in the earlier year of the war depend very much for they success on the work carry out by the admiralty department responsible for design and production and apart from this these department during the year 1917 carry out a great deal of most valuable work in the direction of improve the efficiency of the material with which the vessel of the grand fleet and other warship be equip early in 1917 certain change be make in the naval ordnance department when captain dreyer take up the post of director of naval ordnance in succession to rear-admiral morgan singer on march 1 the opportunity be seize of remove the torpedo department which have hitherto be a branch of the naval ordnance department from the control of the director of naval ordnance and rear-admiral fitzherbert be appoint as director of torpedo and mine with two assistant director under he one for torpedo and the other for mine it have for some time be apparent to I that the torpedo and mining work of the fleet require a larger and more independent organization and the intention to adopt a very extensive mining policy accentuate the necessity of appoint a larger staff and accord it greater independence the change also relieve the dno of some work and give he more liberty to concentrate on purely ordnance matter captain dreyer from he experience as flag captain in the _ iron duke _ be well aware of the direction in which improvement in armament efficiency be necessary and a variety of question be take up by he with great energy some of the more important item of the valuable work achieve by the naval ordnance department during the year 1917 in addition to the provision of various anti-submarine measure mention in chapter iii be : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the introduction of a new armour-piercing shell of far greater efficiency than that previously in use the initial design for these shell be produce in the draw office of the department of the director of naval ordnance -lrb- 2 -rrb- the introduction of star shell -lrb- 3 -rrb- the improvement of the arrangement make after we experience in the jutland action for prevent the flash of explode shell from be communicate to the magazine take these in order the _ new armour-piercing shell _ would have produce a very marked effect have a fleet action be fight in 1918 twelve thousand of these new pattern shell have be order by November 1917 after a long series of experiment and a considerable number be in a advanced stage of construction by the end of the year with we older pattern of shell as use by the fleet at jutland and in earlier action there be no chance of the burst of the shell when fire at battle range take place inboard after penetrate the side armor of modern german capital ship in such a position that the fragment might be expect to reach and explode the magazine a large proportion of the shell burst on the face of the armor the remainder while pass through it in the case of the new shell which be certainly twice as efficient and which would penetrate the armor without break up the fragment would have a very good chance of reach the magazine of even the latest german ship the greatest credit be due to the ordnance department and to we enterprising manufacturer for the feat which they achieve we have press for a shell of this nature as the result of we experience during the jutland action and it be badly want we have experience the need for a efficient _ star shell _ both in the grand fleet and in southern water and after the jutland action the attention of the admiralty have be draw by I to the efficiency of the german shell of this type in the early part of 1917 during one of the short night bombardment of the south coast by german destroyer some german star shell unexploded reach the shore direction be at once give to copy these shell and not to waste time by try to improve upon they a procedure dear to technical mind but fatal when time be of the first importance success be soon attain and star shell be issue during 1917 to all we ship the vessel of the dover and harwich patrol force and the shore battery at the north foreland be the first supply important experiment be carry out in 1917 on board hm _ vengeance _ to test the _ anti-flash _ arrangement with which the fleet have be equip as the result of certain of we ship be blow up in the jutland action valuable information be obtain from these experiment and the arrangement be improve accordingly the work of the torpedo and mining department be also of great value during 1917 the principal task lay in perfect the new pattern mine and arrange for its production in great number in overcome the difficulty experience with the older pattern mine and in arrange for a greatly increase production of explosive for use in mine depth charge etc these project be in hand when the new organization involve the appointment of a admiralty controller be adopt the circumstance in which this great and far-reaching change in organization be bring about be as follow in the spring of 1917 proposal be make to the admiralty by the then prime minister that some of the work carry out at that time by the third sea lord should be transfer to a civilian at first it be understand by we that the idea be to re-institute the office of additional civil lord which office be at the time hold by sir franci hopwood -lrb- now lord southborough -rrb- whose service however be be utilize by the foreign office and who have for this reason but little time to devote to admiralty work to this proposal no objection be raise at a later stage however it become evident that the proposal be more far reach and that the underlie idea be to place a civilian in charge of naval material generally and of all shipbuilding both naval and mercantile up to the spring of 1916 mercantile shipbuilding have be carry out under the supervision of the board of trade but when the office of shipping controller be institute this work have be place under that minister who be assist by a committee of shipbuilder term the shipbuilding advisory committee statistics show that good result as regard mercantile ship production be not obtain under either the board of trade or the shipping controller one reason be that the supply of labor and material which be very important factor be a matter of competition between the claim of the navy and those of the mercantile marine and another the fact that many man have be withdraw from the shipyard for service in the army there be especial difficulty in provide labor for the manufacture of machinery and at one time the admiralty go so far as to lend artificer to assist in the production of engine the idea of place the production of ship for both service under one head appeal to and be support by the admiralty the next step be a proposal to the admiralty that sir eric gedde at that time the head of the military railway organization in france with the honorary rank of major-general should become admiralty controller this would place he in charge of all shipbuilding for both service as well as that portion of the work of the third sea lord which related to armament production i be request to see sir eric whilst attend a conference in pari with a view to he be ask to take up the post of admiralty controller this i do after discuss the matter with some of the head of the war office administration and member of general headquarters in france i learn from sir eric gedde that he feel capable of undertake the work on the understanding that he be assure of my personal support he say that experience in he railway work in france have show the difficulty of take over duty hitherto perform by officer and state that it could not have be carry through without the strong support of the commander-in-chief for this reason he consider he must be assure of my support at the admiralty in view of the importance attach to combine under one administration the work of both naval and mercantile shipbuilding for the reason already state and influence in some degree by the high opinion hold of sir eric gedde by the prime minister i come to the conclusion that he appointment would be of benefit to admiralty work and therefore give he the assurance and say that i would do my best to smooth over any difficulty with the exist admiralty official whether naval or technical in these circumstance sir eric gedde be offer the post of admiralty controller by sir edward carson then first lord and accept it it be arrange that a naval officer should continue to hold the post of third sea lord and that he should be jointly responsible so far as the navy be concern for all _ design _ work on its technical side whether for ship ordnance material mine torpedo etc etc whilst the controller become entirely responsible for _ production _ it be obvious that goodwill and tact would be require to start this new organization which be decidedly complicated and that the post of third sea lord would be difficult to fill at the request of sir eric gedde rear-admiral lionel halsey cb who at that time be fourth sea lord be ask if he would become third sea lord in the new organization he consent and be appoint when the detailed organization draw up to meet the view of sir e gedde be examine by the naval officer responsible for armament work strong objection be raise to that part of the organization which affect they responsibility for the control and approval of design and of inspection sir eric hold the view that inspection should come under the official in charge of production and that the design staff should also be under he the design be draw up to meet the view of the naval officer and finally approve by they personally i see no _ danger _ in the proposal regard design because the responsibility of the naval officer for final approval be recognize but there be a certain possibility of delay if the naval technical officer lose control over the design staff i fully agree with the criticism on the subject of inspection the argument be that only naval officer accustom to _ use _ the ordnance material could know the danger that might arise from faulty inspection and that the producer have temptation in he path especially under war condition to make inspection subservient to rapidity of production sir eric gedde finally waive he objection he inform I that he base he argument largely on he experience at the ministry of munitions with which he have be associate earlier in the war the contention of the naval officer at the admiralty be that even if the organization propose be find to be workable for the army it would not be satisfactory for the navy as in we case it be essential that the responsibility for approval of design and for inspection should be independent of the producer whether the producer be a government official or a contractor apart from question of general principle in this matter accident to ordnance material in the navy or the production of inferior ammunition may involve and have involve the most serious result even the complete loss of battleship with they crew as the result of a magazine explosion or the bursting of a heavy gun i could not find that the organization at the ministry of munitions have even in its early day place design inspection and production under one head inspection and design have each its own head and be separate from production in any case in 1918 the ministry of munitions revert to the admiralty system of place the responsibility for design and inspection under a artillery expert who be neither a manufacturer nor responsible for production the matter refer to above may appear unimportant to the civilian reader but any question relate to the efficiency of its material be of such paramount importance to the fight efficiency of the navy that it be necessary to mention it with a view to the avoidance of future mistake the new organization result in the creation of a very large administrative staff for the purpose of accelerate the production of ship ordnance material mine etc indeed the increase in number be so great that it become necessary to find additional housing room and the office of the board of education be take over for the purpose it be feel that the increase in staff though it involve of course very heavy expenditure would be justified if it result in increase rapidity of production it will be readily understand that such a immense change in organization one which i have promise to see through personally and which be naturally much dislike by all the admiralty department throw a vast volume of extra work on my shoulder work which have no connexion with the operation of war and this too at a period when the enemy 's submarine campaign be at its height i should not have undertake it but for the hope that the change would result in greatly increase production particularly of warship and merchant ship the success of this new organization can only be measure by the result obtain and by this standard if it be possible to eliminate some of the vary and incalculable factor we should be able to judge the extent to which the change be justified it be a change for which under pressure i bear a large share of responsibility and it involve replace in the middle of a great war a organization build up by expert well acquaint with naval need by one in which a considerable proportion of the personnel have no previous experience of the work the change be of course a experiment the danger lay in the fact that until technical and admiralty experience have be gain even man of the greatest ability in other walk of life may find it difficult to produce satisfactory result even if there be no limit impose on the size of the staff which assist they the question of production be best examine under various heading and the result under the old admiralty organization compare with those under the new although comparison be admittedly difficult owe to change condition warship production under the admiralty organization exist up to may 1917 the third sea lord -- as the controller be term when change be introduce by mr churchill in 1912 -- be head of the department of the director of naval construction and engineer in chief and of that part of the work of the director of naval ordnance which deal with the design and production of gun and gun mounting under the new organization a civilian controller become responsible for production the third sea lord be associate with he on technical matter of design a special department for warship production and repair be set up under a deputy controller the third sea lord have no authority over this department except by he association with the controller under the old organization it have be the custom during the war for the third sea lord to give to the board and to the commander-in-chief of the grand fleet a personal forecast of the anticipated date of completion of all warship under construction my experience whilst in command of the grand fleet have be that this personal forecast be generally fairly accurate for six month ahead as a example it may be state that in the first four month of 1917 the delivery of destroyer _ be within one of the forecast _ make in October 1916 four vessel of the class be slightly behind and three ahead of the forecast of thirteen e class submarine forecast in October 1916 for delivery by march 1917 all except two be deliver by April of twelve k class submarine forecast for delivery in the same period all except three be deliver by April 1917 it should be state that these k class submarine be vessel of a new type involve new problem of some difficulty on the other hand there be considerable delay in the completion of a number of the thirty p boat forecast in October 1916 for delivery during the first seven month of 1917 and the April forecast show that only twenty out of the thirty would be deliver during that period there be also some delay in the delivery of twin screw minesweeper twenty of which be show in the forecast of October 1916 as due for delivery in the first six month of 1917 the April 1917 forecast show that six have be deliver or would complete in April ten more would complete within the estimated period and the four remain would be overdue and would not be deliver until July or August these figure show the degree of reliance which could be place on the personal forecast of the third sea lord under the old organization it be of course a fact that accurate forecast do not _ necessarily _ mean that the rate of production be satisfactory but only that the forecast be to be depend on we be never at all satisfy with the rate of production either under the old or the new organization accuracy of forecast be however of great use from the staff point of view in allot new ship to the various command and in plan operation to turn now to the figure give by the admiralty controller under the new organization the table below show the forecast -lrb- f -rrb- give in June 1917 and the delivery -lrb- d -rrb- of different class of warship month by month during the period of July to November of that year : -------------------------------------------------------------------- class of | July | aug | sept | oct | nov | deficit in vessel | f | d | f | d | f | d | f | d | f | d | 5 month -------------------------------------------------------------------- flotilla | | | | | | | | | | | leader | | | | | | | | | | | and tbd 's | 5 | 2 | 7 | 8 | 8 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 4 submarine | 2 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 1 | 11 sloop | 3 | 2 | 5 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 7 | 5 p boat | 6 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------ amongst vessel which be class as auxiliary the figure be : class of | July | aug | sept | oct | nov | deficit in vessel | f | d | f | d | f | d | f | d | f | d | 5 month -------------------------------------------------------------------- minesweeper | 5 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 7 trawler | 25 | 18 | 23 | 14 | 30 | 13 | 27 | 28 | 33 | 24 | 41 -------------------------------------------------------------------- it will be see from these figure that the forecast of June be inaccurate even for the three succeed month and that the total deficit in the five month be considerable except in the case of tbd 's and p boat the most disappointing figure be those relate to submarine trawler and minesweeper the case of the submarine may be put in another way thus : in the June forecast twenty-six submarine be forecast for delivery during the period July to the end of December the date of three however be somewhat uncertain of this total of twenty-six _ only nine be actually deliver _ of the remainder seven be show in a November forecast as delay for four month two for five month and one for nine month the attention of the production department be continually direct to the very serious effect which the delay be produce on we anti-submarine measure and the first lord sir eric gedde be inform of the difficult position which be arise in the early part of December i point out to the third sea lord and the admiralty controller sir allan anderson that it be obviously impossible for the naval staff to frame future policy unless some dependence could be place on the forecast of delivery the controller in reply state that accurate forecast be most difficult and propose a discussion with the third sea lord and myself but i have leave the admiralty before the discussion take place the delay as will be see from the table give be most serious in the case of vessel class as auxiliary sir thoma bell who possess great experience of shipbuilding in a private capacity be at the head of the department of the deputy controller for dockyard and shipbuilding and the director of warship production be a distinguished naval constructor the deputy controller of auxiliary shipbuilding be a officer lend from the war office whose previous experience have lie i believe largely in the railway world some of he assistant and staff be however man with experience of shipbuilding when i become first sea lord at the end of 1916 the new building program which have receive the sanction of the cabinet be as follow : 8 flotilla leader 500 trawler 65 tbd 's 60 submarine 34 sloop 4 seaplane carrier 48 screw minesweeper 60 boom defense vessel 16 paddle during the early part of 1917 it be decide to substitute 56 screw minesweeper and 8 paddle sweeper for the approve program of this class of vessel and to add another 50 screw minesweeper to meet the grow mine menace as well as to substitute 115 drifter for 50 of the trawler and to request the canadian government to build 36 trawler and 100 drifter mainly for use in canadian water it be also decide to lay down 36 mercantile decoy ship and 12 tug and to build 56 motor skimmer on the line of the coastal motor boat which be then show they value off the belgian coast the program therefore in may 1917 be as follow : flotilla leader 8 tbd 's 65 patrol boat 6 sloop 34 minesweeper -lrb- screw -rrb- 56 -lrb- paddle -rrb- 8 additional twin-screw minesweeper 50 submarine 60 trawler 450 drifter 115 canadian trawler 36 drifter 100 boom defense vessel 60 mercantile decoy ship 36 seaplane carrier 4 tug 12 motor skimmer 56 meanwhile intelligence have be receive which indicate that germany be build such a considerable number of light cruiser as to jeopardize we supremacy in this class of vessel and it be decide by the board that we ought to build eight more light cruiser even at the cost of appropriate the steel intend for the construction of six merchant ship further the german submarine program be develop with great rapidity and we own submarine of the l class be take a very long time to build it be therefore propose to substitute eighteen additional h class submarine for four of the l class as the vessel of the h class be capable of more rapid construction thus make the total number of submarine on order 74 approval be also seek for the addition of 24 destroyer and four p boat to the program bring the number of destroyer on order up to a total of 89 the program be approve a slight change be make in the matter of the seaplane carrier by fitting out one of the raleigh class of cruiser as a seaplane vessel in order to obtain a increase number of vessel of this type more rapidly than by building later in the year the cruiser _ furious _ be also convert into a seaplane carrier and she carry out much useful work in 1918 mercantile shipbuilding a greatly increase output of merchant ship have be anticipate under the new organization which place mercantile construction under the admiralty controller instead of under the ministry of ship it be expect that the difficulty due under the previous arrangement to compete claim for steel and labor would vanish with very beneficial result it be as previously state mainly with this object that the admiralty have agree to the change the start be promising enough after a review of the situation hope be hold out that during the second half of 1917 a addition of about 1000000 ton of shipping from the shipyard within the unite kingdom would be effect this figure indeed be give to the house of common by the prime minister on August 16 1917 on compare this figure with that of the first half of the year -lrb- a total of about 484000 ton -rrb- there be distinct cause for gratification it be right to state that admiralty official who have previously be watch mercantile shipbuilding regard the estimate as very optimistic further it be anticipate by the then admiralty controller sir eric gedde that during the year 1918 with some addition to the labor strength a total output of nearly two million ton be possible provide steel be forthcoming whilst with considerably greater addition to the labor strength and to the supply of steel and with the help of the national shipyard propose by the controller the total output might even reach three million ton the actual result fall very short of these forecast the total output for the second half of the year be only 620000 ton the monthly total in gross tonnage for the whole year be : January 46929 July 81188 February 78436 August 100900 march 115654 September 60685 April 67536 October 145844 may 68083 November 158826 June 108397 December 112486 in January 1918 the total drop to 58568 ton and in February be only 100038 ton in march it be announce that lord pirie would take the position of controller general of merchant shipbuilding the subsequent result in the direction of output of merchant ship do not properly come within the scope of this book which be intend to deal only with work during the year 1917 but it may be of interest to give here the output month by month it be as follow : January 58568 July 141948 February 100038 August 124675 march 161674 September 144772 April 111533 October 136000 may 197274 November 105093 June 134159 December 118276 total for the year 1534110 it will be see that the result for 1918 be a improvement on those for 1917 the exact figure for that year be 1163474 ton these result however fall very short of the optimistic estimate give in July 1917 mercantile repair work the controller 's department undoubtedly succeed in the work of improve the arrangement for the repair of merchant ship this be show by a analysis of the total number of vessel that _ complete _ repair during various month in August 1917 the number be 382 with a tonnage of 1183000 in November the figure become 542 ship with a tonnage of 1509000 there remain under repair at the end of August 326 ship and at the end of November 350 ship these figure indicate that the greater number of completion be not due to the smaller number of vessel be damage or the damages be less in extent considerable credit be due to the department for this successful acceleration of repair work which naturally have a great influence on the shipping situation armament production it be not i think realize either by the government or by the civilian bring into the admiralty during the year 1917 that there be a very great difference between the admiralty and the war office organization in the matter of production of material nor be it recognize that naval officer be by they training and experience better fit to deal with such matter on a large scale than be military officer except perhaps officer in the artillery and royal engineer whatever may be the case in the future the navy in pre-war day be so much more dependent on material than the army as to make question relate to naval material of far greater importance that be the case with military material this fact be apt to be forget by those writer on naval affair who think that a intimate knowledge of question relate to naval material _ and its use _ be of little importance i trust that this belief will never become general in the service for the naval officer who be not familiar with the design and production of material be handicap when he come to use it ignorance of the great experience of the admiralty in handle problem of production and of the past success of admiralty method in this respect give rise to a good deal of misconception the fact that it have be necessary to form a separate ministry -lrb- that of munitions -rrb- to deal with the production of war material for the army probably foster the idea that matter at the admiralty should be alter in a similar direction the post of deputy controller of armament production be create under the new organization and all matter concern the production of gun gun-mounting projectile cordite torpedo mine paravane and all other war material be place under he i have deal earlier in this chapter with the question of design and inspection over which some disagreement arise i be not conscious that the new organization succeed in speed up armament production during 1917 and during the latter part of the year i be much concern with the delay in ordnance production as reveal during 1917 and as expose by the forecast for 1918 it be very possible on the other hand that in the case of mine the result be good the old admiralty organization have not be equip to deal with such a immense number of mine as be on order and although a large organization for they production be start by sir lionel halsey when fourth sea lord with the assistance of admiral fitzherbert and captain litchfield-speer it have not be sufficiently long at work for a opinion to be give as to whether the result in production would have be as good as under the dcap in consider the whole question of production during the year 1917 it should be bear in mind that very extensive order be place in the early part of that year for gun gun-mounting mine warship of the smaller class and patrol craft and that if we compare only the actual output for 1917 with that of previous year without take the above fact into account we might form a incorrect impression as to the success of the organization for production for instance in the last quarter of 1917 1515 gun of all calibre be deliver as against 1101 in the first quarter in the month of November 1335 mine of all nature and 2078 depth charge be fill as compare with 625 mine and 542 depth charge in July these figure be the result of the large order place early in the year and it be not until 1918 that the full fruit of the order place in 1917 become apparent the figure for that year however be not at my disposal one great advantage which result from the new organization viz the creation of a directorate of material and priority must be mention this directorate control the distribution of all steel for all service and produce a very beneficial effect on the issue of supplies of steel to shipbuilder the immense increase in staff which result from the institution of the office of admiralty controller be exhibit in the list of staff in 1918 as compare with the staff in the early part of 1917 chapter xi naval work the main effort of the navy during the year 1917 be direct towards the defeat of the enemy 's submarine since the central power confine they naval effort almost entirely to this form of warfare but many other problem occupy we attention at the admiralty and some of these may be mention considerable discussion take place in the early part of the year on the subject of the policy to be pursue in the eastern theater of war and naval opinion on the possibility of effect a landing in force at different point be invite and give it need only be say here that the matter be bring forward more than once and that the situation from the naval point of view be always clear the feasible landing place so far as we be concern be unsuited to the military strategy at that period the time require to collect or build the great number of lighter horse boat etc for the strong force require be not available and it be a sheer impossibility to provide in a short period all the small craft need for a operation of magnitude whilst the provision of the necessary anti-submarine defence would have tax we resource to the utmost and have prevent essential work of this nature in other theater the work of the navy therefore _ off the coast of palestine _ be confine to protect the left flank of the advance army and assist its operation and to establish as the troops advance basis on the coast at which store etc could be land this task be effectively carry out the anchorage on this coast be all entirely open to the sea and become untenable at very short notice so that the work of the navy be always carry out under considerable difficulty nor could the ship work on the flank be adequately guard against submarine attack and some loss be experience the most important be the sinking of monitor m15 and the destroyer _ staunch _ by a submarine attack off deir el belah -lrb- nine mile south of gaza -rrb- in November the navy continue its co-operation with the army in the _ salonika theater of war _ assist by the royal naval air service and bombardment be continually carry out on military objective similarly _ in the adriatic _ we monitor and machine of the rna assist the military force of the ally particularly be this the case at the time of the austrian advance to the piave where we monitor do much useful work in check enemy attempt to cross that river _ off the gallipolus peninsula _ the naval watch on the mouth of the dardanelle be continue extensive new minefield be lay during the year and be effective in sink the _ breslau _ and severely damage the _ goeben _ when those vessel attempt a sortie on January 20 1918 the rna during the year carry out many long distance reconnaissance and bombing operation over constantinople and the vicinity _ in the red sea _ naval operation be carry out in conjunction with friendly arab and the arabian coast clear of turkish force _ in the white sea _ during the latter part of 1917 the whole of the naval work fall upon british naval force when the russian ship which have co-operate hitherto have come under the influence of the political situation we force in these water consist largely of trawler engage in minesweeping and escort work the latter duty impose a very heavy strain on officer and man involve as it do the safe conduct during the year of no fewer than one thousand ship carry store and munitions for the russian military force _ in the baltic _ the situation become very difficult owe first to the russian revolution and finally to the russian debacle we force in these water consist of seven submarine it become evident at the beginning of October 1917 that the german be intend to carry out some operation in the baltic against russium and the question of afford assistance be at once consider by the naval staff it be surmise that but little dependence could be place on the russian baltic fleet -lrb- event show this surmise to be accurate -rrb- and in order to keep we control over the north sea and ensure the safety of we communication with france it be obvious that for any action we might decide to take we should be oblige to divide the grand fleet send such portion of that command into the baltic as could successfully engage the high sea fleet if encounter as well as to secure the return passage via the great belt and retain a sufficient force to deal with such german vessel as might attempt operation in the north sea or channel during we raid into the baltic there be many way in which the german might seriously hamper if not entirely prevent the return of we fleet from the baltic unless we secure the exit the great belt could easily be close by block-ship at its narrowest point and extensive minefield could be lay it be obvious therefore that to secure the exit a strong force would be require and that it would necessarily occupy a position where it would be open to serious attack the initial operation of gain access to the baltic via the great belt though not impossible be difficult involve as it do sweeping passage through very extensive minefield and even when we ship be in the baltic fairly constant sweep would be necessary finally the whole operation would be complicate by the question of fuel supply especially to the destroyer and other small craft with a limited radius of action since we could not depend upon russian source of supply these be amongst the consideration which make it clear that the operation be not one that i could recommend the russian naval view be give in the follow statement which appear in the russian press in October : the naval general staff categorically deny the rumor circulate in petrograd on the 8th and 9th instant to the effect that the british or french fleet have break through to the baltic sea at the same time it be point out that it would be a physical impossibility for the ally ' fleet to come in from the western entrance because it would be necessary to pass through the sound or through one of the two belt entry to the sound through danish or swedish water could not also be affect owe to the fact that these water in part be only 18 foot deep while large-sized vessel would require at least 30 foot of water as regard the entry to the belt this would be a extremely hazardous undertaking as part of the route be under control of the german who have construct they own defence consist of mine and battery in these circumstance accord to the opinion of we naval expert a entrance into the baltic by the ally ' fleet could only be undertake after gain possession of these water and the adjacent coast and then only with the co-operation of land force the german have a easy task in the baltic as the russian resistance be not of a serious nature we submarine attack on every possible occasion and score some success against german vessel towards the end of the year it become necessary to consider the action to be take in regard to we submarine as the german control of the baltic become effective and the demobilization of the russian fleet become more and more pronounced many scheme for secure they escape from these water be discuss but the chance of success be so small and the submarine themselves possess so little fighting value owe to they age that eventually instruction be send to the senior officer to destroy the submarine before they could fall into german hand chapter xii the future it be natural that the task of recount the fact in the foregoing chapter should cause one 's thought to turn to the future the empire have pass through a period of great danger during which its every interest be threaten and it have come successfully out of the ordeal but to those upon whom the responsibility lay of initiate and direct the nation 's policy the serious nature of the peril which face we be frequently such as to justify the grave anxiety which spring from full knowledge of event and they significance a international organization be in process of be bring into existence which if it do not entirely prevent a recurrence of the horror of the four and a half year of war will it be hope at least minimize the chance of the repetition of such a experience as that through which the world have so recently pass but the league of nation be still only a skeleton to be clothe with authority and support by the public opinion of the world if it be to be a success it be in its infancy and so far the most optimistic have not advance beyond hope in its efficiency and if the lesson of the past be correctly interpret as they be interpret by we forefather in they day those upon whom responsibility lie in future year for the safety and prosperity of the empire will see to it that so far as lie in they power whatever else may be leave undo the security of the sea communication of the empire be ensure not one of we but must have realize during the war if he do not realize it before that the all-important thing upon which we must set we mind be the ability to use the sea communication of the far-flung empire which be only unite by the sea so long as we can use they but while government may realize they duty in this matter and set out with good intention it be after all upon the people who elect government that the final responsibility lie and therefore it be to they that it be so necessary to bring home in season and out of season the danger that confront we if we sea communication be imperil the danger which confront the british people be never so great in any previous period as it be during the year 1917 when the submarine menace be at its height and it may be hope that the lesson to be learn from the history of those month will never be forget the british empire differ from any other nation or empire which have ever exist we sea communication be we very life-blood and it be not greatly exaggerate the case to say that the safety of those communication be the one consideration of first-class importance upon a solid sense of they security depend not only we prosperity but also the actual life of a large proportion of the inhabitant there be no other nation in the world which be situate as the people of these island be situate therefore there be no other nation to whom sea power be in the least degree as essential as it be to we four out of five of we loaf and most of we raw material for manufacture must come to we by sea and it be only by the sea that we can hold any commercial intercourse with the dominion dependency and crown colony which together make up what we call the empire with a population of 400000000 people what then be we to do in the future to ensure the safety of the communication between these island and the rest of the empire as a matter of course we should be in a position to safeguard they against any possible form of attack from whatever quarter it may come so far as can be see there be no present likelihood of the transport of food or raw material be effect in anything but vessel which move upon the surface of the sea it be true that as a result of the war people 's thought turn in the direction of transport both of human being and of merchandise by air or under the water but there be no possible chance for at least a generation to come of either of these method of transport be able to compete commercially with transport in vessel sail on the sea therefore the problem of guard we communication resolve itself into one of secure the safety of vessel which move upon the surface of the sea whatever may be the character of the attack i do not desire to enter into any discussion here as to the method by which these vessel can be protect except to say that it be necessary for we to be in a position of superiority in all the weapon by which they safety may be endanger at the present time there be two principal form of attack : -lrb- 1 -rrb- by vessel which move on the surface and -lrb- 2 -rrb- by vessel which move under water a third danger -- namely one from the air -- be also become of increase importance the war have show we how to ensure safety against the first two form of attack and we duty as member of a great maritime empire be to take step to maintain effective force for the purpose in order to carry out this duty it will be greatly to we advantage if the matter can be deal with by all the constituent part of the empire a recent tour of the greater part of the british empire have show I that the importance of sea power be very fully realize by the great majority of we kith and kin overseas and that there be a strong desire on they part to co-operate in what be after all the concern of the whole empire it seem to I of the greatest possible importance that this matter of a empire naval policy and a empire naval organization should be settle at the earliest possible moment and that it should be look at from the broadest point of view i do not think that we in this country can claim to have take into sufficient account the very natural view and the very natural ambition which animate the people overseas we have in point of fact look at the whole question too locally whilst we have be suggest to the dominion that they be incline to make this error and unless we depart from that attitude there be a possibility that we shall not reap the full benefit of the resource of the empire which be very great and be increase in war it be not only the material which count but the spirit of a people and we must enlist the support spontaneous and effective of every section of the king 's dominion in the task of sea defense which lie before we consult fully and unreservedly the representative of we kith and kin and give they the benefit of whatever instruct advice we with ancient tradition and mature knowledge may possess in frame we future naval policy it be obvious that we must be guide by what be be do abroad we be bind to keep a absolutely safe margin of naval strength and that margin must exist in all arm and in all class of vessel at the moment and no doubt for some time to come difficulty in regard to finance will exist but it would seem to be nothing more than common sense to insist that the one service which be vital to we existence should be absolutely the last to suffer for need of money during a period of the greatest financial pressure it may be necessary to economize somewhat in the construction of new ship and in the upkeep of certain of we naval basis which the result of the war and consequent consideration of future strategy may suggest to be not of immediate importance although even here it may well be necessary to develop other naval basis to meet changed condition but we can not afford to fall behind in organization in the testing and development of new idea or in the strength of we personnel or in its training a well trained personnel and a carefully think out organization can not by any possibility be quickly extemporize it be the height of economic folly to stint experimental research for it be in time of stress that the value of past experimental work be show in the matter of organization we must be certain that adequate means be take to ensure that the different arm which must co-operate in war be train to work together under peace condition a modern fleet consist of many unit of different type -- battleship battle-cruiser light cruiser destroyer and submarine before i relinquish the command of the grand fleet large sea-going submarine of high speed vessel of the k class have be build to accompany the surface vessel to sea it be very essential that senior officer should have every opportunity of study tactical scheme in which various class of ship and kind of weapon be employ in consider the future of the navy it be impossible to ignore aircraft there be many important problem which the navy and the air service ought to work out together a fleet without aircraft will be a fleet without eye and aircraft will moreover be necessary not only for reconnaissance work but for gun-spot as well as possibly for submarine hunting air power be regard by many officer of wide practical experience as a essential complement to sea power whatever future the airship and aeroplane may have for independent action a captain who be go to fight he ship successfully must have practice in time of peace with all the weapon he will employ in action and he must have absolute control over all the element constitute the fight power of he ship in a larger sense the same may be say of a admiral in command of a fleet divide control may mean disaster the advent of aircraft have introduce new and at present only partially explore problem into naval warfare and officer command naval force will require frequent opportunity of study they they must be work out with naval vessel and aircraft acting in close association with the air service under separate control financially as well as in a executive and administrative sense be it certain that the admiralty will be able to obtain machine and personnel in the necessary number to carry out all the experimental and training work that be essential for efficiency in action be it also beyond doubt that unity of command at sea which be essential to victory will be preserve in view of all the possibility which the future hold now that the airship and aeroplane have arrive it be well that there should be no doubt on such matter for inefficiency might in conceivable circumstance spell defeat then there be the question of the personnel of the fleet it would be most unwise to allow the strength of the trained personnel of the navy to fall below the limit of reasonable safety because it be upon that trained personnel that the success of the enormous expansion need in war so largely depend this be find during the late struggle when the personnel be expand from 150000 to upward of 400000 throw upon the pre-war nucleus a heavy responsibility in training equipment and organize without the backbone of a highly train personnel of sufficient strength development in time of sudden emergency can not possibly be effect in the late war we suffer in this respect and we should not forget the lesson in future war if any such should occur trained personnel will be of even greater importance than it be in the great war because the advance of science increase constantly the importance of the highly train individual and if nothing else be certain it can surely be predict that science will play a increase part in warfare in the future only those officer and man who serve afloat in the year immediately precede the opening of hostility know how great the struggle be to gain that high pitch of efficiency which the navy have reach at the outbreak of war and it be the devotion to duty of we magnificent pre-war personnel that go far to ensure we victory it be essential that the navy of the future should not be give a yet harder task than fall to the navy of the past as a result of a policy of starve the personnel there be perhaps just one other point upon which i might touch in conclusion i would venture to suggest to my countryman that there should be a full realization of the fact that the naval service as a whole be a highly specialize profession it be one in which the senior officer have pass the whole of they life and during they best year they thought be turn constantly in one direction -- namely how they can best fit the navy and themselves for possible war the country as a whole have probably but little idea of the great amount of technical knowledge that be demand of the naval officer in these day he must possess this knowledge in addition to the lesson derive from he study of war and the naval officer be learn from the day that he enter the service until the day that he leave it the navy then be a profession which be at least as highly specialize as that of a surgeon a engineer or a lawyer consequently it would seem a matter of common sense that those who have not adopt the navy as a profession should pay as much respect to the professional judgment of the naval officer as they would to that of the surgeon or the engineer or the lawyer each in he own sphere government be of course bind to be responsible for the policy of the country and policy govern defense but both in peace and in war i think it will be agree that the work of government in naval affair should end at policy and that the remainder should be leave to the expert that be the basis of real economy in association with efficiency and victory in war go to the nation which under stress and strain develop the highest efficiency in action index _ abdiel _ as minelayer admiralty the american co-operation at and the control of convoy anomaly at lack of naval
