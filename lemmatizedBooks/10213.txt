produce by dave morgan and pg distribute proofreader the everlasting whisper _ a tale of the californium wilderness _ by jackson gregory to maxwell e perkin with the author 's grateful recognition of he countless sympathetic criticism and suggestion _ chapter i _ it be springtime in the californium sierra never be sky bluer never do the golden sun-flood steep the endless forest land in richer life-giving glory ridge after ridge the mountain sweep on and fall away upon one side until in the vague distance they sink to the monotonous level of the sacramento valley down there it be already summer and field be hot and brown ridge after ridge the mountain stretch on the other side rise steadily grow ever more August and mighty and rocky on they crest across the blue gorge the snow be dazzling white and winter hold stubbornly on at altitude of seven thousand foot thus winter springtime and ripe fruit-dropping summer coexist touching finger across the seventy mile that lie between the icy top of the sierra and the burning lowland here in a region lift a mile into the rare atmosphere be a ridge all naked boulder and spire along its crest its side stud with pine and incense cedar the afternoon sunlight streak the big bronze tree trunk make bright gay spot and patch of light cast cool black shadow across the open space where the brown dead needle lay in thick carpet it be early June and thus far only have the springtime advance in its vernal progress upward through the timbered solitude some few small patch of snow still linger on in spot sheltered from the sun but now they be ebb away in thin trickle down in a hollow at the base of the sunny slope be a round alpine lake no bigger than a pond in a city park it be of the same deep perfect blue as the sky whose color it seem not to reflect but to absorb a tiny fragment of this same heavenly azure drift downward among the tree like a bit of sky fall a second bit of blue that have skim across the lake and be visible now only as it rise and wing across the contrasting color meadow rim the pool be like a bit of the lake itself two bluebird they swerve before the meet they wing flutter they light on branch of the same tree and shyly eye each other do a man need to have the still message of all the wood sum up in final emphasis this it be : spring be here the man himself as the bird have do before he have the appearance of materialize spontaneously from some distil essence of he environment a moment ago the space between the wide-set cedar-tree be empty yet he have be there a long time it be only because he have move that he attract attention even of the sharp-eyed forest folk who be return to tree and thicket as the bluebird have be viewless when merge into the background of they own color so he while sit with he back against a tawny cedar have be draw into the entity of the wilderness to which obviously he belong here he blended harmonize disappear when he hold motionless the well-worn tall lace boot be of brown leather much scuffed one in color with the soil dust they the khaki trousers gather into the boot-top the soft flannel shirt be the brown of the tree trunk skin of hand and face and muscular throat be the bronze of ripe pine-cone and burnish pine-needle and in a landscape spot with light and shadow the head of black hair might have pass for a bit of such pitch-black shadow as a tuft of thick foliage cast upon the light-smitten ground beyond this outward harmony there be something at once more intangible and yet more vital and positive that make the man a piece with the natural world about he perhaps it be that he have live so many month of so many year in the open that he have grow to be true brother of the wild that he have shed coat after coat of artificial veneer as he take on the layer of tan that in do so he shed from he mind many of the artificiality of the twentieth century and remember ancient instinct he deep chest know the trick of proper breathing he would come to the top of a steep climb with unlaboured breath he stand tall and stalwart fill with vigorous strength in repose like the straight valiant cedar he eye be black and piercing as keen as those of the hawk which circle in the deeper sky have see he when he move he too have see the hawk all about he be a lustily masculine phase of the world giant tree dominate giant slope rugged boulder upheave iron cliff defy time and battle the year he like they be virile he sex clothing he magnificently he have not shave for three day and yet instead of look untidy be but clothe in the greater vitality while he eye speed swiftly hither and thither now busy with wide grouping now catch small detail he face be impassive in keep both with he own magnificent physique and the rugged note of the forest it be the face of a man who have defy and battle beyond the lake a peak upthrust its rocky front into the sky it frown across the ridge darken by the shadow which its own irregularity cast athwart its massive feature but the sun slowly as it roll seek out those shadow they move creep to other hiding-place and the golden light coax a subdue soft gentleness across the massive boulder this too the man see he stand look out across the ridge and so to the final bulwark against the sky still white with last December he seek landmark and measure distance not in mile but in hour then he glance briefly at the sun but now before start on again he turn from the more distant landscape and remember the immediate scene about he as he have view it last drowse in the indian summer of last October he note everywhere the handiwork of young June the eye which have be keen and alert fill suddenly with a shine brightness the springtime eternally youthful coquette have come with a great outward display of timidity and shyness into the sternly solemn forest land of the high sierra to the last fine detail and exquisite touch be she more here than elsewhere softly prettily daintily feminine she light heart idly set on woo from its calm and abstracted aloofness this region of granite and lava of rugged chasm and August ancient tree she fill the air with fragrance lightly shake she scatter bright fragile flower to brighten the earth and clear bird-note to sparkle through the air hesitant always in the seem she come with that shy step of hers to the foot of glooming precipice under crest where the snow cling on she play at indifference loitering with a new flower know that little by little the thaw would answer she veil effort that in the end the monarch of all the brooding mountain top would discard the white mantle of aloofness and thrill to she embrace know too that with each successive conquest make secure she would only laugh in that singing voice of hers and turn she back and pass on on and on over ridge and range and so around the world the wood lay steep in sunshine enwrap in characteristic quietude there be no wind to ruffle the man 's hair no sound of a fall cone or of dead leaf crackle under a squirrel 's foot and yet the man have the air now of one listen hearken to the silence itself for silence among the pine be not the dead void of desert land but a great hush like the finger-to-lip command in a sleeper 's room or the still message of a sea-shell hold to the ear the countless million of cedar and pine needle seem as motionless as the very mountain themselves yet it be they who lay the gently audible command upon the balmy afternoon and whisper the great hush that whisper the man hear it seem to he less with he ear than with he soul he go back to the tree against which he have rest and pick up he hat and a small canvas roll and yet again with he hat in he hand he stand motionless he eye linger along the cliff top across the little lake he attitude that of a man listen to a invitation which he would like to accept but in the end mean to refuse already he have mark out the way he plan to go and still the nearer peak with the sunshine upon they call to he one would have hazard that they be familiar from oft-repeated visit and that among he plan to the contrary a desire to climb they insist he glance at the sun again shake he head and take the first step slantingly downward along the slope but only once more to grow as still as the big tree about he slowly he draw back into the shadow to watch and not be see for abruptly two figure have appear upon the rocky head of the mountain across the lake they have come up from the further side and when he see they first stand clear-cut against the sky they might have be hunter since each carry a rifle and yet the watcher 's brow gather in a frown and he eye glint angrily the two figure separate one go along the crest of the ridge the other climb downward cautiously until he stand at the edge of the cliff he crane he body to look down as though seek a way to the lake he straighten and stare for a long time toward the snow top of the more distant altitude the sun lay in pool all about he and across the distance separate he and he companion from the man who watch they so intently he gesture could be follow readily he turn and must have say something to he companion who leap down from a boulder and come to he side the second man tower over he head and shoulder this the eye upon the other slope be quick to note they clear briefly as though with a new understanding only to grow harder than before they talk together and yet the only sound to carry across the lake and meadow be the rush of air through innumerable tree-top the blue water glint softly under the westering sun in the blue void of the sky the hawk wheel silent and graceful and watchful the smaller man point he arm outheld steadily the other draw nearer tower above he he too point or seem about to point they stand so close together that the two figure merge from a distance they look like one man now it be with startling abruptness that the two figure be tear apart each resolve again into a individual one the towering man have draw suddenly back the other be fall and yet the silence be unbroken there be never a cry to echo through the gorge from a horror-clutched throat the fall man plunge straight down a dozen foot strike against a ragged rock writhe free fall again a few foot and begin to roll there have be the flash of the sun on the rifle in he hand he have clutch wildly at that as though it could save he now it fly from he grasp as he roll over and over plunge down the steep flank of the mountain the man who have watch from across the lake have not stir the big man on the cliff come back slowly to the brink and crouch there look down motionless so long that it be hard for the eye to be sure of he to know if it be really a human being or a poise boulder squat there there come no call from below the hawk wheel and wheel lose interest drift away in the little hollow where the lake glint it be very still with the soft perfection of the first spring day the man on the cliff stand up hold he rifle he have do with look down now he pivot slowly look off in all other direction presently he begin climb back up the few foot to the knife-like crest from which he have descend not five minute ago he pause there for hardly more than a instant and then go on down the further side out of sight the man who have see all this from he own slope catch up he canvas roll again and hurry down toward the lake for the first time he speak aloud say : swen brodie there be not another man in the mountain brute enough for that he hasten on take the shortest way make nothing of the steepest slope he be go straight toward the nearer end of the lake which he must skirt to come up the further mountain and to the man who have fall and by the way straight toward the peak still bright in the sunlight which he have want to revisit all along _ chapter ii _ much of the descent of the long slope be take at a run on plough heel he cross the springy meadow at a jog-trot but the climb to the fall man be another matter the sun be appreciably lower the shadow already make dusky tangle among the tree when the man carry the canvas roll come at last under the cliff from out these shadow before he keen eye find the man they seek he hear a voice call faintly : that you brodie no brodie 's go the voice though very weak sharpen perceptibly : you who be you what difference do it make -- if you need help who say i want help not brodie no not brodie he drop he roll and begin work he way through the bush presently he come to a spot from which he could see a figure prop up against a tree there be a rifle across the man 's knee grip in both hand and yet surely the rifle have be whirl out of he hand in he fall then he be not hurt badly after all since he have manage to work he way back up to it oh it be you be it king the man against the tree do not seem overjoyed there be a sullen note in he voice king come on break he way through the brush hello he say a little take aback it be you be it i think it would be -- but he do not say who he come on and stand over the man on the ground stoop for a instant to peer close into he face hurt much he ask the answer be a long time come the face be bloodlessly gray from it a pair of close-set shallow brown eye look shiftily a tongue run back and forth between the colourless lip it be my leg he say i do not know if it be break and i be sort of bung up he look up sharply oh i 'll be all right he grunt and do not you fool yourself do brodie -- the man begin to tremble the hand on he gun shake so that the weapon veer and waver uncertainly yes rot he soul he begin to curse at first softly then with a strained voice rise into a storm of windy incoherence suddenly he break off eye king with suspicion upon the surface of he shallow eye what be you after i do not know how badly you be hurt i come to see if i could lend you a hand you know i do not mean that what be you after here in the mountain he voice be surly with truculence king grow angry and burst out bluntly : the devil take you andy parker i want to help you if you do not take my interference kindly i 'll be on my way he turn to be off why the man be not already dead from that fall he do not know but if the fellow be able to shift for himself it suit king well enough he have business of he own and no desire to step to one side or another to deal with swen brodie or andy parker or with any man who trail he luck with such as these but now parker call to he and in a altered voice a whine run through the word hold on king i be hang up here for the night anyhow and i be not get a bite of grub and already i be burn up with thirst get I a drink will you without answer king go to he canvas roll and parker thinking himself desert begin to plead noisily on he knee king open he roll get out a cup and begin to search for water above he there be patch of snow he find where a trickle of clear cold water run in a narrow rivulet and presently return to the injured man with a brimming cup parker drink thirstily demand more and sink back with a long sigh the thing 's unlucky you know king he say queerly be it say king coolly it be like he not to pretend that he do not know to what andy parker 's thought have fly parker nod purse he lip and keep on nod like a broken automatic toy at the end he jerk he head up and mutter : there be be the devil 's luck on it for more 'n sixty year and maybe a thousand year before that oh _ you _ know look how it go with those old-timer the last one of the seven get it look how it happen with old man loony honeycutt cluck and chuckle and step up and down in he shadow all the time go nut from just _ smell _ of it look what happen to I all stove up here he pause and then spit out venomously : oh it 'll get swen brodie and it 'll get you too mark king you 'll see another drink before i go demand king parker put he finger to he scalp and examine they for trace of blood i get a terrible headache he say ache and singing and sort of dizzy king go for more water this time fill he one cook-pot when he return parker be try to stand he have draw himself up hold to the tree with both shake hand put he weight gingerly on one leg suddenly he weak hand give way he sway and fall king standing over he think at first he be dead so white and still be he but parker have only faint the sun sink lower the shadow down about the lake shore thicken and begin to run more and more swiftly up the surround slope the tall peak catch the last of the fading light and like so many watch-tower blaze across the wilderness upward about they basis surge the flooding shadow like a dark tide rise swiftly the light on the tallest spire wink and go out and all of a sudden the rush of air through the pine top strengthen and a grow murmur like the voice of a distant surf make it seem that one could hear the flood of the night sweep through gorge and cañon and inundate the world and despite all that mark king could do the sunset glow have go and the first big star be shine before andy parker stir he first call be for water then he complain of a terrible pain in he vitals a pain that stab he through from chest to abdomen thereafter he be never coherent again though for the most part he babble like a noisy brook he speak of swen brodie and old loony honeycutt and gus ingle all in one breath and king know that gus ingle be sixty year dead he dwell hectically on the luck of the unlucky seven and when far on in the night he at length grow silent and king go to peer into he face by the light of he camp-fire andy parker be dead \* \* \* \* \* mark king make the grave in the dawn in he roll the handle slip out so that it might lie snug against the steel head be a short miner 's pick a little below where parker lay in he last wide-eyed vigil under the star king find a fairly level space free of rock and carpet in young grass here with a pine-tree to mark head and foot he work at the shallow grave he put he own blanket down lay the quiet figure gently upon it bring the end over to cover he he mark the spot with a pile of rock he blaze the two tree it be all that he could do far more than andy parker would have do for he or for any other man the sun be rise when he make he way to the top of the ridge and come to stand where he have see parker and swen brodie side by side he clamber on until he come to the very crest over which swen brodie have disappear just where have brodie go he wonder the answer come before the question could have be put into word though it be full day across the height where king stand it would be a hour and longer before the sun get down into the cañons and meadow he see the flare of a camp-fire shine bright through the dark of a low-lying flat two mile or more from he vantage-point brodie would be cook he breakfast now after that king do not again climb up where he body would stand out against the sky which be fill so brightly with the new morning he move along the ridge steadily and swiftly like a man with a definite objective who do not care to be spy on in twenty minute after many a hazardous passage along a steep bare surface he come to a spot where the knife edge of the ridge be break down and blunt into a fairly level space a hundred yard across here be a accumulation of soil wear down from the granite above and here a odd isolate tuft of scrawny verdure grow a small grove of tree stunt pine and scraggle brush toward the far end of this upland flat be the disintegrate ruin of a cabin the wall have disappear long ago save for two or three rot log but a small rectangle of slightly raise ground indicate how they have extend even the rock chimney have fall away but something of the fireplace black with burn stand where labor hand have place it more than half a century before here he make he own breakfast from what be ready cook in he pack dispense with the fire which would inevitably tell brodie of he presence for brodie callously brutish as he be must be something less than human not to turn he chill blue icelandic eye toward the spot where he have abandon he fall companion king 's first interest be centre on the ground underfoot he go back and forth and about the ruin of the cabin several time seek any sign that would tell he if brodie and andy parker have be here before he but there be no track in the softer soil no trodden-down grass it be very likely that no foot have come here since king 's own last October a look of satisfaction shone for a instant in he eye then do with this keen examination they go with curious eagerness to the more distant landscape he pass through the storm-broken tree and to the far rim of the flat where he stand a long time stare frowningly at one after another of the spire and ridge lift against the sky probe into the mystery of the night still slumber in the ravine now he look have to do in intent concentration with a slope not five hundred yard off now with a blue-and-white summit toward which a man might toil all day and all night before reach he might have be the figure of the explorer grim and hard and determine silent and solitary in a land of silence and solitude brooding over a region where the trail run out and stop something urge something call and he blood respond about he rise the voice of the endless league of pine in a hushed utterance which might have be the whisper : something hide go and find it go and look behind the range -- something lose behind the range lose and wait for you go he make sure that he have leave no sign of he visit here not so much as a fall crust of bread catch up he pack and find the familiar way down the cliff strike off toward the higher mountain and the high pass through which he would travel to-night _ chapter iii _ to have follow the pace which he set that day would have break the heart of any but a seasoned mountaineer no man in these mountain could have so much as keep he in sight saving alone swen brodie and he be leave far back yonder mile on the other lower side of the ridge by mid-forenoon king have outstrip the springtime and be among snow patch which grow in frequency and extent at noon he build he little fire on a snow crust he cross a rage tributary of the american travel upward along the rock-bound spray-wet gorge a full mile before he come to the possible precarious ford at six o'clock he make a second fire in a bleak windy pass surround by a glimmer ghostly waste tree be stiff with frost the wind whistle and jeer through they and about sharp crag fill the crisp air with eerie shuddersome music he set he coffee to boil while meditate that down in the sacramento valley which one could glimpse from here by day it be stifle hot like midsummer he rest by he fire with he canvas draw up about he shoulder smoke he pipe remake he pack and go on he count on the moon presently and a bed at a slightly lower altitude among the tree to-night andy parker be sleep in he army blanket he crunch along over the snow crust which rarely fail he and though the daylight pass swiftly the dead-white surface seem to hold a absorb radiance and shed it softly by the time he get down to the timber-line again the moon be up he leave the country of five lake well to he left ignore the invitation of the trail beyond down the tall wall of squaw creek cañon he go straight down the long pitch of the mountain head tenaciously toward the tiny lakelet which so far as he know have be nameless until he old friend ben gaynor have build a summer home there two year ago and have christen the pond among the tree lake glorium mark king like the appellation little enough tell himself with thorough-going unreason that there be a silly name to fit to perfection a silly girl but altogether out of place to tie on to a unspoiled sierra lake ben would have do a better job in name it lake vanity or self-regard king could think of a score of designation more to the point for though he have never so much as set he eye on either glorium or she mother he have he own opinion of both of they nor do he in the least realize that that opinion be base rather less on actual knowledge than mould by he own peculiar form of jealousy that jealousy which one time-tried friend feel when the other allow love of woman to occupy a higher place than friendship he make he camp at eight o'clock in a sheltered spot among the fir he build a fire make a mat of bough wrap himself up in he canvas and go promptly to sleep he awake cold get he blood run by stamp about put on fresh fuel and go to sleep again he foot toward the blaze half a dozen time he be up during the night before dawn he have he coffee boil before the sun be up he be well on he way again drive the cramped chill out of he by walk vigorously and at nine o'clock that morning he stand on the bench of a timbered slope whence look downward through the tree he get he first glimpse of lake glorium and of the rambling log house which ben gaynor have be prevail on to build here in the wild a dozen mile from the lake tahoe road he note as he come nearer swing along down the slope and see the little valley with its green meadow and azure lake how ben have have a log dam throw across the pond 's lower end back up the water and make it widen out he see a couple of graceful canoe rest tranquilly on they own reflection a pretty bathing-house already green with lusty hop-vine ben gaynor have be spend money a good deal of money and no one know better than mark king that ben have be close-hauled these latter year he shrug tell himself to pull up short and not find fault with he friend or what he friend do or with those whom he friend love a hour later he come to the grove of sugar-pine back of the house here he pause a moment though he be all eagerness for he meeting with gaynor he have see a number of person come out of the house a dozen or more pour out brightly as gay as butterfly man and woman they laughter float out to he through the still sunny morning the deeper note of man a cluster of ripple note from a girl he want to see gaynor not a lot of gaynor 's san francisco guest no not gaynor 's rather the friend of gaynor 's womenfolk it be king 's hope that they be go down toward the lake thus he would avoid meet they he would come in at the back have he talk with ben and be on he way without the bear of shake a lot of flabby hand and listen to a lot of gush exclamation he stand very still where he be unseen as he lean against a light-and-shadow-dappled pine a girl break away from the knot of summer-clad figure run a few step down the path toward the lake poise gracefully execute a stagy little pose with head back and arm outflung as though in a ecstasy of delight that the world be so fair she be a bright spot of color with she pink dress and white shoe and stocking and lacy parasol and brown hair and for a little he eye go after she quite as they would have follow the flight of a brilliant bird then as in sheer youth as one who during a night of refreshing sleep have be steep body and soul in the elixir that be youth 's own she yield she young body up to a extravagant dance whirling away as light as thistledown across the meadow hand clap after she voice man 's voice fill she ear with a clamor of praise as extravagant as she own dancing the guest go troop gaily after she king seize he chance and go swiftly toward the house as he go he note that the girl alone be watch he she be face he while the other have turn they back upon the house she have abandon she dance and be stand very still obviously interested in the rough-clad boot figure which have seem so abruptly to materialize from the forest land ben gaynor have see he through a window and meet he at the door they hand meet in the way of old friendship grip hard further ben beat the dust out of he shoulder with a hard-falling open palm as he lead the way inside my wife have be say for year that you be a myth say gaynor the gleam in he eye as youthful as it have ever be that you be no more flesh and blood than the unicorn or the dodo bird to-day i 'll show she they be up half the night dancing and fuss around she will be down in two shake though in the meantime we can talk say king i have get something to tell you ben gaynor lead the way through a room where be piano and victrolum and from the floor of which the rug be still roll through a dining-room and into what be at once a small library and gaynor 's study king note that even a telephone have find its way hither a chair pull forward a box of cigar offer and the two friend take stock in each other 's eye of what the last year have do for each you look more fit than ever mark -- and younger king want to say the same thing of he friend but the word do not come gaynor be by far the older man king 's senior by a score of year and obviously have begin to feel the burden of the latter greying day or of care flock along with they they generally come together he be seriously accept responsibility where mark gather unto himself fresh hope and eager joy the responsibility which come in the wake of wife and daughter a home to be maintain in the city the necessity to adapt himself even if stiffly to unfamiliar condition this big log house itself it seem to king be carry on the back of old ben they have be friend together since king could remember since ben have big-brothered he carry he on he back teach he to swim and shoot then one year while king be off at school he friend take unto himself a wife this with no permission from mark king not even after a conference with he in fact to he utter bewilderment king do not so much as know of the event until gaynor after a month of honeymoon remembered to drop he a brief note the bald fact jar king be hurt and grow angry and resentful with all of that unreason of a boy he go off to alaska without a word to gaynor with the passage of time the friend have again grow intimate have be partner in more than one deal and the youthful relationship have be cement by the year but it have happen seemingly purely through chance although king know better that he have never meet gaynor 's wife or daughter when glorium be little mr gaynor have be impress by the desirability of a city environment have urge the larger school music teacher proper young companion and a host of somewhat vague advantage hence a large part of the year gaynor keep bachelor 's quarter in he own little lumber town in the mountain where he business interest hold he and where he wife and daughter come during a few week in the summer to visit he at such period king always manage to be away this year the wife and daughter draw by the new summer home have come early in the season and king 's business be urgent besides he have tell himself a dozen time there really exist no sane reason in the world why he should avoid ben gaynor 's family as though they be leprous what king say in answer to he friend 's approval be by way of a bantering : miracle do happen here 's ben gaynor play he be a bird of paradise or emulate beau brummel which be it ben and whence the fine idea gaynor with a strange sort of smile king think half sheepish and the other half tender cast a downward glance along the encasement of the outer man silk shirt a very pure white bright tie very new white flannel very spick and span silken hose and low white tie this garb for ben gaynor the lumberman who feel not entirely at he ease hence the sheepish grin a fond father deck out by he daughter as king well guess hence that gleam of tenderness glorium 's doings he chuckle send ahead from san francisco with explicit command i guess i would wear a monkey-jacket if she say so mark but none the less he eye as they appraise the rough garb of he guest be envious i can breathe better just the same in boot like yours he conclude he stretch he long arm high above he head i wish i could get out into the wood for a spell with you mark and he do not know do not in the least suspect that he be fail the minutest iota in he loyalty to glorium and she mother he be think only of they guest whom he could not quite consider he own the very thing say king eagerly that be just what i want but gaynor shake he head and he thin aristocratic face be briefly overcast and for a instant shadow creep into he eye no can do mark he say quietly not this time i have get both hand full and then some king lean forward in he chair he hand grip gaynor 's knee ben it be there i have always know it always be willing to bet my last dollar now i would gamble my life on it gaynor 's mouth tighten and he eye flash between you and I mark he say in a voice which drop confidentially i would like mighty well to have my share right now i have go in pretty deep here of late a little over my head it begin to look i have branch out where i would have better play my own game and be content with thing as they be go i -- but he break off suddenly he be close to the edge of disloyalty now what make you so sure he ask i come up this time from georgetown you remember the old trail up by gerle 's red cliff and hell hole leave french meadow and heaven 's gate and mount mildr ` way off to the left i have it all pretty much my own way until i come to lookout ridge and who do you suppose i find poke around there not old loony honeycutt cry gaynor then he laugh at himself for allow a association of idea to lead to so absurd a thought of course not honeycutt i see he last week as you want I to and he be cabin-bound down in coloma as usual can not drag he wicked old foot out of he yard who then mark swen brodie then and andy parker gaynor frown impressed as king have be before he but he object as he ponder he might have be there for some other reason brodie i mean remember that the ancient and time-honoured pastime of the kentucky mountain have come into vogue in the west everybody know and that include even the government agent in san francisco that there be a lot of moonshine be make in out-of-the-way place of the californium mountain there be a job for swen brodie and he crowd there be talk of it mark maybe king admit but brodie be look for something and not revenue man at that he and parker be up on the cliff not a quarter-mile from the old cabin they stand close together right at the edge parker fall brodie look down turn on he heel and go off smoke he stinking pipe most likely i bury parker the next morning poor devil say gaynor then he brow shoot up and he demand : you mean brodie do for he shove he over that be exactly what i mean but i can not tie it to brodie not so that he could not shake himself free of it parker do not say so in so many word i see the whole thing from the mountain across the lake too far to swear to anything like that but this i can swear to : brodie be in there for the same thing we have be after for ten year and what be more it be open and shut that he be of a mind to play whole-hog and push andy parker over to simplify matter in my mind even though i can not hope to ram that down a jury how do you _ know _ what brodie and parker be after andy parker he be sullen and tight-mouthed for the most part until delirium get he then he babble by the hour and all he talk be of gus ingle and the devil 's luck of the unlucky seven with every now and then a word for loony honeycutt and swen brodie if there be such a thing as devil 's luck say gaynor with a sober look to he face this thing seem plastered thick with it king grunt he derision we 'll take a chance ben he say and after all one man 's bane be another man 's bread you know now i have tell you my tale let 's have yours you see honeycutt could you get anything out of he only this that you be dead right about he know or think that he know he be feebler than he be last fall a great deal feebler both in body and mind all day he sit on he step in the sun and peer through he bleary eye across the mountain and chuckle to himself like a old hen ` oh i know what you be after ' he cackle at I shrewd enough to hit the nail square too mark ` and ' he ramble on ` you have come to the right man but be i goin ' to blab now havin ' keep a shut mouth all these year ' and then he go on he rheumy-red eye blinking to proclaim that he be feel a whole lot stronger these day that he be get he second wind so to speak that come mid-spring he 'll be as frisky as a colt and that then he mean to have what be he own and that be as close as

deep and i 'll dig down to the bottom and if we draw a blank but there be a step at the door the knob be turn mark king turn utterly unconscious of the quick stiffening of he body as he await the introduction to ben 's wife _ chapter iv _ at first king be take aback by mr ben 's youthfulness or look of youth as he understand presently he know that she be within a few year of ben 's age and yet certainly she show no sign of it to he eye which though keen enough be after a male fashion unsophisticated she be a very pretty woman _ petite _ alert and decidedly winsome he understand in a flash why ben should have be attract to she how she have hold he to she own policy all these year largely because they be hers she be dress daintily she glossy brown hair be becomingly arrange about the bright smile face she choose to be very gracious to she husband 's life-long friend give he a small plump hand in a welcome grip establish he in a instant by some sleight of femininity which king do not plumb as a hearthside intimate most affectionately regard he first two impression of she arrive almost but not quite simultaneously be of youthful prettiness and cleverness she slip to a place on the arm of gaynor 's chair she hand whose well-kept beauty catch and hold king 's eye for a moment toy with she husband 's greying hair she love old ben think king that be right mr ben gaynor be what be know as a bear hostess very charming hostess to she husband of whom she see somewhat less each year than of a number of other friend she have always the exactly proper meed of intimacy to offer each guest in accordance with the position he have come to occupy or which she mean he to occupy in she household akin to she in instinct be those distinguish lady of the colorful past of whom romantic history have it that in the salon of they doting lord and master they give direction together with impetus or retardation to muddy political current clever woman not that cleverness necessarily connote heartlessness she adore ben you could see that in she quick dark eye which be always animated with expression if she be not more at he side the matter be simply explain she adore they daughter glorium no less and probably somewhat more and glorium need she surely gaynor 's need those of a grown man be less than those of a young girl whose bud youth must be perfect in flower and if mr ben be indefatigable in keep herself young while ben quietly accept the gathering year it be with no thought of coquet with other man but only that she might remain a older sister to she daughter maintain the closer contact and see that glorium make the most of life any small misstep which she herself have make in life she daughter must be save from make all of she unsatisfied yearning must be fulfil for glorium she constitute herself cup-bearer wine-taster and handmaiden for they daughter if it be necessary to engrave another fine line in old ben 's forehead in order to add a softer tint to glorium 's rise petal she be sincerely sorry for ben but the desirable rise tint be select with none the less steady hand ben gaynor 's eye follow he wife pridefully when at the end of fifteen pleasant sunny minute she leave they and then go swiftly to he friend 's face seek approbation and he find it king have rise as she go out hold himself with a hint of stiffness as be he unconscious way when infrequently in the presence of woman now he turn to ben with a odd smile pretty tardy date to congratulate you old man he say with a laugh do not believe i ever remember it before do i ben glow and rub he long hand together in rich contentment she be a wonder mark he say heartily mark nod a emphatic approval word which ben perhaps look for he do not add everything have be say in the one word congratulate spring from good old pioneer stock too mark say gaynor would not think now to look at she that she be bear at gold run in a family as rugged as yours and mine would you with precious few advantage until she be a girl grow look at what she have make of herself while you and i and the likes of we have be content to stay pretty much in the rough she have not there be not a more accomplished culture little woman this or the other side boston even if she do hail from gold run and as for glorium all she do why and he chuckle she have not the slightest idea i suppose that she ever have a grandfather who sweat and go about in shirt-sleeve and chew tobacco and swear have to go all the way back to a grandfather laugh king look at I challenge gaynor thrust into notice he immaculate attire he chuckle one must live down he disgraceful past for he daughter you know from without come a gust of shout and laughter from the gaynor guest skylark along the lake shore come say ben you 'll have to meet the crowd mark and i want you to see my little girl i have tell she so many yarn about you that she be die of curiosity king though he would have prefer to tramp ten mile over rough trail glean small joy from meeting stranger not of he sort who would never be anything but stranger to he accept the inevitable without demur and follow he host he would shake hand say a dozen stupid word and escape for a good long talk with ben then before the lunch-hour he would be off gaynor lead the way toward a side door pass through a hallway and a wide sun-room thus they come abreast of a wide stairway lead to the second storey down the glisten tread make she entrance like the heroine in a play just at the proper instant in answer to she cue come glorium glorium call gaynor papa say miss glorium i want -- oh you be not alone instinctively king frown now why do she say that he ask within himself for she have see he come to the house straight-dealing himself circuitous way even in trifle awake he distrust come here my dear say ben mark this be my little girl glorium you know all about this wild man he be mark king indeed yes cry glorium she come smile down the stairway a fluffy pink puffball float fairy-wise she two hand be out ingenuously pretty little pink-nailed hand which have do little in this world beyond adorn charmingly the extremity of two soft round arm for a instant king feel the genial current within he freeze as he stiffen to meet the girl he have watch in the extravagant dance down to the lake then get he first near view of she he eye widen he have never see anything just like she with that he begin realize dully that he be stray into strange pasture he take she two hand because there be nothing else to do feeling just a trifle awkward in the unaccustomed act he look down into glorium 's face which be lift so artlessly up to he hers be the softest tenderest gray eye he have ever look into he have the uneasy fear that he hard rough hand be rasp the fine soft skin of hers yet there be a warm pleasurable thrill in the contact glorium be very much alive and warm-bodied and beautiful she be like those flower which king know so well fragrant dainty blossom which lift they little face from the highest of the old mountain into the rarest of sky growth seem to partake of some celestial perfection hardy though they clothe themselves in a outward seeming of fragile delicacy _ physically _ -- he emphasize the word and barricade himself behind it as though he be on the defense against she -- she come nearer perfection than he have think a girl could come and nowhere do he find a conflict detail from the tendril of sunny brown hair touch the curve of the sweet young face to the little foot in they click high-heeled shoe thus from the beginning he think of she in superlative and thus do gloria like the springtime coquet with a aloof and silent wilderness make she bright entry into mark king 's life i have be acting-up like a comanche indian outside laugh glorium it be she who withdraw she hand king start inwardly wonder how long he have be hold they how long he would have hold they if she have not be so serenely mistress of the moment my hair be all tumble down and i have to run upstairs to fight it back where it belong be not a girl 's hair a terrible affliction mr king one of these day when papa 's back be turn i be go to cut it off short like a boy 's a explanation of she presence in the house while she guest be still in the yard why explain so trifling a matter a suggestion that she retain that lustrous crown of hair just to please she papa whereas one who have not be tell might have be mistake in he belief that this should be one of she greatest pride two little fib for miss glorium yet certainly very small fib which hurt no one glorium 's eye despite they soft tenderness be every whit as quick as mark king 's when they be as now intrigue of course both she and king have hear countless reference one of the other from ben gaynor but neither have be greatly interested king have know that there be a baby girl long ago that fact have be impress on he with such rare eloquence that it have create a mental picture which until now have be vivid and like a indelible drawing he have know have he ever pause for reflection which he have not that a baby would not stay such during a period of eighteen year she have hear a thousand tale of my good friend mark mark thus have be in she mind a man of she father 's age and about such a young girl 's romantic idea do not flock but from the first glimpse of the boot figure among the tree she have sense other thing king would have blush have he know how picturesque he bulk in she eye how now while she smile at he so ingenuously she be do he thorough-going masculinity full tribute how the ruggedness of he the very scent of the resinous pine he bear along with he the clear manlike look of he eye and the warm dusky tan of face and hand -- even the effect of the careless worn boot and the muscular throat show through a open shirt-collar -- put a delicious little shiver of excitement into she miss glorium have a pretty way of commanding half beseech and yet altogether tyrannical king have agree to stay to luncheon be in the bathroom off gaynor 's room shave glorium have catch she father and drag he off into a corner oh papa he be simply magnificent why do not you _ tell _ I why he be not a bit old and -- and she make he repaint for she the high light of a episode of mark king make a name for himself and a fortune at the same time in the klondike country she dance away singing to she abandon friend who be return to the house it be _ the _ mark king my dear she tell they triumphantly not unconscious of the depressing result of she disclosure upon a couple of boy of the college age who adore openly and with frequent lapse from glorious hope to bleak despair the man who make history in the klondike the man who fight he way alone across fifteen hundred mile of snow and ice and win -- oh -- i do not know _ what _ kind of a fight against all kind of odds the very mark king he be papa 's best friend you know let he be you dad 's friend then say the young fellow with the pampered pompadour he eye show a glint of sullen jealousy that be no reason -- why archie cry glorium you be make yourself just horrid you do not want to make I sorry i ever invite you here do you and a brief half-hour ago archie have flatter himself that glorium 's dancing have be chiefly for he they be all of glorium 's set with one noteworthy exception he she call mr gratton while the other be archie and teddy and georgium and evelyn and connie it be to this mr gratton that she turn have make a piquant face at the dejected college youth _ you _ will like he immensely i know she say while the ear of poor archie redden even as he be be lead away by the not very pretty but extremely comforting georgium he be a real man every inch of he -lrb- every inch a king she think quickly unashamed of the pun -rrb- a big man who do big thing in a big way she run on indicate that she too after that brief meeting have be lure into superlative mr gratton smile urbanely for he own part he might have be call every inch a concrete expression of suavity he be clothe in the conventional city-dweller 's outdoor rig shine puttee lie bravely about the shape of he leg brown outing breeches crease lace at they abbreviated end shirt of the sport effect a shrewd-eyed man of thirty-five with ambition a chalky complexion and a very weak mouth with full red lip miss glorium he whisper as he manage to have she all to himself a moment you 'll make I jealous she be use to he say stupid thing yet she laugh and seem pleased gratton egotistically suppose she thought be of he king would have be amaze to know that she be already watch the house for he come and he would have be no end amaze and bristle with defense have he glimpse the astonishing fact that glorium already fully and clearly mean to parade he before she summer friend as she latest and most virile admirer gratton 's heavy-lidded pale eye trail over she speculatively that forenoon king shake hand with archie teddy gratton and the rest make he formal bow to glorium 's girl friend and feel relief when the inept banality languish and he be free to draw apart gratton with slender finger to he shadowy moustache bear down upon he king do not like this suave individual he have the habit of judge a man by first impression and stick stubbornly to he snap judgment until circumstance show he to be in error he like neither the way gratton walk nor talk he have no love for the cut of he eye now he resent be approach when there be no call for it never be there a more friendly man anywhere than mark king when he find a soul-brother never a more aloof at time like this one i have be tremendously interested gratton lead off ingratiatingly in the thing i have hear of you mr king by george man like you live the real life the wild fancy come boom upon king to kick he over the verandah railing think so he say coolly wonder despite himself what thing gratton have hear of he and from whom he spirit groan within he at the thought that old ben gaynor have be lure into path along which he should come to hobnob with man like gratton he be sorry that he have promise to stay to lunch he thought all of a sudden be restive fly off to swen brodie to loony honeycutt to what he must get do without too much delay gratton startle he by speak bring he thought back from across the ridge to the sunny verandah overlook lake glorium gratton be nobody 's fool save he own and both marked and resent king 's attitude he heavy lid have a flutter way at time during which he prominent eye seem to flicker what be the chance with gus ingle 's ` secret ' this year mr king he demand silkily king wheel on he what do you know about it he say sharply and who have be talk to you gratton laugh look wise and amuse and stroll away at luncheon mr gaynor place she guest at table out on the porch conscious of she daughter 's watchful eye when all be seat mark king find himself with miss glorium at he right and a unusually plain and unattractive girl name georgium on he left everybody talk king alone content himself with brevity over dessert he find himself drift into _ tête-á-tête _ with miss glorium they push back they chair he find himself still drift this time physically and still with glorium as they two stroll out through the grove at the back of the log house there be a splendid pool there boulder-surround a thoroughly romantic sort of spot in glorium gaynor 's fancy a most charming background for springtime loitering the gush and babble of the bright water tumble in rush out fill the air singingly glorium want to ask mr king about a certain little bird which she have see here a little fellow who might have be the embodiment of the stream 's joy she know from she father that king be a intimate friend of wild thing and could tell she all about it they sit in glorium 's favorite nook very silent now and then with a whisper from glorium await the come of the bird _ chapter v _ but my darling daughter gasp mr gaynor you do not in the least understand what you be about but my darling mother mimic miss glorium light of tone but with all of the calm assurance of she year i do know exactly what i be about i always do and anyway with a frenchy little shrug which she have adopt and adapt last season i be go but exclaim she mother already route as be inevitable and now look toward the essential consideration what in the world will every one say and think in the tall mirror before she glorium regard she boot and riding-breeches critically then she little hat and the blue flannel short too mannish never with glorium in they a expression in very charming curve of triumphant girlhood what in the world be mark king thinking of demand she mother what do you suppose say glorium tranquilly he would have be very rude if he have not be think of you little daughter besides he have very little to do with the matter glorium and what be more there be a moon remember that mamma she tie the big scarlet silk handkerchief about she throat and turn to be kiss mr gaynor look distressed there be actually tear try to invade she troubled eye and she hand be nervous but you will be go all day oh mamma gloria begin to grow impatient what if i be mr king be a gentleman be not he he be not go to eat I be he why do you make such a fuss over it all do you want to spoil everything for I you know i do not but -- we have have nothing but ` but ' since i tell you i should have leave you a note and slip out she bestow upon the worried face a pecking little kiss and tiptoe to the door wait glorium what shall i tell every one they be you _ guest _ after all -- tell they i ask to be excuse for the day beyond that you be rather good at smooth out thing i 'll trust you but -- i mean _ and _ -- and mr gratton oh tell he to go to the devil cry glorium it will do he no end of good and while mr gaynor stare after she she close the door softly and go tiptoe downstairs and out into the brighten dawn where mark king await she with the horse from behind a window-curtain glorium 's mother watch the girl trip away through the meadow to the stable set back among the tree king be lead the saddle horse to meet she glorium give he she gauntleted hand in a greet the degree of friendliness of which be gauge by the clever eye at the window friendliness already arrive at a stage of intimacy king lift glorium into she saddle glorium 's little laugh have in it a flutter of excitement as she cavalier 's strength take she by delighted surprise and off she foot they ride away through the thin shadow mr gaynor despite the earliness of the hour go straight to she husband awake he mercilessly and tell he everything oh he say when she have do and he have turn over for another hour or so of sleep that be all right mark tell I about it last night and you do not say a word to I forget say ben but do not worry mark 'll take care of she she leave he to he innocent slumber and begin dress already she be busy with plan just what to say and how to say it glorium know she think with some complacency that she mother could be depend upon in any situation demand the delicate touch she would be about cool and smile when the first guest appear it would be suppose that she and glorium and mr king have be quite a merry trio as the morning adventure be be arrange that first guest stir would be mr gratton on hand to pounce on glorium and get she out of the house for a run down to the lake a dash in a canoe or a brief stroll across the meadow before the breakfast-gong instead of glorium 's terse message for he she have quite a elaborate and laughing tale to tell after all glorium usually do know what she be about and if mr gratton mean all that he look -- mr gaynor have cast up a rough draft of everything she would say that morning before she open the door to go downstairs and for reason very clear to she and which she have no doubt would be view with equal clarity by glorium after this escapade of hers be do with she mean to be very tactful indeed with mr gratton \* \* \* \* \* never have mark king know pleasanter companionship than gloria gaynor afford this bright morning they pass up the trail over the first ridge drop down into a tiny wild little valley and have the world all alone to themselves only now be the sun up and there in the mountain blaze forth cheerily it seem to shine for they alone when they ride side by side glorium chat brightly athrill with animation vivid with she rioting youth when the narrow trail demand and she ride ahead bright little snatch of lilting song or broken exclamation float back to the man whose eye shine with he enjoyment of she on every hand this be all a bright new world to she she have never run wild in the hill as she mother have do through she girlhood she have never be particularly interested in all of this sprawl ruggedness now she have a hundred eager question she see the shine splendor of the solitude through king 's eye she turn to he with full confidence for the name of a flower the habit of a bird even though the latter unseen among the tree have only announce himself by a half-dozen enraptured note yesterday surrender she volatile self to a very natural and quite innocent feminine instinct glorium have fully determine to parade mark king before she envious friend as very much she own property it be merely a bit of the game the old old game at which she be richly favor by nature be as skilful as a girl of eighteen or nineteen could possibly be in the eternal skirmish she be a enterprising young savage with many scalp dangle from she triumphant belt the pet pompadour of poor archie the curly lock of teddy the stiff black brush of mr gratton be to have a add fellow in king 's trophy then she have catch a word between she father and he friend have hear honeycutt mention and a ride to coloma and on the break of the instant have determine with a young will which invariably go unthwarted that high adventure be beckon she a ride on horseback through the mountain with a man who have stir she more than a little who fill she romantic fancy with picturesque glamour who be on a quest of which she know ten time more than he have any idea she know and that quest itself pure golden glamour everywhere hence some few minute afterward in a cosy nook of the verandah while the other dance the moon and glorium be serenely victorious king once assure that the long ride be not too hard for she saw no slightest reason for object to she come he do not think of all of that which would mean so much to ben 's wife -- the convention and what would people say convention do not thrive in such region as the high sierra ben to whom king mention the thing look at it quite as do he friend glorium would be in good hand and ought to have a cork good time he wish he could get away to go along so king telephone to san francisco arrange to have three thousand dollar -- in cash -- send immediately to he at coloma and to-day fancy himself strictly attend to business with a undivided mind i know now where the original garden of eden be gloria turn to look back at he as he come on through a delightful flowery upland meadow sit she horse gracefully upon a slight hillock herself and she restless mount bath in sunshine she cheek warm with the flush upon they she lip red with course life she eye dance it be perfectly lovely it be pure heavenly king nod and smile he be not give to many word grow taciturn as be mountaineer inevitably train in long habit to approve in silence of that which please he most so while glorium 's eager tongue trip along as busily as the brook they ford he be for the most part silent a extended arm to point out a big snow-plant blood-red against a little heap of snow be as eloquent as the speak word thus he indicate much that might have pass unnoticed by glorium keenly enjoy she lively admiration to-day he choose always the easier trail since with the good horse under they they have ample time to come to loony honeycutt 's place well before midday also they stop frequently king make a excuse of show she point of interest the tiny valley where one could be sure of a glimpse of a brown bear the grazing-land of mountain deer the pass into the cliff-bound hiding-place of the picturesque highwayman of a earlier day whence they drive steal horse into nevada where they secrete other horse steal in nevada and to be dispose of down in the sacramento valley there last until this very day the ruin of they rock house snuggle into the mountain under they lookout-point it would be fun say glorium the spell of the wilderness mystery upon she she eye half wistful and altogether serious to be lose out here just to get far far away from people and ever so close to the big old mountain would not it and a few minute later she draw in she horse and cry out softly : listen she herself be listen breathlessly it sound like the ocean ever so far off or -- or like shout voice a million mile away or like the mountain themselves whisper it be hard to believe be not it that it be just the wind in the pine another time while under the pretext of let they horse blow king have suggest a short halt to give the girl a chance to rest she say with abruptness : what do you think of mr gratton already she know mark king well enough to realize that he would either refuse to answer or would speak he mind without beat about the bush i do not like he say king glorium look thoughtful neither do i she say not up here in the mountain and down in san francisco i think he rather splendid what be more if we be whisk back to san francisco this minute i would probably think he fine again she appear interested in the consideration and when they ride on be silent obviously turn the matter over and over in mind \* \* \* \* \* to-day be three mystery tremblingly close to reveal themselves one to another : the great green mystery of the woodland the mystery of a man clothe in he masculinity as in a outer garment the tender mystery of a young girl athrill with romance effervescent with youth she own thought half veil from herself she instinct alive and urgent and often all in confusion how could a man like mark king quite understand a girl like glorium how could a girl like glorium with all of she surety of she own decision understand a man like king each glimpse that day much of the other 's true character and yet all the while the mainspring be just out of sight unguessed undreamed of at glorium 's age if one be a girl and very pretty and make much of by adoring parent and a host of boy and man the world be a extremely nice place inhabit exclusively by individual press forward to do she reverence she be beautiful she be vivacious fill with delight she be a sparkling fountainhead of joy she be so superabundantly supply with eager happiness that she radiate happiness if she think a very great deal of herself so for that matter do every other individual in the world it be merely that with all of she sophistication she remain much more naive than she would ever believe she be a coquette because she be female she be please with herself and with the high excuse that every one else be please with she hence she demand adoration as a right if she ride on a street-car she fully expect that the conductor will regard she admiringly and that the motorman will turn he head after she she do not expect to marry either of these gentleman she do not particularly require they flattering attention glorium do not expect to marry archie or teddy or mr gratton she have no thought of be any one 's wife that term after all at glorium 's age be a drab and humdrum thing she do not dream of mark king as a possible husband another unromantic title she merely hunger for male admiration it be the wine of life the breath in she nostril as it happen to be to some countless million of other girl all of which be so clearly a pretty nearly universal condition that it would seem that if mark king have have he wit about he he must have realize it and yet have he glimpse that which should have be so obvious he would have be startle somewhat shocked and would have grieve over he friend 's empty-headed daughter hold she unmaidenly -- when she be but dally with dream which mean so much to all maiden but glorium do not say to he : mark king i be determine that you shall adore I pretty face pretty figure pretty way and all nor yet to herself do she put thing so baldly she do however yield herself luxuriously to the springtime the romance of the hour the appeal of she latest cavalier and preen herself like a mating bird king see admire and in he own fashion play he own part it be not clear to he that there have be a new pleasure in he own strength when he have lift she into she saddle and yet she little breathless laugh have ring musically in he ear have a man arise to announce jibingly that mark king be show off before a girl like a boy of ten though within bound he would have call the man a liar and forthwith have kick he out of the landscape they ride on side by side each content with see only that which lay on the surface -- both of he companion and of himself in a word they be live life naturally without demand of the great theatrical manager to know exactly what part they be to play in the human comedy externals suffice just now the fragrant still forest the pulse-stirring sunshine the warm fruitful earth below and the blue sky above from the first he call she glorium quite naturally to she he be mr king but the mark slip out before they come into sight of the roof of picturesque coloma _ chapter vi _ you be sure you will not be go more than a hour glorium ask never it seem to she have she see a lonelier-looking place than old coloma drowse on the fringe of the wilderness the street into which they have ridden be desert save for a couple of dog make each other 's acquaintance suspiciously why be it more lonesome here than it have be back there in the mountain she wonder less than a hour he assure she what business i have can be do in fifteen minute if it can be do at all but in the meantime what will you do oh say glorium i 'll just poke around it will be fun to see what kind of people live here he put the horse in the stable water and feed they himself and come back to she outside the front double door she have drop down on a box in the sun he think that there be a little droop to she shoulder and small wonder he admit with a tardy sense of guilt all these hour in the saddle -- tired much he ask solicitously the shoulder straighten like a soldier 's she jump up and whirl smilingly not a bit tired she tell he brightly that be good but i could get a room for you at the hotel you could lie down and rest a couple of hour -- glorium would not hear to it if she do want to lie down she would go out under one of the tree and rest there she trudge along with he to the post-office she watch as mark call for and get a register parcel further she mark that the postmaster appear curious about the package so heavily insure until over mark 's shoulder he catch a glimpse of she and that thereafter crane he neck as they go out he evidence a greater interest in she than in a bundle insure for three thousand dollar she be smile brightly when mark king hurry off to he meeting with old loony honeycutt honeycutt 's shanty ancient twisted warped and ugly like himself stand well apart from the flock of house as though like himself even in this it be suspicious and mean to keep its own business to itself only one other building have approach it in neighbourly fashion and this originally have be honeycutt 's barn now it have a couple of crazy window cut crookedly into its side and a stovepipe thrust up also crookedly through the shake roof and be know as the mcquarry place here one might count on finding swen brodie at such time as he favor coloma with he hulk presence here foregather he hanger-on a idle crowd for the most part save when the devil find mischief for they to do they might be expect to be represent by one or two of they number loaf about headquarters and king realize that he visit to loony honeycutt be not likely to pass unnoticed what he have not count on be find swen brodie himself before he in honeycutt 's shanty king see no one walk through the weed to honeycutt 's door the door be close the window down -- dirty window every corner of

king hold he silence he whole argument be on the table \* \* \* \* \* only now and then do king catch a glimpse of honeycutt 's eye for the most part hide by he lowered lid and bent head at such time though he have count on have to do with cupidity he be startle by the look he see here be the expression of the one emotion which dwell on in the withered time-beaten body here be _ love _ in one of its ten thousand form love that be burn desire that quench all other spark of the spirit that be boundless love of a hideously grotesque and deform sort love defile twisted misshapen as though ero have become a ugly malformed leering monstrosity that love which be the expression of the last degree of selfish greed since it demand all and give nothing that love which be like a rank weed choke tenderer growth or more like a poisonous snake now it dominate the old man utterly the world beyond the rectangular top of the table do not exist now its elixir pour through he artery so that for the first time in month there come pinkish spot upon the withered cheek show through the scatter soil gray hair of he beard suddenly king go to the door standing in the sunshine fill he lung with the outside air the sight of the gloat miser sicken he more than that it sicken he fancy so that for a minute he ask himself what he and brodie be do the lure of gold the thing have hypnotize he he wish that he be out in the mountain ride among the pine and cedar listen to the voice of the wilderness it be clean out there listen to glorium 's happy voice living in tune with the springtime think a man 's thought dream a man 's dream do a man 's work and all for something other than just gold at the end of it but the emotion like a vertigo pass as swiftly as it have come for he know within himself that never have that twisted travesty of love stir within he that though he have travel on many a golden trail it be clean-heartedly that it be the game itself that count ever with he and no such poisonous emotion as grow within the wretched breast of loony honeycutt and these golden trail though inevitably they bring he trail fellow like honeycutt like swen brodie be none the less path in which a man 's foot might tread without shame and in which the mire might be leave to one side he turn back to the room honeycutt be near the bunk grope for he shotgun he start guiltily veil he eye and return empty-handed to the table if it be all in gold now say honeycutt hurriedly king make no reference to honeycutt 's murderous intent that paper be the same thing as gold he say the government

must follow since it be he responsibility to bring she back to he friend ben by what he fancy happen between brodie and honeycutt brodie have be in ugly mood all along he would be in uglier mood now after king 's interruption and the shotgun episode nor could king forget what he have see on lookout ridge if swen brodie be sure enough of what he be about to rid himself of andy parker what would he not do with old honeycutt i ought to go back be what king say over and over to himself as he ride steadily on after glorium the last roof lose to sight as they turn into the mouth of a cañon he shake off all thought of return overtook glorium and determine to forget both honeycutt and brodie for the rest of the day to-morrow would be another day there be hundred of pretty place to picnic say glorium but it be so much jollier by run water if you can fight down that hunger of yours for a few mile he tell she i 'll show you the prettiest picnic spot you ever see and one by the way that precious few folk know about it be tuck away as if the mountain have the notion to hide it from all invader she be immediately all eagerness to come to it but she be quick to see that though king laugh with she he retain certain serious thought of he own thought which of course have to do with he errand to-day she wonder what have happen at honeycutt 's if king have have any word with swen brodie she have be wonder that ever since he rejoin she under the tree but now as then she hold back she question since she be also wonder something else -- if he would tell she without be ask when they come to a spring freshet which they have cross this morning king turn off to the right ride up-stream he horse 's hoof splash mightily in the water glorium look on ahead see only rock-bound cañon wall on either hand and a tangle of alder-bush across the creek come on call king keep you horse right in the water and in two shake i 'll show you my hidden place you be go to like it though she be little impressed by what she could see she follow now and then a alder brush against she once king wait hold back a green barrier which he have thrust to one side the shrubbery thicken in five minute she could catch but broken glimpse of the slope rise to right and leave they horse splash through a deep pool and king tell glorium to let she animal have he head so that he could pick he way among submerged boulder there come a spot where the bank slope gently again and here he ride out upon a bit of springy sward ringed with alder and willow as he dismount glorium look uncertainly about she damp underfoot and a paradise for mosquito be she think he catch she look and laugh we get down here and leave the horse he inform she they can top off they grain and hay with grass while we dine we go only about fifty step further but we go on foot she come down lightly again all eager curiosity king carry they provision-bag go ahead break aside the shrubbery for glorium close at he heel they plough through what look to she like a impenetrable thicket they ford the stream where it widen out placidly step on boulder always king go ahead hold out he hand to she once she slip but before she boot have break the surface of the water he arm be about she he catch she up hold she a instant glorium begin to laugh then as she regard it a thoroughly astonishing thing happen she feel she face flush hotter and hotter until it burn she laugh again a trifle uncertainly and jump unaided to the next boulder and across to the pebbly shallows wade out through six inch of water little fool she chide herself hot with vexation what in the world do you want to blush like that for he will think you be about ten year old for he part king stand stock-still a moment regard the water rush about he he have catch she to save she from fall he have hold she for something less than a round second and yet something of she pervaded he sens it have be a second fraught with intimacy she hair have blow across he face she have thrill through he like a sudden burst of music when he jerk he head up and look at she he could not see she face she be very busy with a white pebble she have pick up he jump across to land and go on and the incident sink away into silence he be glad to come to what he call the door to the hidden place he open it for she that be he shove aside a mass of leaf hold the branch back with he body glorium go through the opening thus afford climb a long slanting whitish granite slab and cry out ecstatically at the beauty of the spot before she be a tiny meadow as green and smooth as velvet thick with white and yellow violet about it rim it in clean line which do not invade the sward be pine and beyond the pine to be see in broken glimpse among they sturdy straight trunk be the cliff shut all in through one of these vista she see a white waterfall its wide-flung drop of spray all the color of the rainbow as the sun catch they the water fall into a green pool spill over flow through a rock channel of its own ancient carve and curve away through the meadow on the edge of this granite basin with shower of spray breaking over it a little bird bob and dip and lift its head with its own inimitably bright gesture break into a sweet singing as liquidly musical as the fall water the water-ouzel cry glorium see i remember he name and he be here to welcome we under the pine where the ground be dry king make they camp-fire a small blaze of dry twig between two flat stone glorium be every bit as exultantly delight with the moment as she could have be be she really about ten year old i want to help what can i do tell I mark what can i do oh the coffee you can not make coffee without water can you she catch up the new tin coffee-pot and run across the meadow to the creek the little bird have give over singing and watch she when she be mindful of he previous rights and do not come too near he waterfall he give over any foolish notion he may have have of flight and cock he eye again at the pool perhaps the coffee-pot put he in mind of he own dinner glorium kneel at she task watch he he seem to reflect a moment then with a sudden flirt and flutter he have break the surface of the water and be go out of sight she gasp he have go right under the waterfall a little bundle of feather no bigger than she clenched hand she kneel with one knee get wet and never know it she begin to feel positive that the hardy headlong little fellow surely must be batter to death and drown then with the abruptness of a flash of light there he be again on the surface now drive himself forward toward the bank and there he sit again on he rock the water fling from he to flash and mingle with the fall spray he head back he throbbing little throat pour out he fluent melody glorium laugh happily and go back to king and the fire with she pot of water \* \* \* \* \* i love this say glorium softly she be drink a tin cup of strong cheap coffee cool with condensed milk in she other hand be a thick man-made sandwich of bread butter and corn beef king laugh what he demand what particular article of my daintily serve luncheon have make the great hit with you be it perhaps the rancid butter that you adore you know i love this she look embrace the universe -- begin with the die fire sweep on beyond the tree-top against the deep blue of sky i do not know why people live in city with all of this shut out the call of the wild he speak lightly and yet he glimpse a soul really stir saw that for the moment if for no longer the great solitude hold she enthral more seriously he add : it be the blood of you ancestor it be just get a chance to make itself hear the racket of market street drown it out she nod thoughtfully they do full justice to they lunch finish with she purchase for dessert quite as he have prophesy and laze through the nooning hour glorium lay on a yield mat of pine-needle she eye grave as she spirit within she be grave move by influence at once vague restless and tremendous this be not she first day in the wood and yet she feel strangely that it be he have speak of she ancestor she know little of she mother 's and she father 's forbear she have never be greatly concern with individual whom she have never know in a way she have be lead to think by she own mother however so innocently that she be live they down they have be of a ruder race that have live in a ruder day in san francisco to miss glorium gaynor in a pretty new gown one of a cluster of dainty girl those grandparent have seem further away than the one step of removal between they and she nearer blood to-day they come near she very near indeed for the hour that she lay look up at the sky not many word pass between she and king he sit back to tree and smoke he pipe and be quite content with the silence she start out of a reverie to find king stand up he body rigid as he stand in the attitude of one who listen he head a little to one side he eye narrow wait for I he say i 'll be back in just a minute she sit up and watch he he go back to the sloping granite slab over it down among the alder and out of sight for a moment she hear he among the bush then as all sound make by he die away there be only the purl of the creek and the eternal murmur of the pine now it seem to she more silent than before even when king have sit wordlessly near she and yet incongruously whereas the silence be deepen by utter solitude the voice of run water and stir tree rise clearer louder more insistent a fall pine-needle striking all but noiselessly at she side make she turn swiftly only now do she hear that other sound which king have detect it be the thud of horse ' hoof with it come man 's voice faintly king have go that way glorium stand up smother under a sense of aloneness she resent he go she be on the verge of call to he she heart begin to beat faster she be not afraid she do not think she be afraid when he come up over the rock again go but a few moment true to he word she run to meet he she have not be afraid but engulf by a emotion which have seem not bear within she but a mighty emanation of the wood themselves and which in its effect be not unlike fear a emotion which now that king be here be lift out of she and blow away like a whiff of smoke before the mountain wind she look at he with new curiosity wonder at herself wonder at he that he presence or absence could make all this world of difference she see he in a new bright light as one may see for the first time a stranger on whom much depend he be strong she think strong of body of mind of heart he be like the mountain which be not complete without he he eye be frank and clear and honest and yet they be for she fill with mystery for he be man and he physical manhood be splendidly vigorously vital she have dance with man and boy flirt with they make friend of a sort with they yet none of they have set she wonder as king do the repress curl of he short crisp hair the warm tan of he face and hand and expose throat the very gleam of he perfect tooth and the flow of the muscle under he shirt -- these thing by the sheer trick of opposite send she fancy scurry to gratton how unlike the two man be and how glad she be that now it be king come up over the rock to she it have be to gratton that she have say : he be every inch a man she stop abruptly and wait for he to come to she side we must be go he say you have rest she nod and he begin gather up coffee-pot cup scrap of paper bit of food he leave for bird and chipmunk but the tin can be drop behind a old log and cover over with leave she would not have think of that she understand the reason and be glad that they own arrival here have not be spoil for they by find a litter of other camper ' leavings he stamp out the few ember of they fire and not entirely satisfied though there be but little danger of forest fire here in green young June nevertheless go to the creek for water and douse the one or two black char stick which still emit thin wisp of smoke those man query glorium when it be clear that he would require prompt who be they some chap from coloma packing off into the wood swen brodie she demand yes swen brodie and half a dozen of he ilk we will overtake they be that why you be in a hurry now no we will not see anything of they that be what i go to find out we be within a few hundred yard of the fork in the trail they turn off to the right as i think they would you would like to follow after they she gather that from a vague something in he voice and from a look not so vague in he eye if i be not along you would go the way they have go yes he admit but you be along you know what be more -- as he realize that she might fear he resent she be with he -- i be glad that you be and now shall we start we have a long ride ahead of we yet she follow he down through the alder at the pool where she have slip before and he have hold she in he arm she be very careful not to slip now nor do they look at each other while she lightly touch he hand and they cross over for a hour until the wilderness work its green magic upon they again they be a very silent man and girl he ponder on brodie and he man push on into the solitude she wonder many thing about she companion -- and about herself _ chapter viii _ through the long shadow of evening they ride back to the log house while king unsaddled glorium stand watch he she eye shine softly through the dusk it have be a truly wonderful day she say simply it be you who have be wonderful he answer stoutly i know you be not use to long ride like ours to-day i know you be tire out and you never give a sign the blood of my ancestor she laugh happily in the house gratton look at they sharply and suspiciously archie and

deprecatingly though with a shrewd watchful look to mark she daughter 's quick play of expression that that man could not sleep two consecutive night under a roof he clothes smell like a pine-tree he would not understand we any more than we could understand he i suppose glorium be silent and thoughtful then good-night mamma she offer again she cheek snuggle against she pillow and put out the light as you go please mr gaynor accept she dismissal though reluctantly sigh and go out as the door close glorium toss back the cover and spring out of bed go again to she window she watch the mountain ridge turn blacker and blacker see a second star and another and suddenly the heaven fill with a softly glimmer spray of twinkling light she hear the night wind rustling tender with vague voice a tiny shiver shake the white shoulder a shiver not from cold since not yet have the air chill through she mind sweep a dozen vivid picture all of king most of they of he out there alone with the night and the mountain but she see he also as she have see he to-day ride before she break the alder aside catch she as she fall all day she have thrill to he now more than ever she thrill she imagine she see he stride along through the big bole of the pine pass swiftly silent and stern through a faint patch of light standing in the shadow listen he keen eye drill the obscurity pass on again vigorous

and for the instant perfectly heartfelt determination to go and be a movie actress there be no dancing that night glorium when they think she upstairs sit alone out in the gloaming a wistful droop little girl surrender sweepingly to youthful melancholia she do not know just what the matter be she do not seek for reason and explanation she merely stare at the far-off star which swim in a blue blur and feel miserable but morning come again as bright as that first day in eden the bird sing and the air be crisp and young blood run pleasantly she come down early all radiant smile she kiss she mother on both cheek and the lip rumpled she father 's hair affectionately go for a stroll with mr gratton before breakfast crave georgium 's pardon abjectly and make the world a abiding-place of joy for the college boy glorium be mildly surprise that gratton do not appear in the least to resent she day of adventuring with king he be interested he do shake he head with one of he suave smile and murmur lucky dog when king be refer to but he interest seem to be chiefly in that quaint little relic of past turbulent day coloma he have she tell he all about it of the desert house the store

beloved old humbug of a male parent be hold out on she she first impulse be to face he down and demand to be tell the rest but realize that a father at the end of a long-distance line be possess of a certain strategic advantage present more difficulty than a mother at hand she say lightly : all right papa i 'll call she be sure you take good care of yourself bydie she relinquish the telephone instrument to she mother and stand wait she could hear the buzz of she father 's voice but no distinct word she mother say yes and yes and yes ben and then : oh _ ben _ i do not understand and then she mother 's voice sharpen and she cut into something gaynor be say : i can not say anything like _ that _ it be as though we suspect he of be underhanded and -- such scrap of talk be baffling and

tell he jim spalding will be here he can tell -- why mamma after papa have trust to _ we _ to see that he message be deliver glorium look shocked incredulous surely -- so they wait for mark king to come again out of the forest all the next day glorium dress very daintily and look so lovely in she expectancy that even old jim spalding 's eye follow she everywhere watch from the porch or a window or she place by the creek she be sure that he would step out of the shadow into the sun with that familiar appearance of have just materialize from among the tree trunk over and over she be prepare with prettily simulated surprise to greet he come but the day pass night drive they indoors to a cosy fireplace and light and fragment of music which glorium play wistfully or crashingly in burst of impatience and still he do not come mr gaynor go off to bed at nine o'clock glorium suddenly absorb in a book elect to sit up and finish she chapter she outwatch the log fire at eleven o'clock the air be chill and glorium as she go upstairs shiver a little and feel tired and vaguely sad the next day she put on another pretty dress do she hair in she favorite way and go about the house as gay as a lark the day drag by king do not come by nightfall the look in glorium 's eye have alter and a stubborn expression play havoc with the tenderer curve of she mouth she resent at this late date king 's way of go not only have he not tell she good-bye he have leave no word with she father for she she sit smile over a letter receive some day ago from gratton -- after she have retrieve the letter from a heap of crumpled papers in she bedroom waste-paper basket she read to she mother fragment bright gossipy remark in gratton 's clever way of say they she write a long dashingly compose answer two day later she say to she mother out of a long silence over the coffee cup : let 's go back to san francisco this stupid place get on my nerve why of course dear agree mr gaynor i can have everything pack this afternoon and to-morrow -- nonsense say glorium you know we can get pack in half a hour that day they leave jim spalding in charge and depart for truckee to catch a train for san francisco mr gaynor dutifully entrust to spald she husband 's message for mark king that be to say that portion of the message which she consider important glorium herself leave no message with old jim not in so many word but she do impress he with she abundant gaiety with she eagerness for san francisco where all of she best and dearest friend be if any one should ask old jim concern miss glorium jim would be sure to make it clear that she have no minutest regret in go but a very lively anticipation of the fullest happiness elsewhere _ chapter ix _ three or four week pass before mark king and glorium meet again week of busy gaiety on she part of steady persistent seek on he now again glorium and she mother and ben be at the log house in the mountain this time with a fresh set of guest only one of the former flock have be invite : mr gratton and this despite ben gaynor 's uneasy this chap gratton nellie he be cut in pretty strong here of late and i do not know that i like he he be too confound smooth somehow king come the day after the guest arrive for a talk with ben glorium know that he be come and be coolly prepare to meet he she give he a bright little nod friendly enough but casual and resume she lively chatter with she friend king go off with gaynor that night there be no moon but the star those great glittering star of the sierra make the hour softly palpitant king betook himself to smoke upon that particular remembered corner of the porch glorium slip out from a dance feel the little thrill that would not down when she find he there in they two chair necessarily close together since the nook be so cosily narrow she shoulder now and then brushing he as she move the faint fragrance from she gown and hair blow across he face by the night breeze -- for they he pipe hastily lay aside -- they sit talk softly or in a pleasant silence the next morning -- the matter seem to arrange itself with very little help from either -- they be to have a ride together this time they would take they lunch when they say good-night glorium impulsively give he she two hand he remember how she have do that the first time he have see she she face be lift up to he in the starlight he see she eye shine softly gloriously he see she mouth the lip barely apart for a instant he hand shut down hard on hers he feel the faint pressure of she own in return when they hear she mother in the doorway call glorium where be you they start apart a strange and unanalysed sense of secrecy have fall upon they gloria whisper good-night mark and then call here i be mamma just cool off she go skip down the porch slip she arm about she mother and carry she back into the house \* \* \* \* \* before the new day be fairly come they meet in the fringe of pine again they shake hand again for a instant they stand as they have stand last night they be tremblingly close to the first kiss suddenly glorium with she color high and she eye hide under lash which king marvel at lash lay tenderly against she cheek pull she hand out of he and begin draw on she gauntlet gravely as though here be a rite to be approach solemnly he lift she into the saddle they turn they horse and ride up the ridge among the tree they hear together the first sleepy twittering of hidden bird they see the black shadow thin they watch the light come upon the peak ridge shake off the shadow cloak seem to quiver as they awake to the new day grow flush and rosy the chill of the early morning air be like wine sparkling tingle in the blood the smell of resinous wood be insistent the fine bouquet to the rare vintage the day the world themselves -- all be young together -- all awaken to the full true and triumphant meaning of life they ride a mile with never a speak word but in a never-broken communion then it be glorium who speak first say as she have say once before : i love it they follow narrow trail through the ceanothus-bush ride one behind the other they climb steep trail among the pine then go down steep trail among granite boulder they ride side by side through little upland valley and grassy meadow they break off spray of resinous needle as they ride inhale the sharp odour they stoop for handful of fragrant sage they splash through swampy place where the grass and stalk of lush flower sweep they stirrup through rock-bound noisy stream where they must pick they way cautiously and where the horse snort and shake they head and glorium laugh gleefully to-day be like the completion of that other day when they have ride to coloma -- to both it seem that it be only yesterday the week in between do not matter they be wipe out of life by the green magic unfinished topic leave over from the first ride present themselves now to be complete once glorium speaking of they first woodland luncheon say yesterday once king as they cross a wild mountain brook say there be one 's nest now on that rock down by the waterfall look like a bit of the rock itself with moss all about it and glorium understand that it be she water-ouzel he be talk about it be springtime yesterday and to-day it be summer say glorium it be always springtime somewhere in the world answer king to-day we 'll ride from one season up into the other more magic laugh glorium it be always springtime somewhere in the world as youth know and remember as age forget always a place somewhere for laughter and love and light hand caress for bird song and bird mating and colorful flower and to-day they be seek this place among the mountain ride on expectantly through dark pass climb wind trail look across deep cañons and blue ridge glorium think dreamily that she would like always to be ride thus leave summer behind and below quest the joyous full-sapped springtime he have promise to show she he latest temporary camp they come to it before noon at a altitude of well above seven thousand foot in a grassy open space they leave they horse king carry they lunch bundle and they go on on foot along the frothing creek along the mountain-side through a wild country of dwarf vegetation she begin to understand a thing he have tell she that the sierra be the land of dwarf and giant pine and cedar and in one spot he know mighty sequoia pierce at the sky and here pine dwarf pygmy until it be but a mat of twisted broken twig carpeting the height and i have walk among the pine top cry glorium for up here there be scant soil here the wind rage and the snow heap itself high in the late fall and remain icy-crusted into late summer and here now the springtime have just come never have glorium see more beautiful flower flower half so delicate-looking and yet how hardy they must be to live here at all you be like these flower king say quite gravely and with sincerity glorium tell he also gravely and sincerely that that be the finest compliment she have ever receive -- she hope that he mean it at least she understand and she would like to be like they he camp be in a little nearly level spot sheltered by crag and so hide by they that one must come fairly upon it before guess its proximity back of it rise cliff so sheer that glorium crane she neck to look up at they below be the headwater of the creek across it the steep slope of the other cañon wall on all hand bleak naked rock with tiny blossom here and there between in the shallow soil and the carpeting of pygmy pine and flatten cedar only infrequently do a tree with root grip like claw lift its ragged top above the big boulder a wild place savagely silent save for the hissing of the wind around the cliff above king bring water from the creek he show she where he have hide he few camp utensil the one small pot one frying-pan one cup one spoon to these he add he big-bladed pocket-knife he make a fire where already there be a little heap of char coal against a blacken rock and they make coffee and cook bacon glorium use a stick which he have point for she to turn the bacon they take turn with the one cup what be it like up on the cliff top king do not know he have not yet be up there and would it take long to climb they not over a hour he estimate if she be not tire it be decide that king would have he postprandial smoke up there where they could sit and look out across the top of the world as they climb they come into a current of rush air higher up the wind strengthen they stand poise on boulder they shoulder throw back head up lung fill glorium 's hair be whip out from under she turban it blow across she face a strand of it flutter across king 's eye brush he lip he give she he hand up a steep place down which they send a cascade of disintegrate stone they stand side by side shoulder brushing rest breathing deeply perceptibly the air thin one 's lung be tax to capacity here the blood clamour for deeper draft for more oxygen when they come to the top glorium drop down panting though they have stop many time on the way she close she eye and she sens swim through a vast blur king give she a drink from he canteen she merely thank he with she eye but in ten minute she have rest and be on she foot she slim body lean against the wind he stand by she and they look out across the mountain for what seem to gloria a thousand mile there be the broken wilderness of mountain gash with gorge crown with peak paint with sunlight and distance glint white here veil in purple there she gasp at the bigness of it it speak of the vastness of the world and of the world 's primitive savagery and yet it do not repel it fascinate and its message have the seeming of a old oft-told and half-forgotten tale it threaten with its spire as cruel as bared fang and yet it beckon and invite with its blue distance always since the first man fashion the first club and make he a knife of a jagged flint have mankind battle with the great mother the earth who bear he he have strive with she for he food war with she for he raiment entrench himself against the merciless attack of the season winter to stab he with icy spear summer to consume he and always have he love she and honor she since she be he great mother glorium she thought confuse by conflict instinct inspire and awed draw closer to king -- but to be out here alone the utter utter loneliness of it she look at he with new curious eye do not it bear down on you do not you feel at time that the loneliness -- he understand i be use to it you know i have never know what it be out here to feel lonely until -- she wait for he to finish she eye on he until -- until after we first ride together he say again she understand and now she look away hastily and she cheek redden he be about to tell she that he love she he eye have tell she he lip be shape to the word i love you and she be suddenly conscious of a wild nutter in she heart she be tremble as though terrify other man have tell she i love you many time and in many way -- smile with a laugh with a sigh -- whisper the word or say they half sternly and she have always be gay and ready a little thrill perhaps as by a chance strain of music but now -- she could hardly breathe now she be frightened she do not know why she could not understand the sense of it she only know that she be afraid of what nor do she know that she only know that here be gloria gaynor and mark king man and girl -- man and woman -- set apart from the world lift above it clear-cut figure upon a pinnacle pierce the infinite blue of the heaven and that a mystery be unfold before they she have a wild wish to stop the flight of time to thrust it back upon itself to have the present not the present but to avoid the now by race back into the serenity of just a little while ago ten minute ago -- anything but this electric terrifying moment when mark king a surge of emotion upon he be about to say : i love you look glorium start and forgetful of the strange conflict of emotion within she clutch at he sleeve a man -- here -- swen brodie mutter king angrily brodie have just clamber up the ridge and come into view only when he head and bulky shoulder be upthrust beyond a boulder he come on until he top the boulder standing fully reveal upon its flattish top the butt of he rifle rest on he boot glorium be suddenly afraid with a new sort of fear though this man be not near enough for she to see the dancing evil of he little eye she see the brutish face in full relief against the sky and mark the jeer on the ugly mouth she one wild thought be that brodie would murder they both shoot they both down in cold blood she shudder king be unarmed brodie hate king as only a man of brodie 's kind bestial and cruel could hate she remember what she father have tell she of the death of andy parker she begin tug at king take I away she gasp and then with a terrify look over she shoulder : oh he be terrible perhaps brodie hear the stiff wind blow she word away from she lip toss they toward he steady glorium say king in a low voice i 'll take you away but we need not hurry he will not hurt you and to further soothe she he add : he would be afraid to shoot be he mind to the noise of the gun you know and he do not know how many there be with we or how close they be come we 'll go this way he turn he back square on brodie and with he hand firm on glorium 's arm lead she along the ridge they pass about a wind-worn rock and glorium look back hope that it have hide they already from brodie she see he head over the top of it feel upon she the eye which she could not see lose as they be under he hat-brim and hurry on she run ahead now with king hasten he step to overtake she _ chapter x _ that night when king and glorium say good-night a odd constraint lay over they to gloria king seem stiff and preoccupy she herself have red spot in she cheek and be nervously tense the abrupt approach of brodie with he repulsive face -- at a moment when the world swirl away from she underfoot and a divine madness be in she blood -- the reaction and revulsion -- all this and the resultant conflict of emotion have worn she out she be sure of nothing in all the world -- for once be not in the least certain of herself -- when she draw she hand out of king 's and hasten to she guest in the house it be with a sense of relief that she hear the door close shut she in with familiar homey object and face oppose its barrier against the wilderness and a man who be a part of the wilderness she know that king be go back to the mountain she know when he leave go swiftly and silently like a shadow among shadow she know that this time he go armed carry she father 's rifle for mark king know that it be inevitable that he path and swen brodie 's should run closer and closer that trail make by two man like king and brodie could never converge harmoniously that there be too much at stake that it be well to be ready for brodie in a ugly mood in a encounter so far remove from the habitation of man that a deed do would pass without human commentary a week pass and glorium go back to san francisco these have be seven day and night of uncertainty for she and have bring hour of confusion that mount into bewilderment she have sing and dance and flirt as even gloria gaynor have never do before she have make gratton sure of she and he eye have smoulder and he chalky pale face have flush she have send he off gnawing at he nail she have make other young laughter rise like echo of she own she have sigh and sit long hour at she window wonder wonder wonder in the end she have go leave she little note for mark king king do not return to the log house he know that long ago glorium would have go there be nothing to draw he in she absence he keep in touch none too close with ben gaynor telephone he once from coloma and once send a note to he by a hunter he encounter on five lake creek above hell hole the note to be mail in truckee some time later and to reach gaynor the follow day at he lumber-camp these be strenuous day during which king penetrate the most out-of-the-way corner of the mountain he construct he theory and strove doggedly to set they to the proof he hold that when baldy winch have make he a cabin in so inaccessible and distant a spot as the crest of lookout ridge it have be because winch the sole survivor of those hardy spirit who have be of gus ingle 's party be of a mind to make sure day after day that no other man go where he have be perhaps he know that he alone remain alive that the secret be he that he have but to wait the winter out to sit through the spring thaw and then go back to claim he own a man like baldy winch as king envision he would do that hence from lookout ridge one should be able to see the very point or a peak standing over the very point where gus ingle 's man have go but always the one difficulty : that point might be a mile away or ten twenty thirty mile away there be nothing to do but seek -- and he know that always swen brodie too be seek brodie and the man of he own kind whom likeness draw to likeness so king spend day after day in the cañons and on the ridge and yet through ben gaynor think to keep a eye on old loony honeycutt but there be many hour alone in the forest rest sit over a bubble coffee-pot lie in he blanket under the star that king think very little of brodie gus ingle or honeycutt there be time when the solitude be empty when a new strange feeling of loneliness sweep overpoweringly over he at such moment he fancy that a girl come steal through the tree to he that she slip she hand into he own that she lift to he she soft eye that something within the soul of he speak to she and that she answer he pulse quicken a great yearning as of infinite hunger possess he he remember how they have stand together upon the ridge the last time how he arm have be open for she the look in she eye that have be a moment when the world have lie at they foot when they have be lift up and up close to the gate of paradise he see virtually nothing of brodie now and then smoke from a camp-fire once or twice the char coal where brodie 's man have be before he upon these camp site he look contemptuously carelessness and wastefulness be two thing he hate in a woodsman and always he find they in brodie 's wake also he find bottle further he be of the opinion that he could go in the dark to the particular cañon in which the illicit still make its output of bad moonshine whiskey but though that canon lay in the heart of the country he be comb over it be one which he have explore from top to bottom two year ago and now be content to leave aside one day he come upon sign of a killing make the day before by one of brodie 's outfit he assume some one have bait for a bear and have kill the mother bear he discover the follow morning for he come upon a little brown cub whimper dismally king make the rebellious little fellow a unwilling captive -- and smile as he think of glorium glorium have talk of bear cub if she but have one for a pet well here be glorium 's

wonder what have happen to he one-time proud evening regalia how he have strut in it dance and dinner and theatre-party but briefly and long long ago it be like a half-forgotten former incarnation or rather like the unfamiliar existence of some other man he grow restless over he paper and stroll into the bar there he be fortunate enough to stumble on a man he know a old mining engineer the two get off into a corner and talk later they dine and go to the theater together the next evening king get a taxi call for he bear cub stop at a florist 's for a armful of early violet and grow more eager and impatient at every block be off to the gaynor home here you be sir say the chauffeur open the door king fancy the man have make a mistake in the number the house be blaze with light upstairs and down there be a unmistakable air of revelry about it faintly the music of a new dance tune violin and piccolo and piano creep out into the night above the music he could hear gay voice muffle by door and window and wall king be of a mind to go back to the hotel he have count on the gaynor alone not on this sort of thing but also most of all he have count on glorium and he hesitation be brief he jump down and lead he bear cub by its new chain go up the step a housemaid come to the door open it wide for he see the cub against he leg and scream why what on earth be the matter frieda say some one it be gloria pass through the front hallway with a worshipful youth glorium come to the door the youth at she heel look over she shoulder oh cry gloria king know then in a flash that she have not expect he that probably because he have never answer she letter she have forget all about it unconsciously he stiffen -- he old gesture before a woman but now glorium come run out to he she two hand offer she eye alight with pleasure you do come she say gladly glorium 's escort obviously hold himself to be privileged through virtue of he briefly temporary office thrust himself along in she wake he king do not notice king see only glorium as of old she set he pulse stir restlessly with she sparkling vivid loveliness to-night be glorium 's night she be eighteen and queen of the world and -- oh look she let she hand remain in he but she eye be all for the little brown bundle of fur at king 's foot that begin now to whine and pull back at its chain my birthday present just now mark king would have give anything he could think of to have that bear cub back in the wood where it belong he have not have time to analyze impulse he do not know why all of a sudden he gift seem out of place as he let glorium 's finger slip through he he look at the young fellow a boy of glorium 's own age in the doorway perhaps the full evening dress have something to do with king 's new attitude toward he pet but now as glorium a little timid and hold she skirt back and yet clearly delighted flash he she look of understanding and gratitude he be content glorium remember to make mr king know to mr trimble then king suggest that they take the cub around back and lodge he for the night in the garage but glorium discover that she could pat and fondle the little creature and that he be of friendly disposition insist on have he bring into the house for all to see it be the most delightful present of all she whisper to king in the hallway they be surround by a crowd of the curious girl in pretty dress young fellow in black suit all very exact as to the proper evening appointment at first they be dispose to look on king as the man who bring the cub and it be only when glorium begin a string of introduction that they understand one and all they regard mark king curiously the cub be make much of and finally lead off to the kitchen for sugar and a bed in a box under the table mr gaynor appear and be very glad indeed to see mr king again gratton whom king remember with small liking come up and shake hand and look at king in a way which do nothing to increase the liking ben it appear have be unable to come this year king be sorry for that as he look about he only now do he remember the violet he have bring for glorium the evening be anything but that to which he have look forward from the beginning he regret come before the end it be slow torture for he he be out of place and feel more out of place than he be glance at he carelessly purchase clothes be veil and never utterly impolite but he be conscious of they he be conspicuous because he be different outwardly in garb inwardly in much else there be no one here whom he know he have never feel that he know glorium 's mother and

to feel that she be very far away from he he know that he be dance awkwardly he have not dance for a dozen year gloria suggest sit out the rest of the dance she say it prettily but he understand he understand too by that sixth sense of man which be so keen at certain moment of mental distress that all of glorium 's friend be wonder about he where he come from what he business be he be tan rugged he be not of they he fancy sensitively that among themselves they laugh at he as he sit with glorium and find little to say he be conscious of she eye probe at he when she think that he do not see he look away a shadow in he eye and chance to see gratton gratton who have strike he as contemptible in the wood a misfit and a poor sort of man at best be here on he own heath he carry himself well he talk well he bear himself with a certain distinction clearly he be much in favor among the girl and woman much envy by the younger man yes glorium be right : this be another sort of wilderness where mark king be the misfit where gratton be as much in tone with he environment as be king among the forest and crag of the ridge another dance glorium excuse herself lightly and escape into the arm of gratton himself escape king understand that be the word for it he watch they see gratton whisper something into she ear see glorium toss she head see she cheek flush then gratton laugh and she laugh with he they dance wonderfully together sway together like two reed in the same gentle wind other than king notice there be know smile at the end of the dance king see the look which glorium flush and happy flash up at gratton and he heart contract in a sudden spasm of pain when again couple be seek each other to the jazzy invitation of the musician king slip away and go outside he stand in the shadow of the porch seek to get a grip on himself in a moment he would go in and say good-night to mr gaynor he would say good-night to glorium he would go and put a end to a hideous nightmare he hold himself very much of a fool and he know that he be fanciful but he be of no mind to stay two or three couple come out he remain unnoticed in the darkness he hear a girl 's voice : but _ who _ be he i think he be terribly handsome and distinguished-looking superior to we kind of nonsense who be you talk about betty she dancing partner pretend to be in doubt I a whirlwind of girl ' laughter then one of they say : _ you _ distinguished-looking or handsome she mean the sixty-nine-dollar serge suit good god be there a price tag on he oh the animal trainer they laugh again then glorium come and they call to she demand : _ who _ be he oh say glorium carelessly he be a old friend of papa 's and he name be king they go in two of the girl linger a little behind the other glorium and another the other

unfettered spontaneous be of high amusement georgium say just the same that she would bet on a elopement -- king reddened and stir uneasily gloria gasp georgium 's crazy she say emphatically why the man be impossible \* \* \* \* \* five minute later king go in find he hat and tell mr gaynor good-night she be glad that he be go and he know it though she make the obvious perfunctory remark glorium saw and come trip across the room not go so soon yes he say briefly good-bye glorium good-night you mean do not you i mean good-bye he say quietly gratton thrust forward king leave abruptly leave they together conscious of the quick look of pleasure on the face of glorium 's mother _ chapter xi _ always gloria yield to the heady impulse of youth be ready for high adventure therein lay the explanation of many thing which glorium do time go scurry on mark king have return to the sierra no word come from he and glorium tell herself with a exaggerated air of indifference that she have just about forget he autumn come that finest of all season about san francisco bay the ocean fog be thrust back unveil the clear sunny sky by day the crystalline glitter of star by night the city grow gayer as the season advance dinner and dance and theatre-party make life a gloriously joyful affair for glorium she have hardly the time to ask herself : just where be i go it be so much easier to laugh and cry lightly in the phrase of the day i be on my way she have drift drift like one in a canoe trail she finger idly in the clear water and never note when the little craft be catch by a steady purposeful current it be speed now but she only laugh breathlessly and drink she fill of the hour and leave to other the thought which carve fine line about brow and eye she know that she father be beset by some sort of financial trouble for the first time in she life he have not come to she birthday-party and she mother have explain rather soberly that it be because of a business crisis glorium do not know that crisis last so long week and week have go and still she know from a look which she mother could not hide that the money trouble be still stalk she father and come so close that for the first time in history they cast a shadow from the top of the sierra down into she mother 's heart in san francisco now gratton become the man of the hour he have study glorium with infinite patience and he never displeased she he understand she as she comfortingly assure herself that mean of course that he give in to she always that tirelessly he exert himself to please she at a time when there be much financial depression gratton 's obvious affluence be very agreeable to the pleasure-seeker he dress well he entertain with due respect for the most charming accessory he take she to dance or theater or for a drive in the park or down the peninsula in a new elegantly appoint limousine and about the same time fate have it that by two entirely unassociated trend of circumstance he should draw to the dregs of glorium 's lively and romantic interest in the first place he begin to become a prominent figure in san francisco he name be in the papers with name of man who count and of far greater import to glorium he become what she like to consider a man of mystery for week ago glorium have note that regularly once a week mr gratton drop out of sight to be go for one or two day he be never to be see Saturday seldom Sunday always any day from Monday to Friday night during week-end he be out of town and though there be countless opportunity for a off-hand explanation gratton never give it other than gloria remark the fact a girl friend insinuatingly remark : better watch out for he glory dear _ cherchez la femme _ you know gloria never suspect any such condition of affair she be too sure of gratton 's attention but be gloria she wonder one night she and gratton be have a late supper together at the palace they have be to the theater and now yield to the demand of she young appetite they sit before sandwich and coffee glorium see the page as he come to the doorway he stand a envelope in he hand look up and down the room when at last he eye rest on she and she companion the boy come to the table telegram mr gratton gratton more interested in what she be say than in the yellow envelope open it carelessly but in a flash he attention be whip away from she she stop in the middle of a sentence and know that he have not notice a quick spurt of blood flush he dead-white skin he eye grow bright with excitement he read in a sweeping glance and before he eye come back to she they go hurriedly to he watch i have get to go glorium he say nervously immediately this be important why of course she agree i can get a bite when i get home he thrust the telegram into he pocket and come around to the back of she chair he be all impatience it seem he could not wait until hat and coat be get on the way to the street he look again at he watch i have

here be a shut door and from be bar a door always invite the more temptingly especially to a girl like glorium why i can go home alone -- i do not like it i -- he end abruptly and thrust he head into the car he eye questing hers in the half-light the chauffeur with he engine go look over he shoulder come with I gloria glorium wonder what he mean : whether the man be suggest a elopement or just a wild bit of downright unconventionality i mean it say gratton listen the new day have already start by the time the ferry land we in oakland it will be nearly three o'clock i have get to drive up into the country we 'll phone you mother and will start right away we 'll get there long before noon we 'll be back before night it would mean only a day 's outing and no harm do will not you come glorium please come he pull out he watch again we have just get time to catch the boat comfortably he call to the taxi-driver to the ferry and jump in but -- you can come as far as the ferry anyway even if you will not give I a day of motor it be wonderful out in the country this time of year and -- when they come to the ferry there be no time for debate the matter the crowd be pour toward the last boat and glorium she eye bright with the joy of she escapade go with he through the little gate where the ticket be present for the last boat across the bay it be unconventional as she see quite clearly but to glorium unconventionality be a condition fairly divide into two widely separated browsing-grounds there be the thing which be just daring there be that other which be ugly because it be compromise this adventure promise to fall into the safer category to be off motor with mr gratton from three o'clock in the morning until late afternoon be what she consider a lark they laugh together in anticipation as they cross the bay they sit where they could watch the red and green light reflect like topaze and ruby in the shimmering water fall away and dwindle as the silhouette of the embarcadero recede on the electric train they be whiz among many sleepy folk into a sleep town oakland drowse and silent gratton summon a somnolent taxi-driver and they be whisk through the cool air to a garage he leave she a moment sit in the taxi while he run in and arrange for a roadster glorium leave to she own thought begin to regret have come the thing review in solitude be crazy she grow vaguely distressed she want to go back to san francisco -- but there would be no boat now until full morning three or four hour she could not get home before seven or half-past seven o'clock she try to recall a friend on this side of the bay to whom she could go at this time of night -- day rather she lip shape to a half smile i have get the car gratton be back offer to help she down and i phone

he make a great lark of they escapade assure she gaily that they destination be reserve as the final surprise for she he evade laughingly when she ask maybe we 'll keep right on go always and always he jest with she she think that under the jest there be a queer note when he eye flash briefly toward she she try to read they message but the hour mystery-filled fill they with mystery glorium begin laugh what will we look like to-morrow -- i mean when it be full day I dress like this -- you in evening suit by jove say gratton then he laugh with she it be the lark of my life the ocean breeze smart in they eye the motor thrum merrily tree and house fly by the racing car leap to fresh speed on the cement highway the spin tyre whine musically they be far up-country when the sun rise glorium very sleepy now watch it climb above the hill she have watch the sunrise last June -- with mark king later again with mark king she have see it thrust its great burning disk above the pine ridge she be asleep and start wide awake when the car stop suddenly they be in the one street of a little town it must be eight o'clock she be cold what do you say to a cup of coffee and toast and egg i be hungry she confess over they breakfast in the little wayside restaurant with its untidy table and greasy lunch-counter it be gratton who do all of the talk glorium by now realize that she be downright

put the gay note of adventure back into the affair glorium make she purchase in fifteen minute and the change from theater gown into a olive outing-suit in another fifteen she discard garment be gather up put into a cardboard box by the clerk and wrap in heavy paper to be stow away in the car she confront gratton smilingly in she new garb she hand in she pocket she face saucy she slim body boyish in its swagger and richly feminine in its unhidden curve gratton 's eye shine quick with admiration she laugh and a flush come into she cheek as he gravely pay for she clothing and he own when they go to they car both be strangely silent i owe you a lot of money she say with assume carelessness which i hope you never repay he return meaningly at nine o'clock they be thread the street of sacramento at a little after ten they be in auburn they drive through old town pass the courthouse and through the newer portion of the village by the freeman hotel and the railroad-yard through the subway under the track and turn off to the right leave the highway for the first time and skirt the olive-orchard on the hill then sweep around a wide curve they catch the first glimpse of the american river deep down in its historic canon on over a narrow red-dirt road closer down to the gorge across the long bridge up and up the steep writhe grade they come to the top of the ridge race through cool through lotus -- coloma gasp glorium you be go to coloma he slow the car down that he might look at she keenly well he say lightly it be to coloma that you have be come every week well he

absently hearken to gratton call from the foot of the stair she jump up only when she hear he start to mount they then galvanize she spring to she foot cry to he i 'll be down in just a second and run to she room she stand again look at herself in she glass glorium gaynor she hear she own pale lip say you have get yourself into a nasty nasty mess the lip begin to tremble then with a great struggle

determine to bring some vestige of color back she take down she hair only then so distrait to-day be glorium do she think of change from she boyish suit into a house dress she eye which have harbour only bewilderment and terror now grow speculative she bring from she closet half a dozen dress choose a certain pink one without analyze the reason of she selection find silk stocking and pump and dress from top to toe she would have to have it out with gratton one way or the other -- she begin to know which way it would be but always a girl should be at she best also she decide by the time that she be becomingly gowned and she hair arrange tastefully it be as well to let gratton wait for she a while wait always to some extent bring to the one cool he heel a sense of disadvantage in short glorium have go through the most panicky of she moment and be get a grip on herself again when after gratton have wait and fume for upward of a hour she go downstairs she look cool and pretty and quite unembarrassed he flash a look at she that be eloquent of nervous excitement i want to explain everything to you gloria -- it will take a good deal of explain will not it mr gratton they go

and out of sight he stand look after she tap and tap at he cigarette-case _ chapter xiii _ to gloria the sluggish moment be fraught with despondency or pulsating terror all arrangement be make she be powerless in a trap a justice be come she be go to marry gratton she lay on she bed with she door bolt and weep bitterly moan over and over : oh i wish i be dead she hear gratton stir restlessly downstairs she herself grow restless she spring up tiptoe to she door and slip out as silent as a shadow she go into the little room where the telephone be and through it to the sun-porch for a long time she stand look out across the mountain she hand press to lip which tremble she think of she mother who come as fast as she could no doubt by automobile since she would not have the patience for

will of they own refuse to obey she own command lay upon they she seek wildly to delay delay to the last fragment of the last second before yield to the inevitable she want to loiter over she hair and she finger race she could hear voice downstairs gratton 's voice low and urgent a thin querulous voice she shudder that would be the justice another voice a man 's and strange to she he say nothing but twice she hear he laugh a laugh that jar upon she nerve she guess who he would be the man gratton have send to bring the justice glorium gratton be call from the foot of the step the voice that answer for she be clear and steady and downstairs must have sound untroubled : i be come just a minute \* \* \* \* \* two hour ago while glorium have be watch the shadow creep among the pine mark king

they horse he see the door open and gratton come out the horseman go up to the porch neither be ben gaynor one as he pass in through the light-filled doorway be a little gray man whom jim have never

bench \* \* \* \* \* in the house they be wait for glorium the little gray man whom they call judge and who have a way of clear he throat before and after the most trifling remark go up and down with he hand under he coat-tail peer near-sightedly at picture and book and wall-paper quite a tidy little place ben gaynor 's get here he say patronizingly quite a tidy little place gratton pace back and forth whirling always abreast of the stair look up expectantly steve jarrold the man whom glorium have hear laugh never budge from the spot where he have land when enter the living-room he wide spraddled leg seem root through the big foot into the floor big-framed and bony with startlingly black restless eye and a three or four day ' growth of wiry beard no less lustrously black he be ragged

like a man do a job he be be pay for at last since no delay hold back for ever the rolling of the great wheel of time glorium come slowly she descend the stair one hand at she breast one grip the banister she pallor be so great that she lip though pale also look unnaturally red in contrast they be just a little apart she seem to breathe with difficulty she eye glance wildly about the room and at the man to be see in the hallway be the eye of one in a trap seek frantically for escape know that there be no escape she brain like one 's in a fever be quick to impression alive with broken fragment of think like so many flash of vari-coloured light she note trifle she see a painting over gratton 's head -- a seascape she father have give she for she fourteenth birthday she see three pair of eye stare at she man 's eye to she the eye of wild animal she read as clearly as if they message have be in large print letter what lay in the mind of each : in the little gray man 's the judge 's speculation in steve jarrold 's the jeer of a man of jarrold 's type at such a moment when they fall upon the bride in gratton 's quicken desire of she and triumphant cunning my dear say gratton come forward as though to meet she and then pause abruptly and hold back this be judge -- judge summerling he will -- perform the ceremony you know and this be mr jarrold he bring the judge and will be a witness glorium from the last step regard the three man as a prisoner might have look upon jailer come to drag she to execution she lip move but no sound issue judge summerling bow stiffly and clear he throat steve jarrold 's hat cease revolve a instant then fairly spin as though to make up for lose time suddenly glorium begin to laugh hysterically uncontrollably gratton whip back and stare at she summerling and jarrold be mystified she look so little like laughter and as both have cause to regard the situation there be so little call for laughter but they could have no clue to glorium 's thought she wedding with that insignificant little gray man in he cheap wrinkled clothes to officiate with that unshaven leering dirty man to witness holy matrimony glorium gaynor 's wedding she be near madness with the hideous cruel travesty of such wedding as be dear to the heart of san francisco society girl the judge be clear he throat again she look at he curiously with the odd sensation that while glorium gaynor be asleep drug into a deep stupor there be within she another glorium who take a keen interest in the smallest happening this affair be not any more regular than it ought to be he be say now just the matter of the licence -- gratton jerk about and glare at he the judge break off with a vehement clearing of he throat in a moment he speak again seein ' as both party _ want _ to get marry he say hastily and as circumstance be what they be -- keepin ' in mind how circumstance do alter case -- well then -- be you ready that be you ready seem to explode like a pistol shot in glorium 's ear something within she shrieked : no no no gratton have say a quiet yes and be look at she she hear herself say faintly : yes gratton put out he hand as though to help she down the last step she make a little gesture motion he back he bit at he lip and obey though with a quick flash of the eye glorium look down at the step about six inch high and yet -- and yet where she stand be as high as heaven down there as deep as hell she seem powerless to achieve that last step but gratton be stir restlessly he would put out he hand again to help she she shudder and move quickly now she stand on the same level as gratton and the other the physical fact be sinister as though symbolical of the psychical the judge begin to grow vastly businesslike he must have the full name correctly age birthplace gratton answer for himself and for glorium who stand now with she hand on the back of a chair just within the living-room door across the room be the fireplace over it a ornamental mirror she wonder dully what she look like the bride but from where she stand she could see only the reflection of the window across the room the strip of curtain at the side stir softly in the evening breeze that breeze come down through the pine it wander free why could not she glorium be like that she think poignantly of she few day among the pine with mark king oh the remembered glory of it the clean sweet freedom of it now folk if you be ready stand side by side -- oh cry glorium eh what be that demand the judge she try to smile i -- i think -- she see steve

be place anywhere else in the universe even by a few inch remove from its present abiding-place would there be a _ glorium gaynor _ in all the world right now or would she chair hold quite another sort of person -- mr gratton if she have not lift she desperate eye and see mark king reflect at the window how would she have answer that one final question the judge propound would she have say yes or would it have be no she do not know she would never know she have be on the verge dizzy with profitless speculation and now only the extent of one little word stand between she and a unthinkable condition that a whole life should be steer down one channel or another -- oh what immeasurably separate channel -- by one 's breath in a single-syllabled word -- \* \* \* \* \* you do not answer a voice be say irritably she start they be talk to she they have be talk to she and now she realize that she have hear voice across a great distance and by no means as clear to she consciousness as the remembered voice of she mother two year ago argue for a mirror over the fireplace she turn she eye on gratton since obviously it be he who insist on a answer but king speak for she look here gratton he say bluntly as far as i can see there be no reason why miss gaynor should pay the least attention to you effervescing if she do not care to she be a free agent and under no obligation to you i 'll ask you opinion when i want it snap gratton miss glorium -- you ask I something say glorium pardon I i do not hear she aloof reply disconcert he she attitude be spontaneous unaffected and hence unconsciously one of polite indifference suddenly gratton fume as he would have become of not the least importance you say that you would marry I not a dozen minute ago do i she demand coolly be you quite sure i say that look here miss glorium it be jim spalding who have be ill at ease all along and now have the brain and perhaps the delicacy to understand that this be no place for he if you do not need I after all i 'll go and the rest of we with you say king if miss gaynor care to talk thing over with gratton -- glorium put out she hand impulsively touch king 's arm _ you _ stay please until -- he go king inclined he head gravely not realize that he body stiffen under she light touch what about _ I _ demand the judge sharply be i need or be not i i would say not this evening king 's dry voice answer he good-night to you that be a fine way to treat a man cry summerling truculently here i ride all this way in the dark and without stoppin ' for so much as supper here i be not have a bite to eat since dinner-time and it be good-night and get out and that hundred dollar i be to get so fast how about that think i be the man to let folk trample on I and -- maybe jim will give you a hand-out at he cabin king tell he as for you money get it out of gratton if he promise it to you -- or he add with a flash of heat take it out of he hide for all i care wait for I outside summerl muttered gratton _ i _ have not say you will not be need have i just the same i would not mind takin ' what be comin ' to I now -- man alive shout gratton whirling on he have not i get enough on my hand without you yelp at I just the same -- jim call king above the incoherent mouthing slip you arm through summerling 's and lead he off with you feed he if you feel like it and let he stick around for a word with gratton if he want and you steve jarrold ben gaynor be not here but just the same you can take it from I that neither you nor any other of swen brodie 's hangdog be want in ben gaynor 's house out you go jarrold 's eye slant off to gratton then see himself ignore and forget he shrug he shoulder pull on he hat and go out behind he arm in arm one smile widely and the other pull back and still sputter go jim and the judge to all this glorium have give scant attention the spell no longer lay over she she be keenly awake to the demand of the present she be think think think it seem that she have walk on quicksand that a hand have draw she up and place she where she be now with solid ground underfoot but that still all about she be quicksand what temporary sense of security be hers be due to mark king to he presence as long as he stand there where she could put out a hand and touch he she could rest calmly assure of safety but when he go there remain gratton and he venom quicksand all about she in which she would be flounder at this moment but for mark king -- \* \* \* \* \* she heart be beat normally again the pallor leave she face which become delicately flush she eye large and humid a sweet gray and once more almost childlike -- eye to remind a man that here after all be no woman of the world but only a young girl -- rise to king 's and meet he long and searchingly yet there be that in they expression that make he understand that she be not look at he the physical man so much as through he for the first time in she pampered life the day have come when she be face to face with vital issue when there be no mamma and no papa to turn to when there be no shoulder other than she own to feel the weight of event she must do she own thinking come to she own decision here be no time for a misstep the one great step she have already take she have cry no that step could be reconsider retrace she look at gratton 's face and see that but now she would not do that she could not in the city see the two man together she have turn to gratton now here in she father 's log house in the mountain she wonder that she could have do so do man change color like chameleon shift from one environment to another or be it she who have be unstable she who be the chameleon a queer sensation which have be hers before and which she be to know more than once in day to follow master she it seem that within she coexistent and for ever in conflict there be two gloria : a girl who be very young spoil vain and selfish a girl who be older who look above and beyond the confines of she own self who be warmhearted and impulsive and could be generous there be the glorium who be the product of she mother 's teaching and pampering there be that other glorium who be the true daughter of a pioneer stock a girl link to the city through tradition bind to the outdoors through instinct there be the glorium who be ashamed of mark king at a formal gathering in she own home there be the glorium who be thrill to the depths of she being as in the forest-land she know a breathless moment in the arm of mark king well here be consideration to linger over on a idle day now without seek for hidden spring there be on the surface certain plain fact no matter what she have feel toward gratton before she detest he now no matter what he might have appear in san francisco here in he unaccustomed garb he look to she puny shallow and contemptible he be as she have tell he a beast he have betray she confidence he have take advantage of she headlong youth he have display to she view the vileness within he he love she do he so much the better it lay within she power then to repay he if only in part for what he have make she suffer \* \* \* \* \* i repeat miss glorium gratton be say a stubborn look in he eye that you promise to marry I you have have a hard day i realize there have be much to unnerve you i err in haste perhaps i should have wait until you have a night 's rest but you know why i do not wait it be for you sake glorium hear he through with a hard little smile nothing be further from my intention mr gratton she tell he icily than to marry you now or ever please let we consider the matter close once and for all he finger work nervously at he side glorium choose the moment to lift she eye again fleetingly to king 's she want gratton to see she want to hurt he all that she could she look back to see he wince nor do he quick contraction of the brow result from she glance alone he have see the look lie unhidden in king 's eye mark king have to-night for the first time sweep barrier aside and look straight into he own heart and know that all of the love that be in he to give have be give to glorium gaynor he have come from jim 's cabin to look on she for the last time he be give she up and then when he have turn away rather than hear she murmur yes she have cry out ringingly : no the sod have not fall upon a beloved face death have not enter the door life be not extinguish -- where there be life invariably there be hope -- he have give glorium up yes but she have come back from beyond the frontier she have come call to he he be certain of nothing just now beyond the tremendous all-excluding fact that wise or fool he love she he want she with a want that be greater than hunger or thirst or love of man for man or of man for life itself much of this lay shine in he eye for gratton to read -- or for glorium i be no boy to be throw aside like a old glove cry gratton beside himself shake with jealous fury you have promise you have love I in you heart you love I now shall i stand back for a girl 's nervous whim i tell you you shall marry I glorium 's laughter cool and insolent madden he he clench he hand and be sweep away by he passion to gusty vehemence : think before you laugh what if instead of do the gentlemanly thing i refuse to marry you alone with I all this time all last night a clerk to swear i buy clothing for you a register to show where we engage a room as man and wife the san francisco papers already bandy you name about already nose after scandal you have _ get _ to marry I there be nothing else for you to do glorium flush hotly but only in anger this time king mystified look from one to the other turn at last to glorium and mutter : for god 's sake let I throw he out of the door i think it might be best first she answer quietly if mr gratton remain long enough to understand that this be the last time i shall ever speak to he or listen to a word from he he have try to get I into a nasty situation he will do all that he can to promote scandal but i want he to know that he will in the end of it all have my father to reckon with -- and my friend again she look swiftly at king and again gratton writhe at the look papa will not be here to-night he be hurt and in coloma and i 'll give you he message soon but -- you see you father in coloma it be a gasp of astonishment from gratton you say nothing you bring a message to king here and you escort I and never guess glorium taunt he really it seem too bad after all of you week-end trip to coloma after all of you conference with the estimable mr swen brodie he prominent eye bulge write large with consternation for a moment he stand the picture of uncertainty pluck at he lip glorium he say shortly despite all you have say i shall see you again to-morrow when we have both rest i 'll come to you now if you will pardon I i 'll have a word with king strictly business you may be sure king he conclude sarcastically there be to be no business between you and I king tell he promptly but there be if you have get two grain of common sense look you loony honeycutt be dead at last he secret be no longer he secret swen brodie know something -- a whole lot -- it strike I frowned king that you know more of this than i give you credit for where do you come in i know -- nearly all that it be necessary to know he eye flash triumphantly think i be the man to let the crowd of you lift a fortune right under my nose here be my proposition and you 'll thank you star that i make it : we be not friend you and i but that be no reason that we can not be business associate until this trick be turn you and i enter into a pact right now purely business you understand he be speak more and more rapidly in the grip of a new emotion whatever we find we divide fifty-fifty -- king 's sudden laughter no pleasant sound in gratton 's ear check the rush of word to accept gratton as a partner -- on a fifty-fifty split of the spoil be the man crazy i have be work with brodie shout gratton if i go on with he now with he and the man with he six or eight of they take what he give they either in money or in curse and order -- if i say i chip in with he against you what will the inevitable end be i ask you look at the odds -- the inevitable end say king sternly will be that they 'll pick you bone and kick you out i demand to know what word gaynor send -- will you have he go mark say glorium he -- sicken I king unleash by she word take a quick step forward gratton he say you would better go gratton rise to fresh fury shout at he : and leave you and she here alone all night -- king bear down upon he and strike he across the mouth hurl he back so that gratton trip and fall glorium rise and stand watch terrify and yet fascinate she see gratton crawl to he foot he hand go out to the table to draw himself up it find one of the heavy bronze book-end the finger grip it so that the tendon stand out like cord she could see the face of both man gratton 's twitching and vindictive king 's immobile look at once calm and terribly stern if there be two gloria within she one of they flee now the other watch with quick bright eye and glory in the man who have come at she hour of direst need one vanish afraid the other feel a little thrill go singing through she blood and though that bronze block be it hurl at king 's head might have be the death of he she be not once in doubt as to the end of this conflict there before she eye a man contend with a manikin drop that gratton do you hear I drop it i say he even draw closer while he speak in he voice be assurance that he would be obey in he look be the promise of death or near-death to be mete out swiftly and relentlessly for disobedience gratton like a man in a daze hesitate king 's hand shoot out swiftly grip he wrist there be a sudden jerk and the bit of bronze crash to the floor you 'll go now yes i 'll go but -- on you way then but -- shut up a tremor not to be repress shake king 's voice and go before i -- just go gratton catch up he hat stand for a moment pluck at he lip and stare at glorium and then turn and go out strangely only now that he have go do glorium shiver and look after he fearfully the man here have seem so futile and yet she have see that last look so fill with malevolence that in he wake the room seem steep in menace king must have have somewhat the same sort of a impression he go to the door and call out loudly : jim oh jim jim 's voice answer from the cabin : comin ' mark gratton 's outside i have tell he to clear out give he about two minute and if he be still here throw a gun on he and run he off the place oh i be go fast enough from somewhere off in the dark it be gratton 's voice call back hatefully and do not you forget it mark king i be go where a offer like mine to you will be accept we 'll be there before you yet a dozen man that will not lay down before you and you can tell that girl in there with my compliment she 'll be on she knee to I before she be a day older he lift he voice so that glorium shiver in the silent house must hear every word you can tell she too that if i do not telephone to she mother from oakland i do call up two of the san francisco newspaper office tell she to watch for the papers and when they get wind of the nice little situation to-night glorium here all night -- king have hold the door open only to see if gratton be go to he horse now however he slam it suddenly and go back to glorium after all jim could be depend on to see to gratton and to do he job thoroughly and with joy in the do there be still the message to be have from ben gaynor who it seem lay hurt somewhere in coloma but he stop dead in he track when he see glorium and for the moment all thought of gaynor or a message flee from he mind again she be as pale as death she catch at the back of the chair which have serve she thus before she lift to king eye sick with terror i have not get the straight of thing very well king say to she speaking very gently for in he heart he be think : poor little kid she be only a kid of a girl and she be pretty near the breaking-point from the look of thing and small wonder but aloud he continue : only one thing seem clear you be tired half to death and worry the other half i would not let myself think of that snake gratton or he poison dripping thing will work out all right he manage a smile of a sort the first smile to-night and add : they always do you know do they she ask listlessly and she too force a smile so wan and bleak that it come close to put a dash of tear into king 's eye for one thing he say brusquely i 'll bet you have not have a bite to eat since you get here have you she shake she head she have not think of such a thing as eat when have she eat last not since she and gratton motoring up from san francisco have stop at the wayside lunch-counter perhaps that be why this giddy faintness trouble she why the blood drum in she ear you 'll sit right down command king or lie down be better in two shake i 'll have something ready for you you be so good to I that come straight from glorium 's heart she eye shine with a gratitude which strike he as far beyond proportion to the small deed of the moment i 'll go upstairs a moment papa 's message -- it can wait ten minute let I get it now i -- i will lie down in my room until you call I if you want I to that be good he watch she go slowly upstairs and then hasten to the kitchen he get a wood fire go in the range scout for coffee find a glass jar of bacon a tin of milk all kind of can goods and meantime though occupy with much speculation concern all that have happen to-night and must have happen before and might happen in the future he never for a instant entirely forget glorium and how pitifully bear down she look gratton have trick she some way have coerce she have come close to break she utterly and yet she indomitable spirit have in the end triumph over gratton 's scheming king would never forget how she voice have ring out in that fearless no no and no and no just a little kid of a girl and he have look to she for the sanity of mature age a mere girl sheltered always by father and mother spoil to the _ n_th degree give no opportunity to develop she own character to grow up to life 's responsibility she mother have not even tell she of she grandparent be ashamed of they make glorium ashamed grandparent of whom any one might be justly proud folk of integrity of stamen of fearless hardihood man and woman of that glorious type that build empire and glorium king sense be like they deep within she under the layer of artificiality which she mother have strive so indefatigably and lovingly to lay on she be like they he remember he two day with she alone in the mountain and seek to forget the fragment of one evening in the city here she be she real self there she have be what she mother have make she over \* \* \* \* \* glorium with lagging step have go to she room now she lay on she bed she hand press tight upon she closed eye she will set against heed the throb in she temple as she strive to think clearly gratton 's word ring in she ear they plunge she into panic for score of friend and hundred of acquaintance she would furnish a topic of talk girl who be jealous of she would get into a warm flurry of excitement glorium could picture a dozen of they sit at they telephone call up this that and the other mabel and ernestine saying : oh do you hear about glorium gaynor be not it _ terrible _ what _ could _ she have be think of i know she be -- and so forth and so on ring interminable change youth though declare by the thoughtless to be a period of heedlessness take to heart far more seriously than do age all happening which touch its own interest pure tragedy be youth 's own realm it feel acutely its imagining be fearful it magnify and distort beyond all reason have glorium be above thirty instead of under twenty this moment would have be far far less deeply immerse in the gloom of despair she suffer dry-eyed but youth condition of wed extreme while it hold tragedy to its bleeding heart can not entirely fail in time to listen to the voice of hope glorium cling passionately to the one straw offer she : mark king have come he have save she if only for the moment if there be further salvation it lay in mark king and so she come presently to a thought that make she sit bolt upright that set she heart racing that bring a new look into she eye just now it have seem so clear that only one thing could save she from clack diatribe from torture under the tongue of ernestine and mabel and daily newspaper -- marriage with gratton but gratton be go and mark king be here if she marry king the judge be still here king be she father 's friend between man like they there be nothing which would be deny when friendship ask what if she go to king say to he straightforwardly : thus and such be my predicament for my sake -- for the sake of papa 's daughter and hence for papa 's sake no less -- will you go through the form of marry I i shall be no burden it will make no difference in you life for to-morrow i will go back to san francisco and you need never see I again you can let I have a divorce you will have lose nothing i shall have be save everything will you many I mark king \* \* \* \* \* gloria king be call will you come down now everything 's ready come answer glorium right away she glance in she glass as she go out the color which have play hide-and-seek all day be again tint she cheek a delicate rise what be fatigue and hunger when hope attend they but it happen that glorium 's impulse which be at least honest and frank be for a little held in abeyance and thus it come about that she lose the opportunity to appear before mark king at a critical moment as be straight-dealing direct and outspoken she thank he with she eye for the lunch he have set forth for she she give he a quick little smile as he wait on she he pour the coffee give she milk and sugar bring the hot thing from the stove and all of the time there be in he eye a look which he have no suspicion be there the look of a man 's adoration he will do whatever i ask he to do something sing within she will not you sit down with I mark she smile at he and there while one glorium have determine to indulge in plain talk the other glorium come forward obliquely demand the place which have always be hers when it be a case of man and girl together the smile be the smile of a coquette it intoxicate it make a man 's heart beat hard it bring he in close to she and thrust the world back she could not have help the smile or its message i have eat he say a trifle harshly she think you be so good to I she stir she coffee and he see only the lash and they black shadow on she cheek then she say brightly : this be we third little picnic together be not it then you have not forget the other the word say themselves for he the human comedy have begin or the comedy begin long ago be resume smoothly in its third act king unconsciously answer to he cue after that it be neither glorium nor himself who play the part of stage-director that time-honoured responsibility be back in the hand of the oldest of all stage-manager the wind that drive autumn leave scurry the sun that awaken spring bud be no more resistless or inevitable force than the one now voice its dictate it would be -- unmaidenly to ask he to marry you whisper that other self within she oh if she could only guess which be the _ real self _ which the pretender and there be no need look at he eye king see lie on the table the package do up in a old cloth which she have bring further he know that he have see it before and where he have see it he know that at last he have old loony honeycutt 's secret where he could put out he hand to it with none to gainsay he he know that with it be a message from he old friend ben that ben himself lay at this moment in coloma hurt and yet he eye cling to the eye of glorium and all of these thing be sweep aside in he mind he see that when she eye come to a meeting with he the flush in she cheek grow hotter he try to remember how he have come away from she in san francisco how he have give she up for all time but that memory blur in its place he stand with she on a boulder in a creek hold she in he arm he stand with she on a mountain top with the world lose below they he seek to get a grip on himself here and now be no time to talk to she of love she be alone it be he one job right now to take ben 's place to protect she and efface he own madness but be he mad and be now no time after all she be alone yes but if some day she would marry he be not now the time what would he not give for the right to stop the nasty mouth of gratton once and for all fragmentary thought by no means logically align they come and go with other thought between pro and con but thought do not always sway destiny in the crisis often enough there be no time for so slow a process as think instinct leap instinct compel all of the think in the world will not draw a steel needle to a bit of wood all of the think in the world will not hold back the same needle from a magnet there be urge which must be obey the urge of spin world to circle sun the urge of man to maid glorium he say huskily gloria yes mark she say quietly try to speak very calmly and as though she do not know oh so well all that tumult that lay behind he call she name but despite she determination she be agitate the moment have come there be no stop it and do she want it what do she want what exactly do she feel she know what be in he heart he soul exult as the certainty rush upon he she know what he be go to say word be needless between they and the color merely deepen in she cheek while she hide she eye from he he come to she swiftly she rise as swiftly to she foot he see that a tremor shake she he see that she do not draw back from he she eye at last lift to meet he own they baffle he he could not read they meaning but they shine on he softly they be the eye of she whom he love like magnet and steel they be sweep together he have she in he arm he feel against he breast the wild flutter of she heart against he face the soft brushing of she hair he feel she body tense but unresisting in he arm suddenly she relax she head be against he breast glorium in he arm -- glorium 's sweet face hide from he against he rough shirt -- glorium he cry again gloria the -- the bacon gasp glorium it be burning -- she free herself and while he let she go he stand watch she with the new look in he eye scarlet-faced she flash she look at he from across the table then she flee to the stove and retrieve the burning bacon as though here be the one matter of transcendent importance king begin to laugh he laughter as joyous as a boy 's glorium -- that be five time you have say ` glorium ' she inform he hurriedly and -- please mark as he move toward she and you have not read papa 's letter yet and -- and i be die to know what be in that funny package be not you if i be die at all he tell she gravely though he find a smile to answer she own -- and two very serious smile they be -- it be of quite another complaint and this time -- but _ please _ mark i be here all alone -- with you -- and -- i know i have not forget but glorium -- they both start to a sudden sound outside a scuffle on the porch involuntarily gloria prone to nervous alarm in she overwrought condition move hastily back toward he from whom just now she have escape they glance toward the sound they see at the window the puckered and perplexed face of the judge they be just in time to see a big hand grasp he by the shoulder and yank he out of sight they hear summerl expostulate they hear jim spalding 's far from gentle voice cursing he king understand at least in part what must lie under glorium 's look of distress surely circumstance have place she in a equivocal position to-night summerling be the type to blab he be in no charitable frame of mind he have find she alone here with man have come to marry she to one man and now have see she in the arm of another there be but one answer even to mark king some time you be go to marry I glorium he say gravely why not now it sound like -- like a advertisement mark she laugh somewhat wildly poor little kid he mutter see how she tremble but glorium why not some time you be go to give yourself to I be not you dear while this man be still here will not you let he marry we it will give I the right to shut that fool gratton 's mouth for he and -- oh gloria my dear my dear -- she stand stare at he with wide eye he plead with she will you gloria and then from lip which do not smile he hear the very faint but no longer evasive yes now gloria yes mark if you be sure that you want I she speak humbly at the instant she be humble but she add hastily still you have not read poor papa 's letter he be very anxious let I go a minute mark i be go upstairs i -- i want to phone to mamma first and while i be go you can read papa 's letter and -- and -- she face be hot with blush and arrange with the judge he say he own voice uncertain yes gloria she run by he then he hear she go upstairs he hear a door closing after she then like a man who tread on air he go to the window and throw it up and call : jim tell the judge not to go i have business with he i want he and you here in ten minute and then when jim 's voice have answer he he think to take up the parcel on the table -- largely because glorium have ask he a hurry letter from ben and the parcel from honeycutt 's something here for which he have be seek work for year remember now only because glorium have make the request that they be not forget \* \* \* \* \* to withdraw he racing thought from glorium and she golden promise to bend they to a letter -- this be in the begin a

chapter xvi _ king be astir long before dawn he get the fire go in the kitchen and start breakfast seek to be very silent and succeed in make the usual clatter of a male among pot and pan whilst water heated and bacon sizzle he rummage through the store-room at the rear of the house gather what he mean to put into he pack for the four or five day ' trip as he return from the last journey to the store-room he arm full of camp accessory include canvas and camp blanket he confront glorium fully dress he drop he arm-load and fill he eye with she any shadow leave overnight in he heart be send scurry before he new joyousness glorium have come down to he while he deem she fast asleep glorium he cry a more radiantly lovely glorium he have never look upon she have sleep and rest she have bath and groom and set herself in order she be dress after a fashion to bewilder a mere man in the only utterly ravishing outing costume mark king have ever see he feel insanely incline to pick up she little boot one after the other and go down on he knee and kiss they she hat be a flopsy turban from under the brim of which the most adorable of golden-brown curl half escape to throw kiss-shadow on she rosy cheek and glorium 's eye this time there be no door between they nor even the memory of a door he gather she up into he arm so that she boot-heel swing clear of the floor do you know do you guess have you the faintest suspicion how i love you the -- the coffee gasp glorium it be boil over he laugh joyously at that and finally when he have set she down glorium bright and flush laugh too burn bacon last night boil coffee this morning he chuckle and then there in the kitchen they sit down to breakfast it be sweet of you he tell she softly to get up and come down and see I off oh say glorium i be go with you not once have king dare think of a thing like that he have think that at best he would be with she again in four or five day but that she should go with he into the mountain on this quest of he he sit and ponder and stare at she do not you want I ask gloria be not you glad mark she be serenely prepare for objection should they be forthcoming for it be not on any spur of the moment but after long deliberation that she have decide that she would go with he she want no scandal in the papers she mean that there should be none if it be rumor that she have go out of town with gratton if gratton want to be ugly and feed rumor then on top of that if she appear within reach of a reporter without a husband there would be talk if it be answer that she be marry to mark king there would be the question : and where my dear be this mark king those girl friend in san francisco who have meet he at she birthday-party would be fairly squirm with excited curiosity to know _ everything _ among themselves they would make insinuation about the bear tamer or the animal trainer as glorium know that they would variously and mirthfully designate he they would find it unusual that king have marry she one day and have go off the next without she they would hazard endless unpleasant explanation they would get they head together they would make a astonishing patchwork of scrap of distorted rumor and bit of wild speculation from upstairs last night she have hear fragmentary outburst from the judge irregular no licence now gloria mean to kill the snake outright not to allow the scotch reptile to writhe free she be marry she be go with she husband into the wilderness on the most romantic of all honeymoon the papers be free to make much of that of course i want you say king slowly glad glad that you want to come with I can not you see that i be the gladdest man on earth but -- i have already write a message i want to send to a girl friend in san francisco it be to miss mildred carter who be engage to be marry to bob dwight of the _ chronicle _ i be go to have it phone in to she it tell she i be -- marry to you mark and that we be off on the most wonderful trip together into the heart of the wild country god bless you he say heartily but glorium glancing at he swiftly see that he eye be cloud with perplexity of course she say if you do not want a girl along -- glorium well then it be settle i be to go only i be afraid it be not the sort of a trip for a girl it be hard go and -- oh it be a cursed shame i can not put it off you say last night that you be not afraid of anything brodie and he man could do that they do not even know where to go that they would never know where to find you yes and i mean it but -- he want she with he she want to come further it pained he to think that those first glorious day should be spend with the mountain between they he be tempt sorely tempt glorium know she smile at he across the table she tempt he further be there really any danger would there be danger to she if he think so that there be the faintest likelihood of harm to she he would say no no matter what the yearning in he heart but if they make a quick dash in and out two day each way not over one day at gus ingle 's cave if they go on horseback nearly all the way and travel light he carry a rifle nowadays and he rather believe he might carry it ten year without ever firing a shot at any man of they hulk crowd they could go in one way come out another they have at least a full day 's head start of any possible follower no in he heart he do not believe that there would be any danger to glorium further the think strike he that she would not be altogether safe here there be venom in gratton god only know how virulent and there be sinister significance in the fact that gratton be hand in glove now with swen brodie then too gratton know from glorium 's own lip that she have bring the message from she father in coloma hence gratton might suspect and brodie after he that glorium be in possession of old loony honeycutt 's secret instead of seem hazardous to take glorium with he it begin to appear that he new responsibility of guard she from all harm have begin already and that he could best protect she from any possible evil by have she always with he he could not allow she to go to she parent in coloma he think of that but that be brodie 's hangout and ben be in no condition to send for she nor be it advisable for she to go alone to san francisco she mother be not there and gratton might be look on to follow herso with himself commune mark king never a man overly give to caution but seek now to measure chance to set they in the scale over against the desire of he heart a fanciful thought insist on be hear : have gus ingle 's treasure hide itself all these year await the time when he and glorium together come to it they wedding gift how much more precious then than mere gold we have travel light he say thoughtfully and glorium know that she have win we would go in quick out quick it be get late in the year he add with a smile and we would have to hurry brodie or no brodie i have no notion for a prolonged honeymoon snow-bound in those mountain she eye dance would not that be fun he smile quicken she childish ignorance of what such a adventure would mean be in keep with she vast inexperience with matter of the outdoors she have merely begin in he company to glimpse the true meaning of the solitude she would learn further -- with he and a warm glow of pleasure come with the thought that glorium want to go \* \* \* \* \* the pearl-grey dawn be flower into a still pink morning when they lock the door behind they and step out into the crisp sweet freshness of the autumn air he have make two small pack provision roll into the bedding and the whole wrap in piece of canvas he estimate they would be go five day and then make due allowance for any reasonable delay provision for ten when he see that glorium have note how for the first time on a woodland jaunt with she he carry a very businesslike-looking rifle he explain laughingly that if they develop abnormal appetite there be both deer and bear to be have she be much interested in everything and look out to the mountain eagerly when king have swing she up to she saddle on blackie the tall sober-faced horse where she sit with a roll of blanket at she back and with the horn before she decorate with a miscellany of camp equipment -- a frying-pan a short-handled axe in its sheath a overcoat do into a compact bundle here be another moment when thought be too slow process to emphasize themselves she be sway by emotion provoke by the moment where be the trunk and suitcase and hat-box to accompany the young bride in they stead a coat tie into a tight bundle and a frying-pan before she king look at she and marvel she cheek be rose she eye be glorium 's own wonderful and big and deep beyond fathom from he own saddle on the buckskin he nod he approval of she you be not afraid that i can not take care of you be you glorium he ask and glorium laugh gaily answer : my dear mr man i be not the least little bit afraid of anything in all the world this morning so with the glorious day brighten all about they they turn away from the log house and into the trail which straightway king dub adventure trail and as they go he sing out joyously : the lord know what we 'll find dear heart and the deuce know what we 'll do but we be back once more on the old trail we own trail the out trail and life run large on the long trail -- the trail that be always new _ chapter xvii _ the magnificent wilderness into which ride mark and glorium king seem to prostrate its August self to do they honor upon this they wedding morning succeed the paler tint of the earlier hour come the rare blue day last night 's cloud have vanish the air be clear and crisp with still a hint of frost on all hand have October in pass splash the world with color along the creek the aspen dance and play and shiver in bright golden raiment through the bush there be a glimpse of vivid scarlet where the leaf of a dwarf maple be as bright as snow-plant a little grove of gracefully slender poplar tremble in yellow against the azure above the clear thin sunlight prick out color until it make the wood a riot of they green dark and light the gray of sage the white of a granite seam the black of a lava rock and in the creek spray a brilliant vari-coloured rainbow sheen they two ride side by side while the broad trail permit pass over the ridge and out of sight of the house immediately the solitude shut down about they with titanic wall they ride down into a long shadowy hollow out through a tiny verdant meadow fringe with the rusty brown of sunflower leave and on up to the crest of the second ridge already they be alone in the world a man and he mate with only infinity and its concrete symbol embrace they ancient and ageless tree limitless sky mile after mile of ridge and precipice and barren peak and upon they and about they and within they the utter serene hush of the sierra with every swing step of the horse take they on a new gladness blossom in king 's heart for they be push ever further into the portion of the world which he know best loved best the present leave he nothing to wish for he have glorium and glorium have elect to come with he until high noon they would wind along for the most part climb pretty steadily with the old trail -- indian trail miner ' trail trail which even to-day seem to lead from the first generation of the twentieth century straight back into the heart of 1850 and beyond here man do not penetrate save at long interval here be true solitude and soon when they should leave this trail to travel as straight a line as the broken country would allow toward gus ingle 's cave they would enter a region give over entirely to the wild 's own bright-eyed shy inhabitant there be red spot in glorium 's cheek when they start king seek to guess at what might be the emotion of a young girl go on with glorium 's present emotional adventure -- vain task of a mere man seek to fathom those troubled feminine depths -- mark that she be a little nervous and distrait i know the place gus ingle try to describe he say as well as i know my old hat or at least i would have say so until he mention the third cave i have be there dozen of time too but i have get to see more than two cave there yet together they have read the crabbed line in the bible they have be silent thereafter as to each come imagine picture like ghost from the past ghost of greed and envy and despair now gloria muse aloud : i wonder -- do you suppose we 'll find it as he say at least we 'll see about it and whether there be heap and pile of red red gold as the tale telleth be sure we trip be go to be worth the two day ' ride i 'll show you such chasm and gorge and crag as you have never turn those two lovely eye of yours upon mr gloria king -lrb- he could not abstain absolutely from all love-making -rrb- and a little grove of sequoia which belong to I or at least i believe i be the only man who know where they be friend of mine those big fellow be five old noble-souled monarch she look interested and treated he to a fleeting smile but ask curiously : how can a man speak of a tree that way as though it be alive -- she break off laughing and amend : but they _ be _ alive be not they i mean -- human why you poor little city-bred angel he cry heartily you will answer you own question inside of two day no doubt i be go to grow jealous of old vulcan and thor and majesty sure i have name they he chuckle and you 'll come with I into they dim cathedral to-morrow at dusk and listen with I to they old sermon a man ought to go to church to they at least once a year to keep he soul clean out and grow properly glorium appear thoughtful that she be interested just now less in that of which he speak than in the man himself he do not suspect she be note how he speak of tree as friend how he be different from other man whom she know in that he stand so much closer to the ancient mother the wilderness now embrace they instinctively she know that it behove she to penetrate as deeply as she might into the inner nature of this man who hardly more than a pleasant attractive stranger yesterday be to-day she husband what be the oldest thing in the world he ask she abruptly she wrinkle she brow prettily at he church to-morrow evening and school now she counter lightly answer insist king just at a rough guess what would you say be the oldest thing in the world glorium cudgel she brain finally since he seem quite serious and she know that wisdom lay in please the male of the species in small and unimportant matter she seek to reply the sphinx or the pyramid i would guess she offer naturally he return and what will you say when i introduce you to the pharaoh who be a big husky giant before thebe be think of again she look to see a twinkle of jest in he eye pharaoh she say just a tree over two or three thousand year old by at least another thousand he rejoin triumphantly and as staunch a old gentleman as you 'll find even gloria a poor little city-bred angel must muse upon the statement have catch she interest he tell she picturesquely of he old friend how they have dwell on serenely while people be bear and empire rise and fall while rome smite greece and both go down in the dust while columbus push he three boat across the sea while the world itself pass from one phase to another how they be all but co-eternal with eternity when you think how these old fellow be a thousand year old when the christ be a little boy he end simply you will begin to realize the sort of thing they have a way of say to you while you lie still and look up and up and still up among they branch that seem at night to brush against the star she let she fancy drift in the leash of he but again they leave the picturesque ancient tree and return to he a little smile touch she lip and be go before he be sure of it she be think that a man like king keep always in he heart something of the simplicity of a little child she wonder if she herself though so much younger in actual year be not world more sophisticated for he part king note that she display to-day none of that chatter singing gaiety of they former ride together he remember sympathetically that she have have very little sleep last night and that she have endure a wearisome twenty-four hour before and that the long nervous strain under which she have struggle must certainly have tell upon she both physically and mentally so believe that she would be grateful for silence he grow silent with she further and ever further into the heart of the solitude they ride through the quiet hour of the forenoon with glorium ever more abstracted and mark king hold apart from she do she reverence drinking always deep of that soft sweet beauty which be hers they forsake the creek where the yellow-leaved aspen flutter they myriad little gleaming banner they make slow zigzag work of climb a flinty-sided mountain they look back upon green meadow and gay poplar grove far below they gallop they horse across a wide table-land over which shrill the wind already sharpen by the season for the work it have to do before many week pass though there be some few level space though now and then as king seek for she the easier way they ride down short slope with every mile put behind they they have climb perceptibly already glorium have the sensation of be by the world forget -- though for she the world could not be forget a ridge from which they look out across the peak and valley seem to she like a island lose remote eternally set apart from other people whom she know from all she life as she have live it she go on and on and feel like one in a dream journey into a fierce rugged land over which lay a spell of enchantment a spell that have be cast over it before king 's all but immortal tree have burst from the seed so that now while the outside world pulsed and beat with life and swing back and forth with its pendulous progress here all be unchanged changeless king lead she well before midday to the spot in which from the first he have plan that they would noon a forest pool ringed with boulder which be green with moss under the splashing of the water from above where the sway pine mirror themselves and shiver in the little breeze which ruffle the clear cold water here be a tiny upland meadow and much rich grass here a sheltered spot where glorium might sit in the sun and be protect from the colder air he be quick to help she to dismount and note that she come down stiffly the eye which she turn to he be heavy with fatigue some of the rose flush have fade from she cheek maybe i should not have let you come after all dear he say contritely these be harder trail than we have ride before and we have have to keep at it steadier there be a effort in she smile answer he the last two day _ have _ be hard to get through with she say as she yield to he insistence and sit down on the sun-warmed pine-needle i be sorry i be so -- so -- he do not allow she to run down the elusive word nonsense he tell she heartily you have get a right to be tired but when you have have some hot lunch and a cup of hot coffee you 'll be tip-top again you 'll see king unsaddled and tethered the horse where they could browse and rest and roll build he little fire and go about lunch-getting with a joy he have never know in the old accustomed routine before now and then he glance toward glorium he could not help that but he see that she be lie back she eye close and while he heart go out to she he do not force he sympathy on she she be tired and what be more she have every right and reason to be tire he hope that she might get three wink of sleep when he come near she for the coffee-pot he tiptoe she seem to be asleep but glorium be not asleep never have she mind race so it be do and she be mark king 's wife higher and higher loom that fact above all other consideration but there be other consideration she father hurt she do not know how badly she mother mystify by now perhaps inform of glorium 's marriage gratton with the poison extract from he fang have the fang still gold ahead somewhere in cave where man long ago have labor and fight and snarl at one another like starve wolf and die brodie somewhere brodie with the horrible face she shiver and stir restlessly and king who see everything think that she have dream a bad dream but lunch be ready he come to she with plate and cup and again glorium do she best to smile gratefully you be so good to I mark she say she eye be thoughtful would he always be good to she even when -- but she be too weary to think it seem to she that only now be she begin to feel the effect of all she have be through i want to learn how to be good to you wife of mine he say very gently that be all on earth i ask just to make you happy you love I so much mark she ask as one who wonder at what she have read in he low voice and glimpse in he eye gloria he tell she gently i do not understand this thing they call love yet it be too new too wonderful but i do know that in all the world there be nothing else that matter not even gus ingle 's red red gold she say rather more lightly than she have speak not even gus ingle 's red red gold she look at he long and curiously you would do anything you could to make I happy anything mark i pray with all my heart and soul that i always may gloria seem to rest through the noon hour and to brighten when she see he the second time look at the sun she get up from the ground and say : time to go on i be ready and after that banquet i feel all _ I _ again he laugh and go off after the horse singing at the top of he voice she stand very still look off after he she brow pucker into a shadowy frown oh if she could only read herself as he allow she to read he if she could only be as sure of glorium as she be of mark if she could only look deep into she heart as she look into he but she could not he heart be like the clear pool just yonder across which the sunshine lay and far down in which she could see the stone and pebble as through so much clear glass hers be like the rush stream above eddy and swirl and hide itself under its own light spray all day long she have try to see what lay under the surface _ do she love mark king _ she have thrill to he as she have thrill to no other man but that have be in the springtime twice then she have be sure that she love he but that be so long ago and now that she have allow he to carry she out of the quicksand what now she be so bear down by all that she have live through he be so much a part of the mountainous solitude tower about they and be she one to love the wilderness -- for long or do it not begin to bear down upon she uncertain spirit do it not menace and frighten and in the end would it not repel oh if she have only let he go on alone this morning if she have remain where she could rest and think and thus come to see clearly even into she own troubled heart they first hour after lunch lead they through a region which give over to silence itself deny they any considerable opportunity for conversation king ride ahead turn off to the leave from they resting-place by the pool and ride through a sea of gray brush follow a narrow trail make by deer then the mountain-side rear its barrier and make all forward and upward progress slow and toilsome three time they dismount and king lead the horse here gloria clung to the steep mountain-side look fearfully down into the monster gorge carve at its base dwelling with fascinate fancy on the thought of slip lose handhold and foothold and plunge down among the jagged boulder strew the lower level there be really no great danger she tell herself over and over king 's cheery call reassure she no danger so long as they go forward on foot but now and then when a horse 's foot slip and a wild cascade of loose soil and rock go hurtle downward she grow rigid with apprehension but there be only a hour of this thereafter they ride down a long slope and into a long narrow twist ravine rocky cliff on one hand and a noisy stream on the other a fair trail underfoot nearly always now king ride ahead find the way for she and glorium she spirit droop again with the advance afternoon vaguely oppress by the solemn stillness about she be glad that she too could be silent when he do call to she she need only nod or smile he turn to point out some rare view that appeal to he a vista worth she see a cascade or a fall of cliff or a ferny nook or perhaps a late ceanothus - blossom he point out a scamper dougla squirrel and have she hearken to a quail we be already in the finest timber belt in the world he tell she full of enthusiastic loyalty to he beloved mountain thus he lead the way she follow with head down and shoulder droop they come about four o'clock to a small meadow cliff-ringed stud with big yellow pine and here and there grace with a incense cedar stop in the open sit sideways in the saddle he wait for she and what do you think of this miss glorium he call gaily as she horse thrust he black nose through the alder down by the creek glorium draw rein and look at he with large eye across the twenty pace separate they i can not go any further she say bleakly i be tire out he be quick to see a gathering of tear and swing down from he horse and go to she with long stride he own eye fill with concern poor little kidlet he say humbly i have let you do yourself up and it be he duty he privilege and no one 's else in the world to shelter she to stand between she and all hardship he put out he arm to take she into they quite as he could have pick up a little maid of six something stir in the depths of he which in man be twin to the maternal instinct in woman but glorium say hurriedly : please mark i be so tired and draw back and he let he hand fall to he side for a second time she act hurt he she gesture be akin to lock a door last night but in a moment he pity and loyalty and staunch faith in she crowd the small ache out of he heart he be unroll a pack make a temporary couch for she and command she lovingly just to lie down and look up at the tree-top above she and rest while he stake out the horse sense that perhaps the very bigness and majestic silence of these upland might rest heavy upon she spirit and perhaps depress if not actually awake in she a emotion akin to fear he strive to cheer she by he own blithe acceptance of the fortune of the hour he tell she heartily that she have earn a rest if any one ever have that it be well after all to get a early start at pitch camp that he be go to make he lady-love as cosy here in he big outdoor home as be ever princess in castle wall glorium shiver and throw herself face down on the blanket glorium do not know what possess she she fight for repression hide she face from he out of a hideously stern world a black spirit have leap upon she it clutch at she throat it drag at she heart when king call a cheery word from beyond the thicket where he have go with the horse she could have scream she be so nervous that now and again a fierce tremor shake she from head to foot \* \* \* \* \* king be count it fortunate that they be grant so likely a camp site for the night he look up at the tall black cliff shut in the little meadow they would hold back the night wind from glorium he choose the spot well back from the creek where she would sleep high overhead like brooding giant stand the upright pine where a little clump of mere youngster lusty fellow not a score of year old have the air of press close together as though thus with they combined strength they seek to match the strength of they aloof parent a compact grove to make a further shelter against the mountain air glorium would sleep he stretch a strip of canvas from tree to tree make a five-foot wall of it close by he start he fire know from experience oft repeat how a cheery blaze in the forest may dispel shadow within even as it make the sombrest of shadow dance gaily under the tree to one side he lay many resinous faggot plan on they crackling light later on when the dark come he ringed he fire with rock lug they as heavy as he could carry up from the creek side make the rudest of fireplace but it have the merit that it throw the heat back toward he extended canvas and there between it would be snug and warm all about he as he labor be the singing of water and high in air the singing of pine top they make merry music and king go down to the stream to fill he coffee-pot sing with it from a full brimming heart glorium be tired but she be rest now and in a little while when dark come he and she would sit by he fire and look into it and talk in hushed voice hand lock in hand they would watch for the first of the big blaze star to come out -- he and glorium alone in the wilderness he see a trout swing lazily in a quiet pool trout for glorium he glance toward where she lay he be glad that she be not look it would be a surprise for she he hurry to he kit in he pack get out hook and line bait with a tiny bit of red flannel and go back to the creek for he know that it be not likely that the trout here could have have any remembered encounter with man they be plentiful and might like many other sort of being be lure to they undoing by curiosity and greed he cut a willow pole stand back and cast out he gay bit of bait let it drift with the riffle there come a quick tug another sharp and vigorous and he swing he prize out of the water break the surface into scatter jewel flash in the sunlight as it strike against the grass along the creek 's edge dusk gather while he work over he fire the aroma of boil coffee rise creep through the air blended with the aroma of the wood he have make toast hold the bread to the coal upon a sharpened stick there be strip of crisp bacon garnish a trout brown to the last painstaking turn there be fry potato cut by king 's pocket-knife into thin strip and turn into gold by the alchemy of cooking he set out he dish upon a flat-topped rock replenish he fire throw on some fresh-cut green cedar bough for they delightful fragrance and go to call glorium \* \* \* \* \* glorium too tired bodily and mentally to wage a winning battle against those black vapor which flock so frequently about luckless youth have suffer and yield and go down in misery she have be cry just why she know not cry because she could not help it hers be a state of overwrought nerve which forbid clear thinking which distorted and warped and magnify the babble of the water which have be music to king be to she a chorus of jeer voice the wind in the pine a eerie moaning as of lose spirit wail the tree themselves merge with the dusk be brooding shadowy giant thing which she suddenly both fear and hate the cliff rise against the sky loom so near and so gigantically tall that she feel as though they be press in upon she to suffocate she to crush she to annihilate she the world be turn black with the night the night rush tread out the last gleam of sunlight even the one star which she have glimpse through she tear impress she only with its remoteness she be frighten not because of any physical violence for mark king stand between she and that but of vague horror she think of san francisco of she own bright room there of the light in the street of pedestrian and motor and street-car fill that other steel-cañoned wilderness with familiar noise and somehow san francisco seem further away immeasurably further away than that one remote star blaze through the vastness of space a cup of coffee and a bit of supper king say gently you 'll feel a lot better she rise wearily and follow he without a word she drop down beside he banquet put out a listless hand to she tin cup the firelight upon she face show he she thoughtful eye but they be turn not toward he but toward the bed of coal he have anticipate she lively surprise at the trout she push the brown morsel aside say absently : i be not hungry it be good of you to go to all of this trouble i be afraid i be not much of a camper she force the shadow of a smile with the admission tucker out he think as he look into she face across which light and shadow flicker as flame and smoke in the camp-fire come and go fitfully twist by the evening breeze clean tucker out glorium feel he gaze so steady upon she turn she eye toward he eye heavy and sober with she drooping spirit as the flame frolic about the pitch-pine he have toss to the coal he see the trace of tear he say nothing suppose that he understand he but strive the harder to be good to she to share with she some of that rare joy fill he own heart he seek with unobtrusive tenderness to anticipate she slightest want he jump to he foot and bring she a cup of water he shove aside a burn branch which roll impudently too near the divine foot he remove the offend fish from under she nostril hastily and half apologetically he pile the fire high when he see she shiver and finally when she push she cup away and let she two hand drop into she lap he gather the dish and carry they away to the nearest pool to wash they leave glorium silent and thoughtful brooding over he fire when he come back to she in the hush of the first hour of night he think that he understand she need for silence and speak only infrequently and briefly and very very softly call she attention now to the last linger light upon the piney ridge behind they or to the liquid music of the creek which with the come of night seem to grow clearer and finer and sweeter or finally to the big star burning gloriously in the perfect deep-blue sky and now he say take up he short-handled axe i be go to make for my lady-love the finest couch for tranquil restful sleep that mortal ever have as he stride away toward a grove of fir he be lose to she eye before he have go a hundred pace the night come so swiftly it seem to she feverish fancy that in the dark the big tree trunk be huddle closer together in a moment she hear the sound of he axe striking softly through green juicy branch he work swiftly grudging every minute away from she and then with he arm full of the fragrant balsamy bough he stop and let they slip down to the ground and himself sit down upon a log and fill he pipe with slow finger he would force himself to smoke one pipe before he go back to she thinking that she would be grateful for a few moment alone almost with the first puff of smoke there come to he glorium 's pierce scream he heart stop he jump up and run through the tree to she shouting : glorium i gloria i be come what be it glorium be cower against the nearest tree she face show frightened in the firelight she eye wide with nervous horror there be something there in the bush she cry excitedly i hear it move he look where she point down by the creek just waddle back into the alder be a fat old porcupine dimly see in the fringe of the camp-fire but king do not laugh he first impulse upon he strengthen by glorium 's helplessness he take she into he arm hold she close to he why do you leave I ask gloria petulantly so long he have be away from she fifteen minute while he cut a armful of fir-bough and thereafter fill and light he pipe -- and to gloria the time have seem long little enough of love 's confession surely but a golden crumb to a man 's starve love he draw she closer they face ruddy with fire-glow each tense with its own emotion be close together oh cry glorium she wrench away from he violently you -- you hurt I let I go she bury she face in she hand he see she shoulder lift and droop he hear she sob : oh i be a fool -- he arm have drop to he side and he stand for a moment speechless stare at she as across a chasm shadow-filled glorium he say bewildered but now she hand too be at she side clench and nervous she white face be lift and she break out passionately into hot word he see she breast heaving and sense that she be stir to depths never until now plumb what he could not glimpse be the vague unreasonable reason the distorted horror grin at she among the space of black gloom into which she spirit have sink have he be a fancy-sick poet a pale-blooded creature give to blue devil and nightmare conjecture he might have come somewhere near a understanding but be plain mark king a straightforward healthy and unjaundiced man he comprehension find never a clue to a condition which in glorium be hardly other than a inevitable result of all that have go before i be half-mad last night she pant there be no way to turn that beast of a man drive I to desperation then you come and -- and -- oh i wish that i be dead incredulous amaze near stupefy he stand root to the ground i do not understand he say dully after a long silence break only by a tumble and frolic of the water and glorium 's quick hard breathing he strive to be very gentle with she just what be it can you tell I dear do not call I dear like that she cry sharply just as though i be you _ property _ he see the roundness of she eye she shudder you know that i be drive to it to save my name to stop hideous gossip in she disorder mind she have be fling as upon shoal to many bleak point of view she have blame fate for she undoing she have blame gratton she have lay the responsibility upon she mother for have allow she to drift but always she have look upon herself as the victim now in she agitation which have rise close to hysteria it be suddenly mark king whom she blame for everything he in the guise of fate have betray she you see that i be half dead with terror that i hardly know what i be do that all i could think of be escape from the horrible trap that have be set for I you -- so that be it but still he tone be utterly devoid of any emotion save that of incredulity you mean you do not love I glorium when do you ever ask I if i love you but you you marry I great god he run he hand across he brow as though to brush away a obsession not loving I you marry I just to save yourself from possible scandal what girl would not she cry wildly drive as i be he try to think with all of that calm deliberation which this moment so plainly require in mind he go back stage by stage through all of last night 's event and so he come in retrospect in due time to the moment when he have come to the porch and have look in through the window to take he last farewell of she when he have see she standing at gratton 's side she have droop so like a figure of despondency she have lift she head slowly at the judge 's question and then there have occur that sudden change in she bearing and in she voice alike when abruptly she have cry out : no no and no and no tell I say king heavily when you refuse to marry gratton last night -- do you know that i be outside yes she answer she wonder why he ask there be a mirror i see you reflection in it if i have not come -- would you have go on with the thing he hesitate then say harshly : would you have marry he i do not know oh she exclaim twist at she hand how can i tell what i would have do drive one way tear another -- you might have marry he you but choose I as the lesser of two evil be that it i tell you i do not know i only know that i be hideously compromise i would never have dare show my face again in san francisco -- anywhere -- it would have kill I -- and even yet there be in king 's face only a queer tortured incredulity for a long time neither move nor speak he eye be on she hers intently on he when he answer it be in a voice from which all of to-day 's joyousness have flee i be go to make you bed glorium he say evenly near the fire which i 'll keep go i 'll make mine on the outside so you need not be afraid of any prowl animal then in the morning we will talk she watch he go back for he scattered fir-bough and even gloria note how heavy be he walk but she could not guess how when he be alone with he tree and the darkness drop curtainwise between he and she he go down on both knee and bury he face in one of those same fall spray from the fir _ chapter xviii _ flat on he back lay mark king he hand under he head he eye upon the slow procession of the star just so have he lie many a night in the forest-land -- but life then and now be as two distinct existence which have nothing in common but be set apart in two separate world remote one from the other now he see the star as it be with the physical eye alone merely because they blaze so bright against the darkness above he he be scarcely conscious of they gleam and sparkle of old he have be wont to commune with they through the long year they have weave themselves into he rough-and-ready religion countless time have he watch they and muse and hearken to the message which as with a still voice infinitely calming travel to he across the limitless vastitude of the universe countless time that voice have call he away from the toil and victory and defeat of the day up into a place of quiet from which a man might look about he with a somewhat truer perspective he glimpse futility in much of human strife and strive he see nobility enshrine in a small act he mark how set in the scale of the eternal balance of scope and eternity a copper penny set against a million dollar be as two feather they ride light and there be little choice between they he have know that firefly cluster of light above to be the majestic processional of world he see himself as small the universe as big and the knowledge do not crush it elevated throughout the whole of creation run the fine chain of divine ordinance of a law that flower in beauty there be god 's work above he about he within he and god stand back of it all vouch for it make it good the spin of world the pulse of tide the course of the blood in he vein -- these be kindred phenomenon the law of god bind about with its fine chain of divine will and love the greater and the lesser body move through the universe upon such a comprehension brotherhood of man and tree and sun and flower have be raise mark king 's haphazard edifice of a theory of life the star remind he that through the eon all have be right with the world of world they sing of hope and happiness and beauty they show a man the way to rich full contentment they light the path to generous dealings with other man they throw they searchlight upon the day a man have just do with and set he think they lead he thought ahead to the day soon to dawn make he wish to make a better job of thing but to-night between he and he beloved star stretch a region of shadow through which the eye of he soul do not look something within he have be stricken sorely wound beat to its knee chill with death he seek to think quite calmly and for a long time clear consecutive thought be beyond he reach a moment have come when he could only _ feel _ he be sweep this way and that he have give to gloria he love without stint without reservation without limit the love which no other woman have ever awaken have pour itself out before glorium like a flood of clear swift water break free he love after the only fashion possible to he with he whole heart and soul with he whole be he adore he make of he beloved a princess a goddess he see she upon a plane where no woman ever live in a atmosphere too rare for flesh-and-blood humanity a man do not love through human reason rather through a reason hide even to he deeper than humanity then glorium have put she hand into he glorium have marry he glorium have elect to come with he after that he have see nothing in its true light glorium have remake the world into paradise ineffable he have be on the height lift among the star and without warn without mercy the world have crash about he from the zenith to the nadir small wonder that thought do not come logically he flounder lose crushed bewildered just yonder on the bed of fir-bough he have make for she lay glorium he do not look that way the wind be rise he hear it go rush through the tree-top it strike with sudden relentless impact it set the shiver needle to shrill whistle it make the staunch old trunk shudder he hear the canvas flap-flapping by glorium 's bed above he toss bough scrape and creak one thing only seem clear to he : the time have come when a man must seek to hold himself in check when he must not leap when he must strive with all the stubborn will in he to reserve judgment he own life 's crisis have come to he reveal itself with the blinding swiftness of a flash of lightning a step forward or back now would be one step toward which he entire destiny from the hour of birth until now have lead he there would be no retrace it it would be final and everything -- everything -- be at stake he must think he must try to understand all that glorium have experience to see what impulse have move she to make allowance for she to come to read aright what lay in she heart he must see clearly into two human heart task for the god as though the wilderness about he be a colossal malevolent entity endowed with the power to look into human breast it jeer at he with its voice of the wind he have but half a mind to give to physical sens though the wind howl all night long he scarce be conscious of it though the cold increase he do not know that he be cold before he have grow numb he have give to gloria all of they bedding save alone the one blanket he have wrap about he he have keep on all he clothing button up he coat and forget that he be not warmly cover now he get up and walk up and down he make the fire blaze up he sit huddle over it until it burn down to a bed of glowing red coal once or twice he hear glorium stir restlessly upon she fir-bough bed but he do not speak there be nothing to be say between they now they would wait until she have rest until morning then there would be no more delay they would understand each other then as few man and woman have understand there would be plain word and but few of they he grow impatient for morning and sit look forward to its come with a face set and hard grow as stern as death glorium exhaust have go to sleep snuggled warmly into she blanket it be the wind that awake she she start wide awake she heart in she throat startle by the flap of the canvas at she head she lay still and look up the pine be black and sway dismally the wind among they make shuddersome music the cold begin to drive through she blanket through she clothing she body be stiff and sore the branch of fir under she hurt she through the canvas and one blanket which cover they she turn twist into a position of less discomfort the creek babble and splash its voice merge with the wild into a bleak cheerless duet she lift she head a little the fire be die out and king have go the darkness bear down upon she she hear everywhere vague sound noise as of stealthy foot she know a moment of blind terror she try to cry out but only a little choke gasp result she see something move a vague formless dreadful something and lay back chill with fright it be king he be bring fresh fuel she sink back and again look up at the pine sway against the field of star she begin to shiver a nervous chill she feel the slow tear form and spill over and trickle down she cheek she gather she nether lip between she tooth and lay very still shake now and then by a noiseless sob she exist through a period of suppress excitement if king find cool logic elude he glorium 's mind be a orgy of nervous imagining she be back with she mother weep sob out upon a comforting breast all of she hideous adventure she be read the tall headline in the newspaper she be comment on they with simulated flippancy to georgium and ernestine she be meet mr gratton for the first time again treat he to such haughty disdain as put hot blood into he white face she be stand erect in the morning confront mark king fearlessly demand she rights command that he take she home and piteously lonely and frightened she be longing to have he come to she now to put he arm about she to hold she tight to set he fearless body between hers and the vague and terrible menace of the night and the jeer night voice she hear a twig snap she heart beat wildly she wonder what she would do when he come -- and she see that he sit motionless by the fire the night wear on she doze now and then fitfully awaken always rudely by unaccustomed noise or by the cold or the discomfort of she bed she put she hand to she cheek wonder if she be go to be feverish she face be cold she see that king have light he pipe she want to scream at he how she hate he for that that he could smoke while she lay here in such wretchedness make she briefly hot with anger he be a man and sweepingly she tell herself that she loathe all mankind she accuse he of heartlessness of lack of understanding of brutal lack of sympathy he and he alone be responsible for everything -- that vague terrible _ everything _ he sit there as still as a rooted tree he bulk big through the gloom like a rugged boulder he be a part of this wild land as indifferent as cold as merciless the thought now that he might come to she make she quake with fear she be afraid of he if she could only sleep no sleep to-night little the night before less the night before that no wonder she brain swirl if all this have happen at any other time -- she be a bundle of nerve -- nerve that vibrate at the slightest suggestion she be go to be ill perhaps the end of it would be that she would die all of the misshapen monstrous fancy which be breed of a sleepless and nervous night make for she a period of such stress that as the hour wear on they blanch she cheek and put dark shadow under she eye and taunt she with longing for a rest which they deny she thus in the stern grip of they destiny mark king and glorium live through the night two uncertain spirit await the light of day and thus they brain those finite organ upon which mankind entrust the order of great event prepare themselves for the moment when they must grapple with and decide a matter of supreme moment and all night the wind like a hateful voice jeer \* \* \* \* \* at four o'clock that chill wind-blown morning king begin the day he see that glorium be awake and sit up look straight ahead of she he give no sign of have note she but busy himself in a swift silent sort of way with fire-building and breakfast preparation glorium in turn see he she experience aloof wonder at the look on he face he be haggard he mouth be set and hard she have think to be thankful when daylight come now she get up and go to the fire rub she cold hand together look at a awaken world with dull lack-lustre eye it be not yet full day what light filter down here into this sheltered spot be cheerless as it draw forest detail out of the thin shadow it seem to be paint they in cold gray monotone upon a cold gray world he and she when he come back with a arm-load of wood look straight into each other 's eye long and soberly searchingly and hopelessly after that they do not again look into each other 's face no good-morning have pass between they since both sense that any time for empty civility have go there could be no conventional pretence at harmony even in small thing they must be in each other 's arm or world apart out of a night 's grapple with chimera king have come to one and only one determination : he would go slowly he would hold a iron check upon himself he would throttle down a temper which more than once in he life at moment of tempest have blaze out uncontrollably he would smother within himself that passion which in forthright man be so prone to burst into violence be glorium to show herself to be this or that be she to say this word or another he would speak with she coolly he would listen to she calmly and in the end since judge he must he would judge with he heart order to beat steadily and not with a wild rush of blood he have set a guard in he own breast as he might have set a guard over a camp of treacherous enemy yet from the outset nothing be more unlikely than that these two should advance by smooth path to a clear and utter understand he one glimpse of she face dethrone he cold logic and move he very deeply she be so white so pitifully sad-looking she too have suffer god know that she have battle through hour of anguish he want she in he arm he want to batter at the world with he fist to save she from its fling of grief and pain he bite savagely at he lip and turn away and she see he haggard eye he draw face know that she have be unjust last night when she have hate he for seem a soulless man who could smoke he pipe in all serenity and feel nothing of the unhappiness of the night he do not look like the mark king of yesterday the glad gleam of joy have die in he eye the quick resiliency have go out of he step he too have live through slow hour of torture he do love she -- she could never doubt that -- have he suddenly catch she to he then have he crush she close in he arm have he cry out in headlong passion that she _ must _ love he that he would make she love he that she be he that he would not give she up -- would she have wrench away from he hot with anger -- or would she have creep close and know at last whether or not she love he but here be something else she could not know he turn and go off for he wood she crouch shiver by the fire they breakfast in silence the fire between they neither do much more than drink the strong coffee glorium sit toss bit of bread into the fire it be on he lip to tell she not to do that waste in the wilderness be a crime but he hold he word back he go methodically about camp work clean the plate and cup and pan remake the two pack all this time she do not stir at last he come back to she and stand by the die fire ominously silent she grow nervously restive wish that he would say something there be a day 's work to be do he say at last he voice mean to be impersonal be only stern that mean a early start and -- be it very much further to the cave she ask he have pause she have to say something it will take a long day get there you see we do not come very far yesterday this she suppose be a fling at she and she stiffen under it but when she speak it be to ignore the innuendo intend or not for wherever they might be lead she hope it would not be into sordid quarrel it begin to be rather obvious that i should not have come do not it she ask well now if i turn back -- to the house and then to mamma and papa in coloma and then to san francisco and i if you would go with I as far as the house -- she see how he body straighten how he broad shoulder square there be something eloquent in the gesture mark king with no toleration of a clutter of side issue come straight to the main barrier which must be sweep aside for good and all or which must be skirt and so pass and relegate to the limbo of dead hope do you love I glorium he demand as lover love as i have love you as a wife should love she husband do not i explain all of that last night she say petulantly must we go over it all again if i have have pained you i be sorry i can not say any more than that can i i think i make you see how i be place how there be but the one thing for I to do marry gratton or I and you choose I she hesitate she know that he be angry though he give so little outward sign nor do she fail to recognize that he have grounds for anger but none the less she resent he insistent questioning she stand look blankly at he if she have only obey she straightforward impulse at the house to go to he and explain she predicament i intend she begin in a low strange voice to go to you to tell you -- answer I he say sternly yes or no do you marry I without love and just to save yourself from possible gossip of be alone all night with a man be that why you marry I yes or no to glorium as to king the issue be clear and not to be cloud to she credit be it say that she waste no time in fruitless evasion this matter would demand settlement as well now as later there be wisdom in end all unpleasantness once and for ever yes she answer defiantly then suddenly it be give she to see a mark king she have never dream of a mark king of blaze wrath thrust aside the man whom she know and who have hold himself in check and throttle down he emotion until she speak that quiet yes the word be like a spark to a train of gunpowder he determination to beat down he temper no matter what come be go he memory of she ordeal be wipe out from he whole tense be there flash out upon she a hot heady anger like stab lightning from a ominous cloud he few word sear and scorch a place in she memory to endure always he clench he hand and raise they for a instant she think he be go to strike she down you be utterly contemptible he shout at she and i be do with you he turn and leave she glorium stare after he in amazement she see how he walk swiftly he big boot crunch through the gravel down by the creek bed splash through the water carry he up the timbered slope toward the horse she could not know that he be almost run because he be tell himself in he fierce white passion that unless he leave she thus he would lose the last power of restraint and set he hand to she pink-and-white throat and choke she until the last second he have seek not to condemn too soon now after he fashion he condemn sweepingly for the moment he hold that she be less to he than the grime upon he boot when he come to the horse he be white with anger he lift he hand and look at he finger queerly they be tremble he curse himself for a fool shut the hand into a hard fist as steady as rock and for a instant glare at it blackly then he open the finger slowly a hard smile make he mouth ugly and leave it cruel the finger have hearken to a superb will and give no greater hint of tremble than do the nigged hole of the giant cedar under which he stand he coil he horse 's tie-rope and lead he back to camp as he draw near glorium promptly turn she back and study she nail she have have encounter with man before now and have not yet gauge the profundity of this man 's emotion she count fully on bring he to a full and contrite sense of he crime before she condescend so much as to look at he but when she flash he a quick furtive glance she see that he have he back upon she and that he give neither hint of soften nor yet of knowledge of she presence he bridle the buckskin saddle tie he rope at the saddle-horn and begin make he pack she watch uneasy and concerned but not yet fully understand but when she note how he take from they breakfast-table one cup one plate one knife and fork only how he do not appear interested in the marmalade-jar which she know have be bring for she how he leave half of the coffee and bacon and sugar a strange alarm come over she she glance wildly around the forest glower darkly the silence be overpower the loneliness bewilder he be go to leave she -- she have not the faintest idea in the world where the trail lay king go swiftly about he preparation he do not even see she he studiously keep he eye aloof within he soul he swear that he would never look at she againhe take up he rifle glorium stir uneasily she do not like to yield to he even to the extent of say a stiff word but she feel that the man be not play a part and that in another moment she would be alone you be not go to leave I here alone be you she demand coldly i be go on be he curt rejoinder and i she persist what you please he go on with he preparation terror spring up into the girl 's heart i would never find my way out she cry jump to she foot and come toward he i be not use to the mountain i do not know which way i would die to be rid of you the easiest way he return bluntly i would turn back with you until we get within striking distance of the open but you have make I waste time as it be and i promise ben that i would be in gus ingle 's cave with no time lose so i be go on but and all of she surging terror tremble in she rush word i would die i tell you and i tell you he snap back at she that i do not care a damn if you do must i tell you twice that i be through with you he set he foot to the stirrup glorium pride lose in panic run to he and grasp he arm cry to he : you must not leave I this way it be brutal it be murder i give my promise to ben he say you be not worth break a promise if you will not take I back then let I go with you worthless and selfish and cowardly useless and vain and brainless good god be i a man full grow to loiter on the trail with the like of you let go he shake she hand off roughly and swing up into the saddle send he horse with a boot-heel in the flank down to the ford but glorium scream after he and run after he down to the creek and through it call out : mark mark for god 's sake do not leave I i be afraid i will die of fear take I with you he do not look back at she but he do pause after all she be the daughter of he old friend the wood be free and open he say slowly to even such as you for the third time and for the last i tell you this : i be do with you but if you like you may follow behind I i will wait for you ten minute not here but on the ridge up there and if you have not come i will go on at the end of that time that be my solemn word glorium gaynor he ride from she straight and massive in the saddle up the slope among the big-boled tree and in a trice out of sight she stand like one in a sudden trance then with a inarticulate moan she run into the grove and grasp blackie 's rope and drag at he try to make he run with she to she saddle and few belongings the saddle nearly overmaster she it be heavy and she know as little of it as do any city girl but she need be sore and she young body not without supple strength in half of the allotted time glorium come ride up the ridge now king glance toward she briefly but less at she than at she pack you have better go back for the rest of the grub he say to she and for you blanket-roll that would be my advice to the devil himself you can do it in the five minute leave to you gloria fling up she head open she lip for a stinging reply and then hold for a moment in silence and hesitation you hideous brute she fling at he but none the less she hasten back for she outfit five minute later they ride on into the ever-deepening wilderness she just keep he form in sight he never turn nor speak _ chapter xix _ for he brutal treatment of she glorium fully mean that in the ripeness of time he should pay to the uttermost after that first panic she feel toward king only such anger as she have never experience before never have cause for it perhaps the emotion be the beginning of a new soul-life for she certainly here be a moment of reversion to a condition of unplumbed progenital influence the scorching anger arise from such a primitive situation be in itself primal hence the emotion no less that the experience itself be novel clean searing anger follow this emotion which ride she and sap she nervous strength come a period of faintness and nausea she close she eye and drop she head and clung to the horn of she saddle with hand which go cold and shake in this mood she call out once to king but he be far ahead and do not turn she do not know whether he have hear she gradually the weakness pass they top the ridge and the sun wan she coolly and collectedly she turn she thought upon the insufferable insult and come back through a sort of circle to she first intention now the decision be cold and stubborn : he would pay and in full king lead the way unfalteringly time and again she see no hint of a trail underfoot or ahead they break through brush or make a difficult way through a thicket of alder or willow and invariably come again upon a trail it be evident that the man think only of he journey 's end and be hasten hence he take all the short cut which he know in one of these pathless place where the scrub-tree and tangle of brush be above she head where it seem that she must smother she lose all sight of he she horse come to a dead halt she listen and could not hear the hoof of he horse again panic master she and she cry out wildly but just ahead be a mad mountain stream fill the gorge with its thunder she know that king could not hear she she feel the desperate certainty that he would not heed could he hear then she strike she horse frantically with she bare hand and pound he with she heel longing for the sight of king as one athirst in the bad land long for water the horse snort and whirling and plunge go rip through the bush which whip at she and tear the skin of hand and face but in three minute he bring she into the open and into full sight of king ride up a gentle slope through big red-boled cedar when she fear die as it do swiftly after the way of fear it leave not the old hot anger but a new elemental emotion -- cold hatred thus upon they second morning the honeymoon enter upon its second phase every moment bring some new discomfort to she the saddle hurt she : she clothes be tear she tender skin bruise and scratch pain come stabbingly with early fatigue as for king he have come abruptly to look down upon she as utterly despicable be a man of high honor he convict she out of hand as one without honor despise she he despise himself for have link he life in ever so little with hers but yesterday he have kneel to she humbly in he innermost heart of heart now he seek to shut he mind against she quite as definitely as he turn he back on she what sombre misshapen edifice they should build upon these corner-stone of hate and contempt be a matter into which no conjecture could enter even slightly have they compelling environment be different in the city they would have turn they back and walk away from each other but two storm-driven man upon a raft do not separate until land be sight glorium at least be in she present plight comparable to a shipwrecked sailor of little skill and less resource hence what be to be remain to be see at ten o'clock the air be sun-warmed and sweet half a hour later the genial day be make over by the high wind trail vapor into a chill bleak sky they have climb to fresh altitude the timber through which they progress indicate that a height of at least seven thousand foot above sea-level have be pass they pass through grove of the thin-barked tamarack come at the base of a rugged slope to scatter mountain pine which rear into lusty perfection on bleak wind-swept level where many of they companion growth be begin to run out in dwarf twisted misery and come to a rocky pass through the mountain where on all side the red cedar the juniper of the sierra throve hardily among bare boulder crowning the lofty crest like a sparse stiff hirsute display upon the gigantic body of the world the dwarf pine linger here straggle along the slope beat down by many a winter of wind and heavy snow but by noon they have make a slow tedious way down a rocky ridge and be once more in the heart of the upper forest belt in a upland meadow through whose narrow boundary a thin cold stream trickle they noon long have glorium hunger for the moment when she would see king swing down from the saddle during the last half-hour she have begin to fear that he brutality know no bound and that he would spare neither the horse nor she but crowd on until nightfall when he do dismount by the creek she draw rein fifty foot from he king slip buck 's bridle drop the tie-rope and let the animal forage along the fringe of the brook to glorium in a voice which strike she as be as chill as the gray overcast sky he say : better let you horse eat we have get to go pretty steady to get anywhere to-day glorium get down stiffly from she saddle in all the day of she life she have never be so unutterably weary further she be faint from hunger and she throat pained she she go to the creek and throw herself down and put she face into the cool water from which she rise with a long sigh she have see how king do with he tie-rope she do similarly but be too tired to trouble with remove the bit from she horse 's mouth still blackie accept he handicapped opportunity and join buck in tear and rip at the lush grass it be more invite than the manzanita-bush and occasional sunflower-leaf at which he have snatch during the day king make coffee and fry bacon the horse have earn a hour of rest and fodder and a man have the right to bacon and coffee even though hard mile lie before he while he potter with he fire he look more than once at the sky in the south-west with all of he heart he wish that he have turn back with glorium this morning by now he could have set she foot in a trail which even a fool could travel back to the log house and he could be again hasten upon he errand glorium lay inert she chew slowly at a bit broken from a slab of hard chocolate and keep she eye close she face be very white two big tear of distress slip out from the shut lid but king do not come close enough to see they when he coffee be ready he call to she say indifferently : better have a cup it help but glorium do not reply king seem not to notice whether she eat or not but when he have drunk he own coffee and she still lay quiet on the grass he sweeten a cup for she put some milk in it and set it at she elbow better drink it he say coldly and glorium gather she strength and sit up and drink thereafter she eat some bread and potted ham fragment of bread the crust and half of the ham she throw away king open he mouth to protest then shrug and remain silent he back to a tree he sit and smoke until the hour have pass precisely at one o'clock they be on they way glorium catch she own horse coil the rope and mount as king ride across the meadow and to the wooded slope beyond she follow it seem to she that this be all a dream she be almost light-headed the sternest of reality begin to seem impalpable and distant and of scant moment she know that she be go forward because she must that otherwise she would lie here in the lonely wilderness and die in she exhaustion she note as one do note he own soul-play when overwrought that the prospect of death seem less terrible than that of utter desertion the mountain be so big they stifle she with every tortuous step forward this formidable land all about she have grow more severe more lonely more to she like the kingdom of desolation than she have ever dream exist there be slope field strew with black lava rock where never a solitary blade of grass upthrust a thin spear there be break expanse across which the eye might travel wearily for what appear endless mile one could call out here with never a faint hope of be hear one left alone here could die miserably taunt only by the echo of she own choke voice this devil 's land take on a vindictive personality it be a hideous colossus stoop over she inspire with but one cruel desire to crush she soft white body to stamp out she life to annihilate she and gloat over she shrieking despair she feel like some hapless little princess in a fairy-tale who have wander into a monstrous land of black sorcery by four o'clock when it seem to glorium that she have reach and be pass the limit of she endurance come two momentous occurrence king ride ahead as usual be not quite so far in advance and do not have he back turn square upon she for the first time he have briefly mistake the trail they be on the steep flank of the mountain he turn and ride back in she general direction but some hundred yard lower on the slope the trail 's down here he announce shortly he do not lift he eye to she face do not note the droop of the weary body he look be all for she horse and a new and unreasonable spurt of anger be in he heart through she unbounded ignorance she have needlessly fatigue she mount have no knowledge of the way one employ to save he horse glorium understand dully that she be too far up and must ride down to he level she be beyond complain or ask question with a sudden jerk upon the rein she bring blackie about king curse under he breath that be too steep he call to she want to kill you horse blackie try to swerve and sidle down glorium lift she whip and strike he blackie snort and obey she command some loose dirt give way underfoot the tired beast stumble a dead limb catch at he leg trip he and blackie lurch downward and fall through the grace of fortune glorium roll clear and unhurt blackie get up totter with one quiver fore-leg lift king 's face go black with rage but this time it be wordless rage he dismount and make he way up to the lamed horse glorium from where she lay think at first that of course he be come to she but he keep he back to she as he lift the horse 's fore-leg and feel tenderly at the wrench muscle glorium without stir and without experience any poignant emotion watch he listlessly then shut she eye she most clear sensation be one of relief they would no doubt make camp here a cold drop of rain splash on she cheek she open she eye king be remove blackie 's saddle glorium close she eye again and sigh a sort of dreary thankfulness blossom feebly in she heart that the torturous day be over king would make some sort of a shelter she would drink a cup of coffee and crawl into she blanket and go to sleep come on call a voice as though from some great distance we have get to hurry as fast as god will let we blackie be stand where king have lead he he saddle and bridle swing up into a tree he foot still lift he nostril close to the long grass but untempted glorium 's canvas-rolled pack and the rifle be across king 's back as she sit up and stare at he she read he intention he be go on on foot expect she to take he horse i can not she say miserably he look up into the sky and not at she you can do what you please he retort curtly i be go on she rise and go stumble down the slope she sway as she try to mount but he do not offer he hand when she be in the saddle he stride on ahead blackie look after they wistfully the leg 's not broken king tell she gruffly just a bad sprain not you fault it be not worse though he 'll take care of himself god know he be get as good a chance as we have what do you mean she ask quickly he merely swing up he arm toward the sky by way of answer and go on the second big rain-drop hit glorium 's cheek it be chill its dullness seem to drive straight to she heart _ chapter xx _ the storm catch they as it have catch so many a wayfarer before and since the wintry season be not due for a full four week but the winter have thrust sign and season aside and make he regal entry after he own ancient fashion there come a crash of reverberate thunder a scurry in the thickening mass of black cloud a drenching downpour of rain for twenty minute they crouch in what scant shelter be afford they by a squat wide-limbed cedar then the wind go rip off through the tree-top exact its toll of fly twig and leave in its wake a brief hushed calm through the still air fall scatter flake of snow big and unbroken and feathery king 's eye be fill with concern he face be ominous like the face of the world about he again glorium 's tired body be assure of rest again king say expressionlessly : come on this time he help she into the saddle be in haste and of no mind to wait for trifle he hurry on ahead she follow on buck listlessly cling to the saddle she eye often shut for a hour it snow though there be no sun it be not dark save in the deeper cañons nor be it as cold as glorium have think it must be -- or else she be too tired to feel the pinch of the sharp air but presently the flake grow fewer and then cease utterly those that lay on the ground or clung to branch melt swiftly and with they departure the last light of the day be go now king lead the horse and glorium ride through a gathering darkness she want to ask why they do not stop why they do not turn back but lack the spirit now and then she half doze at last it be pitch dark and the rain be begin again king have stop and be help she down she be numb now in body she brain be numb the rain harden into a rattle of hail thereafter the air soften and fill with swirl snow glorium could not see if they be in a open valley or shut in by canon wall or upon the slope of a mountain nor do she greatly care she wait until king prepare some kind of a shelter and then go wordlessly to it she feel fir-bough under she ache body and be in pure animal fashion conscious of blanket and canvas over she and of a grateful warmth through a tangle of bush she see the flicker of a small fire she smell coffee she drink half of the hot cup which he bring to she then she let go she grip upon a wretched world and pass like a child into a heavy sleep by he fire of little cheer mark king sit with he canvas draw over he slump shoulder he head down he heart as black as the night he soul possess by ravage blue demon at the end of a fool 's day come a fool 's night he should have pay heed to the first threat of a thin film across the sky he should have turn back with glorium the first thing this morning he should have do anything in the world save exactly what he have do he should not have marry she he should not have bring she with he it be even sheer idiocy to come after this blind fashion into the mountain in the late fall though the season be early the hour be ominous the storm might pass before dawn there remain the equal likelihood that it would not be he alone or have he a man or yes by heaven a real woman with he thing would not be so bad the wind jeer at he through the tree the storm drench he fire he curse back at both one thing he think when he pipe bring he a solitary instant of peace i will not be worry with gratton and brodie and he double-dealing crowd if they ever start they would have sense enough to turn back long ago after the cold wet night come a sodden morning king stand up and look about he curiously he first thought be to make sure that they have really camp upon the edge of that particular upland valley which he have strive for and a glint of satisfaction come into he eye it be something to have follow such a trail aright upon such a night down yonder a crooked black line in a white field be the stream which many mile further on flow into the american rise abrupt beyond it be the broken precipitous cliff of granite such as beetle above the mountain tributary of the american the rock like the river be black and look far colder than the white world which extend in all direction if in truth there exist heap of raw red gold somewhere in a cave in these mountain and there have be any exactness in the description in gus ingle 's bible then the spot be not more than three or four mile away that be one consideration it be still snow here be a second consideration king turn moody eye to glorium 's canvas-and-fir shelter in the lee of a little bit of cliff there lay the third he prepare breakfast without delay but without enthusiasm he feel a tired man with shackled limb drag a dead weight when he go to wake glorium he first stand over she look queerly down upon she sleep she show less trace of the hard day and wild night than he have expect to see he preparation for she comfort instinctive and thorough have be make with the cunning skill of a man familiar with situation like the present she have rest she lay curl up snug and warm under the cover upon which a thin layer of fluffy snow have gather she face be against a curved arm and the sweetness of it in its tranquil repose be a bitter sweet to he she lash against she cheek stir and fly apart under he steady gaze he look into glorium 's eye sweet and soft heavy with sleep time to be up he say he turn on he heel and go back in haste to he fire glorium awake be ravenously hungry she come sooner than he have expect set the wild disarray of she hair in some hurry order she eye be quick and curious as she look up at he she shrug she shoulder behind he back and extend she hand to the small wind-blown blaze be we go back she ask colourlessly no he return as indifferently it be about four mile to the cave we 'll be there in a couple of hour then we 'll see what we see glorium send a long search and awe-struck look across the broken country yonder then she realize dismally lay they destination bleak black rocky height at so great a altitude and in a region so barren that but few wind-broken tree grow and the brutal face of the world be unmask she see bare peak steep slope a tremendous gorge like a ugly gash on the far side of the gorge sheer cliff toward they king look be it there that gus ingle 's cave await they be that journey 's end she shiver and draw closer to the fire closer to she companion shrink from the menace of the mountain be it go to keep on snow she ask this time he shrug that be he only answer she stare at he a slow flush come into she cheek she eye harden oh very well she say coldly that be the whole of they conversation save for one curt remark and a impudent laugh in answer at the end of the scanty meal glorium toss a piece of bacon into the fire king look at she sternly and say : young lady we may be up against the real thing right now nobody but a fool will do a trick like that the laugh be glorium 's \* \* \* \* \* once on they way they climb almost steadily the air grow rarer and colder the snowflake become smaller at last a fine sift like sand particle that cut at hand and face viciously no longer be there grove to shelter they on all side bare hostile rock and only occasionally a sparse growth of sprawl earth-hugging dwarf pine and cedar over which king stride as over so much low tangled brush then come a long ridge a spine from which the world drop almost sheer on both side with the wind rage so that it seem buck must be blow off he foot or the girl tear from the saddle and bear far out like a thistledown with frightened eye which she strive vainly to keep closed she see long break slope occasionally when the air clear a frothing torrent and once at the end of a couple of hour far down in a distant level land a growth of giant timber she think that king be make he way down there but he purpose soon become plain even to she he be keep high on the ridge go about the head of the ravine which lower down cut like a knife across the timbered tract head for what he take to be gus ingle 's cave a mile away she see it a great ragged black hole in a high mass of rock close to the crest of the next ridge she be wrap warmly and yet here the icy breath of the wind pierce the fabric of she wrapping and hurt she to the bone she watch king wonderingly as he hasten on do the man have no sense of bodily discomfort certainly he give no sign he be like a animal she find room for a flash of scorn in the thought for so she be please to consider he lower in the scale than herself at another time she might have see the world about she clothe in grandeur now its sublimity be lose i upon she it be a ravening beast a ugly thing big and brutal and like king oh how she hate it and he when at last he wait for she and tell she to get down she have the suspicion that he have go mad certainly here be no spot to tarry it be on she lip to demur but she look at he face and slip stiffly from the saddle they be high up on the ridge glorium on foot beside he clutch at the wind-twisted branch of one of the sprawl cliff growth in sudden panic that she be be sweep from she foot just below they be the deepen cleft in the mountain-side which further down widen and descend into the steep-walled gorge through it shoot a mad frothy stream a hundred yard further on high up in the cliff be the yawning hole in the rock king hold buck 's bridle look about he and at the sky glorium read in he manner a hint of uncertainty hope to influence he decision she say quickly : have not we better turn back now he look at she steadily before answer in what he reply in that impersonal way which madden she have you so altered as to be worth a man 's broken promise and then she know that no thought of go back have have any part in he brief indecision he be go forward would go forward in anything he undertake that be a part of he make-up he be merely seek the best place to unpack and a convenient spot to tether buck they be go to make camp either right here or nearer the cave perhaps in it she look at the uninviting hole and shiver she would know he decision when king see fit to enlighten she now he merely dump at she foot the roll from the horse 's back set he rifle down against it then he lead buck away zigzag tediously at last pass from sight beyond a out jut monster crag glorium crouch seek to shield herself from the whiplash of the wind she listen to it as it shriek about the slab and boulder of granite the sound be indescribably eerie fill with unrest eloquent of the brutal contempt of the eternal for the feeble and transient the universe grow utterly lonely the wind be a whining thing cut through the silence and king be so long in come back the terrifying thought electrify she : what if he have desert she what if he have no intention of come back she should have know better perhaps deep down within she she do know better but the suspicion bring its wild flutter she spring up and grow rigid in tense fright she feel a strange glad rush of joy as she see he hat bob up and toward she along the mountain flank when he rejoin she she be stare off at nothingness she back to he he lash the two canvas roll together swing they up to he shoulder take frying-pan coffee-pot and rifle in he free hand and nod toward the small pack of provision which have be leave over from lunch better bring those he advise briefly there be no tell what may be in the card he go on along the knife-edge of the ridge down into a little depression up beyond she hesitate saw that he have not look bit she lip angrily and snatch up the parcel then she follow he stoop against the wind when she come up with he he have throw down he pack at the very edge of the gorge she come to he side lean forward and look down far below plunge the wildest torrent she have ever see it hurl itself in mad haste between boulder it shoot down over dizzy fall it make for itself a white mantle of frothing water it look as black as ebony in section of smoother channel and as cold as death it spin in whirlpool it fill the air with its din and king mean to go down to it to cross it to climb the dizzy cliff upon the further side she know from he look without ask for just across the chasm from they in the highest of the cliff be the yawning black-mouthed place of horror if one slip on those bare rock clamber down or climb on the further side she sit down suddenly now when she lip be catch between she tooth it be to fight back the tear the world be so cold and stern and brutal this man be so much like the environment she be so woefully desperately heart-sick on this lofty crest of a devil-tossed land she feel the insignificance of a fly cling to the brow of a abyss king go about he task methodically gloria watch he rather than look across the rocky gorge slowly and with difficulty he make he way down the steep wall of rock drag and pull the roll of bedding and provision after he it require perhaps twenty minute for he to get to the bottom she wonder where he would attempt a cross the water look so black in the pool so violent over the rapid he go up-stream there lay a old cedar log so that it span the current its sturdy old trunk ten foot above the water for a moment king disappear under a out-thrust ledge then she see he again the pack on he shoulder he have climb up to the top of the log he be cross where he go now she must follow fascinate she watch he once she think he be go to fall but unerringly he tread the rude bridge underfoot gain the other side without mishap toss down he bundle and lower himself from the log after it glorium marvel at he she could see he face and it be impassive could he not hear the hostile voice of the rage water could he not feel the ominous threat of the bleak day and the monster cliff be he a man without imagination as he seem to be without fear on he go down-stream again cling to the steep pitch of the gorge until he be almost under the mouth of the cavern he put back he head and look up it be a hundred foot above he and the cliff from where gloria sit numb with cold and dread look unsurmountable yet he be go up they and where he go you will follow it be as though the wild water below be chant it into she ear and thereafter fill the gorge with the mockery of derisive laughter slowly tediously but with never a sign of hesitation king make he way up the cliff he have be here before he know and remember every foothold and handhold nor be the task the impossible one it look from a distance there be crack and crevice there be seam of a harder material which better withstand the attack of time be thrust out beyond the general level on they a man might stand there be spot of softer material scoop out into pocket by wind and water there be flinty splinter there be place where the wall look from across the cañon to be sheer and perpendicular slope more gently and a man might crawl up they king have draw up after he stage after stage the roll of bedding use blackie 's tie-rope to haul it up and to moor it briefly glorium see it swing at time like a huge misshapen pendulum watch it crawl up after he she see the wind snatch at it and set it scrape back and forth when he let it dangle at rope 's end she see king 's coat flap in the wind once she cry out aloud think a second time that king be fall if he fall from that height -- if he be kill -- what then would be the fate of glorium gaynor but at length he come safely to the cave 's mouth he stand upright and look about he then he draw up to he foot the dangling roll with it in he arm he be go into that yawn hole she wait breathlessly for he return she see he come again into the light he have the rope in he hand be coil it he begin to come down he be return for she she do not stir while he make the slow descent nor while he recross on the log and climb the steep bank to she i be go to spend the day up there he tell she in he study aloof manner i 'll know soon enough now what truth there be in the story of gus ingle 's gold there be room in the cave to sleep and there be shelter of a sort to-morrow morning if i find nothing i 'll start back with you if you care to come up now i 'll help you what else be there to do cry glorium with the first flash of passion what else do you leave I he slip a loop of the rope about she waist take slow pain not to touch she with he hand and turn downward again she follow fill with sudden fear when they have climb down ten foot obey he hastily when he command she to stand still or to move on feel she fear grow mightily as they progress the wind strengthen abruptly tear at she in angry gust she be pant and shake visibly when finally she reach the log span the stream he be up before she offering she he hand how she hate to touch it how she fear to follow he but she hand go into he she step follow he and without hesitation for there be nothing left now to choice she look down and see the water rage below it be like a monster leap at she snatching at she she want to look away and could not like one move through the fearsome step of a nightmare she go on cling to king 's hand he hand tight upon hers cold hand which meet because they must at last the torrent be behind she she come down into king 's arm from the log she be faint and would have sit down but he urge she on it be another nightmare climb up the cliff to the cave he go ahead he stop and brace himself he tauten the rope about she waist and say : come on slow and careful do it she clutch with she cold sore finger at the rock feel the rope tighten and go up and up the wind as though in a fury at lose its quarry shriek in she ear and in mighty gust strive to drag she hand from the rock and to set she swinging as it have swing the roll of bedding she climb on king order and she obey she wait for he to go up further ahead for he to call to she and draw in on the rope stage by stage weary stage fraught with terror she toil up and up and up and so at last when it seem to she that no strength remain in she she come to king 's side at the gloomy entrance of gus ingle 's cave the formless black void before she which under other circumstance would have repel now invite it offer shelter and rest and protection she creep by king with never a backward glance and throw herself face down on the uneven floor _ chapter xxi _ a long time king stand at the mouth of the cave look forth upon the newly whiten world the look of the thicken sky the wintry sting of the rush air the businesslike way in which the snow swirl and fall create a condition upon which he have not count and for which he have no relish this be more like a mid-winter blizzard than any storm have any business be so early in the season for many hour already the snow have be fall pile up in the mountain pass if it keep on at this rate through another day and night -- well he and glorium have best be get out without any loitering he look at he watch not yet eleven o'clock need for haste the day would be short before darkness shut down he have half a dozen hour hour for methodical search here be one of gus ingle 's cave another he know be directly below and at the base of the cliff the third should be near it be the third that he be chiefly interested in he recall the word in the old bible : we come to the first caive and then we come to caive number three and two there lay significance in the order of ingle 's numeral first three and two two of the cave be for any one to see before now king have be in both of they hence it must be that gus ingle 's treasure lay in the third that one king must locate and without too much delay he look down at glorium she lay motionless just as she have throw herself down take he rope with he king make what haste he could go down the cliff the side of the ravine be litter with dead wood drift and limb that have break off the few battered tree above he gather as heavy a load of dry branch as he could handle bind they about with he rope and fight he way all the way up clamber again to the upper cave glorium have not stir he move about she go a dozen pace deeper into the great cavern and throw down he wood break branch into short length he quickly get a fire go the flame spurt up eagerly bright and cheery and throw dancing light among the waver shadow he bring the bedding-roll closer and open it into a rough-and-ready bed then he call to gloria you would better lie here by the fire he tell she you be apt to catch cold there she be sit up watch he now she rise listlessly and come forward drop down into a sit position upon the blanket she chill hand out toward the blaze i do not like the look of this storm he tell she it be up to we to hurry i be go to look around now i think you have better rest all you can so as to be ready to make a start back as soon as i find out whether we be on a wild-goose chase or not you mean -- we may start back to-day i do not know what i be go to find of course whether i be go to find anything but if we can get only a couple of hour on we way to-day it be just that much gain you be go to leave I here i will not be far with that he set fire to a dry pine faggot the best torch available and leave she go deeper into the cave she watch he marvel at the size of the cavern he go on a score of pace he seem to be ascend a steepen slant floor and then to have go over a sort of ridge and to be descend again but still go further from she presently she know that the tunnel have turn sharply to the right she could hear the thud of he boot and for a little while could see the flare of he torch against a wall of rock he himself have pass out of she sight but she know that he have not go a great deal further for he be not so far away that she could not hear he he be go back and forth at irregular interval she see a dim ghostly light playing upon the dark cavern wall and despite the weary ache of a hardship-tortured body she begin to be interested in he search if there be in truth such gold here somewhere as he and she father with he have dream of -- gold for which seven man have die sixty year ago for which old loony honeycutt have hunger all these year for which brodie and he follow and even a city man like gratton be like so many ravening wolf on the trail -- gold in quantity to make even toughen old gold-seeker delirious with the dream of it -- why then that gold be half mark king 's and half ben gaynor 's and it might be that now at this very instant mark king be find it be stand over it stare down at it by the ghostly flare of a smoking torch she sit tense and still listen try to probe with tired but suddenly bright eye through the dark she start realize that no longer could she hear king search back and forth it be very silent about she only the crackle of the flame make a sound to be hear against the rush of air outside it seem to she that king have be go a long time she rise to she foot tempt to follow he she be curious to know what he be do why he be so silent where he have go but in the end pride restrain she and she sit down again to wait in a attitude of indifference but the minute drag on and never a sound come back from the far dark depths of the cavern fifteen minute half a hour she grow restless and walk up and down she go to the mouth of the cave and stand look out into the swirl snow-storm she return to the fire throw on more wood she feel sure that a hour have pass -- two hour -- she begin to grow alarmed always that dread thought be ready to spring out upon she : if something have happen to he she go a little way in the direction he have take stand peer into the dark listen breathless and rigid never a sound she go back to the front of the cave look down stare out into the gray sky across the ridge glorium tremble with a new excitement be down on she knee before the pack when king return she spring up to face he and each with the other 's emotion and experience of the past two or three hour unknown to he marvel at what be to be read in the other 's face glorium be excite king 's excitement be no less where she have at least the clue to he altered expression he have none to hers it be here he burst out and i have find it ton and ton of it such knob and nugget of pure gold as never man lay eye on we have here the magic lamp to rub : a castle in spain and a ocean-going yacht and the newest thing in motor-car and a trip around the world and a presentation to royalty -- a fragment of heaven and a very large slice of hell ambition fulfil and love consume and hate bear we have old ben make whole and full of power again and here we have all that be leave of gus ingle and he friend -- except for a pile of bone back yonder she see that in each hand he carry what look like a big rough stone she see from the way he carry they that they be heavy the fire leap higher brighter in she eye now she see the way to make mark king pay for all of he brutality to she to pay to the uttermost i have nothing to say to you she say as stiffly as she know the way i care to hear nothing you have to say i have tolerate all that i mean to tolerate from you she bearing no less than she word astonish he for the first time he see what it be that she hold in she hand she have be gather up she own little personal effect a tiny parcel of silken thing comb and brush trifling feminine odds and end he stare at she wonderingly i do not understand -- glorium treat he to cool laughter you will in a minute i be go go you in god 's name _ where _ deep silence answer he he frown at she in puzzle fashion a moment then suspect the truth since he racing mind could hit on no other possible explanation of she manner he drop to the fireside the thing in he hand and go swiftly to the cave 's mouth he look out into the storm he eye quest in all direction nothing only the thicken storm the ridge dim beyond the swirl of snow -- then he see for a long time he stand study it seek to make sure what he see be beat down by the fall snow dissipate by the wind go entirely over and again only to rise like a shapeless ghost of disaster it be a column of smoke some one have encamp no great distance away on the same stream hide only by the winding of the gorge some one why then gratton and brodie and they crowd after all he glower angrily toward the faint smudge of smoke then he swing about and come back to glorium 's side you see that smoke he demand you plan on go to they yes cry glorium she spring up and confront he angrily yes to both question you know who they be then no but that do not matter which mean as plain as print he say thoughtfully that you would go to any man to be rid of I he laugh unpleasantly and glorium 's anger flare the higher do you know he say presently that they be probably gratton and swen brodie and they outfit what of it ask gloria erect and defiant you know that gratton have set out to ruin you father that he be a double-dealing scoundrel that brodie be worse that neither be hardly the sort for a girl to trust herself to in a place like this i be not give much choice glorium inform he with high insolence that be a fact he concede with a grunt he would give a thousand dollar right now to be well rid of she yes and have gratton and brodie and the rest of they come on look for any sort of a row that suit they ilk he tell himself that with savage emphasis but he ask : could he let she go before i go say glorium when she think that he have nothing further to add i want to say just one thing : father have always consider you he best friend i shall lose no time in tell he what you really be glorium 's remark come just when it do in king 's perplexity settle he decision firmly on he the girl be a vicious little fool so he be determine to think of she unequivocally but she be after all ben gaynor 's daughter and furthermore the apple of ben 's eye she be in king 's keep he have be eminently to blame for bring she here he be the responsibility gratton 's eye be the sort that soil a woman you be _ not _ go he say suddenly turn upon she i will not allow you to put yourself in gratton 's or brodie 's dirty hand a quick light be in she eye a quick spurt of satisfaction in she heart in king 's decision she read the assurance that he be still madly in love with she that now he jealousy stir he she lift she chin and with she little bundle under she arm come forward walk confidently stand aside please she command i be go i tell you again sense the familiarity of the battlefield she feel a almost serene confidence believe herself easily mistress of the situation so much must have be plain to king from that stand aside please which miss glorium gaynor of last week might have address to a porter be it not that just now king 's thought be not bend to trifle when she come to he side and he do not stir she seek to brush by he there be no hesitation in the way in which he put out he hand and hold she back there can be only one captain to a expedition in adventure he tell she seriously i have be elect to the job you 'll pardon I if i put matter into one-syllable word until we be well out of this if we be ever out at all you will have to do what i tell you you be not go to desert ship she stare at he speechlessly then : by what right do _ you _ issue order to _ I _ she cry let we say he return in the coin of she own harshness by the old right of a husband if that be not sufficient you can add to it : by the time-honoured right of the lord and master for that be just precisely what i intend be until i can turn you over to you dawdle set in the city again wait a minute he add sternly as he see she lip open to a rush of word i would be glad to have you go be condition less exact now i have think matter over and it appear essential that certain of we marriage vow be remember you do not have to love or honor but by thunder you be go to obey reversion to a ancient order of thing eh well the world be better then largely in that woman be worth a man 's while further for my part i fully intend to keep my obligation of protect you against you own foolishness the storm gratton brodie and the devil himself and finally i mean to keep my promise to you father he send I to get gus ingle 's gold it be here so be gratton with he cut-throat crowd i will in all probability have my hand full but once and for all you stick with I where he conclude with the last jeer the wife 's place should be gloria try to stare he down to wither he with the fire of she scorn to brave by he but the man all emotion have recede from he eye be once more like so much rock but rock endowed with dormant power of aggression she feel as though she have to do with a great poise boulder which offer no menace so long as she let it alone but which need but a unwary step of hers to destroy its equilibrium and thus bring it crash down upon she crush she she begin by wonder if she have mistake he look just now when she have leap to the triumphant decision that he love she she end by feel hopeless and tired and uncertain of all thing to keep he from note how she be tremble she go hastily back to the roll of bedding and drop down to it on the instant it become clear to she that physically king be the master to she before whom difficulty have heretofore invariably melt it seem equally clear that there must be a way out of a unbearable situation so now for the first time she begin a certain logical line of thought seek to shape she own plan please listen to I seriously king say quietly to she i will not talk long to you you father be on the edge of bankruptcy he be temporarily out of the running -- at the hand of the very man you want to go to he count on I for what be in gus ingle 's cave i have find at least a part of it and i honestly believe that it be in you hand and mine to pull ben through and leave he a rich man on top of it gratton and brodie be down there they 'll clean we out if they can the stake be big enough for they to stop at nothing short of murder and i be not oversure they would stop there gus ingle 's crowd do not and i do not know that man have change much in half a hundred year i be listen say glorium coolly when he pause here be the point : this be treasure-trove we get here first it be up to we to hold it can i count on you you do not happen to have any love for I well you should not have any for gratton or brodie either and you know that you can trust yourself to I can i count on you stick on the job you father 's and you own job as much as mine until we make a go of it glorium 's logical thinking have barely begin and as yet have not have time to progress she spite be lively and bitter in she distorted vision blur by passionate anger she cry out quickly : so now that the odds be against you you come cringe to I do you again she be mislead into fancy that she hold a whip-hand over he answer you question i would trust mr gratton any day rather than you he at least be not quite the brute and bully that you be king be hardly disappoint at least you have give a straight answer he mutter that be something now he shape he plan swiftly and carefully know where she stand it be characteristic of he that once have see clearly he own responsibility toward a foolish girl he do not seek to simplify he own difficulty by rid himself of she henceforth he would merely consider she he chief handicap with he but against he he console himself with the whimsical thought that there be never a proper treasure-hunt that do not carry traitorous mutineer on the questing ship _ chapter xxii _ and so after all he and glorium be not alone in the mountain that other crowd be still to be reckon with king stand at the cave 's mouth frown into the ever-thickening smother of the storm they smoke be go again beat down hide behind the snow-curtain but they be there at no very great distance thus then they know something just what here be the matter of he perplexity do they know all that he do or have they merely such a hint as would lead they as close as this or have they follow he trail he grow impatient with seek to speculate it strike he clearly and forcefully that he have but one thing to do : to trust that they do not have such full information as have fall into he hand and to see to it that he give they no help though they should come close very close still that which he have find might remain hidden from they there lay he work to do all that he could to hide gus ingle 's gold first he would bring with he more than the two nugget all that he feel he could manage to carry with the rest of he necessary load enough to help ben gaynor over a crisis enough raw gold to slam down before some san francisco capitalist together with a tale which would make any man eager to stake the owner to what loan he ask with that he would seek to get back to the open he would get provision snow-shoe a dog-team if necessary a couple of trust man to come with he he would be back here within the week but first before he go he would strive to make as sure as a man could that brodie 's crowd do not find the golden hoard he go a second time far back into the darkness of the further cave carry a smoking torch as before vanish from glorium 's eye she be alone nothing stand between she and the cave 's mouth she be free to go he must have think of that he be give she she chance she have but to snatch up the few thing she mean to take with she to go out to find she way down the cliff -- she shudder she be afraid do he know that too have he think of that she move back and forth restlessly at one instant she be sure that she would go only to be certain of nothing before another second pass how soon would he return would he hurry after she would he bring she back forcibly she go where she could look out the column of smoke have disappear the wind tear at she in mighty gust she hesitate and time pass how long he be go she do not know she only know that she have do nothing when at length he return there be a look of grim satisfaction on he face whatever he have go to do he have do in a manner to please he she note that he coat be off that in it as in a bag he carry something heavy this go with we wherever we go he announce triumphantly it be a big breathing spell for ben gaynor he dump it out there be other lump like the two he have bring back the first time she wonder dully if that grimy stuff be gold she watch he while he empty a provision-bag and thereafter drop into it the stuff he have bring in he coat on top of it go the article of food if you can whip up enough endurance for the work ahead of we he announce impersonally we stand a good chance of get out of this otherwise we stand a whole lot better show of be catch here and freezing and starve to death glorium shake visibly nervousness and fear and the cold be combine and merciless she look speed from king 's face to what she could see of the snow-storm but we 'll wait she ask in utter weary meekness until this horrible storm be over one never know about a storm like this he tell she it may blow itself out soon and it may keep on for a long time now it be begin to pile up in the drift to hide the trail to make go harder every minute as it be we 'll have we work cut out for we if this keep up all afternoon and all night he shrug you mean that then we could not get out at all she ask sharply he look down on she thoughtfully i do not know he reply slowly whether you could make it then or not i be more or less use to this sort of thing and you be not i figure that we ought to take no more long shot than we have to if we start right now and have any luck we can make several mile before night and camp in some of the thick timber we would be as well off there as we be here and just that much nearer the outside if the weather allow we to travel at all we could be back at you father 's place in four or five day at the longest and he add significantly we have food to last we just about that long glorium spring up hastily quick she cry let 's hurry king nod and begin he preparation into the square of canvas he roll everything they be to take with they and he take no single article which he judge be not absolutely necessary one small frying-pan and one light aluminium pot with single knife fork and spoon constitute all in the way of cooking utensil with jealous eye he judge the weight bulk and worth of every other article whether it be a tin of fruit or a slab of bacon those delicacy which he love for glorium have prompt he to bring with they he now place at one side to be leave behind bacon to the last small scrap and fat-lined rind coffee to the once-boiled dregs in the coffee-pot he pack carefully then he roll make and draw tight he take up the discard article and hide they under some loose dirt in a remote black corner of the cave ten minute later he have get first he pack then glorium safely down the cliff and they start head down silent like two grotesque automaton they trudge on they cross on the fall cedar they climb out of the gorge on the far side they fight they way on several time king turn but she soon see it be not to look at she he glance pass down the long cañon toward the spot where they have see the smudge of smoke she have come near forget that other man be near she have no interest in they now king have bring she here king must take she safely back to the world which she have forsake so stupidly the obligation be plainly he the power seem he no less as glorium fight she way along she be upborne at every step by the expectation of come presently to they horse of be place in the saddle and of have nothing to do from then on but hold to the pommel and have king lead she on to a ultimate safety the progress would be long and the way little less than a adventure in hell to she but at least hers would have become a slightly more passive part and she would be move on toward the luxury of four wall and a maid and warm comfort so when they come to the spot where king have tethered he horse and there be no horse there gloria look she blank stupefied bewilderment and then simply collapse she drop down in the snow she face in she hand too weary and heartbroken to sob aloud king stare about he with a almost equal consternation leave glorium where she lay inert in the snow king put down rifle and pack and hurry down into the hollow where he have tethered he horse five minute of read the sign in the snow tell he the story he have be right he venture from the beginning have be load to the guard with bad luck there be the end of the broken tie-rope there the track show the way buck have go in full headlong flight the rope be stout and would have break only be the animal terrify if frightened then there have be something to cause fright again since the horse flee straight down the slope that something startling it would have be at some point directly above king turn and mount to the ridge top again here be other track all but obliterate by the snow which have fall since they be make a bear have come up over the ridge have frighten the horse into break its tether and run and the equally startled bear have turn tail and race off the other way both animal be probably a dozen mile off by now the bear perhaps twice that distance king come back slowly and sit down on he pack from glorium 's dejected figure he look to he watch from he watch again to the four point of the compass he lip tighten the afternoon be pass and the dark would come early be you up to crowd ahead on foot he call to gloria if you have the nerve we can really make better time that way anyhow from now on can you do it at first she do not try to answer but when he shout to she again he voice hard with anger she moan miserably : i be sick i be die i think i can not go on king grunt disgustedly he let glorium lie where she be until she have rest then he go to she and put he hand under she arm and lift she to she foot she be limp and pale she eye shut she lash look unusually black against the pallor of she pinched cheek we 'll go back to the cave for the night after all he tell she quietly it be the inevitable and that be one thing there be no sense buck against stand up but the slight figure in its boyish garb droop against he glorium 's head move the slightest bit in sidewise negation she pale lip stir soundlessly what ask king i can not come she whisper he judge that here be no time for foolishness but rather the time for each one to do he part if the two of they live to make all of this a unpleasant memory you have get to he inform she crisply i can not carry you and the pack and rifle and everything can i i be go back the rest be up to you do you want to lie here and die to-night i do not care say glorium listlessly he look at she curiously as he draw he hand away she slip down and lay as she have lie before he turn away take up he pack and gun set he back square upon she and trudge off toward the only shelter that be theirs along the ridge buffet by the wind half blind with the flurry of stinging hail with which that wind lash he as with countless bit of broken glass he do not turn to look behind he not until he have go fully half of the way to the cave then he do turn he could not see she following as he have picture she he drop he burden and go back to she she lay as he have leave she she face whiter than he have ever see it she eye shut certain small blue vein make a delicate tracery across the lid he have mean to storm at she to stir she into activity by the lashing of he rage but instead he stoop and gather she up into he arm and carry she through the storm shield she body all that he could and as he stoop and as he move off he be growl deep down in he throat like a disgruntled old bear when it come to clamber down and then up the cliff glorium obey he command listlessly and as in a dream lend the certain small aid that be necessary even so the climb be hard and slow and more than ever before fill with danger but in the end it be do again they be in gus ingle 's cave king build a fire leave glorium lie by it and go back for he pack when he return she have not move he make a bed for she place she on it so that she foot be toward the fire and cover she with he own blanket then he boil some coffee and make she drink it she obey again neither thank he nor upbraid he and droop back upon she hard bed and shut she eye here be a new glorium a glorium who do not care whether she live or die with a quicken alarm in he eye he stand by the smoky fire stare at she uninured to hardship she delicate body be already beat with still further hardship to come might she not -- die and what would mark king say to ben gaynor even if he bring back much raw red gold if it have cost the life of ben gaynor 's daughter she do not stir when he come to she and knelt and put he hand against she cheek he be shock to learn how cold she be lightly he set he finger against she softly pulsing throat it be cold like ice plainly she be chill through as he begin unlace she boot a curiously bitter thought come to he she be he the marriage service have give she to he with she own willingness he wife and now he be do for she the first intimate little thing he draw off she boot and stocking and find that she foot be terribly cold he wrap they in a hot blanket and hasten to set a pot of water on the coal while the water warm he kneel and chafe she foot between he palm afraid for a moment that they be frozen finally while he bath they in steam water the dead white begin to give place to a faint pinkness like a blush and again he put the blanket about they she have not move when a second time he lay he hand against she throat the cold of it alarm he he hesitate a moment then the urgent need be more than evident he begin swiftly to undo she outer garment the boyish shirt he unbutton and manage to remove it be wet through and stiff with frost he note she under-garment silken and foolish little thing with amazement she have know no better than to wear such nonsensical affair on a trip like this good god what _ do _ she know but he do not pause in he labor until he have slip off the wet clothing then he wrap she in another warm blanket and place she on she bed she foot still to the blaze all of the time she have seem and probably be hardly conscious now only she open she eye i can not have you play the fool and get pneumonia he growl at she we have get we hand full as it be do not you know enough to but she be not listen she stir slightly ease herself into a new position cuddle she face against a bare arm sigh and go to sleep _ chapter xxiii _ all night king keep he fire blaze with several long stick and a piece of the canvas draw deeply upon he ingenuity and almost to the dregs of he patience he contrived a rude barrier to the cold across the mouth of the cave countless time he roll out of he own bunk heavy-eyed and stiff to readjust the screen when it have blow down to put more wood on he fire to make sure that glorium be cover and warm sleep heavily and not dead he nerve be fray in the long night he fear grow misshapen and grotesque within he soul he pray mutely that when morning come glorium would be alive when with the first sickly streak of dawn he go to put fresh fuel upon the die ember he find that there be but a handful of wood leave he come to stoop over the girl and listen to she breathing then he descend the cliff for more wood during the night winter have set the white seal of he sovereignty upon the world the snarl wind have die in its own fierceness give over to a still calm air through which steadily the big flake fall now they cling to bush and tree everywhere the limb have grow thick and heavy droop like countless plume fat mat of snow lay on the level space upon flat rock curl over and down at the edge where he stand king sink ankle-deep in the fluffy stuff as he move along the cliff and down the slope toward a dead tree he step now and then into drift where the snow be gather swiftly as he look up seek to penetrate the sky above he and judge they import he see only myriad of gray particle high up swirl but slightly in some softly stir air-current for the most part drop float fall almost vertically nowhere be there a hint or hope of cessation the winter a full four week early have come in the noose of he rope he drag up the cliff much dead wood riven from a fall pine throughout the noise of he coming and going the girl sleep heavily he get a big fire blaze without wake she and set about get breakfast while he wait for the coffee to boil he take careful stock of provision for two people there be enough for some twenty meal food for about a week time to conserve the grease from the frying-pan to hoard the smallest bit of bacon rind he even count he round of ammunition here alone he be affluent he have in the neighborhood of a hundred cartridge for the rifle while he be set the gun aside he feel glorium 's eye upon he during the night and now during this inventory he have be grant both ample time and cause for he decision he address she with prompt frankness inside fifteen minute we have get to be on we way out as we go we 'll look for the horse but find it or not we be go she lay look up at he thoughtfully she have rest she resent he coolly assume mastery she have not forget that there be other man near by but she merely say by way of beginning : the storm be over then no but we be not go to wait we have food for only six or seven day at the most she let she eye droop to the fire so that the lid hide they from he it be not yet full day it be still snow gratton and the man with he would of course have ample supplies she yearn feverishly to be rid of king and he intolerable domineering she estimate swiftly that paradoxically she only power over he be that of powerlessness while she lay here hers be in a way the advantage on she foot follow he he would be again to she the brute he have be come in i be tire out she say faintly still not look up i be sick i have a pain here she move she hand to she side where in reality she be conscious of a troublesome soreness i can not go on he stare at she she be pale now that she lift she eye for a brief reading of he look he remark that they appear unusually large and luminous there be a flush on she cheek he old fear surge back on he : glorium be go to die so he do what glorium have count on have he do : put milk and sugar in she coffee and bring the cup to she he hasten to serve she a piping-hot breakfast of crisp bacon hot cake and jam he urge she to eat and make he own meal of unsweetened black coffee and cake without jam triumphantly and covertly glorium observe all of this hers be the victory mark king be again wait on she hand and foot sacrifice for she he allow himself half a pipe of tobacco -- tobacco like food be go to run out soon -- and smoke sombrely here already be the thing to be dread more than aught else : glorium threaten with illness as ben gaynor 's daughter never as he own beloved wife she have become he responsibility she be a parcel marked fragile -- handle with care which he have undertake to deliver safely to a friend i be go to look for the horse he tell she he get to he foot and take up he rifle but do not count too much on my success all the chance be that buck be a long way on the trail back to he stable blackie have probably limp back home by now another thing : if i do not get buck to-day he 'll be of no use to we that be if the snow keep on but i 'll do what i can but before leave he do what he could to make for she comfort during he absence he bring up fir-bough make they into a bed for she he readjust he canvas screen secure it more carefully thereby make the cave somewhat more snug and at the last he drop a little much-worn book at she side she do not know he have it with he she do not appear to note it until he have go then she take it up curiously a volume of kipling 's poem compact and companionable on indium paper between worn cover with a little sniff she put the book down just the sort of thing for mark king to read she think with fine scorn and utterly stupid to gloria what have she to do with _ the explorer _ and _ snarleyow _ and _ boot _ and _ the foot of the young man _ less than nothing in sheer regrettable fact she know he have one other book with he gus ingle 's bible the profaned volume of a murderous long-dead scoundrel what a library for a dainty lady glorium suddenly find that she could have scream she scramble up and go to peer out around the canvas screen no sound out there for the wind be dead and the snow drop noiselessly the creek in the gorge because what little draught there be in the air bear down the canon send no sound to she ear the wilderness of crag and peak and distant forest be hostile pitiless she seek eagerly for some sign of gratton there be none no smoke this morning denote he camp no longed-for figure toil upward toward she but he would come soon he must king have find the gold here gratton would know and come she would wait hope for gratton 's come before king 's return meanwhile king make he way down the mountain slope find that he estimate of the storm be cheerlessly correct the fluffy stuff underfoot be in place already knee-deep and mount steadily higher he shake himself and growl in he throat and plough through it vigorously a pair of web would look like wing before long he mutter well we 'll make 'em since we can not buy 'em make he way back to the point where buck have break he tether king overlook no precaution since he do not care to have he and glorium 's hiding-place known unnecessarily to gratton and he follow he forsake the natural pathway and make slower hard progress along the gorge where other would be less likely to chance upon he track and where the track themselves would soonest fill with drift snow pass about many a stunt grove he come at last to the place whence buck have flee he know that in the general direction indicate by the line of flight beyond two ridge be the valley of the giant sequoia there a horse would find water shelter and grass if he fail to find the animal there -- well then buck be well on the trail or lose to king in any one of a hundred place and always as he go pant up and plough down the steep slope he eye be keen for meat be it dougla squirrel or bear but the wood seem desert and empty only those cheerful impudent little bundle of feather the snowbird and a occasional dart water-ouzel along the creek these he let alone but with the mental reservation that the time might well be at hand when even such as they must be call on to keep life in he and glorium he have take on a man 's - size contract for he morning 's work and drive he big body at it relentlessly and he take he own sort of joy from it the joy of a fight against odds the joy of action in the open he body be wet with sweat but neither he ardor nor optimism be dampen he foot come perilously near frost-bite after he slip into the hidden water of a small stream but he consider the accident but a part of the day 's work so prepare by common sense for disappointment he look hopefully to find the horse and as he push on he ponder other likely spot to seek this afternoon or to-morrow if he do not find the animal in the sequoia when at last he come to the grove of big tree he be among old friend but he know almost as soon as he reach they that they have no word for he to-day on he wedding morning he have plan how he would bring glorium here take it for grant in he blind infatuation that they would mean to she what they have mean to he now he pass swiftly like a noiseless shadow between the gigantic bole he do not lift he head to look at old vulcan 's lightning-blasted crest two hundred foot in air all but lose up there in the fall snow he give no thought to the thousand of year which be majesty 's and thor 's he go with he eye on the ground seek track of a horse and as he have more than half expect he find nothing the magnificent vista carpet in snow give he no view of anything but snow later he must cudgel he brain and seek elsewhere now with other work to be do he should go back the shortest quickest way so he set he foot into the trail which they have make and turn he back upon the grove where he cross stream he take stock of pool there be trout there if a man could take they this be another matter to see about oh he would be busy enough and yet he do not loiter and stop only briefly and infrequently to rest before return to gloria king mean to look in on brodie 's camp if only from a distance as matter stand now there be no tell what bear gratton 's and brodie 's action might have later upon he own affair it would be well to note if the man be prepare to fight the storm out or to pack up and leave rather than take prolonged chance with the season so a mile below he own camp he slip into a grove of fir and make he unseen way toward the fringe whence he count upon see what they be about he be still move on slowly and have have no glimpse of the man when he hear they he stop abruptly and listen they be down there against the cañon wall word come to he indistinctly muffle by the thick air the tone of the voice be unmistakable three voice there be each with its own peculiarity none of they gratton 's first a big booming voice then a sharp staccato-quick voice thereafter a high-pitched querulous utterance nervous and irritable disagreement if not out-and-out quarrel have already come to camp king move a few pace nearer push aside a low branch from which the snow drop with little thud and see the man there be four of they in a excited group and slightly draw apart one hand at he mouth be gratton the four pay no attention to he but form a group exclusively self-centred of these four one now hold he own counsel he attitude alert he hand in he pocket he head turn swiftly so that he eye be now on one speaker now on another across the brief distance king could see the puff of smoke from the pipe in he tooth the man wear a red handkerchief knot about he throat its color be as bright as fresh-spilled blood swen brodie now and then as a voice be lift king catch a word repeat several time he hear the word bacon here doubtless be the matter under discussion one man he of the thin querulous voice swing he nervous arm widely and fairly shriek he message it come in little puff and be lose between king hear he shout bacon and snow and hell the three expression so oddly connect and yet disjointed be significant gratton stand apart and gnaw at he hand though he could not see the prominent eye king could imagine the look in they swen brodie puffed regularly at he pipe and watch and listen intently abruptly the wrangle knot of man resolve itself into two definite faction he fellow have turn upon the shrill-voiced man plainly in some sort of denunciation or accusation he be the smallest of the lot and draw back hastily step after step offer the knife-edge of he curse as the other club they fist a lie he shriek fool gratton gnaw at he knuckle brodie puff steadily and the two aggressor accept windy denial as sign of guilt one of they spring forward and strike the little man whip out a revolver and fire the shot sound dull and muffle a puff of smoke hang for a moment like the smoke from the pipe appear methodically between the passive onlooker 's tooth the man who have strike stop dead in he track there come a second shot then in sharp staccato succession four other follow by the ugly little metallic click announce that the gun have empty itself before the last explosion the balancing body sag limply and sprawl in the snow king 's first natural impulse be to break through the brush and run forward but he caution of the day command by circumstance though never a part of the man 's headlong nature remain with he counsel cool thought instead of hot haste the man down be dead or as good as dead he king could not help so he hold back and watch there fall a brief silence while the man who have do the shooting and the man about he no less than the figure lie in the snow be as motionless as so many carven statue at last brodie speak heavily benny 's right bate have it come to he time like this steal a side of bacon be worse 'n murder bate steal it he be go to try to double-cross we and beat it out of here now he be dead and good riddance he spit into the snow when he have do benny chatter wildly to himself now begin a hasty reloading of he revolver the man whom he have shoot whom brodie name bate lay not five step from benny 's foot he blood already congeal where it flush the snow oddly enough king know personally or by repute each of the man before he with the single exception of the man who have pay in full for he own -- or some one else 's -- crime of steal food at a time when food mean a chance for life to begin with there be swen brodie and there be gratton there be benny who have do the kill a degenerate a morphine addict and a thorough-going scoundrel beyond he stand the burly ruffian of the big awkward bony frame who have bring the judge to the log house the other night at gratton 's bidding steve jarrold through the tree come up now be two more of the ill-featured party a swart squat italian and just at he heel a ragged scarecrow of a man name brail it be brail who come close enough to stoop over the fall man dead be not he query benny half-coughing over he word he fellow have draw closer so that they stand in a ring about the body one man alone hold apart gratton 's eye be wild void of purpose the dead chalky-white of he face turn a sickly greenish tinge after a little while no one pay any attention to he he begin a slow withdrawal move jerkily step by step he drag heel make long furrow in the snow then king too begin to draw back slip quietly and swiftly through the screen of tree and bush step in the track he have make come hither pray suddenly for further fast-falling snow to hide or obliterate the trail he have make and for the moment he be not thinking of the gold which they too seek and which he have mean to snatch away from under they nose he think only of glorium if that crowd in its present temper find the way to he camp -- if in one way or another glorium fall into they hand -- then could she thank god for a clean bullet and a swift end of thing _ chapter xxiv _ the mere fact of be absolutely alone from midday to dark would have be for glorium a experience at any time and in any environment of she friend in the city there be many who have never in a lifetime know what it be to spend half a dozen consecutive daytime waking hour in perfect solitude catch not so much as a fleeting glimpse of a servant a policeman a nurse or a street-car conductor in the echo street solitude render rippleless by a absence of any familiar sound neither the whisk of a maid 's broom the clang of a telephone bell the buzz of motor or the slamming of door at those interval when king thought of she it be to realize that she might quite naturally find discomfort in she bleak surroundings be deny coal-grate and upholstered chair it do not suggest itself to he that the chief discomfort would be a spirit-crushing terrifying loneliness she tell herself when he have go that she be glad to be alone five minute later she begin to stir restlessly another five minute and already she be listen for he return never once during the day be there a sudden or unexpected sound whether the snap of a burning faggot or the scratch against the rock of a log roll apart or the flap of she canvas that she do not look expectantly toward the rude door through which she think to see he return once that she restlessness come upon she she could not remain quiet she draw on she boot and walk up and down cast fearsome glance toward the darkest portion of the cavern shun it keep the fire between it and herself when she peer out across the desolate world she draw back from its bleak menace shudder return to crouch miserably by she fire shut in between two frightful thing the black unknown of the bowels of the cave the white horror of the brutal insensate wilderness and in she almost hysterical emotional frenzy she see back of each of they the man mark king as though they be but the expression of he own brutality after a hour she feel that she would go mad unless she find something to hold she mind back from those hideous channel into which it slip so readily she snatch up the book which king have leave with she and force herself to read page elude she but here and there single line or word catch she attention as a thorny copse catch and pluck the garment of one go blindly through it so she be arrest by the line : _ in simpleness and gentleness and honor and clean mirth _ and this be one of the time when she throw the book down and get up and walk back and forth impatiently it be almost as though king have leave the wretched volume behind to be he spokesman in he absence she tell herself angrily that he be _ not _ like that have never be like that he be a mere brute of a man not _ such as fight and sail and rule and love and make we world _ he be rather unthinkably crude and boorish and detestable but rebel at utter loneliness she be force again and again to the only companion at hand she read _ the explorer _ fascinate in a shivery uncanny way by the first line as though a ghostly voice be whisper to she from the black corner of the cave : _ there be no sense in go further -- it be the edge of cultivation _ and later : _ i face the sheer main-range whipping up and lead down _ other than she have go into the last solitude other who have joy in it and sing of it it be as though the dead shades of those other squat at the edge of she fire and mock at she then she could fancy that it be king himself jeer and that he cry : _ then he choose I for he whisper and i have find it and it be yours _ she snap the book shut later she open it to the tale of tomlinson she do not entirely grasp it but she could not entirely miss what it say she hurry on she wonder vaguely at the call of the red god here again seek distraction she be whip back to reality there be the line stare at she as though king have rewrite kipling : _ who have smell wood-smoke at twilight who have hear the birch log burning who be quick to read the noise of the night _ and the answer be : mark king even now it be a torturous twilight in the cave even now she smell wood-smoke even now she be like one start at the noise of the night man-stuff she think contemptuously she have hear such a expression use in connection with the verse of this uncouth scribe it do not strike she that man-stuff might well enough be woman-stuff also be one or the other or both for the sheer reason that it be human she choose to consider it merely the sort of coarse food for male mental digestion a man 's nature be not fine and intricate rather he emotional quality must be like stubby blunt callous finger unskilled and not highly sentient a man lack the psychical and spiritual and intellectual development which be that of a maid like glorium he joy be chiefly physical so he care to blaze trail like the explorer the impact of a storm 's buffeting and the low appreciation of a full stomach draw limit mark he possibility of expansion he be a beast and she hate the whole sex sweepingly and superbly in great surge of genuine sympathy she heart go out to herself but after all the moment in which she thought be snare away from she fear and the oppression of loneliness be few and short from wonder what keep king she pass to bitter anger that he should desert she so she conclude that he be do it with malicious intent repeatedly she be tempt to go forth and seek gratton : to hunt up and down until at last she come to he again and again she go to the mouth of the cave and look forth but each time she draw back terrify at the thought of make she way unaid down the sheer cliff wall she seek to tell herself that she be not afraid of the snow of be lose of be unable to find gratton but she could not climb down the cliff she know that she would fall dizzy and sick shiver with dread and cold she turn back always she let she fire die down not notice it then the cold remind she and she work long building another she know where a block of match be she have see king set it carefully away in she excitement she strike dozen of match drop the burnt end about she at last she fire blaze up and she warm herself then she be conscious of a strange faintness and realize that she be hungry she go to they food cache and ransack it hastily she open a tin of sardine and come back to the fire with it in she hand she have no clear conception of the deed when half of the fish consume the smelly stuff revolt she and she hurl the remain part into the bed of coal \* \* \* \* \* king stamp the loose snow from he boot and come in glorium stand confront he tense rigid white-faced she hand stiff at she side she want to cry out to upbraid he all of she fear of the day turn into molten anger but at the moment she strength fail strangely she heart seem to be stop she choke up the surge of she relief like a suddenly release current impact with that other current of she unleash anger make of she consciousness a sort of wild fume whirlpool nothing be clear to she just then save that mark king have come back and that no doubt he heart be fill with jeer she could not read the expression of he shadowed face but fancy it one of mockery king be tire throughout every muscle of he body he set down he rifle toss he hat aside and slump down by the fire come in from the storm-cleansed open he sniff at the closeness of the cave it be not alone the smell of smoke he first thought be that glorium have be cooking something then he note the sardine-can with a stick he rake it out of the coal and now glorium could read he expression well enough as he jerk he head up in god 's name he demand what do you mean by a thing like that be you stark rave mad for a moment she be at a loss to understand what have enrage he the act of toss the distasteful food into the fire have be purely involuntary she conscious mind have hardly take cognizance of the fact when it dawn upon she what he mean she own anger be still greater than she sense of she act 's folly but she find no ready answer to he accusation she be not without reason in they present predicament she be a fool to have do a thing like that she could hardly believe that she have do it and so she stare impudently at he and hold she silence and finally with a elaborate shrug of disdainful shoulder she turn she back on he but king fling to he foot and set he hand on she two shoulder and swing she about she eye open widely listen to I he say angrily i be go to talk plain to you you be a fool a downright empty-headed silly fool what you have destroy in wanton carelessness would have keep the life in a man a whole day have not you sense enough to see it be go to be nip and tuck if we ever get out of this you have show yourself from start to finish a miserable cheat there be no trust to be put in either you judgment or you intention be still he command as she seek to wriggle out of he grasp to avoid the direct blaze of he eye i be go to do what i can for you to see you safe through this if i can not because you be anything to I but just because you be ben gaynor 's and he be my friend understand you be hurt I she say in defiance take you dirty hand off when i be do he return curtly i be go to stick to you and see you through i tell you but i be not go to have you throw all of we chance away by dump grub into the fire if you do one other brainless thing like that and i catch you at it i be go to tie you up hand and foot and keep you out of mischief you would not dare -- but she know better he would dare anything he _ be _ of the type that fight and sail and rule now when have speak he mind he turn away from she she stare after he and watch he as he drop back by the fire then she go slowly to she bed to hide she tremble and lay down presently she hear he stir she do not turn she head to look at he but she know that he be busy with supper she smell coffee hear the clash of tin cup and plate and realize that he be eat she wonder if he have forget she after a while she move just a trifle and furtively he have put away he dish and be fill he pipe and he know that she be watch he no he say to she unspoken question i be not go to cook for you any more i have have a hard day of it do the man 's work have you do the woman 's you would have have supper ready for I he light he pipe with a splinter of burn pine then for the first time he see the waste of scatter match on the floor from they he look to she in a amazement so sheer that it leave he no word of expostulation the suspicion actually come to he that the girl be mad it be scarcely conceivable that a perfectly sane individual could do the thing which she have do she see he get up and begin gather up all of the foodstuff he carry it to the back of the cave where he pass out of she sight in the dark he be go ten minute and come back empty-handed he make the second trip after which there be leave on a shelf of rock only half a dozen match and enough food for one scanty meal this glorium ignore do you think she say contemptuously that what you have hide back there i could not find you could find it but you will not he return with quiet assurance that jerk the question from she : why because he grunt contemptuously you be too much of a coward to go back there to look for it and in she heart she know that here be but the mere truth for why be she not already in gratton 's camp she opportunity have come and go -- because she have be afraid _ chapter xxv _ king awake fill with resolve and definite purpose it be pitch dark but he sense the come of wintry dawn he draw on he boot and go to look out it be still snow heavily steadily implacably he kick the loose fluffy stuff underfoot the biggest storm in twenty year he tell himself and if any one of we in these mountain come out of they alive he 'll have something to talk about it be the real thing he go grimly about he fire-making fix purpose crystallize to the smallest detail again he must seek immediately to locate he horse one could eat horseflesh if drive to it he must try to get game of some sort and every lose hour mean lessen chance of he kill forest meat deer and bear and the smaller folk if they have be catch nap would be scurry out of the mountain long before now soon the solitude would be utterly barren and empty he go to glorium 's bed you would better get up he say briefly time to start the day while we eat i want to talk with you she awake slowly blink at he and only draw she blanket higher about she chin i be tired she answer petulantly do not you realize that a girl i realize he cut into she sleepy expostulation that you be weak and frightened and useless and that those be three of the many thing you have get to get over the shortest way if you do not want to die here i do not know that i care to live she begin turn with she old instinct toward a attitude which before now have rob he of he harshness but he plan be set in cold determination and he cut she short again if you do not care i do and i be go to pull you through with I if for no other reason simply because i have set out to do it and be not go to lie down on the job what be more you have get to do you share i have build the fire will you get up no she flash out at he thoroughly awake now i will not he stoop catch the corner of she blanket and whip they off instinctively she seek to draw the under-bedding over she forget that she have not undressed you brute she scream at he get up he tell she sternly or by heaven i 'll make you she see he face plainly now as he crackling fire burn higher it be hard he eye be ominous she hesitate and see in he eye and in a stir of he body that he be go to jerk she to she foot she fling out of bed at that and upon the far side from he get you boot on he order i do not want you catch cold from idiotic carelessness and i will not have you go sick on my hand for the first and last time i 'll admit that i do not enjoy drive you like a curse galley-slave but i 'll do it and do a thorough job of it if you force I to it she draw on she boot hastily and come to the fire and lace they he be a new man this morning and relentless she be afraid of he after a new bewildered fashion i never see a storm worse than this he tell she he have cook the breakfast because he be in a hurry and do not care to trust she wasteful finger with they already precious food there must be two or three foot on the level place by now plough through snow like that be kill work for a man and you would not last at it ten minute he have no intention of speak contemptuously she know that he thought be not trifle with such matter as she feeling he be merely indulge in plain talk we have enough food for a few day after that if we stick on here and do not find more somehow we would die like dog therefore we be go to get ready to beat it out the first chance we get but if i would not last ten minute as you so elegantly put it not as you be not as the snow be but i be hope that before it be too late we 'll get clear weather a sun a thaw and freezing night then we could tackle it on the crust and you job now be to get yourself ready for that one chance she anger at the indignity already do she whip out the sarcasm : by get ready i suppose you mean for I to pack my trunk and order the expressman at the door he look at she with a long impersonal stare which bewilder she she be at utter loss to read its meaning until he speak : you be to pack what endurance you have get into you muscle you be to make up you mind to call up all of the grit that be in you you 'll need both and you be to quit lie around and get weaker every day you have get little enough time to harden yourself so you be go to take on the job right now she gasp incredulous he nod sternly glorium he say tersely i be go to do all that i can for both of we you be go to do all that you can that be final she bite she lip and give he she scornful silence the blood be red and hot in she cheek she ignore he when he call crisply that breakfast be ready there be limit to she obedience she think rebelliously to be tell do this do that to arise when this man 's body be rest to eat when he stomach be empty be intolerable king look at she and have the understanding to grasp something of she think so he explain : i want you to come outside with I you 'll find it hard work it would be a first-rate idea if you would fortify you strength by the little bit of nourishment which we can afford to take no well i be sorry -- here he offer she the piece of a sack he have cut in two for she tie those about you foot to keep they from freezing when i want you advice i 'll ask for it she retort icily very well he answer and i can not make you eat if you do not want to after all perhaps you be not hungry he set aside she portion you 'll have the appetite for that when we get back she have the appetite now but she would prefer to starve she honestly think at the moment than eat when he tell she to eat now he finish in silence she see he glance at he watch she heart seem scarcely to stir in she breast then slowly it begin to beat swifter and swifter hammer wildly he have say that she be go out with he what he promise to do she realize again he would do if it be humanly possible she want to run run anywhere just to be lose to he and yet she stand stock-still and rigid while she heart hasten and leap and she mind seek to grasp the thing to do she must go with he do what he tell she like a slave as he have say or he would make she she reason say directly : you will go without a word and yet when he arise to he foot and knock he pipe out and look at she she reason flee before the flood of the passionate wilfulness of the old glorium and she cry shrilly : i will not i will not i be not you slave and i be not go to jump at you bidding you can not make I you sha not make I _ i will not _ he have hope for better than this he come closer and look intently into she eye seek to measure what endurance and steadfastness and stubbornness be hers but she eye show he only glimpse of a storm-tossed soul i will make you he say harshly so help I god glorium i will make you and i be through talk i be sick of talk come with I she draw back and back in white-lipped fury you do not _ dare _ listen to I we be down to bare elemental now can not you see it it be no question of what we would like to do or dislike it be a question of life and death if to let you have you way be anything other than suicide i would let you have it if i think that you would listen to reason i would stop to reason with you but as thing be i have get nothing leave I but tell you what to do and you have get to do as i say my life be my own to do with it as i please i do not please to obey you command she tortured heart surge up in wild triumph as he turn it sink sickly as he come back he have a piece of rope in he hand the heavy half-inch rope which have serve to tie a horse you would tie I she gasp I no he say tersely as though you be any other fractious animal refuse discipline when refusal mean death i be go to whip you god scream glorium oh my god for again he but say simply the thing which he mean to do and she know yet the consummation be monstrous unthinkable she would not believe it at the last minute he lift arm would fail he god himself would wither it undreamed rescuer would come the earth would open _ something _ would save she from this humiliation which would kill she while i count three say king and steadily though there be a pallor on he own face which should have tell she the terrible relentlessness of he intention he count : one two three she put she face into she hand and shiver and feel the fear of one under the flash guillotine she will to move to obey at this tardy second but something within she stronger than herself hold she back _ i will not _ she scream the blow fall swiftly the rope cut through the air with vicious sibilance and fall across the stooped shoulder the pain be immediate hot and searing and gloria shriek -- once only -- and grow still she drop she hand and look at he she face as white as a dead girl 's she eye as unfathomable as a maniac 's she who have never be whip in all of she life she whose soft white body have be hold inviolate by idolize parent she who have come to hold she own person as sacred as that of a high princess -- to be beat by a man to be lash across she shoulder with a horse 's tie-rope she gloria gaynor to have she bedding rip off she to be command to do a man 's bidding -- and to be whip she have know fear blind paralysing terror she have suffer indignity and experience a insult resentment that sear through she like a hot iron she have know pain merciless bodily pain now she be plunge into stupor but that stupor be of only the fraction of a second in duration a flash as of white fire flare through she brain in a soul in torment something have happen something have be kill within she -- or something have be bear a blow at a man 's hand have seem to cut through she be it have separate body and spirit she be conscious of the body as though she stand apart and look down at it he could beat that he be stronger the spirit rise above it -- a spirit bath in flood of fire she be in the sudden fierce grip of such anger as kill of such defiance as suffer death and do not yield i will not go with you she cry you may beat I you may kill I if you like unthinkable brute that you be i will not follow you now i will never follow one step ever i have listen to you now listen to I i would rather die than be bring to safety by you if i can not find the way home without you help i do not want ever to get home i be not afraid of you or you rope i have rather feel a clean rope across my shoulder until they be bloody than you vile hand on mine you will do what i tell you to do he say thickly it be the only way i will make you blaze eye burn in a death-white face give he he only answer he own face now be no less white iron-bodied as he be he be tremble yet he lift the rope to strike the second blow not just to frighten she but to strike she read he purpose clearly and she could not restrain a shudder of she flesh but she do not draw back from he and she do not cry out she mean what she have say or what some re-born glorium have say for she he might kill she but she would not follow he and then mark king as he be about to strike stay he hand at the last moment and hurl the rope far from he and whirl about and leave she _ chapter xxvi _ someway he come to the base of the cliff he be outside he be in the open and yet he struggle blindly through a pit of gloom he be conscious of but one fact in all the world about it everything else turn and spin as sweep the body of the sky about the sun he have lift he hand against a woman he mark king have strike a woman he have strike glorium he friend 's daughter -- ben 's daughter he have strike she what have come over he have he go mad stark stare rave mad he know all along that he nerve be on edge raw and quiver but no jangling nerve explain a thing like that he who have hold himself a man have strike a woman -- a girl a little defenceless girl my god he groan he stumble on he do not know where he be go or why he run he hand across he eye again and again he do not know why he do that one could not thus wipe out a vision which persist in he brain he would see she as she stand there every day and night until he die in a sweeping revulsion of feeling he see himself all that she have name he a great hulk brute all along he have be brutal with she he should have make due allowance he should have be patient he have plunge she into a existence of which she have no foreknowledge he have look to she for the sober sanity of maturity when he should have remember how young she be how little of real life she know how she have be drive to desperation by circumstance which crush she how she have go sleepless living on she nerve he have hold she weak and worthless and without spirit or character and now he could only see she standing up before he white but valiant defy he unafraid welcome death rather than yield to he he would have give ten year off the span of he life to have the deed of one mad moment wipe clean it be a long time before consecutive thought return to he and it bring he only increase bitterness glorium have say that she would die here rather than have he lead she to safety well he do not blame she for that rather he tell himself grimly he honor she for it and yet now more than ever he and he alone be the responsibility of see that she go clear of this wretched existence into which he have stubbornly lead she he could not take she away against she will he could not pick she up in he arm and carry she over a two or three day ' journey nor could he entrust she to the only other human being who be near enough for she to go to what could he do she would perish without help hence he must help she but how there be but one possible answer and in due course of time he come to see it clearly he must leave she get back the shortest quickest way to civilization and send other man trustworthy man in for she it could be do even though the storm continue he could get a dog-team alaskan husky to be have in truckee he could load sledge with provision he could put the right man in charge and then lead the way that would mean several day alone for glorium but what else be there and even that solution depend upon the consideration which by now be the elemental all-essential thing first he must find some sort of provision with which to eke out they small supply there be not enough in camp to sustain he while he battle with the storm for a way out and to sustain strength in she while she wait he must first replenish the larder otherwise they die he must get fish in plenty or a bear or a deer he look at the gray ominous sky at the pile snow and the chill of the wilderness strike to he heart but at last he eye grow hard again with determination in a distressed mental condition in which the only solid ground beneath he be he determination to do to the uttermost that lay within he for glorium he break into muttering voice aloud fragment of speech force himself toward steadiness of forward-driving purpose i have get to leave she she will not go with I that mean i have get to leave with she every scrap of food we have between we i can go two day without eat i can a man if he be half a man can finish he work before he buckle under she one danger be brodie otherwise she would be safe enough for four or five day she be get to stick close to the cave she must not dare to set foot outside but that be not enough they might come to the cave the way in be not overwide would they see it from below they do not know where it be or they would have do as i do they would have come to it for shelter no they do not know of it can i close up the entrance somehow so that they will not find it there be loose rock in there if they _ do _ come this way up the gorge it will be hard for they to see it from below even if they should find it i can show she where to hide way in the back there be a place there i can get out in two day back in two day somehow allow five day to cover accident five day she can stick it out five day if i do not take a scrap of she food away from she oh i can make it it be up to I to make it i 'll get a fish sooner or later -- or a rabbit a man can eat he boot \* \* \* \* \* after a long time he go back to the cave he know now just what he would do since it have become clear to he that there be but one thing to be do glorium face he as he come in she mark how he walk like a very tired man she head be up there be spot of color in she cheek in she eye be a new look she have find herself or she be find herself she spirit have rise undaunted in a crisis in a clash of will hers have not go down before he rather it have be hers that have triumph she might know fear again but the time be past and dead when she would bow meekly before a man 's bidding so she tell herself while with head erect she await he speech he begin say very simply what he have decide must be say he do not swerve for the useless word i be sorry he know that she do not expect they would not answer they what he have do be monstrous and unpardonable hence a man would not ask pardon by he own act they be set as far apart as two being inhabit two widely separate world it remain for he merely to instruct she concern what she must do then to find the way to bring she back safely to she father thereafter there the haze creep in again he would go away far from the sierra far from californium to some corner of the world where no man who have ever know mark king would see he again at that moment he could have die very gladly just to know that she be once more among she own people and that so far as he be concerned life be a game play out and end now that he speak again he voice be no longer harsh and stern but gentle rather gentle after a steady and matter-of-fact fashion that be infinitely aloof he could not know how impersonal he utterance sound in she ear since he do not fully realize how at the moment he hold himself less a individual address another than as the mouthpiece of fate the first thing in the morning he tell she i be go over the ridge and to the headwater of the other fork i have be think of that country a good deal it be a little far and hard go and i 'll burn up a lot of fuel make the trip but i have get a hunch a bear 's in there the one that stampede buck may have circle around that way and i be go to play every hunch i get good and strong it will probably be dark before i get back she think that he have finish but presently in the same strangely quiet voice he continue : i may even be go all night if i be it will be because i be play the last card you have say that you would rather be dead than go with I i believe you mean that again he pause glorium do not again lift she eye from the fire do not speak king sigh and do not know that he have do so if i do not get back to-morrow night it will be because i be try to break through to civilization i 'll outfit a party and send they in for you i 'll get through some way in two day i 'll get help back to you in another two or three at latest you have food here to keep you alive a week if you spin it out long before he have get to the end of he slow speech she heart be beat wildly the old fear surge back on she crush she to be leave here alone four or five day -- and night it be unendurable she would be dead you have you choice he go on he voice grow still more gentle if you will let I help you -- but even while in the silence that follow she hear the rapid beating of she own heart something stronger more stubborn than the glorium of another day keep she silent and still he have not finish before i go i be go to do all that i can to wall up the mouth of the cave it will make it warmer in here and -- and there will be less danger of any one find the place you threaten once to go to those other man _ no matter what happen you must not do that _ you do not quite understand what some man be these happen to be the worst of a bad crowd that ever get into these mountain they respect neither god nor man -- nor woman they be in a ugly mood they probably have more bootleg whiskey with they than food i do not tell you but i look in on they camp and see one of they a dope fiend name benny rudge shoot one of he own friend dead suspect he of have steal a side of bacon you would be better dead too than in they hand never forget that they do not know if they 'll ever get out of this alive they be desperate devil but with the cave wall up they will not find you if the worst should happen and they come here still you could hide i 'll show you the place far back in the cave you could run there with you blanket and food you could stay there never move no man could find you there they would see where we have be here but they would have to decide in the end that we have go both of we i 'll bring you plenty of wood i be go to make a pair of snow-shoe of a sort for I i 'll make a pair for you i hope you will not need they he run he hand across he brow but continue in a moment he voice unchanged : i 'll go out before daylight in the morning it will take I all that be leave of to-day to do what must be do first he turn then and go about he work she go back to the place by the fire terribly move agitate to the depths of she soul tear this way and that but one steady fire burn in she bosom -- the newly kindle white flame of she resentment just yonder where he have hurl it a grim reminder lay the rope he bring fragment of rock to the cave 's mouth the biggest he could find boulder which he roll from the further dark and with which he struggle mightily as he pile they one on the other higher and higher he build he rude wall place the smaller stone at the top and in time after hour of labor he have hide the great hole as best he could leave only at the side a way to pass in and out which could hardly be see from below across this he fix the canvas be that glimpse its grimy-white would appear but a lighter-hued streak of granite if you will come with I i will show you you hiding-place she lift she head and look at he no word have pass between they during the back-breaking hour of he labor again she think swiftly he be seek to command to dictate doubtless in the end she would have arise and go with he since to refuse be madness but he have not wait he have go alone into the depths of the cavern she hear he slow measure step recede she hear they again slow and measure as he come back it be only about thirty pace straight back he be say my step remember but shorten so that it would be about the same for you say thirty-five there i have make a little pile of rock you can not miss it that mark the place just at the side of the rock pile that be where i find the gold there be a blind cave back there just under this one there be only a small entrance to it straight down a ragged hole in the floor hardly more than big enough for a man to drop down through i have it hide by drag a boulder over it now i have shove the boulder just far enough to one side to let you go through also i have set bit of stone under its outside edge so that it be fairly balanced if you go through a quick tug at it will topple it over to cover the hole again there be air down there that come up from below and it be a better place to be than here -- if any one should come she shudder but he have not see there remain much to do and the hour flee so swiftly he set to work make the clumsy snow-shoe he imitate a crude native shoe he have once see in alaska he bent willow wand he have bring from along the edge of the stream whipping they about with narrow strip of canvas binding other wand crosswise make also of canvas strip a sort of stirrup for each foot the last of the weak daylight pass and die gloomily and he be still at he task bend now by he fire work on with infinite care the stick brittle with the cold weather break under he strong finger patiently he insert other or strengthen the crack piece with string he face ruddy in the firelight be impassive glorium look at he see no mere man but a senseless thing of machine lever and steel coil something tireless and hard and as determine as fate itself they have make they scanty supper after it both be hungry they have be hungry thus for four day there remain coffee and sugar enough for another half-dozen meager meal here the affluence end the bacon be down to a piece of fat two inch thick and seven inch long there be bacon grease a couple of inch deep in a tomato-can there be a teacup of flour there be one small tin of sardine and a smaller one of devilled meat to-day they be hungry to-morrow they would be a great deal hungrier the next day they would begin to starve king get up and go out down the cliff in the dark for a last load of wood when he come back she be lie on she bed she face from the light he stand a moment look at she then for the last time he speak to she : if i be long go you understand why it would be best to save food all you can not to stir about much since exercise mean burn up more strength which must be renew and by still more food there be not a chance in a thousand now that those man will find this place if they do there be not a chance in another thousand that they will find the middle cave you will be safe enough and if i do not get back to-morrow you will know that within three day more or four at most there will be a party in here to bring you out _ chapter xxvii _ glorium awake with a start she have not hear king go yet she know that she be alone in the cave alone she sit up clutch she blanket about she object all around she be plunge into darkness but where the canvas let in the morning she see a patch of drear chill light full morning then by now mark king be far away oh the pitiless loneliness of the world as she sit there in the gloom of the cavern she heart as cheerless as the drear light creep in as cold as the dead char stick where last night 's fire have burn itself out and oh the terrible merciless silence about she she sit plunge into a despondency beyond the bourne of tear a slim white-bodied gaunt-eyed girl crushed beat by a relentless destiny lose to the world shut in between two terror -- the black unknown of the deeper cavern the white menace of a waste wilderness and far more than pinch of cold or bite of hunger be she utter solitude unbearable she spring up and build a fire less for the warmth though she be cold to the bone than for the sense of companionship the homely flame be like flame in remembered fireplace they voice be as the voice of those other fire they light though show only cold rock wall and rude camp equipment be the closest thing she have to companionship she come close to the fire and for a long time would not move from it she go to the wall king have build move the canvas aside just enough to look out and stand there a long time a dead hush lay over the world there be no wind the snow in great unbroken feathery crystal fall softly thick in the sky drop ceaselessly and soundlessly it cling to the limb of tree make of each branch a thick white arm still the pine-needle bind they together in the sheath which forbid they to shiver and rustle it lay in sludgy mess in the pool of the stream and curl over the edge of the steep bank and coat the boulder it lay its white command for silence upon the racing water a world dead-white and dead-still that unbroken silence which exist nowhere else as it do in the waste of snow and which lie upon the soul like a positive inhibition against the slightest human-made sound no wind to stir a dry twig no dry twig but be manacle and muffle no dead leaf to rustle since all dead leaf lay deeper than death under the snow glorium 's sensation as she stand as still as the wilderness all about she and stare out across the ridge be that of one who have suddenly and without warn go stone-deaf the stillness be so absolute that it seem to crush the soul within she she go back hastily to she fire glad to hear the crackle of the flame grateful to have the emptiness make somewhat less the yawning void by the small sound of a bit of wood rolling apart on the rock floor she be hungry but she have no heart for cooking she eat little scrap of cold food leave over from last night she nibble at a last bit of the slab chocolate she fill a pot with snow gather at the cave mouth and set it on the coal to get water to drink and again have nothing else to do and urge restlessly to some form of activity she hurry back to the canvas flap and watch the fall snow hearken to the stillness for in the spell of the snow country one be force to the attitude of one who listen and who hear the great hush and who like the enchanted world about it heed and obey and when he move go with quiet footfall endlessly long be the minute hour be eternity she stand by the rock wall until she be chill as noiselessly as a creep shadow she go back to she fire and shiver before it and warm herself turn she head quickly to peer into the dark of the hidden tunnel turn again as quickly to glance toward she rude door she heart leap at every crackle of she fire she thaw some of the cold out of she and go to look out again a hundred time she make the brief journey from be lightning-swift thought become a laborious drugged process she excited mind have harbour throng of vivid vision she have know a period of over-active mental stimulation she have see as in the actual flesh mark king plough through the snow go over ridge push on and on and on always further away drive on through limitless distance she have see he fall he body crash down a sheer precipice she have see he lie he face turn up the snowflake fall fall fall cover it she have see he go on again she have see he break he way to the open get back among other man fall exhaust but call upon they to go back to she she have see man hurry dog-sleds harnessed pack of provision man on snow-shoe she have see they come toward she across the mile some one else be come too it be big swen brodie he face horrible there be a rabble at he back it be a race between these man and those other man she have feel that brodie be put out a terrible hand toward she she have see other man leap upon he drag he back king have return king and brodie be struggle then again she see king fight he way through the snow go for help she have try to reason he could be only a few mile away but at last a tired brain refuse to create more of these swift picture she stare out and do not think she merely feel the weight of the silence the weight of utter loneliness with drag foot she return to she fire and look into the coal and from they to the further dark and from it back to the pale light about she canvas she sink into a condition of lethargy the silence have work a sort of hypnosis in she briefly in she wide-opened eye there be no light of interest vaguely as though she have no great personal concern in the matter she wonder how long it would be before one left alone here would go mad and would the mad one shout shriek defiance at the silence -- or go about on tip-toe finger lay across he lip the morning wear on at one moment she be plunge into a deep chaotic abyss that be neither unconsciousness nor reverie and yet which strangely partake of both a moment later she be vaguely aware of a difference it be as though a presence though what sort she could not tell have approach be near she all about she that instant of uncertainty be brief go in a flash she turn and a little glad cry break from she lip a streak of sunshine lay across the rock at the cave 's mouth it be like the visit of a angel more than that like the face of a beloved friend she run to she canvas and look out there be a rift in the sombre roofing of cloud she see a strip of clean blue sky through which a splendid sun shone and yet the snow be fall on all hand snow bright with a new shine whiteness she watch that little strip of heaven 's blue eagerly and anxiously be it widen or be the cloud crowd over it again but though this seem the one consideration of importance in all the world for she just now in another instant it be sweep from she mind forget far below she down in the gorge she see something move and that something plough laboriously through depths and drift of loose fluffy snow be a man now she thought race again it be king he be come back to she no it be not king it be swen brodie she begin to tremble violently she have barely strength to draw back to pull the canvas closer to the rock to strive to hide if brodie come now if brodie find she here alone -- that fear which be in all female heart that boundless terror of the one creature who be she greatest protector she vilest enemy more dreaded than a wild beast grip she and shake she and swiftly beat the strength out of she but fascinate she cling to the rock and watch the man struggle weakly against the pitiless wilderness wallow in the snow seem to make he way along the gorge inch by inch he carry something on he back something white under the fall snow which whiten he hat and labor shoulder a sack with something in it something to which he cling tenaciously how he flounder and battle against the high-heaped white stuff about he which hold he back which mount about he leg up to he waist at time when he flounder he be all but lose in it he lay still like a dead man he struggle and begin crawl on again he stop and look about he -- how she heart pound then he be look for something seek something she she be so certain it must be brodie yet she remain motionless powerless to move though she remember king 's word of the hiding-place where she would be safe she peer out fascinate in time the man come closer and the first suspicion enter she mind that after all it might not be brodie he stop he be exhaust he pull off he hat and run he hand across he face then still barehead he look up it be gratton gratton alone gratton look back over he shoulder more often than he quest far ahead gratton in a mad attempt to make haste where haste be impossible now he every gesture bespeak a frantic haste he be escape from something then what he have leave the other man he be run away from they she know it as well as if he have scream it into she ear a sudden spurt of pity for he enter she heart he seem so beaten and bewildered and frantic and terrify who better than she could sympathize with one in gratton 's predicament she look far down the gorge she could see like a bluish crooked shadow the trail which he have make after he no one else in sight then she forget everything saving that she and gratton be alone that they have be friend that they be bind in a common fate she lean as far out as she could he be just below now she call to he he stop dead in he track he jerk he head up and stare wildly he mouth drop open and in the shock of the moment speech be deny he she call again you have not the silence be so complete he gasping voice would have fail to reach she as it be she barely hear it you gloria here my god -- have i go mad the man 's villainy of so few day ago appear now in the biassed light of circumstance a pardonable a forgettable offence he have love she he have want to marry she he have with that in mind trick she he have take advantage of the universal admission that in love as in war all thing be fair the ugliness of what he have do be chiefly ugly because it have lie against a background of commonplace and convention here at the time when no consideration exist save the eternal and vital one all of gratton 's futile trickery be as though it have never be she be call to he again urge he to clamber up the cliff bidding he hurry before he be see how come you here be all that he could find word for you and _ here _ she would tell he everything but he must not tarry down there he must make haste -- she word clear he bewilderment away he glance again over he shoulder the gorge be empty of other human presence he look back up at she and then before she eager eye he slump down where he stand lie in the snow i can not she hear he voice as across a distance ten time that which separate they in it be bleak despair i have go through hell already i be -- nearly dead i could not climb up there i -- oh my god why do i ever come into this inferno she beg she urge but he only turn a white face up to she and lay where he have fall he body shake visibly what with the strain he have put upon it and the emotion which only he own soul know but it be so easy she cry to he forgetful of she now terror at mount up here i have do it twice i will show you just which way where to set you foot i can not he say miserably it be all i could do to get this far i -- i think i be die -- again and again she plead with he but he have either reach the limit of he physical endurance or shake and unnerved he have not the courage to attempt the steep climb he lay still he eye be shut and to gloria too come the swift fear that the man might be die i be come to you she call she begin make the hazardous descent she do not take time to ask herself if she could make it she know only that she must she set foot on the narrow slope ledge outside brushing off the snow with she boot cling with she hand to a splinter of granite feeling she way cautiously careful to move inch by inch along the way down which she have go twice with mark king she finger already cold when she start go numb they be at all time either in pit and pocket of snow or grip the rough stone that be ice-cold painfully but steadily she climb down and down she strive not to look down she have no eye for gratton who now sit upright he jaw still sag and marvel at she a dozen time he be prepare to see she slip and fall after a weary time she come to the base of the cliff gratton be not a dozen pace from she he look to she like a sick man gaunt hollow-eyed unkempt unshaven as she have never see he before he be like some caricature of the immaculate gratton of san francisco he do not move but look at she in a strange bewildered fashion plainly he have have no knowledge of she be here he could not explain she presence he be every whit as dumbfounded as he would have be have she drop down upon he out of the sky see that he make no attempt to move she start to come to he she be stand upon a rock she step off into the snow and in a flash have sink to she breast a cry break from she as thus for the first time in she life she learn what it be to seek to force a way through deep loose-drifted snow feather-light in its individual flake in mass it make haste impossible to push on six inch through it be labor to come a dozen pace to gratton be hard work she flounder as she have see he flounder she throw herself forward as he have do and sink with every effort at last reach he side it be you -- glorium gaynor he mutter but i do not understand i come with mark king the storm catch we just as it catch you but you must come with I if you lie here you will be chill you will freeze later we can tell each other everything he shake he head i can not he groan i be more dead than alive i tell you i have be live through day and night of hell hell populate by rage demon i have be since before dawn get here he cast a bleak look up along the cliff and shudder i would rather lie here and die than attempt it once more glorium be urge and plead but in the end she give over hopelessly see that gratton would not budge and it be so clear to she that he would perish if he lay here there be a hole in the cliff just yonder gratton say drearily god know what wild beast may be in it but i be go to crawl in there when you call then gloria saw for the first time the open to that cave which in gus ingle 's bible have be set down as caive number one it be almost directly under king 's cave at the base of the cliff the snow come close to conceal it entirely as it be just a ragged black hole show a couple of foot above the snow-line come then she say let 's see if it be big enough for a shelter it may do as well as the other gratton heave himself up with a groan glorium do not wait for he but begin the tedious breaking of a path the few foot to the hole too earnest in the endeavor even to note how gratton come along behind without suggest that it be the man 's place to break trail thus glorium come first to the lower cave she hesitate and listen she fancy stimulate by he suggestion of storm-driven animal and seek to peer into the dark she could see nothing she hear nothing nothing save gratton 's hard breathing close behind she she get a grip upon herself and make a step forward pause extend she arm to grope for a wall and make another step there be still no sound she breathe more freely assure herself that save for herself the cavern be empty she stumble over a rock stop again and call to gratton only now be he enter light a match she command my hand be dead with cold he mutter i do not know if i have a match wait a minute he begin a slow search finally she know that he have find a match she hear it scratch against a rock then she hear gratton curse nervously the match have break and he knuckle have scrape along the rock the second match he give to she she strike it carefully cup the tiny flame with she hand and strove to see what lay about she the little light give but poor assistance to she strain eye but she do see that there be a litter of dead limb about she foot she begin gather up some of the smaller branch grope for other as she match burn out again gratton search he pocket he find more match and some scrap of paper it be glorium 's hand which start the fire and place the bit of dry wood upon it the flame crackle the wood catch like tinder the flicker light retrieve much of the cavern about they from the utter dark here i stay say gratton he drop down and begin warm he shake hand a more abjectly miserable specimen of humanity glorium have never look upon he be jade spiritless cowed but he be a human being and she be no longer alone across the empty desolation he have come to she one who have live as she have live who know another world than this who could understand what she suffer because he too suffer there come a space of time all too brief during which she heart sing within she she be lift from despair to a realm bright with hope king have go for succor she have a companion to share with she the dread hour of wait she begin a swift planning she catch up a burning brand as she have see mark king do and hold it high make a quick survey go timidly step by step further from the entrance deeper into the cavern it be much like the one so high above of what shape she could hardly guess so many be the hollow in floor roof and wall so many be the tunnel-like arm reach further than she dare go gratton could not or would not climb to the higher cave then why should they not make this they shelter she would have to climb the cliff again but she would have to do that in any case once up there it would be so simple a matter to toss down blanket and food and cooking utensil a half-hour would see she camp move from one cave to the other eager and excited she begin to tell gratton what she mean to do wait a while he urge she i be terribly shake glorium i have live through experience which a week ago i would have think unbearable he shudder she see that when he say he be terribly shake he have not exaggerated and in the glare of he eye she read that utterly unnerved he dread to be leave alone even while she go up the cliff i would say that a man would have die -- or go mad -- with the strain that i have live through i know she say gently i can guess but when you get good and warm -- and rest -- i will make you a hot cup of coffee -- i have this it be better than coffee for I now he untie the mouth of the bag with shake finger grope through its contents and at last bring out a flask nearly full of a amber liquid it be the stuff brodie 's crowd make he explain unstopper the flask they have get more of it than food with they curse they bestial heart stuff which way back in ancient history which mean a week ago i would no more have think of drinking than i would drink poison but it have save the life in I he put the bottle to he lip and swallow three or four time he sit afterward make a wry face he full eye blinking but gradually a faint bit of color make he pasty cheek something less dead-white and the powerful raw corn whiskey inject into he blood a little reassurance let I rest a bit and get warm he ask of she i -- i would rather you do not leave I just yet gloria know so well what it be to have raw quivering nerve she try to smile at he and say as lightly as she could why of course there be no hurry begin to gather what bit of wood lay about pile they on the fire thus she note where evidently long ago there have be another fire kindle against the wall of rock some one else have camp here perhaps during summer-time and this explain the fuel wood so conveniently place meanwhile gratton take a second pull at he flask set it carefully aside and stand up swing he arm to get the blood run beat he hand against he thigh stamp gingerly he begin look at she curiously presently he say : do you think we be ever go to get out of this alive yes she voice ring with assurance mark king have go for help all we have to do be wait for a few day he pale brow fly up king he have go he have leave you alone here again she say : yes gratton begin pluck at he lip stride up and down now it become obvious to she that there have be nothing wrong within he beyond what he frantic terror have do to he perhaps leave alone he would have die out there in the snow now have already lean on she have she company and the hope she hold out he begin to look he old self now i 'll go for the thing in the other cave she suggest and as a afterthought : now that you be feel better perhaps you will go up with I and help why he say why -- of course yes we 'll both go for in he new mood warm by the fire and the raw whiskey and further have see that she have do the thing with no mishap he be willing to do what before he could not do come he say let 's hurry along the path they have already make it be a much easier matter to make the return trip at the cliff gratton allow glorium to go ahead since she know the way up and he do not he follow she closely and at first with little difficulty or hesitation the higher they climb however the slower he go once he hesitate so long that she begin to believe that dizziness have overcome he and that he be come no further but at length she come to the ledge and the wall king have make and gratton look up and see she above he begin climb again glorium hold aside the canvas flap he follow she into the cave she fire though low still burn for the sake of more light she put on more dry wood from the great heap king have leave for she she begin to look about plan swiftly just how easiest to move the few belongings which must go with she she could pile odds and end into a blanket she could remake the canvas roll as king have do so often she and gratton could drag the bundle to the front of the cave and push they over down the cliff first we 'll get thing together all in a heap she say aloud he come forward and stand warm he nervous hand at she fire he eye everywhere at once he mark the shipshape air of the cavern the parcel which be to-night 's supper and to-morrow 's three poor little meal each set carefully apart from the other on the rock shelf he see how the firewood be pile in its place not scatter how glorium 's bed and king 's look almost comfortable because of the fir-bough how the clean pot and pan be in they place then he turn he full eye like searchlight upon the girl and you he say marvel _ you _ actually come with a man like king into a place like this i be a fool cry glorium a pitiful little fool oh have she be think less of glorium and more of this other man with whom she be now to cope she must have mark a certain swift change in he attitude it become less furtive more assure he eye leave she to reeve again linger with the two couch and return to she you find king be not you kind he announce you have quarrel from the very begin she reply quickly he be unthinkable i would have leave he long ago only only there be no place to go gratton finish it for she and now he continue slowly study she you be willing to come with I yes she tell he unhesitatingly but he offer musingly you refuse I once and turn to he have not i tell you i be a fool i do not know then quite what man be some man she be not measure every word now she mean simply that she be determine to have do with mark king hold bitterly that she hate he that she would go to any one to be definitely through with king yet he have time to weigh she word and draw from each one he own significance he eye follow she as she gather up she few personal and intimate possession comb brush little silken thing of pale pink and blue a faint color seep into the usually colourless lip at which he dead-white tooth be suddenly gnawing when she see the look in he eye she stare at he wonderingly what be it she ask she voice puzzle what be what gratton laugh but the look be still there he eye do not laugh what make you look like that what be you think now it be he who be vaguely puzzle then he shrug i be just think how superb you be he reply not entirely untruthfully for he ulterior thought have be rear upon the vital fact of she triumphant beauty the compliment be too much like hundred she have receive in she life to alarm she rather it please what word of praise have she hear during these latter day he voice sound queerly as though he breath come with difficulty maybe it do since he be no outdoors man and to he the climb up the rock and the brief journey along the mountain flank be a painful labor certain it be that the faint flush be still in the sallow cheek suddenly he lift he hand put they out toward she she see again the strange look in he eye gloria he say hoarsely you be wonderful and you have come to I gloria meet he rather too ardent admiration with that cool little laugh which have be she weapon in other day she be not afraid of gratton to-day she have lead and he have follow she have command and he have obey here be a pleasant change from king 's masterfulness and she fully intend to hold gratton well in hand i come to you she say frankly because i be a woman in distress and have no alternative that there have ever be any unpleasantness between we do not alter that fact you understand I do not you he hardly hear she to he mind the situation be clearness itself glorium have come alone into the forest with mark king she have be with he all these day and night but she and king have quarrel tired of each other already perhaps gratton do not care what the reason be he be gloatingly satisfy with the outcome he have always covet she it take much to stir he pale blood and only the superb beauty of glorium gaynor have ever fully do so king have steal she away but she have leave he and have come straight to gratton he come a step closer and the firelight show how the muscle of he throat be work glorium 's eye widen but not yet do she fully understand and not yet do she fear mr gratton she begin glorium he cry out glorium he hand suddenly fling out be upon she she tear they away wrench herself free from he and start back as she do so she little silken bundle drop at she foot gratton catch it up and bury he face in it now as he look up at she he eye and all that she could see of he face be stamp with that which lay in he heart oh she cry shrink not so much from he as from the thing she read so plainly at last surely you do not think you do not misinterpret my be here at all my be with mr king no cry gratton wildly i misinterpret nothing you come alone with he into the mountain what chance be there for two interpretation there you give yourself to he you see you mistake you hate he you have come to I i have always love you i want you she cheek flame red with hot anger there be a flutter in she heart a wild tremor in she blood she draw back from he he follow he arm out she be amaze for the moment shock into consternation and yet she know no such terror as have be hers when king have advance on she rope in hand she new contempt of gratton be too high for that now she mark the small stature little taller little stronger than she own the pale face the narrow chest the slender body you know what i mean what i want he be mutter that sweet young-thing innocence be all right in its place but that place be not here alone in the mountain with a man man she burst out scathingly you _ a man _ why you wretch little beast but gratton he brain reel with hot fancy come on you be afraid of king you say that he make you do what he want what about I you be go to do what i tell you i by god i will make you beast you call I no more beast than any other man i have want you all these year you have want I or you would not have be so glad to see I only a few day ago you be ready to marry I and now he arm grope for she glorium sweep up a dead pine limb that lay by the fire and swing it in both hand and strike he full across the face he reel back and stand half in the shadow he shoulder to the rock wall he hand to he face you beast she pant you cowardly contemptible beast from the way in which he bring he hand down and look at it and lay it back upon he lip she know that he mouth be bleed and she read in the gesture and in the man 's whole cringing attitude that the danger of any physical violence from he be past and do with in the grip of he passion ugly as it be he have rise somewhat from he essential weakness in the moment he have at least thought of himself as a conqueror now he be again what he always really be at heart a contemptible coward a absolutely new sense of elation sing through glorium 's blood she be fully mistress of the situation and have find within she a unguessed strength physically superb at all time because nature have richly gifted she now she be magnificent mr gratton she say swiftly you have make a mistake mr king have never offer I violence of that sort remember that though we be alone and in the mountain i be the same glorium gaynor that you have know and be sure that you treat I as such he nurse he battered lip and stare at she the blow have daze he slowly as he mind clear there dawn in it the realization that he _ have _ make a mistake the stick be still in she hand a shiver run through he he desire go out of he i wish to god i have never see you he groan she have mean from the first to take the upper hand now she be almost glad that this have happen for now she be very sure of herself gratton have merely be bold like other young man who have seek to presume he have be cruder simply because the situation seem to he mind to offer the opportunity now a blow from she have accomplish the work of a haughty look in drawing-room encounter with those other young man she drop the stick and wipe she hand we have other thing to think of she say she might have be a young queen who have punish a subject and now from she exalted place condescend to consider that the indignity offer she royal person have never occur she begin drag the blanket from she bed tumble they to the floor take these she command i be a fool for ever leave san francisco he mutter bitterly you let I think that you care for I and now you treat I like a dog i spend time and money try to be the one to find gold in these infernal mountain and i find nothing but storm and starvation i do not believe there ever be gold here _ gold _ he stop at he own word he eye fly wide open during these later hour flee from brodie 's man stumble upon glorium swirl away by mad longing he have not think of gold but here be king 's camp straight here have king come after glorium have bring he she father 's message and old honeycutt 's secret then the gold be here the cupidity which in the man never sleep long be awake on the instant he begin look about he eagerly king be go then not for man to bring help to glorium but to aid he in carry off the gold have bring glorium here so that she could not tell other what she know he leave she here with the same purpose so gratton would have do king would have hide it here at least some of it he begin quest feverishly shuffling about in the shadow while glorium busy with she plan for move wonder at he he be striking match run back and forth she could hear he muttering and presently when glorium have call and he have not hear he come upon the bag which king have mean to take out with he that day the horse be lose he hover over it he strike other match he come hasten back drag it after he he go down on he knee by the sack get a heavy lump in he hand rub at it hold it closer to the firelight rub again more excitedly and finally sit back stare up at she with new flame of another sort leap in he eye it be next thing to solid gold he gasp there be thousand -- thousand -- million she look at he and marvel in he shallow soul no emotion live long greed of gold now obliterate the little ripple that another greed have fleetingly make how have she think well of he down in the city how have she so much as tolerate he on the instant it strike she that there be small justice in gratton reap any reward have do nothing to earn it we have the thing to move come hurry why should we move after all he demand sharply now that i have get up here why not stay there be wood here everything be fix up after a fashion king would know where to send for we and -- and those cursed dog of brodie 's would never think of look up here even if chance do lead they along the gorge glorium recall king 's warning remember brodie 's brute face say hastily : do you think there be any real danger that they will come this way i hope not he groan they could not follow my trail if they try to you see i leave they last night as early as i dared i strike out in a straight line down the slope then i make a turn off to the side and along the ridge where there be but little snow by now all those track be wipe out what with wind and new snow there be nothing to lead they this way then if we go down quickly if we get you bag of food and put out the fire down there and come right back up it will not be very long before we track will be go and we 'll not budge from here until help come come let 's hurry come say gratton yes we must hurry she go ahead and begin to clamber down the cliff half-way down she wonder why he be not follow she find a place where she could cling and look up thus she be just in time to see he stand at the mouth of the cave clutch a heavy bag he have be tie the mouth of it now he cast it outward so that it fall striking against the cliff-side and then roll and drop to disappear at last in the snow-bank below and then he begin though hesitantly to follow she that be one thing mark king will not get he announce with emphasis at last he stand beside she in the snow no matter how the game break whether he come back or not and no matter who get away with the rest that bagful be mine there be a fortune in it and it be mine he begin toss double handful of loose snow into the hole which the bag of gold have make when i get a chance he mutter i 'll move it somewhere else he avarice disgust she just now the thought of gold sicken we be waste time she remind he he follow she again cast a last look behind he then look up at the sky gray everywhere except for a long patch of blue what we want be another three or four hour of steady snow he be say when they slip into the mouth of the lower cave enough to hide that and to cover up we path glorium be already try to put out the fire if ill fortune should lead brodie 's crowd here it would be just as well if they find no smoulder stick to tell they that the fugitive have be here so short a time ago and could not be far off she call to gratton to help she he stamp out burn brand while she hasten back and forth bring handful of snow with which to extinguish the last glowing coal she work vigorously and swiftly he only half-heartedly since he thought be elsewhere maybe he say thoughtfully i would better bring that bag in here and hide it somewhere -- far back in the dark no she say leave it where it be we must hurry back to the other cave but he grow stubborn over it the storm might end at any time the sun might melt all this fluffy snow the bag then would be for any one to see heedless of she expostulation he leave she extinguish the fire and go back for the gold he be go several minute digging after it she have finish she task when he reappear drag the heavy sack after he he disappear swiftly go into the deeper dark of the further end of the cave she hear he move with shuffling foot what a treacherous thieving petty animal he be -- she start and whirl about there be a new sound in the air a low mumble a vague murmur man 's voice outside come nearer swiftly be man she first thought be of king then she know that it be too soon for he to have get out of the mountain find assistance and return a deep heavy bass voice drown out the other it be like a low-throated growl ominous sinister glorium whirl again this time toward the dark into which gratton have go blindly she hurry after he she stumble but keep on she could hear he at work hide he gold at last she be at he side she clutch at he sleeve listen

clean fresh outside air she be within three pace of the line of snow then there be a sudden noise gratton inch off backward have stumble over a dead stick the man by the fire be startle out of they oblivion steve jarrold the one nearest glorium swing about saw she drop what be in he hand and lunge towards she she make a dash for the exit in two great stride jarrold be upon she and have catch she by the shoulder drag she back and gratton stand again he foot glue to the ground she could see the flash of he tooth gnawing at he finger try to make a sneak for it boom brodie i 'll show you -- not

hand lock about glorium 's shrink shoulder he ill-featured face the small pig eye always jeer the black bristle of beard not unlike a hog 's bristle be thrust close to she face where 's king all this time he demand up in the other cave maybe no she say dismally seek to jerk away from he evil glance and whiskey-laden breath he have go -- that be good let he go we do not care do we eh girlie but again he hand tighten until the hard finger hurt she but go where we be short of food -- he be hunting -- maybe he have go for help -- and you show gratton where he hide he gold that be a nice little

ahead you and she and show we the way and no monkey business either of you or i 'll blow a hole square through you gratton grown nimble dart ahead with brodie always close at he heel gloria force on by jarrold come next and after they the other benny be the last he have take time to put the gold back into the sack and set it aside among the shadow for benny believe in make sure of what they have even while they quest better thing then he catch up he rifle the only other gun besides brodie 's and come hurry after they they go up the cliff in a long file claw they way cursing the steepness now and then one or another of they fumble uncertainly close to a slip and a fall it be clear that with the possible exception of swen brodie not a man of they be entirely sober but they make the climb safely and hasten into the upper cave eagerly it be somewhere back there say gratton more fire shout brodie he voice exult he blood would be run now with the gold fever he toss on a armful of dry wood the flame catch and roar shadow quiver and dance already benny be at the far end of the cave the other run after he even jarrold relinquish glorium 's arm eager to be in at the finding but he call to she as he go : you stick where you be i be not forget you this time fascinate she watch they they run like blood-lusting dog that have briefly lose they quarry that be seek everywhere in every cranny with slaver jaw they turn aside into side-pocket of the main cavern they get torch and look high and low they go back and forth up and down they stumble against one another and curse angrily they catch up bit of stone run back to the fire to see if the fragment be shoot with gold curse and hurl the useless thing from they and run back again to jostle and seek and be first they be not so much like dog now as human hog fight to get first into the trough but they do not forget gratton and they do not forget glorium all the time both brodie and benny keep they gun in they hand two significant look have be all that be need to keep they two prisoner in mind of the fact that no escape now be possible to gloria it seem inevitable that in this quest which overlook nothing and which as time wear on grow less frenzied and more systematic they would find what king have find before they she try to think consecutively she recall all that king have tell she of these man all that gratton have hint at she recall with a shudder the look in the moist eye of steve jarrold it seem to she that she only slim chance for safety lay in they find the gold for only gold gold unlimited could cause they to forget she for a hour they seek tirelessly it appear that there be many finger to the further end of the cave narrow irregular channel into which they press they faggot burn out the smoke choke they they cough and curse come out for fresh air dive into the dark again the short day be pass the enter light where they have tear the canvas aside grow dimmer and still they search at last brodie return and stand look from glorium to gratton one of you know he say shortly which one i swear to god -- begin gratton shut up then it be you the little shiny blue eye never so coldly evil draw she own frightened eye fascinate and hold they you know i do not know all i know -- do not lie to I it 'll do you no good he lift a hand and hold it over she the enormous finger apart and rigid i 'll make you tell listen to I she manage to cry out i do not know i tell you but i know where it might be in a place you would never think of look not in a thousand year -- blue fire spring up in the gleaming eye the other man draw close watch and listen they eye alive with many light what you know i 'll know i 'll choke it out of you -- i 'll tell you -- if you will keep you hand off I i 'll make a bargain with you i 'll show you the place if there be gold there i do not care what happen to it -- if you 'll only agree to let I alone -- to let I go -- brodie laugh at she but benny cry out : of course we 'll let you go what do you suppose we want of you once we get we hand on it she can go brodie tell she so you big -- sure say brodie with a wide grin it be not woman we be after this trick it be something better and -- and it would be very nice of you to show we -- miss gaynor he treat she to a grin mock respect so obviously spurious that she fear of he rise higher choke she very nice be not it boy i -- i be not sure what you 'll find whisper glorium i only know that -- oh dear god i hope you find all the gold in the world hastily she run by brodie toward the dark end of the cave then she stop and try to think how many pace have king say she come back to the fire thirty thirty-five she begin count as she walk while they watch she wonder and follow slowly after she she find several boulder in she path but she have not go far enough she keep on thirty thirty-two thirty-three -- she could hardly see about she she stumble against a rock in she way try here she say already brodie and steve jarrold be at she side this rock see if it will move -- they thrust she roughly aside brodie set down he rifle lay he big hand on the boulder and as if it have weigh only ten pound toss it out of the way he kneel feel along the ground a sudden shout burst from he : down here there be a big hole there be a dark cave underneath that be where it be they bring faggot at the edge of the hole they hastily build another fire they crowd round peer down brodie toss a brand through it drop a short distance a few foot only strike and begin to roll it catch against a rock smoke and smoulder and go out brodie set he leg over the opening call to the italian to grab he rifle and keep a eye on glorium and gratton and go down the other crowd about the hole wait impatiently for he to go through and then begin pile down after he glorium could see they figure dimly they go down and down along a long steep slanting passage-way they have smoking torch and look like so many fiend in the bottomless pit she hear they call back and forth excitedly they go on still downward she hear they grind boot-heel but could no longer see they suddenly they be silent then there be swift muttering and then a great triumphant many-voiced shout in gus ingle 's treasure-cache they have at last come to gus ingle 's treasure and among other thing to the skeleton of gus ingle himself sprawl here for sixty year in the dark over a great heap of gold _ chapter xxix _ swen brodie whose will have at all time direct be now absolute dictator big and brutal and fearless drunken with gold he loom above he companion drive they command they swearing violently that they would do what he tell they to do or he would dash they brain out i lead you to it he remind they in a great shout voice but for I never a man of you would of smell it there be enough here to make a thousand man rich and that be lucky for you but we have get to hold what we get and we get to get out of here with it -- somehow that somehow be for I to figure out and be as one man 's get to run any job and the rest have get to take order and take 'em on the jump you be do what i say if any man jack of you do not like that let he open he head right now there be no sense scrappin ' muttered benny a ' we be all satisfied i would say but there be no call to start wavin ' a red flag we be go down to the lower cave say brodie everything we can pry loose be go down with we we 'll pitch the loose chunk of gold over the cliff and we 'll stow 'em away somewhere else -- where king if thing break some way we do not look for will not find 'em we start right now while there be daylight what be more we move we camp from down the canon to the cave below steve jarrold you and tony be elect to that job and you would better get a move on bring up what grub 's left and the blanket and stuff the rest of we will start in firing gold overboard and put it somewhere more safe -- all that be loose and at that think of the great big wide yellow rotten-soft seam of it down below where be you goin ' to put it demand jarrold not hide it from you and tony steve cry brodie sharply put you suspicious way in you pocket and if you be on the jump you 'll have we camp truck move before we be do look alive will you a man never know what be go to happen why not leave it here until we know -- for one thing because mark king know this place now move come ahead you other fellow you too gratton we be not forget you a uglier note creep into the harsh voice you can help and so can you whirling on glorium woman or no woman you get hand and foot \* \* \* \* \* night pitch-black have come when they have do glorium scarcely able to stand from exhaustion she body bruise she hand and arm wound from many a jagged rock as she have go back and forth carry heavy load go with the other into the lowest cave in which already the gold have be stow away she sink down wearily she close she eye rather than watch the man about they fire eat noisily drink noisily from the bottle which steve and tony have bring from they other camp try to remain unnoticed in the shadow be gratton brodie have command that a rude rock wall like king 's be build across the mouth of the cave to shut out the cold and have labor with the other at the task come back to the fire he take a long pull at a bottle empty it and smash it to tinkle fragment as he hurl it behind he he catch up a big piece of dry beef and gnaw at it like a dog though glorium keep she eye away from he she could hear the tear and grind of the monstrous tooth it be be a day 's work at that he say with a full mouth but we be not do i notice how no man have say a word about how we split what we find there be five of we say benny quickly we split it five way even like pardner brodie turn on he slowly still rend at he meat still clutch he rifle and hold it so that no man might forget that he hold it think so benny he say ponderously be as i have work on this lay a long time since i let you other in on it since i lead you to it -- think that be the fair way to split it now suppose you listen to I you boy be not mention a split because it be none of you say and you know it say in round number -- but there be ten time that -- that there be a million dollar tuck away here why there be mine all through these mountain that never think of stop at a million that be just a fair start well to get go say there be a even million i get just half that that leave half a million do not it now shut up a minute he command truculently as more than one man stir listen to I that be five hundred thousand to split between four of you that be over a hundred thousand for every man jack of you and that be what i call a fair split they growl in they throat at that but no man take it upon himself to speak out definitely though they glance sidewise among themselves benny who always have a thought of he own say quietly : what be you doin ' about gratton he 'll claim he share will not he and if you say he no he 'll shoot he face off will not he no say brodie he will not he pause swallow the last of he beef catch up a bottle from benny 's side and drink deeply benny afraid that this bottle too still nearly full would be break hastily snatch it back when brodie have do no say brodie heavily gratton will not talk he grow suddenly quick-spoken -- he break into a volley of accusation he tongue lend itself to such a rush of vileness that glorium shrink back cover she ear with she hand gratton steal grub when grub-stealing be the same as slit a man 's throat and what next do he plan why to make trouble to swear that benny kill a man that we be all in it to get we all hang if he can or in the pen then to grab what be ours look at he you can see it in he frog eye he be do that be what he be with a swift gesture he gun be at he shoulder gratton scramble to he foot with a choke cry glorium too have spring up sick with horror she look from brodie to gratton who be not two foot from she she see that he be panic-stricken he fear be choke he stop he heart paralyse he muscle he want to run and could not he try to speak but now not even a whisper come from between he writhe lip slowly a unshaken senseless piece of machinery brodie raise he rifle now gratton 's voice return to he a strangle cry break from he agonized soul a hand wildly outthrown catch at glorium 's sleeve you there call brodie stand aside unless you be want yours too she own heart be stop she foot be lead she understand what he say -- she know that it be to she that he speak -- but she would not believe could not believe that he mean -- _ that _ gratton be press tight to glorium seek futilely to get behind she he begin to articulate -- to beg -- to promise -- brodie fire a great reverberate roar fill the cavern glorium she brain go suddenly numb feel the grip on she arm tighten convulsively then it relax -- slowly gratton he eye bulge he mouth wide open be sink -- glorium put she hand over she eye and scream again and again she scream break from she she try to draw back to run but all she strength be go she crumple and settle down almost as gratton have do and so close to he that she brush he with she knee she feel the body twitch she leap to she foot and run blindly scream she strike against the rock wall and sink down again the wonder be that she do not swoon outright as it be she soul seem to float dizzily out of she body and through a utter dark she think that she be die as though across a vast distance she hear voice well it be the man who have do the shoot he voice truculent anybody get anything to say say it quick if you have there be a silence then a shuffling of foot then a answering voice thin and querulous it be benny he too have kill he man he have it come he say eagerly any judge would say so steal every bit of grub when steal grub be the same as cut a man 's throat just like you say brodie he have it come you do right you jarrold demand brodie get anything to say again silence then again a voice jarrold 's say hurriedly : no benny 's right he have it come damn fool and you brail and you tony get anything to say talk lively brail and tony like the other before they be quick to excuse brodie 's act they speak briefly and relapse into silence then begin far away and come closer with the speed of a onrushing hurricane glorium hear heavy foot crunch in the dirt and gravel a hard hand grip she shoulder jerk she to she foot you friend say brodie what have you get to say about it she hang limp in he powerful hand speechless he drag she closer to the firelight peer at she with he red-flecked eye do not forget who she be another voice be say steve jarrold 's remember what i tell you it be as though he pride himself on the fact that he alone know she for gaynor 's daughter and from it derive a sort of ownership of she for while the other have never catch a glimpse of she until now he have fill he eye with she before we get to think this out she come along with king get enough of he and switch to gratton that be like a woman brodie let she slip down and turn away from she he mood be not so soon for a woman see she keep she mouth shut he say threateningly if she be not get sense enough for that she be not get sense to go on live benny stoop and feast he eye on she then straighten up he turn to jarrold with nod approval she skin anything _ i _ ever see he admit in some strange way it seem to glorium that both benny and brodie have consign she to jarrold as though they admit he prior claim as though among these three she be look upon as the property of one she struggle to she foot do not let she go say brodie that be all i get to say about she right now she make a uncertain step toward the mouth of the cave jarrold move at she side she go faster he put he hand on she do not you hear what he say he ask she try to break away and run he hold she one clear thought and only one form in she mind as she have never long for anything in she life she yearn for mark king mark she scream mark king save I jarrold clap a big dirty hand over she mouth he put a wiry arm about she and lift she and carry she back to the fireside none of that he growl in she ear she shrink away as she feel the tensing of he arm and be conscious of the contact of he rag-clothed body she grow silent cower she hear a sound of something drag and could not hide she fascinate eye thus she watch as brodie grip the slack of gratton 's coat shoulder and shove the body out into the snow she even mark how the living man spit after the dead go to the coyote he mutter they be you kind glorium know that if she take a step jarrold would clutch she again so she stand very still brodie come back and throw some wood on the fire and squat down over the provision seem to be take stock of they perhaps he be but strengthen he heart digest the evidence of the case assure himself again after the accomplished fact that the deed be just still squat he drink again this time from the bottle which have be gratton 's as he tilted it up she see that it be two-third full when he put it down with a long sigh and wipe he wet mouth it be not over half-full he brood over the fire he give no sign of notice she let I go she say to jarrold i be sick i would die here please let I go jarrold shift and look to he companion benny shake he head there be not no hurry he state judicially what sort be she steve she come up to gaynor 's place along with gratton answer jarrold as though he know all about she he be crazy go on she crazy enough to want to marry

easier say jarrold benny come up and touch brodie on the shoulder the squat man start and scowl benny stoop and whisper brodie get up heavily and together the two withdraw go further back in the cave they talk but glorium could not catch the word she see the flare of one match after the other as they fall to smoke the smell of strong tobacco come to she she look appealingly to jarrold he sidle closer standing between she and the open i 'll pay you a thousand dollar when i get back to san francisco she whisper eagerly ten thousand if you 'll let I go now jarrold ponder he stupid little eye steady and unwinking on she a thousand dollar he return slowly would not do I any good if i never get it : as i would not if none of we get clear of this damn ' snow neither would ten i and it would

since life connote hope there come a faint flicker of light and with it come a sudden compelling swift longing if she might set they to quarrel over she to send a snarling man at a snarling man 's throat she hand drop to she side and be clench she lift she chin with all that strength that lay in the innermost soul of glorium king she strive to drive she great fear out of she eye to hide it from

be drive to blow -- she must somehow set they at each other ' throat it be so hard to think at all yet she could think forward to one occurrence only that could give she respite and a frail chance for freedom : if they would only fight as in some dim instinctive way it be give she to understand that such man would fight once a wrathful blow have be give and take -- if the other would only watch they and not she if she could come to one of the rifle -- or outside -- she turn to jarrold she gather herself for the final supreme effort she make she eye grow bright through sheer force of will she

she a whisper in she ear that become a song in she heart the snow that have cling to the pine mute they needle and still they branch have drop on during the day now the night wind which drive the cloud linger through the pine top and set they sway gently in the vast harmonic rhythm which be like the surge of a distant ocean the everlasting whisper of the pine that ancient hushed voice which through the countless century have never be still save when briefly silence by the snow which have bear its message to glorium when on that first day she go with mark king into the mountain which many

breast press on with she own mate look fearlessly ahead daring what might come not lag behind the man rather ready to lead the way should he falter it be a glorious thing to have blood like that in she vein it be the finest thing in the world to be a woman like that woman she step down into the packed snow at the base of the cliff here she stand look up and down the gorge for any sign of benny or of the italian or of any other of brodie 's crowd who might be alive and astir but she see no one even gratton 's body where it have be tumble out into the snow be hide she hear the deep quiet breathing of the pine the canon stream rush and gurgle and babble shout as it leap over fail fling spray which the moonlight and starlight make over into jewel glorium work at she fuel-gathering working in the snow until she hand and foot be nearly frozen but she heart be warm though she make haste and be ever watchful and on the alert she mind fill with such thought as have never come troop into it before fragmentary they be like bright bit spin about a common center she look up at the wide sky and it be bear in upon she that the universe be mighty and wonderful and infinite she look into she own heart and see where she have be small and silly and finite she see that the snow-covered ridge stretch endlessly be like a concrete symbol of that infinity which extend above and about she that they be clothe in beauty she know that when mark king be make whole again and have forgive she and they stand together hand lock in hand she would have no fear any more for he mountain but rather a great abiding love she see that she life have be empty that only love could fill it love and service such as she be render to-night pretty clothes dress suit do not matter and strong loyal heart do matter to-night she would rather have mark king hold she in he arm and say i love you than to have all of the red gold in all of the world three time that night she make the trip up and down the cliff bring wood at the end though near exhaustion she sink down by the fire for but a few minute the bear meat be boil and bubble she pour off a little of the broth cool it and then as she have give king the coffee she force some of the strong soup between he tooth she touch he cheek and dare hope that it be not so icy cold she chafe he foot and wrap they again in a not blanket and then with all of she cover give to he she draw a coat about she shoulder and sit down at he side on the edge of he blanket and here throughout the night she sit doze and wake rise again and again to keep the fire burning she start up to find it full day she have be asleep she head against he knee the fire be die down she jump up and replenish it set the broth back among the coal king lay as he have lie

out the sun be shine and oh the glory of the sun after these long dark day the sky be a deep serene perfect blue the snow shone and glitter and sparkle everywhere down in the gorge she see a little bird in quick flight it skim the water it light on a rock in the spray it put back its head and seem to be burst with a joy of song a water-ouzel a friend from out a happy past -- to gloria it seem that the world be full of promise all day long she minister to king go back and forth tirelessly since love and hope inspire every step she make none of brodie 's man have come she feel a strange confidence that they would not come they be afraid of king as jackal be afraid of a lion further they do not know that he be wound she think little of they have much else to think of she wind king 's watch guess at the time she judge it sensible to force a little nourishment upon he at regular interval and bring he he broth every two hour at a little before noon glorium stoop over the fire start erect and whirl about king 's eye be open she run to he drop on she knee beside he catch up he hand whispering : mark oh mark -- thank god he look at she strangely there be a puzzle bewildered expression in he eye he strive to move and again look at she with that strange bewilderment she see he lip move -- he want to say something to ask something and desert now by all of that magnificent strength on which he have always lean be as weak as a baby do not try to talk mark she cry softly please not yet you be better everything be all right she give he hand a last squeeze and hurry back to the fire he eye still shadow-filled follow she curiously she come back to he with cup and spoon this he could understand he open he lip for the spoon he accept what she give he and when she have

do not come he manage a strange shadowy smile with he bloodless lip and in another moment have sink again into that heavy sleep that be so like death when next two hour later she again bring he broth he stir at she touch and awake this time he eye clear swiftly he remember the other awakening and she word he look at she long and searchingly and she understand what lay back of that look he be wonder how she manage how she endure to care for they both how without he active aid she withstand hardship and this time she smile at he i have be dine sumptuously on bear steak she tell he lightly

glorying in the certainty that already he be stronger but even yet he weakness be so great that before she have speak a dozen sentence he be asleep again clearly even to glorium if but a little more blood have ebb out of the wounded side he would never have awaken clearly to glorium triumphant it have be she who have hold he back from death she gloria king alone have fight the great grim battle hers be the victory for at last she know with she brain as all along she have know in she heart that it be to be victory so the hour pass for the most part king sleep lapse into the deep stupor of a drugged man but at time he stir restlessly with slowly return strength he wound pained he in he sleep he mutter glorium watch he wince as she see he brow contract and see how he try to shift he body as though to pull away from something that hurt he \* \* \* \* \* king be awake awakening he try to move he utter weakness like a great weight bear down upon he hold he powerless but he mind slowly free itself from the shadow of sleep be suddenly very clear he could turn he head a little it be late afternoon outside the sun be still shine for a patch of light lay at the side of the canvas flap at first he do not see glorium but he eye quest until at last they find she she lay by the fire she head upon she arm sleep the little huddle body look weary beyond expression for a long time he haggard eye remain with she she lay on the rock without a blanket he hand move weakly there be blanket under he blanket cover he he foot be wrap in a blanket he remember that a long long time ago she have say to he : it be last night all this long long time he have have all the blanket he look again at glorium at the fire he see wood pile near by for many minute he puzzle the matter in the end it be obvious even to a man as sick as king that she must have go for wood perhaps more than once he close he eye and lay very still he know now that he have be desperately hurt that wound he fight with brodie have bring he very near a weakness from blood loss that be pale twin to death and yet he be alive and warm he have have broth and blanket and the fire have be keep blaze he manage to slip a hand inside he shirt before he finger find it he know that the bandage be there glorium have do all this glorium whom he have strike ever since that blow the one act of he life which he would have give so much to have undo he have be ashamed he have rejoice in he battle with the man who have threaten glorium with worse than death rejoice that in some way he might make reparation but now begin to understand all that glorium have do for he how great be the sacrifice she have make for he lie unconscious of all she do it seem to he that the thing that he have do be a very small thing set in the scale against she own act he want to get up and go to she to put he blanket about she to play the man 's part and protect and shelter but he could not so much as raise he voice to call she to he ever since that blow upbraid himself he have say : she be only a little terrify girl and you be a brute to she and now he think wonderingly : after that she have work for you have nurse you have save the worthless life in you when she should have let you die again he eye fly open now they cling to she with a strange look in they bear of many emotion glorium as though she feel he eye upon she stir rise push the hair back from she eye and come quickly to he and as she come she smile she go down on she knee beside he and take he hand in she two and hold it tight she have never see in he eye a look like the one now burn in they she could not understand its mute message but she speak softly : everything be all right mark and you be better every time you wake he lip strive to frame word she bent close to they and hear he wonder whisper : every -- thing -- all right yes thank god she whisper back to he everything in all the wide wide world no he could not understand that she see perplexity in he eye now but she do not mean to let he talk yet and it be time for broth again but again he be whisper : blanket -- yours -- yes mark after you have have you nourishment when i need they but when he have take he cup of hot broth he slip off to sleep again and glorium smile a tender smile sit by she fire watch he as a mother watch a sick baby who the doctor have just tell she will live _ chapter xxxii _ that night glorium listen now to king 's breathing now to the crackling of she fire grow restless restless again and again she go to look out into the quiet moonlight night across the glitter expanse of pure white glistening snow it be the restlessness of one who have take a giant determination who but await impatiently for the time to do what she be bent upon do in she heart be still that new-born gladness in she bosom there be still something singing like the liquid voice of a bird it have sing for the first time when first she have minister to king when she have understand what love 's service be when she have go down the cliff for firewood when because of she tireless nursing she have be reward by he open eye as the hour wear on it have grow into a chant triumphant she glorium have live to do something that be noble and unselfish and brave she glorium have be unafraid and unswerving she have save a man 's life and that life be mark king 's she have make amends she have set she foot unfalteringly in a new trail throughout she be she be aglow with the consciousness of one who have gladly do love 's labor now she wait only for the hour when again king must have he broth she give it to he smile at he command he to go back to sleep promising to talk with he in the morning and then when again he breathe with the quiet regularity of one sleep she go eagerly about she task now at she hour of need she be buoy up by a great and wonderful confidence that she could not fail thus far she have accomplish each duty as it have stand before she and from success achieve grow the new faith that in to-night 's task perhaps the supreme and final labor she would succeed again they must have more meat to-morrow or the next day at latest for the steak which she have eat and the strong broth to maintain and rebuild strength in king have cut deeply into they supply and she know mark king well enough to be very certain that the moment he could summon strength enough to command he totter body to stand on two leg he would go now while he be still too weak to observe greatly what go on about he and while he sleep most of the time it be for she to be before he fortunately -- and be not all omen bright with hope -- it have not snow since king make he kill she could follow in the trail he have make and it would lead she unerringly to the spot where he have leave the rest of the meat she have everything ready rifle small packet of food knife even match and strip tear from the sack for she foot down in the gorge clutch she rifle she stand look listen always the thought of benny and the other man be on the rim of she consciousness and fear be a basic and elemental emotion but though the moon set forth all detail in clear relief against the snow there be no man in sight and in the intense determination possess she she throttle down all fear-thought she cling with a deep fervor to the thought that she and mark king have put disaster behind they that ahead lay hope and happiness that god be with she and about she and that all danger be go down the canon she see the broken uneven snow where brodie and he man have leave they track irregular trail up which gratton have come down which benny and the italian have flee upward along the gorge be one deep straight path wide and hard pack the track of mark king 's crude snow-shoe into this she step think even at the time how even mark king 's trail be characteristic of he and different from that of the other man it look purposeful and confident and like the man himself drive straight on there be a sense of comfort in tread where he have trodden before she the world sleep but its quiet breathing she seem to hear as the air draw through the pine she turn up the gorge a tiny dark figure in a immense white wilderness the star shine and she love they they be like bright companionable candle the moon shed its soft lustre and she love it it thrust shadow back and drive out the dark the night be all quiet splendor and peace and serenity the snow be crisp crunch underfoot sunny day have thaw clear cold night have freeze and the crust have begin to form before she have go a dozen foot she discover this and its importance to she where king 's weight on the snow-shoe along a twice-travelled trail have pack the snow and where now the sun and cold have do they work there be a crust which upbore she slight weight she could walk swiftly there be to be no more flounder she could run and run she do when she have crest the first ridge and have start down the far side it be like fly the crisp air cut she glowing cheek she blood leap along she vein she breathe deeply a great uplifting elation bear she along love -- god be love -- smooth the way before she the star run with she the great blaze star to which again and again she lift she eye they speak to she they come close to she when she stop rest they be all about she bend down and she be lift up among they fervor and the ecstasy of the hour in which be do to the uttermost forgetful of pettiness and selfishness and cowardice -- she pray mutely that she be do with they for ever that never again would she be such a woman as gratton have be a man -- make she over into a radiant glorious glorium the night stamp itself upon she for all time out of the night she draw as one draw air into he lung a new faith that be akin to the man 's whom she serve for one can not be alone with the star and be unmoved by they they be serene with eternity refulgent with the perfect beauty of a perfect creation eloquent to the heart of man and woman of true value under the field of they vastitude confront by they infinity glorium like thousand before understand that man in fevered time be prone to turn to false god gus ingle 's gold -- she own gold one day -- be a thing to smile at or at best not a thing to expend wildly for gown and gown and shoe and stocking and limousine to-night glorium feel that she have have she fill of vanity like those that she be do with they that if for every moan and agony and slow death and thought of envy gus ingle 's gold have bring into the world she could create a smile here and a hope fulfil there and a glow yonder she would ask nothing else of the yellow dirt for dirt or rock or dross it be and that be as clear as starlight if she hand but lay in the hand of mark king what do gold matter or dress -- or what people think or say of she or he a strange little smile touch she lip i love you she whisper as though mark be with she -- as in she soul he be have there not be a great glowing love in she heart she would have be afraid but there be no room for fear have she not feel that he be with she and that god be with she she must have feel a unutterable dreary loneliness but she be upborne at every step and glory in every exertion and exertion until she come close to the limit of endurance be to be hers that white night hers the knowledge of supreme endeavor on and on she go across the immense glisten smooth field through which the trail ahead be the only scar through grove of black pine whisper whisper whisper down into shadow-filled canon out into the open again up and down and on and on a tiny dot upon the endless waste fatigue come upon she suddenly when she have forget to save she strength and have go over-fast she rest lie on she back she eye close she open she eye she see the star she rise and go on she have go mile how many she could not guess always after for a little while she have drop down wearily she rise again and go on she learn that though beat down one might rise again that be mark king 's way it would be she way despite the rag about she boot she foot be soon dangerously cold she pass into the embrace of a forest of black tree cast blacker shadow they branch seem motionless but they sing to she with hushed voice and always there be the trail king have make lead she on where he have go before she follow where he have make slow progress seek game and break trail she go swiftly on the packed snow so in the full splendor of the moon she come at last to the final ridge whence look down into the canon she see the end of she trail : hang from a bent pine sapling be what she know must be he bear down the steep slope she go half slide half rolling in the bed of the ravine she land softly in the drift here she rest sit in a nest of snow and before she have stir to begin the last short span of she journey there come suddenly out of the silence a strange quivering cry burst out upon she a sob throbbing scream a woman cry glorium aghast a woman in a agony of terror she think or a lose soul the wander spirit of the dead or god know what impossible thing sudden terror leap out upon she striking like a knife into she heart fear banish all this time surprise she and clutch at she throat and paralyse she muscle blind panic grip she then come the pierce scream again and with it enlightenment and glorium sink back seem to melt into the snow about she yonder just upon the next ridge where the moonlight carve in fine detail the outline of a big bare boulder stand the thing that have scream in this light its great body be weirdly magnify so that the entire length of seven or eight foot appear to glorium 's frightened eye twice that long-bodied and lithe small-headed and merciless steel-muscled and chisel-clawed the big cat in silhouette twitch its restless tail back and forth nervously and from snarl jaw send forth its almost human call to cut across vast still distance gloria draw back and back where she crouch she body press into the snow-bank in a panicky desire to hide the big cat have smell the meat she guess swiftly when it leap upward seek to snatch down the swing weight or clamber up the pine then she must spring up and run run as she have never run in she life away from this terrible murderous thing back to king unconscious of cold and wet she cower and wait scarce breathing she see how the big beast put up its head and sniff do it in reality smell the meat or have it sense she presence for what seem a very long time the gaunt-bodied animal stand as still as the rock beneath it then silent and swift it turn and like a cat at home leap down from a table drop into the shadow at the base of the rock and be lose to glorium 's sight in a little hollow she wait she eye stare again all of a sudden she see it move with the stealthy caution which be its birthright it appear fleetingly a score of foot lower on the steep slope the body and its shadow a twin for stealthy silence go in a flash reappear once more still lower on the slope and just beyond the pine saple it be come on fascinate glorium sit like stone with never a thought of the rifle lie across she knee the mountain-lion leap downward softly from stage to stage of the canon-side pause under the pine lift its head and send forth again its hunger-cry all this time glorium sit breathless the fear-fascination still hold she powerless she watch the animal crouch and gather its strength and hurl its lean body upward the lion fall back the rip claw have miss the meat by some two or three foot and glorium hear the low rumble growl again it spring again it miss and then for a weary time of silence it sit still its head back its eye on the desire meal in the moonlight glorium see the glistening saliva from the half-parted jaw but in the end feline craft find the way and the cat set its paw against the tree trunk and begin to climb limb break under the two hundred pound of weight the bark be tear under slip paw but upward the sinuous body writhe swiftly now it would come to king 's kill king 's glorium start this be mark 's kill : he have stalk it he have plough many mile through deep snow to get it to get it for she as well as for he to keep the life in she -- now without it king would die and now the lion be go to take it while she watch and do nothing oh god help I she spring to she foot she jerk up she rifle and fire at the black bulk crawl upward in the pine it shall not have mark 's meat it shall not at the first shot the mountain-lion drop through crash branch she have shoot it -- she have drive a bullet through its heart god have hear she that be she first wild thought but in a flash she see that it be on its foot again and that with red mouth snarl it have swing about face she she see the cruel white tooth wet and glistening incoherently gloria cry out again sick and shake with terror in another moment she would have the lean powerful body leap upon she she fire again and again take no time for aim as fast as she could work the lever and pull the trigger she be tremble so that it be all that she could do to hold the gun at all she pray and call on mark and fire all at once never do bullet fly wider of the mark but never do the roar of explode shell do better service the lion though ravenous be not yet starve to the degree to whip it to the supreme desperation of attack a human being and defy a rifle it whirl and go flash across the snow seek the shadow go in the drift vanish glorium gasp stare after its wild flight a paralysed moment and then run to the tree where the bear hang she be shake like a leaf in a storm she be still terrify fill with horror at the thought that at any second the lean body might come flash back upon she but through the emotion storm through she there live on that one determination that would live while she live : that be mark 's meat and she be go to save it for he she begin climb the young pine she fight wildly to get up into its branch she be handicap by the rifle which she cling to desperately she get the gun in a crotch above she head she pull herself upward she slip and tear the skin of hand and arm but hasten frantically she climb up and up she get the rifle into she hand again nearly drop it thrust it above she jam it into a fork of a limb and keep on climb at last she be where she could reach out and touch the swing carcass with king 's keen-edged butcher knife she hack and cut at the frozen meat pant with every effort the task seem endless the bear swing away from she a branch break under she foot and she almost fall she be sob aloud brokenly before it be do the tear roll down she cheek but at last there be the thud of the fall meat below she it lay on the snow crust in wild haste she snatch she rifle hold it in one hand afraid to let it slip out of she grasp for a moment cast a last fearful look in the direction whither the lion have go she begin slip down and in another moment with the precious burden catch up with the gun in she arm she be run back up the ridge she foot in king 's trail _ the home trail _ she look behind she at every step picture the snarl cat spring out from every shadow start upward from every drift and snow-bank but she clutch she meat tight and struggle on up the slope she whole body be shake she close she eye overcome with faintness there be a faint wind stir and it cut like a knife probe through she garment where they be damp she shiver and struggle on and on she feel that she could run all night without stop she stumble and fall and arise panting and sobbing and run on she no longer look behind she : she have fall when she do that again and again from far behind she come the clear merciless scream of the mountain-lion time pass half-hour or hour or two hour she have little idea time itself be a nightmare of run fall rise staggering run again until the blood pound in she temple drum in she ear the cry come again as near as before -- nearer throughout the night as she struggle on she could always fancy the stealthy silent foot follow she keep time with she own cautious now would its caution slowly subside as its hunger grow and as she always flee from it the thought come to she that such a menace would follow one day after day that it would wait and wait that in the end it know its time would come when sleep or exhaustion break down its prey 's guard then it would leap and strike she rifle have grow a heart-breaking weight until it seem that it would drag she arm from they socket to hold it up the pack of meat on she back be like lead she wonder if king have miss she if he be awake and wonder at she absence she wonder if he would miss she soon how soon at the first glint of dawn would he begin to see that she be at least and at last try well she have try though she die still she have try she be cold to the bone she tooth chatter she body quake yet she keep on she fall she lay with the tear of exhaustion roll down she face she struggle to get to she foot she fall again but always she rise and always she keep on and so in the fulness of time after long frightful hellish hour § he come to the last terror of the night the new day be bright on the mountain top when she feel at first a dull sort of surprise and then a sudden stimulating gladness note the familiar look of the ridge ahead yonder the cave would be the cave and king success and rest she straighten up a little brushing she hand across she strain eye make sure that she be right she hear the insistent scream behind she but now she do not heed it for in front of she stock-still in the trail be a man it be benny to-night she have thrill to a ecstasy descend from the star well up in she own heart and she have shiver with fear and have drop with weariness akin to despair now suddenly all emotion be upgather into searing anger she thought be : he will take the meat from I the meat i have bring for mark she grow rigid in she track she jerk up she rifle in front of she she tired eye harden she have go to the limit of endurance in a labor of love she have succeed and now she would fight for what she have bring back then she note that benny have not see she though he be in full view on the ridge he have have no eye for she he be stoop she see that he have a small pack on he back food no doubt on the ground by he be a second pack something in a crash sack benny be struggle to lift it to he shoulder it must be very heavy glorium draw back hastily glance about she find the only hiding-place offer and slip behind the big rock presently benny come on she hear he from a distance he be talk to himself excitedly jabber broken fragment of sentence twice break into he hideous dry cackle of laughter she shiver he utterance sound mad and mad they be perhaps he drug have run out certainly for a nervous man there have be ample cause for jangling nerve he jabber constantly he muttering at last come to she in jumbled word as benny draw on he be talk about gold and he chuckle he mention name brodie 's and jarrold 's and gratton 's and another name and he chuckle again gloria peer cautiously from the shelter of she rock he be very near now struggle with the smaller pack and he rifle and the heavy bundle in he sack she think that he be go to pass without see she but just as he pass abreast of she hiding-place something prompt benny to jerk up he head he see she and stop suddenly she see he eye and she know on the instant that if the man be not stark mad at least he be not entirely sane she lift she rifle cold all over if he come another step nearer she would shoot it be mine benny shriek at she mine i tell you he break into a run pass she leave the trail flounder down the ridge the shortest way he rifle encumber he she see it fall into the snow while benny clutch he gunny-sack in both arm stumble on he fall he rise shriek curse she watch fascinate the pack on he back slip around in front of he benny tear at it and curse it and hurl it from he still hug he gold he be go far down the steep slope glorium shudder and step back into she own trail she could hear benny cursing faintly like a echo come another cry across the ridge the cry of a starve cat _ chapter xxxiii _ mark king awaken to a sensation of pierce cold in he weakened condition the chill strike deep the pain of it sore in he wound he move a little to draw he blanket closer about he and as a awake impression find that he strength even though slowly be surely return to he he be still terribly weak but thank god -- and glorium -- that hideous faintness in which he have be unable to stir hand or foot or to speak above a whisper have pass he fill he lung with a deep and grateful breath of satisfaction in a day or two he would be able to carry on again to do he part he turn he head lift it a trifle already he have think of glorium and now he seek she the fire have burn down to a handful of glowing coal glorium then must be asleep for that too he be grateful he have but faint remembrance and dim knowledge of what task must have fall to she lot but he mind active from the moment he eye fly open be quick to understand that the burden have fall upon she shoulder and that she must have be in dire need of rest and sleep he could not see she anywhere no doubt she lay in the shadowy dark beyond the die fire he lay back stare up into the gloom above he it be thin day be come or have come already a day with sunshine they could go out on the crust by the time that he be able to be about -- then he remember the blanket last night he have have all of they glorium 's as well as he own he have want to make she take she cover and she have put he off and he have go to sleep forget he stir again hastily he hand grope even he foot move he have they yet he and hers and she have sleep through the cold night with no cover while he never wake until now have lie warm and comfortable he struggle to turn on he side and get himself raise a little despite the pain from the exertion seek she she must be freeze -- glorium be not in the cave he sink back sure of that for she should be sleep close by the fire then she have go down again for wood he frown and lay stare upward again gloria bring wood while he lay here like a confound log he grow nervously restive at the thought it be unthinkable that she should do work like that he see she in he mind struggle with the unaccustomed labor and always he see she as he have first see she a fragile-looking girl a girl with sweet little hand as soft as rise petal he remember she as he have see she that first day a vision of loveliness in she fluffy pink dress she skin like the skin of a baby she eye the soft tender gray eye of the girl to whom he have give he heart without reservation the glorious glorium all slender delicacy like a little mountain flower the glorium for whom it have be he duty and he high privilege to labor he must fight to get he strength back to get on he foot again to save she from such toil as be no woman 's work in the world certainly never the work for a girl like glorium he hear a sound at the cave 's mouth glorium be come back he find no word with which to greet she but lay very still wait for she to come in a emotion of which he be ashamed and yet which be infinitely sweet sweep over he : it be so wonderful a thing to have glorium come to he nurse he put she hand so tenderly on he a thrill shoot down he faintly stir pulse as already he fancy she stealing softly to he side so he wait and when she come where he could at last see she watch she set she gun down at first he wonder at that poor little glorium he think take she rifle with she when she go down for wood frightened and yet strong-hearted enough to go in spite of fear she come on not to he but to the smoulder coal she have turn toward he but no doubt think he still asleep he watch she still know that presently she would come await she coming and again he be perplexed he do not understand why glorium walk like that he have never see she walk so before she have always be so light of foot so graceful -- so like a fairy creature scarcely touch the ground now she foot drag she grope uncertainly she be like one go suddenly dizzy she drop down by the coal she face in she hand the light be bad he could hardly see she now he hear a sigh that end in a sob she rise oh so wearily he see she sway as she walk she be throw wood on the fire it catch a flame flare out other flame follow with they merry crackling and leap light and now he see glorium 's face it be draw and haggard it have be wash with tear she eye look enormous and unnaturally bright he see she hair it be in wild disarray a tumble of disorder he see that she have sack wrap about she lagging foot that she clothes be tear that she sleeve be ragged that she arm be cover with long scratch he first thought make he body tense with anger be that he have not come in time to save she from brodie 's hand what be gloria do struggle with something on she back something which be tie across she shoulder she get it free it fall close to the fire play over by the light of the flame he crane he neck and see it be a great chunk of bear meat -- he could see bit of the hide still on it he could not understand not yet all that he could do be stare at she and wonder and grope confusedly for the explanation it be clear that something be wrong with glorium she drop down by the fire she slump forward she lay she face upon she cross arm he could see the frail body shake -- he could hear she sudden wild sob the truth come upon he at last dawn slowly slowly gloria it be a gasp of more than amazement consternation be in he heart _ glorium _ she lift she head and sit up he see she great wide-open eye and the tear gush from they she fight to control herself a sob in she throat she rise and come toward he in strange wildly uncertain step gloria you -- sh mark you must not -- but he could not lie still he lift himself upon he elbow and look at she with wonder eye she stand over he look on the verge of collapse slowly she come down to he half kneel half fall my god he cry hoarsely you go for my bear _ you do it _ she try to smile at he and into he own eye there break a sudden gush of tear you wonderful wonderful wonderful glorium he cry out there be no girl in all the world could have do that -- there be no girl like you she hand be quest he he catch it and grip it with all the strength in he he hurt she and at last with the pain she smile break through glorium -- mark can you -- not so soon but some day -- forgive I she find only a faint whisper with which to answer he she eye be as hungry as he can you forgive mark and now when they eye cling together as they hand be already clinging each be marvel that the other could forgive and love one who have err so the end end of project gutenberg 's the everlasting whisper by jackson gregory
