autobiography either some day i may wish to write of myself and i will then speak without any disguise or feigned name though it be true that i have lend some idea to my hero he individuality he character and the circumstance of he life be all he own and i have try to give a picture of the inward labyrinth where a weak spirit wander feel its way uncertain sensitive and impressionable but sincere and ardent in the cause of truth some chapter of the book have a family likeness to the meditation of we old french moralist and the stoical essay of the end of the xvith century at a time

the novel and a note explain the original title _ l'un contre tous _ this somewhat ironical name be suggest -- with a difference -- by la boëtie 's _ le contr ' un _ but it must not be suppose that the author entertain the extravagant idea of set one man in opposition to all other he only wish to summon the personal conscience to the most urgent conflict of we time the struggle against the herd-spirit -rrb- this book be not write about the war though the shadow of the war lie over it my theme be that the individual soul have be swallow up and submerge in the soul of the multitude and in my opinion such a event be of far greater importance to the future of the race than the pass supremacy of one nation i have leave question of policy in the background intentionally as i think they should be reserve for special study no matter what cause may be assign as the origin of the war no matter what theses support they nothing in the world can excuse the abdication of individual judgment before general opinion the universal development of democracy vitiate by a fossilized survival the outrageous reason of state have lead the mind of europe to hold as a article of faith that there can be no higher ideal than to serve the community this community be then define as the state i venture to say that he who make himself the servant of a blind or blinded nation -- and most of the state be in this condition at the present day -- do not truly serve it but lower both it and himself for in general a few man incapable of understand the complexity of the people force thought and act upon they in harmony with they own passion and interest by means of the falsehood of the press and the implacable machinery of a centralised government he who would be useful to other must first be free

the stupid unitarianism of socialist -- by all these different road we be return to the gregarious life man have slowly drag himself out of the warm slime but it seem as if the long effort have exhaust he he be let himself slip backward into the collective mind and the choke breath of the pit already rise about he you who do not believe that the cycle of man be accomplish you must rouse yourselve and dare to separate yourselve from the herd in which you be drag along every man worthy of the name should learn to stand alone and do he own thinking even in conflict with the whole world sincere thought even if it do run counter to that of other be still a service to mankind for humanity demand that those who love she should oppose or if necessary rebel against she you will not serve she by flattery by debase you conscience and intelligence but rather by defend they integrity from the abuse of power for these be some of she voice and if you betray yourself you betray she also rr

glance full of simple pleasure pass from one to the other of he three auditor sure of meet the reflection of he own happiness he wife pauline follow the flight of he thought with difficulty after the third phrase anything read aloud make she feel drowsy and the affair of she household take on a absurd importance one might say that the voice of the reader make they chirp like bird in a cage it be in vain that she try to follow on clerambault 's lip and even to imitate with she own the word whose meaning she no longer understand she eye mechanically note a hole in the cloth she finger pick at the crumb on the table she mind fly back to a troublesome bill till as she husband 's eye seem to catch she in the act hastily snatch at the last word she have hear she go into rapture over a fragment of verse -- for she could never quote poetry accurately what be that agénor do repeat that last line how beautiful it be little rise she daughter frowned and maxime the grown son be annoyed and say impatiently : you be always interrupt mamma clerambault smile and pat he wife 's hand affectionately he have marry she for love when he be young poor and unknown and together they have go through year of hardship she be not quite on he intellectual level and the difference do not diminish with advance year but clerambault loved and respect he helpmate and she strive without much success to keep step with she great man of whom she be so proud he be extraordinarily indulgent to she he be not a critical nature -- which be a great help to he in life in spite of innumerable error of judgment but

a wild-growing thicket in a city square maxime be amuse by all this know what it be worth he be a good-looking boy of nineteen with bright laughing eye and in the parisian surroundings he have be quick to acquire the gift of rapid humorous observation dwelling on the outside view of man and thing more than on idea even in those he love nothing ridiculous escape he but it be without ill-nature clerambault smile at the youthful impertinence which do not diminish maxime 's admiration for he father but rather add to its flavor a boy in pari would tweak the good lord by the beard by way of show affection rosine be silent accord to she habit it be not easy to know she thought as she listen bent forward she hand fold and she arm lean on the table some nature seem make to receive like the earth which open itself silently to every seed many seed fall and remain dormant none can tell which will bring forth fruit the soul of the young girl be of this kind she face do not reflect the word of the reader as do maxime 's mobile feature but the slight flush on she cheek and the moist glance of she eye under they droop lid show inward ardor and feeling she look like those florentine picture of the virgin stir by the magical salutation of the archangel clerambault see it all and as he glance around he little circle he eye rest with special delight on the fair bend head which seem to feel he look on this July evening these four people be unite in a bond of affection and tranquil happiness of which the central point be the father the idol of the family he know that he be they idol and by a rare exception this knowledge do not spoil he for he have such joy in loving so much affection to spread far and wide that it seem only natural that he should be love in return he be really like a elderly child after a life of ungilded mediocrity he have but recently come to be know and though the one experience have not give he pain he delight in the other he be over fifty without seem to be aware of it for if there be some white thread in he big fair moustache -- like a ancient gaul 's -- he heart be as young as those of he child instead of go with the stream of he generation he meet each new wave the best of life to he be the spring of youth constantly renew and he never trouble about the contradiction into which he be lead by this spirit always in reaction against that which have precede it these inconsistency be fuse together in he mind which be more enthusiastic than logical and fill by the beauty which he see all around he add to this the milk of human kindness which do not mix well with he aesthetic pantheism but which be natural to he he have make himself the exponent of noble human idea sympathise with advanced party the oppress the people -- of whom he know little for he be thoroughly of the middle-class full of vague generous theory he also adore crowd and love to mingle with they believe that in this way he join himself to the all-soul accord to the fashion at that time in intellectual circle this fashion as not infrequently happen emphasise a general tendency of the day humanity turn to the swarm-idea the most sensitive among human insect -- artist and thinker -- be the first to show these symptom which in they seem a sort of pose so that the general condition of which they be a symptom be lose sight of the democratic evolution of the last forty year have establish popular government politically but socially speak have only bring about the rule of mediocrity artist of the higher class at first oppose this level down of intelligence -- but feel themselves too weak to resist they have withdraw to a distance emphasise they disdain and they isolation they preach a sort of art acceptable only to the initiate there be nothing finer than such a retreat when one bring to it wealth of consciousness abundance of feeling and a outpouring soul but the literary group of the end of the xixth century be far remove from those fertile hermitage where robust thought be concentrate they care much more to economise they little store of intelligence than to renew it in order to purify it they have withdraw it from circulation the result be that it cease to be perceive the common life pass on its way without bother its head further leave the artist caste to wither in a make-believe refinement the violent storm at the time of the excitement about the dreyfus case do rouse some mind from this torpor but when they come out of they orchid-house the fresh air turn they head and they throw themselves into the great pass movement with the same exaggeration that they predecessor have show in withdraw from it they believe that salvation be in the people that in they be virtue even all good and though they be often thwart in they effort to get closer to they they set flow a current in the thought of europe they be proud to call themselves the exponent of the collective soul but they be not victor but vanquish the collective soul make breach in they ivory tower the feeble personality of these thinker yield and to hide they abdication from themselves they declare it voluntary in the effort to convince themselves philosopher and aesthetics forge theory to prove that the great directing principle be to abandon oneself to the stream of a unite life instead of direct it or more modestly follow one 's own little path in peace it be a matter of pride to be no longer oneself to be no longer free to reason for freedom be a old story in these democracy one glory to be a bubble toss on the flood -- some say of the race and other of the universal life these fine theory from which man of talent manage to extract receipt for art and thought be in full flower in 1914 the heart of the simple clerambault rejoice in such vision for nothing could have harmonise better with he warm heart and inaccurate mind if one have but little self-possession it be easy to give oneself up to other to the world to that indefinable providential force on whose shoulder we can throw the burden of thought and will the great current sweep on and these indolent soul instead of pursue they way along the bank find it easier to let themselves be carry where no one take the trouble to ask safe in they west it never occur to they that they civilisation could lose the advantage gain the march of progress seem as inevitable as the rotation of the earth firm in this conviction one could fold one 's arm and leave all to nature who meanwhile be wait for they at the bottom of the pit that she be digging as become a good idealist clerambault rarely look where he be go but that do not prevent he from meddle in politics in a fumble sort of way as be the mania of man of letter in he day he have he word to say right or wrong and be often entreat to speak by journalist in need of copy and fall into they trap take himself seriously in he innocent way on the whole he be a fair poet and a good man intelligent if rather a greenhorn pure of heart and weak in character sensitive to praise and blame and to all the suggestion round he he be incapable of a mean sentiment of envy or hatred and unable also to attribute such thought to other amid the complexity of human feeling he remain blind towards evil and a advocate of the good this type of writer be bear to please the public for he do not see fault in man and enhance they small merit so that even those who see through he be grateful if we can not amount to much a good appearance be a consolation and we love to be reflect in eye which lend beauty to we mediocrity this widespread sympathy which delighted clerambault be not less sweet to the three who surround he at this moment they be as proud of he as if they have make he for what one admire do seem in a sense one 's own creation and when in addition one be of the same blood a part of the object of we admiration it be hard to tell if we spring from he or he from we agénor clerambault 's wife and he two child gaze at they great man with the tender satisfied expression of ownership and he tall and high-shouldered tower over they with he glowing word and enjoy it all he know very well that we really belong to the thing that we fancy be we possession clerambault have just finish with a schilleresque vision of the fraternal joy promise in the future maxime carry away by he enthusiasm in spite of he sense of humor have give the orator a round of applause all by himself pauline noisily ask if agénor have not heated himself in speak and amid the excitement rosine silently press she lip to she father 's hand the servant bring in the mail and the evening papers but no one be in a hurry to read they the news of the day seem behind the time compare with the dazzling future maxime however take up the popular middle-class sheet and throw he eye over the column he start at the latest item and exclaim hullo war be declare no one listen to he : clerambault be dream over the last vibration of he verse rosine lose in a calm ecstasy the mother alone who could not fix she mind on anything buzz about like a fly chance to catch the last word -- maxime how can you be so silly she cry but maxime protest show he paper with the declaration of war between austrium and servium war with whom -- with servium -- be that all say the good woman as if it be a question of something in the moon maxime however persist -- _ doctus cum libro _ -- argue that from one thing to another this shock no matter how distant might bring about a general explosion but clerambault who be begin to come out of he pleasant trance smile calmly and say that nothing would happen it be only a bluff he declare like so many we have have for the last thirty year we get they regularly every spring and summer just bully and sabre-rattle people do not believe in war no one want it war have be prove to be impossible -- it be a bugbear that must be get out of the head of free democracy and he enlarged on this theme the night be calm and sweet all around familiar sound and sight the chirp of cricket in the field a glow-worm shine in the grass -- delicious perfume of honey-suckle far away the noise of a distant train the little fountain tinkle and in the moonless sky revolve the luminous track of the light on the eiffel tower the two woman go into the house and maxime tire of sit down run about the garden with he little dog while through the open window float out a air of schumann 's which rosine full of timid emotion be play on the piano clerambault leave alone throw himself back in he wicker chair glad to be a man to be alive breathing in the balm of this summer night with a thankful heart six day later clerambault have spend the afternoon in the wood and like the monk in the legend lie under a oak tree drinking in the song of a lark a hundred year might have go by he like a day he could not tear himself away till night-fall maxime meet he in the vestibule he come forward smile but rather pale and say : well papa we be in for it this time and he tell he the news the russian mobilisation the state of war in germany -- clerambault stare at he unable to comprehend he thought be so far remove from these dark folly he try to dispute the fact but the news be explicit and so they go to the table where clerambault could eat but little he seek for reason why these two crime should lead to nothing common-sense public opinion the prudence of government the repeat assurance of the socialist jaurès ' firm stand -- maxime let he talk he be think of other thing -- like he dog with he ear prick up for the sound of the night such a pure lovely night those who recall the last evening of July 1914 and the even more beautiful evening of the first day of August must keep in they mind the wonderful splendor of nature as with a smile of pity she stretch out she arm to the degraded self-devouring human race it be nearly ten o'clock when clerambault cease to talk for no one have answer he they sit then in silence with heavy heart listlessly occupy or seem to be the woman with they work clerambault with he eye but not he mind on a book maxime go out on the porch and smoke lean on the railing and look down on the sleep garden and the fairy-like play of the light and shadow on the path the telephone bell make they start someone be call clerambault who go slowly to answer half-asleep and absent so that at first he do not understand hullo be that you old man as he recognize the voice of a brother-author in paris telephone he from a newspaper office still he could not seem to understand i do not hear -- jaurès what about jaurèsoh my god maxime full of a secret apprehension have listen from a distance he run and catch the receiver from he father 's hand as clerambault let it drop with a despairing gesture hullo hullo what do you say jaurès assassinate as exclamation of pain and anger cross each other on the wire maxime make out the detail which he repeat to he family in a tremble voice rosine have lead clerambault back to the table where he sit down completely crush like the classic fate the shadow of a terrible misfortune settle over the house it be not only the loss of he friend that chill he heart -- the kind gay face the cordial hand the voice which drive away the cloud -- but the loss of the last hope of the threaten people with a touch child-like confidence he feel jaurès to be the only man who could avert the gathering storm and he fall like atla the sky would crumble maxime rush off to the station to get the news in pari promise to come back later in the evening but clerambault stay in the isolate house from which in the distance could be see the far-off phosphorescence of the city he have not stir from the seat where he have fall stupified this time he could no longer doubt the catastrophe be come be upon they already madame clerambault beg he to go to bed but he would not listen to she he thought be in ruin he could distinguish nothing steady or constant could not see any order or follow a idea for the wall of he inward dwelling have fall in and through the dust which rise it be impossible to see what remain intact he fear there be nothing left but a mass of suffer at which he look with dull eye unconscious of he fall tear maxime do not come home carry away by the excitement at paris madame clerambault have go to bed but about one o'clock she come and persuade he to come up to they room where he lay down but when pauline have fall asleep -- anxiety make she sleepy -- he get up and go into the next room he groan unable to breathe he pain be so close and oppressive that he have no room to draw he breath with the prophetic hyper-sensitiveness of the artist who often live in tomorrow with more intensity than in the present moment he agonised eye and heart foresee all that be to be this inevitable war between the greatest nation of the world seem to he the failure of civilisation the ruin of the most sacred hope for human brotherhood he be fill with horror at the vision of a maddened humanity sacrifice its most precious treasure strength and genius its highest virtue to the bestial idol of war it be to he a moral agony a heart-rending communion with these unhappy million to what end and of what use have be all the effort of the age he heart seem grip by the void he feel he could no longer live if he faith in the reason of man and they mutual love be destroy if he be force to acknowledge that the credo of he life and art rest on a mistake that a dark pessimism be the answer to the riddle of the world he turn he eye away in terror he be afraid to look it in the face this monster who be there whose hot breath he feel upon he clerambault implore -- he do not know who or what -- that this might not be that it might not be anything rather than this should be true but the devour fact stand just behind the opening door through the whole night he strive to close that door at last towards morning a animal instinct begin to wake come from he do not know where which turn he despair towards the secret need of find a definite and concrete cause to fasten the blame on a man or a group of man and angrily hold they responsible for the misery of the world it be as yet but a brief apparition the first faint sign of a strange obscure imperious soul ready to break forth the soul of the multitude it begin to take shape when maxime come home for after the night in the street of pari he fairly sweat with it he very clothes the hair of he head be impregnate wear out excite he could not sit down he only thought be to go back again the decree of mobilisation be to come out that day war be certain it be necessary beneficial some thing must be put a end to the future of humanity be at stake the freedom of the world be threaten they have count on jaurès ' murder to sow dissension and raise riot in the country they mean to attack but the entire nation have rise to rally round its leader the sublime day of the great revolution be re-born clerambault do not discuss these statement he merely ask : do you think so be you quite sure it be a sort of hidden appeal he want maxime to state to redouble he assertion the news maxime have bring add to the chaos raise it to a climax but at the same time it begin to direct the distract force of he mind towards a fixed point as the first bark of the shepherd 's dog drive the sheep together clerambault have but one wish leave to rejoin the flock rub himself against the human animal he brother feel with they act with they though exhaust by sleeplessness he start in spite of he wife to take the train for pari with maxime they have to wait a long time at the station and also in the train for the track be block and the car crowd but in the common agitation clerambault find calm he question and listen everybody fraternised and not be sure yet what they think everyone feel that they think alike the same question the same trial menace they but each man be no longer alone to stand or fall and the warmth of this contact be reassure class distinction be go no more workman or gentleman no one look at you clothes or you hand they only look at you eye where they see the same flame of life wavering before the same impending death all these people be so visibly stranger to the cause of the fatality of this catastrophe that they innocence lead they like child to look elsewhere for the guilty it comfort and quiet they conscience clerambault breathe more easily when he get to pari a stoical and virile melancholy have succeed to the agony of the night he be however only at the first stage the order for general mobilisation have just be affix to the door of the _ mairy _ people read and re-read they in silence then go away without a word after the anxious waiting of the precede day with crowd around the newspaper booth people sit on the sidewalk watch for the news and when the paper be issue gathering in group to read it this be certainty it be also a relief a obscure danger that one feel approach without know when or from where make you feverish but when it be there you can take breath look it in the face and roll up you sleeve there have be some hour of deep thought while pari make ready and double up she fist then that which swell in all heart spread itself abroad the house be empty and there roll through the street a human flood of which every drop seek to melt into another clerambault fall into the midst and be swallow up all at once he have scarcely leave the station or set he foot on the pavement nothing happen there be no word or gesture but the serene exaltation of the flood flow into he the people be as yet pure from violence they know and believe themselves innocent and in these first hour when the war be virgin million of heart burn with a solemn and sacred enthusiasm into this proud calm intoxication there enter a feeling of the injustice do to they a legitimate pride in they strength in the sacrifice that they be ready to make and pity for other now part of themselves they brother they child they loved one all be flesh of they flesh closely draw together in a superhuman embrace conscious of the gigantic body form by they union and of the apparition above they head of the phantom which incarnate this union the country half-beast half-god like the egyptian sphinx or the assyrian bull but then man see only the shine eye the foot be hide she be the divine monster in whom each of the living find himself multiply the devour immortality where those about to die wish to believe they would find life super-life crown with glory she invisible presence flow through the air like wine each man bring something to the vintage he basket he bunch of grape -- he idea passion devotions interest there be many a nasty worm among the grape much filth under the trample foot but the wine be of ruby and set the heart aflame -- clerambault gulp it down greedily nevertheless he be not entirely metamorphose for he soul be not alter it be only forget as soon as he be alone he could hear it moan and for this reason he avoid solitude he persist in not return to st prix where the family usually stay in summer and reinstall himself in he apartment at pari on the fifth floor in the rue d'assas he would not wait a week or go back to help in the move he crave the friendly warmth that rise up from pari and pour in at he window any excuse be enough to plunge into it to go down into the street join the group follow the procession buy all the newspaper -- which he despise as a rule he would come back more and more demoralise anaesthetise as to what pass within he the habit of he conscience break a stranger in he house in himself -- and that be why he feel more at home out of door than in madame clerambault come back to pari with she daughter and the first evening after they arrival clerambault carry rosine off to the boulevard the solemn fervor of the first day have pass war have begin and truth be imprison the press the arch-liar pour into the open mouth of the world the poisonous liquor of its story of victory without retribution pari be deck as for a holiday the house stream with the tricolor from top to bottom and in the poorer quarter each garret window have its little penny flag like a flower in the hair on the corner of the faubourg montmartre they meet a strange procession at the head march a tall old man carry a flag he walk with long stride free and supple as if he be go to leap or dance and the skirt of he overcoat flap in the wind behind come a indistinct compact howling mass gentle and simple arm in arm -- a child carry on a shoulder a girl 's red mop of hair between a chauffeur 's cap and the helmet of a soldier chest out chin raise mouth open like black hole shout the marseillaise to right and left of the rank a double line of jail-bird face along the curbstone ready to insult any absent-minded passer-by who fail to salute the color rosine be startle to see she father fall into step at the end of the line bare-headed singing and talk aloud he draw he daughter along by the arm without notice the nervous finger that try to hold he back when they come in clerambault be still talkative and excited he keep on for hour while the two woman listen to he patiently madame clerambault hear little as usual and play chorus rosine do not say a word but she stealthily throw a glance at she father and she look be like freezing water clerambault be exciting himself he be not yet at the bottom but he be conscientiously try to reach it nevertheless there remain to he enough lucidity to alarm he at he own progress a artist yield more through he sensibility to wave of emotion which reach he from without but to resist they he have also weapon which other have not for the least reflective he who abandon himself to he lyrical impulse have in some degree the faculty of introspection which it rest with he to utilise if he do not do this he lack good-will more than power he be afraid to look too clearly at himself for fear of see a unflattering picture those however who like clerambault have the virtue of sincerity without psychological gift be sufficiently well-equipped to exercise some control over they excitability one day as he be walk alone he see a crowd on the other side of the street he cross over calmly and find himself on the opposite sidewalk in the midst of a confused agitation circle about a invisible point with some difficulty he work he way forward and scarcely be he within this human mill-wheel than he feel himself a part of the rim he brain seem turn round at the center of the wheel he see a struggle man and even before he grasp the reason for the popular fury he feel that he share it he do not know if a spy be in question or if it be some imprudent speaker who have brave the passion of the mob but as cry rise around he he realize that he yes he clerambault have shriek out : kill he a movement of the crowd throw he out from the sidewalk a carriage separate he from it and when the way be clear the mob surge on after its prey clerambault follow it with he eye the sound of he own voice be still in he ear -- he do not feel proud of himself from that day on he go out less he distrust himself but he continue to stimulate he intoxication at home where he feel himself safe little know the virulence of the plague the infection come in through the crack of the door at the window on the print page in every contact the most sensitive breathe it in on first enter the city before they have see or read anything with other a passing touch be enough the disease will develop afterwards alone clerambault withdraw from the crowd have catch the contagion from it and the evil announce itself by the usual premonitory symptom this affectionate tender-hearted man hate love to hate he intelligence which have always be thoroughly straightforward try now to trick itself secretly to justify its instinct of hatred by inverted reasoning he learn to be passionately unjust and false for he want to persuade himself that he could accept the fact of war and participate in it without renounce he pacifism of yesterday he humanitarianism of the day before and he constant optimism it be not plain sailing but there be nothing that the brain can not attain to when its master think it absolutely necessary to get rid for a time of principle which be in he way it find in these same principle the exception which violate they while confirm the rule clerambault begin to construct a thesis a ideal -- absurd enough -- in which these contradiction could be reconcile : war against war war for peace for eternal peace the enthusiasm of he son be a great help to he maxime have enlist he generation be carry away on a wave of heroic joy they have wait so long -- they have not dare to expect a opportunity for action and sacrifice older man who have never try to understand they stand amaze they remember they own commonplace bungling youth full of petty egotism small ambition and mean pleasure as they could not recognize themselves in they child they attribute to the war this flowering of virtue which have be grow up for twenty year around they indifference and which the war be about to reap even near a father as large-minded as clerambault maxime be blighted clerambault be interested in spread he own overflow diffuse nature too much so to see clearly and aid those whom he love : he bring to they the warm shadow of he thought but he stand between they and the sun these young people seek employment for they strength which really embarrass they but they do not find it in the ideal of the noblest among they elder the humanitarianism of a clerambault be too vague it contented itself with pleasant hope without risk or vigor which the quietude of a generation grow old in the talkative peace of parliament and academy alone could have permit except as a oratorical exercise it have never try to foresee the peril of the future still less have it think to determine its attitude in the day when the danger should be near it have not the strength to make a choice between widely differ course of action one might be a patriot as well as a internationalist or build in imagination peace palace or super-dreadnought for one long to know to embrace and to love everything this languid whitmanism might have its aesthetic value but its practical incoherence offer no guide to young people when they find themselves at the parting of the way they paw the ground tremble with impatience at all this uncertainty and the uselessness of they time as it go by they welcome the war for it put a end to all this indecision it choose for they and they make haste to follow it we go to we death -- so be it but to go be life the battalion go off singing thrilling with impatience dahlia in they hat the musket adorn with flower discharge soldier re-enlist boy put they name down they mother urge they to it you would have think they be set out for the olympian game it be the same with the young man on the other side of the rhine and there as here they be escort by they god : country justice right liberty progress of the world eden-like dream of re-born humanity a whole phantasmagoria of mystic idea in which young man shroud they passion none doubt that he cause be the right one they leave discussion to other themselves the living proof for he who give he life need no further argument the older man however who stay behind have not they reason for cease to reason they brain be give to they to be use not for truth but for victory since in the war of today in which entire people be engulf thought as well as gun be enrol they slay the soul they reach beyond the sea and destroy after century have pass thought be the heavy artillery which work from a distance naturally clerambault aim he piece also the question for he be no longer to see clearly largely to take in the horizon but to sight the enemy -- it give he the illusion that he be help he son with a unconscious and feverish bad faith keep up by he affection he seek in everything that he see hear or read for argument to prop up he will to believe in the holiness of the cause for everything which go to prove that the enemy alone have want war be the sole enemy of peace and that to make war on the enemy be really to wish for peace there be proof enough and to spare there always be all that be need be to know when to open and shut you eye but nevertheless clerambault be not entirely satisfied these half-truth or truth with false tail to they produce a secret uneasiness in the conscience of this honest man show itself in a passionate irritation against the enemy which grow more and more on the same line -- like two bucket in a well one go up as the other go down -- he patriotic enthusiasm grow and drown the last torment of he mind in a salutary intoxication from now on he be on the watch for the smallest newspaper item in support of he theory and though he know what to think of the veracity of these sheet he do not doubt they for a instant when they assertion feed he eager restless passion where the enemy be concern he adopt the principle that the worst be sure to be true -- and he be almost grateful to germany when by act of cruelty and repeat violation of justice she furnish he the solid confirmation of the sentence which for greater security he have pronounce in advance germany give he full measure never do a country at war seem more anxious to raise the universal conscience against she this apoplectic nation burst with strength throw itself upon its adversary in a delirium of pride anger and fear the human beast let loose trace a ring of systematic horror around he from the first all he instinctive and acquire brutality be cleverly excite by those who hold he in leash by he official chief he great general staff he enrol professor he army chaplain war have always be will forever remain a crime but germany organise it as she do everything she make a code for murder and conflagration and over it all she pour the boiling oil of a enraged mysticism make up of bismarck of nietzsche and of the bible in order to crush the world and regenerate it the super-man and christ be mobilise the regeneration begin in belgium -- a thousand year from now man will tell of it the affrighted world look on at the infernal spectacle of the ancient civilisation of europe more than two thousand year old crumble under the savage expert blow of the great nation which form its advance guard germany rich in intelligence in science and in power in a fortnight of war become docile and degraded but what the organiser of this germanic frenzy fail to foresee be that like army cholera it would spread to the other camp and once install in the hostile country it could not be dislodge until it have infect the whole of europe and render it uninhabitable for century in all the madness of this atrocious war in all its violence germany set the example she big body better feed more fleshly than other offer a greater target to the attack of the epidemic it be terrible but by the time the evil begin to abate with she it have penetrate elsewhere and under the form of a slow tenacious disease it eat to the very bone to the insanity of german thinker speaker in pari and everywhere be not slow to respond with they extravagance they be like the hero in homer but if they do not fight they scream all the louder they insult not only the adversary they insult he father he grandfather and he entire race better still they deny he past the tiniest academician work furiously to diminish the glory of the great man asleep in the peace of the grave clerambault listen and listen absorb though he be one of the few french poet who before the war have european relation and whose work would have be appreciate in germany he speak no foreign language it be true pet old child of france that he be who would not take the trouble to visit other people sure that they would come to he but at least he welcome they kindly he mind be free from national prejudice and the intuition of he heart make up for he lack of instruction and cause he to pour out without stint he admiration for foreign genius but now that he have be warn to distrust everything by the constant : keep still -- take care and know that kant lead straight to krupp he dare admire nothing without official sanction the sympathetic modesty that cause he in time of peace to accept with the respect due to word of holy writ the publication of learn and distinguish man now in the war take on the proportion of a fabulous credulity he swallow without a gulp the strange discovery make at this time by the intellectual of he country tread under foot the art the intelligence the science of the enemy throughout the century a effort frantically disingenuous which deny all genius to we adversary and either find in its highest claim to glory the mark of its present infamy or reject its achievement altogether and bestow they on another race clerambault be overwhelm beside himself but -lrb- though he do not admit it -rrb- in he heart he be glad seek for someone to share in he excitement and keep it up by fresh argument he go to he friend perrotin hippolyte perrotin be of one of those type formerly the pride of the higher instruction in france but seldom meet with in these day -- a great humanist lead by a wide and sagacious curiosity he walk calmly through the garden of the century botanise as he go the spectacle of the present be the object least worthy of he attention but he be too keen a observer to miss any of it and know how to draw it gently back into scale to fit into the whole picture event which other regard as most important be not so in he eye and political agitation appear to he like bug on a rose-bush which he would carefully study with its parasite this be to he a constant source of delight he have the finest appreciation of shades of literary beauty and he learning rather increase than impaired the faculty give to he think a infinite range of highly-flavoured experience to taste and compare he belong to the great french tradition of learn man master writer from buffon to renan and gaston pâris member of the academy and of several class he extended knowledge give he a superiority not only of pure and classic taste but of a liberal modern spirit over he colleague genuine man of letter he do not think himself exempt from study as most of they do as soon as they have pass the threshold of the sacred cupola old profesor as he be he still go to school when clerambault be still unknown to the rest of the immortal except to one or two brother poet who mention he as little as possible with a disdainful smile perrotin have already discover and place he in he collection strike by certain picture a original phraseology the mechanism of he imagination primitive yet complicate by simplicity all this attract he and then the man interested he too he send a short complimentary note to clerambault who come to thank he overflow with gratitude and tie of friendship be form between the two man they have few point of resemblance clerambault have lyrical gift and ordinary intelligence dominate by he feeling and perrotin be gifted with a most lucid mind never hamper by flight of the imagination what they have in common be dignity of life intellectual probity and a disinterested love of art and learn for its own sake and not for success none the less as may be see this have not prevent perrotin from get on in the world honor and place have seek he not he they but he do not reject they he neglect nothing clerambault find he busy unwind the wrapping with which the reader of century have cover over the original thought of a chinese philosopher at this game which be habitual with he he come naturally to the discovery of the contrary of what appear at first to be the meaning pass from hand to hand the idol have become black perrotin receive clerambault in this vein polite but a trifle absent-minded even when he listen to society gossip he be inwardly critical tickle he sense of humor at its expense clerambault spread he new acquisition before he start from the recognize unworthiness of the enemy-nation as from a certain well-known fact the whole question be to decide if one should see in this the irremediable decadence of a great people or the proof pure and simple of a barbarism which have always exist but hide from sight clerambault incline to the latter explanation and full of he recent information he hold luther kant and wagner responsible for the violation of belgian neutrality and the crime of the german army he however to use a colloquial expression have never be to see for himself be neither musician theologian or metaphysician he trust to the word of academician and only make exception in favor of beethoven who be flemish and goethe citizen of a free city and almost a strassburger which be half french -- or french and a half he pause for approbation he be surprise not to find in perrotin a ardor correspond to he own he friend smile listen contemplated clerambault with a attentive and benevolent curiosity he do not say no but he do not say yes either and to some assertion he make prudent reservation when clerambault much move quote statement sign by two or three of perrotin 's illustrious colleague the latter make a slight gesture as much as to say : ah you do not say so clerambault grow hotter and hotter and perrotin then change he attitude show a keen interest in the judicious remark of he good friend nod he head at every word answer direct question by vague phrase assent amiably as one do to someone whom one can not contradict clerambault go away out of countenance and discontented but a few day later he be reassure as to he friend when he read perrotin 's name on a violent protestation of the academy against the barbarian he write to congratulate he and perrotin thank he in a few prudent and sibylline word : dear sir -- he affect in write the study ceremonious formula of _ monsieur de port-royal _ -- i be ready to obey any suggestion of my country for I they be command my conscience be at she service accord to the duty of every good citizen one of the most curious effect of the war on the mind be that it arouse new affinity between individual people who up to this time have not a think in common discover all at once that they think alike and this resemblance draw they together it be what people call the sacred union man of all party and temperament the choleric the phlegmatic monarchist anarchist clerical calvinist suddenly forget they everyday self they passion they fad and they antipathy -- shed they skin and there before you be now creature group in a unforeseen manner like metal filings round a invisible magnet all the old category have momentarily disappear and no one be astonish to find himself closer to the stranger of yesterday than to a friend of many year ' standing it seem as if underground soul meet by secret root that stretch through the night of instinct that unknown region where observation rarely venture for we psychology stop at that part of self which emerge from the soil note minutely individual difference but forget that this be only the top of the plant that nine-tenth be bury the foot hold by those of other plant this profound or lower region of the soul be ordinarily below the threshold of consciousness the mind feel nothing of it but the war by wake up this underground life reveal moral relationship which no one have suspect a sudden intimacy show itself between clerambault and a brother of he wife whom he have look upon until now and with good reason as the type of a perfect philistine leo camus be not quite fifty year old he be tall thin and stoop a little he skin be gray he beard black not much hair on he head -- you could see the bald spot under he hat behind -- little wrinkle everywhere cut into each other cross like a badly-made net add to this a frown sulky expression and a perpetual cold in the head for thirty year he have be employ by the state and he life have pass in the shadow of a court-yard at the department in the course of year he have change room but not shadow he be promote but always in the court-yard never would he leave it in this life he be now under-secretary which enable he to throw a shadow in he turn the public and he have few point of contact and he only communicate with the outside world across a rampart of pasteboard box and pile of document he be a old bachelor without friend and he hold the misanthropical opinion that disinterested friendship do not exist upon earth he feel no affection except for he sister 's family and the only way that he show that be by find fault with everything that they do he be one of those people whose uneasy solicitude cause they to blame those they love when they be ill and obstinately prove to they that they suffer by they own fault at the clerambault no one mind he very much madame clerambault be so easy-going that she rather like be push about in this way and as for the child they know that these scolding be sweeten by little present so they pocket the present and let the rest go by the conduct of leo camus towards he brother-in-law have vary with time when he sister have marry clerambault camus have not hesitate to find fault with the match a unknown poet do not seem to he serious enough poetry -- unknown poetry -- be a pretext for not work when one be know of course that be quite another thing camus hold hugo in high esteem and could even recite verse from the châtiments or from auguste barbier they be know you see and that make all the difference just at this time clerambault himself become known camus read about he one day in he favorite paper and after that he consent to read clerambault 's poem he do not understand they but he bear they no ill will on that account he like to call himself old-fashioned it make he feel superior and there be many in the world like he who pride themselves on they lack of comprehension for we must all plume ourselves as we can some of we on what we have other on what we have not camus be willing to admit that clerambault could write he know something of the art himself -- and he respect for he brother-in-law increase in proportion to the puff he read in the papers and he like to chat with he he have always appreciate he affectionate kind-heartedness though he never say so and what pleased also in this great poet for great he be now be he manifest incapacity and practical ignorance of business matter on this ground camus be he superior and do not hesitate to show it clerambault have a simple-hearted confidence in he fellow-man and nothing could have be better suit to camus ' aggressive pessimism which it keep in work order the greater part of he visit be spend in reduce clerambault 's illusion to fragment but they have as many life as a cat and every time he come it have to be do over again this irritated camus but secretly pleased he for he need a pretext constantly renew to think the world bad and man a set of imbecile above all he have no mercy on politician this government employee hate government though he would have be puzzle to say what he would put in they place the only form of politics that he understand be opposition he suffer from a spoil life and thwart nature he be a peasant 's son and bear to raise grape or else to exercise he authoritative instinct over the field labourer like a watch-dog unfortunately disease of the vine interfere and also the pride of a quill-driver the family move to town and now he would have feel it a derogation to return to he real nature which be too much atrophy even if he have wish it not have find he true place in society he blame the social order serve it as do million of functionary like a bad servant a underhand enemy a mind of this sort peevish bitter misanthropical it seem would have be drive crazy by the war but on the contrary it serve to tranquilise it when the herd draw itself together in arm against the stranger it be a fall for those rare free spirit who love the whole world but it raise the many who weakly vegetate in anarchistic egotism and lift they to that higher stage of organised selfishness camus wake up all at once with the feeling that for the first time he be not alone in the world patriotism be perhaps the only instinct under present condition which escape the withering touch of every-day life all other instinct and natural aspiration the legitimate need to love and act in social life be stifle mutilate and force to pass under the yoke of denial and compromise when a man reach middle life and turn to look back he see these desire mark with he failure and he cowardice the taste be bitter on he tongue he be ashamed of they and of himself patriotism alone have remain outside unemployed but not tarnish and when it re-awake it be inviolate the soul embrace and lavish on it the ardor of all the ambition the love and the longing that life have disappoint a half century of suppress fire burst forth million of little cage in the social prison open they door at last long enchained instinct stretch they stiffened limb cry out and leap into the open air as of right -- right do i say it be now they duty to press forward all together like a fall mass the isolate snow-flake turn avalanche camus be carry away the little bureaucrat find himself part of it all and without fury or futile violence he feel only a calm strength all be well with he well in mind well in body he have no more insomnia and for the first time in year he stomach give he no trouble -- because he have forget all about it he even get through the winter without take cold -- something that have never be hear of before he cease to find fault with everything and everybody he no longer rail at all that be do or undo for now he be fill with a sacred pity for the entire social body -- that body now he but stronger better and more beautiful he feel a fraternal bond with all those who form part of it by they close union like a swarm of bee hang from a branch and envy the younger man who go to defend it when maxime gaily prepare to go he uncle gaze at he tenderly and when the train leave carry away the young man he turn and throw he arm round clerambault then shake hand with unknown parent who have come to see they son off with tear of emotion and joy in he eye in that moment camus be ready to give up everything he possess it be he honey-moon with life -- this solitary starve soul see she as she pass and seize she in he arm yes life pass the euphoria of a camus can not last forever but he who have know it live only in the memory of it and in the hope that it may return war bring this gift therefore peace be a enemy and enemy be all those who desire it clerambault and camus exchange idea and to such a extent that finally clerambault could not tell which be he own and as he lose foot he feel more strongly the need to act for action be a kind of justification to himself whom do he wish to justify alas it be camus in spite of he habitual ardor and conviction he be a mere echo -- and of what unhappy voice he begin to write hymn to battle there be great competition in this line among poet who do not fight themselves but there be little danger that they production would clog man 's memory in future age for nothing in they previous career have prepare these unfortunate for such a task in vain they raise they voice and exhaust all the resource of french rhetoric the poilus only shrug they shoulder however people in the rear like they much better than the story write in the dark and cover with mud that come out of the trench the vision of a barbusse have not yet dawn to show the truth to these talkative shadow there be no difficulty for clerambault he shine in these eloquent contest for he have the fatal gift of verbal and rhythmical facility which separate poet from reality wrap they as if in a spider 's web in time of peace this harmless web hang on the bush the wind blow through it and the good-natured arachne catch nothing but light in she mesh nowadays however the poet cultivate they carniverous instinct -- fortunately rather out of date -- and hide at the bottom of they web one could catch sight of a nasty little beast with a eye fix on the prey they sing of hatred and holy butchery and clerambault do as they do even better for he have more voice and by dint of scream this worthy man end by feel passion that he know nothing of he learn to know hatred at last know in the biblical sense and it only rouse in he that base pride that a undergraduate feel when for the first time he find himself come out of a brothel now he be a man and in fact he need nothing more he have fall as low as the other camus well deserve and enjoy the first taste of each one of these poem and they make he neigh with enthusiasm for he recognize himself in they clerambault be flattered thinking he have touch the popular string the brother-in-law spend they evening alone together clerambault read camus drink in he verse he know they by heart and tell everyone who would listen to he that hugo have come to life again and that each of these poem be worth a victory he noisy admiration make it unnecessary for the other member of the family to express they opinion under some excuse rosine regularly make a practice of leave the room when the reading be over clerambault feel it and would have like to ask he daughter 's opinion but find it more prudent not to put the question he prefer to persuade himself that rosine 's emotion and timidity put she to flight he be vex all the same but the approval of the outside world heal this slight wound he poem appear in the _ bourgeois _ papers and prove the most striking success of clerambault 's career for no other work of he have raise such unanimous admiration a poet be always please to have it say that he last work be he best all the more when he know that it be inferior to the other clerambault know it perfectly well but he swallow all the fawn review of the press with infantile vanity in the evening he make camus read they aloud in the family circle beam with joy as he listen when it be over he nearly shout : encore in this concert of praise one slightly flat note come from perrotin -lrb- undoubtedly he have be much deceive in he he be not a true friend -rrb- the old scholar to whom clerambault have send a copy of he poem do not fail to congratulate he politely praise he great talent but he do not say that this be he finest work he even urge he after have offer he tribute to the warlike muse to produce now a work of pure imagination detach from the present what could he mean when a artist submit he work for you approval be it proper to say to he : i should prefer to read another one quite different from this this be a fresh sign to clerambault of the sadly lukewarm patriotism that he have already notice in perrotin this lack of comprehension chill he feeling towards he old friend the war he think be the great test of character it revise all value and try out friendship and he think that the loss of perrotin be balance by the gain of camus and many new friend plain people no doubt but simple and warm-hearted sometimes at night he have moment of oppression he be uneasy wakeful discontented ashamed but of what have he not do he duty the first letter from maxime be a comforting cordial the first drop dissipate every discouragement and they all live on they in long interval when no news come in spite of the agony of these silence when any second might be fatal to the loved one he perfect confidence -lrb- exaggerated perhaps through affection or superstition -rrb- communicate itself to they all he letter be run over with youth and exuberant joy which reach its climax in the day that follow the victory of the marne the whole family yearn towards he as one like a plant the summit of which bathe in the light stretch up to it in a rapture of mystic adoration people who but yesterday be soft and torpid expand under the extraordinary light when fate throw they into the infernal vortex of the war the light of death the game with death maxime a spoil child delicate overparticular who in ordinary time take care of himself like a fine lady find a unexpected flavor in the privation and trial of he new life and wonder at himself he boast of it in he charming vainglorious letter which delight the heart of he parent neither affect to be cast in the mould of one of corneille 's hero and the thought of immolate they child on the altar of a barbaric idea would have fill they with horror but the transfiguration of they pet boy suddenly become a hero touch they with a tenderness never before feel in spite of they anxiety maxime 's enthusiasm intoxicate they and it make they ungrateful toward they former life that peaceful affectionate existence with its long monotonous day maxime be amusingly contemptuous of it call it absurd after one have see what be go on out there out there one be glad to sleep three hour on the hard ground or once in a month of sunday on a wisp of straw glad to turn out at three o'clock in the morning and warm up by march thirty kilometre with a knapsack on one 's back sweating freely for eight or ten hour at a time glad above all to get in touch with the enemy and rest a little lie down under a bank while one pepper the boche this young cyrano declare that fight rest you after a march and when he describe a engagement you would have say that he be at a concert or a movie the rhythm of the shell the noise when they leave the gun and when they burst remind he of the passage with cymbal in the divine scherzo of the ninth symphony when he hear overhead as from a airy music-box the buzz of these steel mosquito mischievous imperious angry treacherous or simply full of amiable carelessness he feel like a street boy rush out to see a fire no more fatigue mind and body on the alert and when come the long-awaited order forward one jump to one 's foot light as a feather and run to the nearest shelter under the hail of bullet glad to be in the open like a hound on the scent you crawl on you hand and knee or on you stomach you run all bent doubled-up or do swedish gymnastics through the underbrush that make up for not be able to walk straight and when it grow dark you say : what night already -- what have we be do with ourselves today in conclusion say this little french cockerel the only tiresome thing in war be what you do in peace-time -- you walk along the high road this be the way these young man talk in the first month of the campaign all soldier of the marne of war in the open if this have go on we should have see once more the race of barefooted revolutionary who set out to conquer the world and could not stop themselves they be at last force to stop and from the moment that they be put to soak in the trench the tone change maxime lose he spirit he boyish carelessness from day to day he grow virile stoical obstinate and nervous he still vouch for the final victory but cease after a while to talk of it and write only of duty to be do then even that stop and he letter become dull gray tired-out enthusiasm have not diminish behind the line and clerambault persist in vibrate like a organ pipe but maxime no longer give back the echo he seek to evoke all at once without warn maxime come home for a week 's leave he stop on the stair for though he seem more robust than formerly he leg feel heavy and he be soon tired he wait a moment to breathe for he be move and then go up he mother come to the door at he ring scream at the sight of he clerambault who be pacing up and down the apartment in the weariness of the long wait cry out too as he run it be a tremendous row after a few minute there be a truce to embrace and inarticulate exclamation push into a chair by the window with he face to the light maxime give himself up to they delighted eye they be in ecstasy over he complexion he cheek more fill out he healthy look he father throw he arm around he call he my hero -- but maxime sit with he finger twitch nervously and could not get out a word at table they feast they eye on he hang on every word but he say very little the excitement of he family have check he first impetus but luckily they do not notice it and attribute he silence to fatigue or to hunger clerambault talk enough for two tell maxime about life in the trench good mother pauline be transform into a cornelium out of plutarch and maxime look at they eat look again a gulf have open between they when after dinner they all go back to he father 's study and they see he comfortably establish with a cigar he have to try and satisfy these poor wait people so he quietly begin to tell they how he time be pass with a certain proud reserve and leave out tragical picture they listen in tremble expectation and when he have finish they be still expectant then on they side come a shower of question to which maxime 's reply be short -- soon he fall silent clerambault to wake up the young rascal try several jovial thrust come now tell we about some of you engagement it must be fine to see such joy such sacred fire -- lord but i would like to see all that i would like to be in you place you can see all these fine thing better from where you be say maxime since he have be in the trench he have not see a fight hardly set eye on a german he view be bound by mud and water -- but they would not believe he they think he be talk contrariwise as he do when he be a child you old humbug say he father laugh gaily what do happen then all day long in you trench we take care of ourselves kill time the worst enemy of all clerambault slap he amicably on the back time be not the only one you kill -- maxime draw away see the kind curious glance of he father and mother and answer : please talk of something else and add after a pause : will you do something for I -- do not ask I any more question today they agree rather surprised but they suppose that he need care be so tired and they overwhelm he with attention clerambault however could not refrain from break out every minute or two in apostrophe demand he son 's approbation he speech resound with the word liberty maxime smile faintly and look at rosine for the attitude of the young girl be singular when she brother come in she throw she arm round he neck but since she have keep in the background one might have say aloof she have take no part in she parent ' question and far from invite confidence from maxime she seem to shrink from it he feel the same awkwardness and avoid be alone with she but still they have never feel closer to each other in spirit they could not have bear to say why maxime have to be show to all the neighbor and by way of amusement he be take out for a walk in spite of she mourning pari again wear a smile face poverty and pain be hide at home or at the bottom of she proud heart but the perpetual fair in the street and in the press show its mask of contentment the people in the cafés and the tea-room be ready to hold out for twenty year if necessary maxime and he family sit in a tea-shop at a little table gay chatter and the perfume of woman all about he through it he see the trench where he have be bombard for twenty-six day on end unable to stir from the sticky ditch full of corpse which rise around he like a wall he mother lay she hand on he he wake see the affectionate question glance of he people and self-reproached for make they uneasy he smile and begin to look about and talk gaily he boyish high spirit come back and the shadow clear away from clerambault 's face he glance simply and gratefully at maxime he alarm be not at a end however as they leave the tea-shop -- he lean on the arm of he son -- they meet a military funeral there be wreath and uniform a member of the institute with he sword between he leg and brass instrument bray out a heroic lamentation the crowd draw respectfully to either side clerambault stop and pointedly take off he hat while with he left hand he press maxime 's arm yet closer to he side feel he tremble he turn towards he son and think he have a strange look suppose that he be overcome he try to draw he away but maxime do not stir he be so much take aback a dead man he think all that for one dead man and out there we walk over they five hundred a day on the roll that be the normal ration hear a sneer little laugh clerambault be frightened and pull he by the arm come away he say and they move on if they could see say maxime to himself if they could only see they whole society would go to piece but they will always be blind they do not want to see he eye cruelly sharpen now see the adversary all around he -- in the carelessness of the world its stupidity its egotism its luxury in the i do not give a damn the indecent profit of the war the enjoyment of it the falseness down to the root all these sheltered people shirker police with they insolent auto that look like cannon they woman boot to the knee with scarlet mouth and cruel little candy face they be all satisfied all be for the best it will go on forever as it be half the world devour the other half they go home in the evening after dinner clerambault be die to read he latest poem to maxime the idea of it be touch if a little absurd -- in he love for he son he seek to be in spirit at least the comrade of he glory and he suffering and he have describe they -- at a distance -- in dawn in the trench twice he get up to look for the m but with the sheet in he hand a sort of shyness paralyse he and he go back without they as the day go by they feel themselves closely knit together by tie of the flesh but they soul be out of touch neither would admit it though each know it well a sadness be between they but they refuse to see the real cause and prefer to ascribe it to the approach reparation from time to time the father or the mother make a fresh attempt to re-open the source of intimacy but each time come the same disappointment maxime see that he have no longer any way of communicate with they with anyone in the rear they live in different world could they ever understand each other again yet still he understand they for once he have himself undergo the influence which weigh on they and have only come to he sens out there in contact with real suffering and death but just because he have be touch himself he know the impossibility of cure the other by process of reasoning so he let they talk silent himself smile vaguely assent to be know not what the preoccupation here behind the line fill he with disgust weariness and a profound pity for these people in the rear -- a strange race to he with the outcry of the papers question from such person -- old buffoon worn-out damage politician -- patriotic bragging written-up strategy anxiety about black bread sugar card or the day when the confectioner be shut he take refuge in a mysterious silence smile and sad and only go out occasionally when he think of the short time he have to be with these dear people who love he then he would begin to talk with the utmost animation about anything the important thing be to make a noise since one could no longer speak one 's real thought and naturally he fall back on everyday matter question of general interest and political news come first but they might as well have read the morning paper aloud the crush of the hun the triumph of the right fill clerambault 's thought and speech while he serve as acolyte and fill in the pause with _ cum spiritu tuo _ all the time each be wait for the other to begin to talk they wait so long that the end of he leave come a little while before he go maxime come into he father 's study resolve to explain himself : papa be you quite sure the trouble paint on clerambault 's face check the word on he lip he have pity on he and ask if he father be quite sure at what time the train be to leave and clerambault hear the end of the question with a only too visible relief when he have supply all the information -- that maxime do not listen to -- he mount he oratorical hobby-horse again and start out with one of he habitual idealistic declamation maxime hold he peace discourage and for the last hour they speak only of trifle all but the mother feel that the essential have not be utter only light and confident word a apparent excitement but a deep sigh in the heart -- my god my god why hast thou forsake we when maxime leave he be really glad to go back to the front the gulf that he have find between the front and rear seem to he deeper than the trench and gun do not appear to he as murderous as idea as the railway carriage draw out of the station he lean from the window and follow with he eye the tearful face of he family fading in the distance and he think : poor dear you be they victim and we be yours the day after he return to the front the great spring offensive be let loose which the talkative newspaper have announce to the enemy several week beforehand the hope of the nation have be feed on it during the gloomy winter of wait and death and it rise now fill with a impatient joy sure of victory and cry out to it -- at last the first news seem good of course it speak only of the enemy 's loss and all face brighten parent whose son woman whose husband be out there be proud that they flesh and they love have a part in this sanguinary feast and in they exaltation they hardly stop to think that they dear one might be among the victim the excitement run so high that clerambault a affectionate tender father generally most anxious for those he love be actually afraid that he son have not get back in time for the dance he want he to be there he eager wish push thrust he into the abyss make this sacrifice dispose of he son and of he life without ask if he himself agree he and he have cease to belong to themselves he could not conceive that it should be otherwise with any of they the obscure will of the ant-heap have eat he up sometimes take unaware the remains of he self-analytical habit of mind would appear like a sensitive nerve that be touch -- a dull blow a quiver of pain it be go and we forget it at the end of three week the exhaust offensive be still paw the ground of the same blood-soaked kilometre and the newspaper begin to distract public attention put it on a fresh scent nothing have be hear from maxime since he leave they seek for the ordinary reason for delay which the mind furnish readily but the heart can not accept another week go by among themselves each of the three pretend to be confident but at night each one alone in he room the heart cry out in agony and the whole day long the ear be strain to catch every step on the stair the nerve stretch to the breaking point at a ring of the bell or the touch of a hand pass the door the first official news of the loss begin to come in several family among clerambault 's friend already know which of they man be dead and which wound those who have lose all envy those who could have they loved one back though bleed perhaps mutilate many sink into the night of they grief for they the war and life be equally over but with other the exaltation of the early day persist strangely clerambault see one mother work up by she patriotism and she grief to the point that she almost rejoice at the death of she son i have give my all my all she would say with a violent concentrated joy such as be feel in the last second before extinction by a woman who drown herself with the man she love clerambault however be weaker and wake from he dizziness he think : i too have give all even what be not my own he inquire of the military authority but they know nothing as yet ten day later come the news that sergeant clerambault be report as miss from the night of the 27-28th of the precede month clerambault could get no further detail at the paris bureau therefore he set out for geneva go to the red cross the agency for prisoner -- could find nothing follow up every clue get permission to question comrade of he son in hospital or depot behind the line they all give contradictory information one say he be a prisoner another have see he dead and both the next day admit that they have be mistaken oh torture god of vengeance he come back after a fortnight from this way of the cross aged broken-down exhaust he find he wife in a paroxysm of frantic grief which in this good-natured creature have turn to a furious hatred of the enemy she cry out for revenge and for the first time clerambault do not answer he have not strength enough to hate he could only suffer he shut himself into he room during that frightful ten day ' pilgrimage he have scarcely look he thought in the face hypnotise as he be day and night by one idea like a dog on a scent -- faster go faster the slowness of carriage and train consume he and once when he have take a room for the night he rush away the same evening without stop to rest this fever of haste and expectation devour everything and make consecutive thought impossible -- which be he salvation now that the chase be end he mind exhaust and die recover its power clerambault know certainly that maxime be dead he have not tell he wife but have conceal some information that destroy all hope she be one of those people who absolutely must keep a gleam of falsehood to lure they on against all reason until the first flood of grief be over perhaps clerambault himself have be one of they but he be not so now for he see where this lure have lead he he do not judge he be not yet able to form a judgment lie in the darkness too weak to rise and feel about he he be like someone who move he crushed limb after a fall and with each stab of pain recover consciousness of life and try to understand what have happen to he the stupid gulf of this death overcome he that this beautiful child who have give they so much joy cost they so much care all this marvel of hope in flower the priceless little world that be a young man a tree of jesse future year all vanish in a hour -- and why -- why -- he be force to try to persuade himself at least that it be for something great and necessary clerambault cling despairingly to this buoy during the succeed night feel that if he hold give way he should go under more than ever he insist on the holiness of the cause he would not even discuss it but little by little he finger slip he settle lower with every movement for each new statement of the justice of he cause rouse a voice in he conscience which say : even if you be twenty thousand time more right in this struggle be you justification worth the disaster it cost do justice demand that million of innocent should fall a ransom for the sin and the error of other be crime to be wash out by crime or murder by murder and must you son be not only victim but accomplice assassinate and assassin he look back at the last visit of he son and reflect on they last talk together how many thing be clear to he now which he have not understand at the time maxime 's silence the reproach in he eye the worst of all be when he recognize that he have understand at the time when he son be there but that he would not admit it this discovery which have hang over he like a dark cloud for week -- this realisation of inward falsehood -- crushed he to the earth until the actual crisis be upon they rosine clerambault seem throw into the shade she inward life be unknown to the other and almost to herself even she father have scarcely a glimpse of it she have live under the wing of the warm selfish stifle family life and have few friend or companion of she own age for she parent stand between she and the world outside and she have grow up in they shadow as she grow older if she have wish to escape she would not have dare would not have know how for she be shy outside the family circle and could hardly move or talk people think she insignificant this she know it wound she self-respect and therefore she go out as little as possible prefer to stay at home where she be simple natural and taciturn this silence do not arise from slowness of thought but from the chatter of the other as she father mother and brother be all exuberant talker this little person by a sort of reaction withdraw into herself where she could talk freely she be fair tall and boyishly slender with pretty hair the lock always stray over she cheek she mouth be rather large and serious the lower lip full at the corner she eye large calm and vague with fine well-marked eyebrow she have a graceful chin a pretty throat a undeveloped figure no hip she hand be large and a little red with prominent vein anything would make she blush and she girlish charm be all in the forehead and the chin she eye be always ask and dream but say little she father 's preference be for she just as she mother be draw towards the son by natural affinity without think much about it clerambault have always monopolise he daughter surround she from childhood with he absorb affection she have be partly educate by he and with the almost offensive simplicity of the artist mind he have take she for the confidante of he inner life this be bring about by he overflow self-consciousness and the little response that he find in he wife a good creature who as the say be sit at he foot in fact stay there permanently answer yes to all that he say admire he blindly without understand he or feel the lack the essential to she be not she husband 's thought but himself he welfare he comfort he food he clothing he health honest clerambault in the gratitude of he heart do not criticise he wife any more than rosine criticise she mother but both of they know how it be instinctively and be draw closer by a secret tie clerambault be not aware that in he daughter he have find the real wife of he heart and mind nor do he begin to suspect it till in these last day the war have seem to break the tacit accord between they rosine 's approval hitherto have bind she to he and now all at once it fail he she know many thing before he do but shrink from the depths of the mystery the mind need not give warn to the heart it know strange splendid mystery of love between soul independent of social and even of natural law few there be that know it and fewer still that dare to reveal it they be afraid of the coarse world and its summary judgment and can get no farther than the plain meaning of traditional language in this conventional tongue which be voluntarily inexact for the sake of social simplification word be careful not to unveil by express they the many shades of reality in its multiple form they imprison it codify it drill it they press it into the service of the mind already domesticate of that reasoning power which do not spring from the depth of the spirit but from shallow walled-in pool -- like the basin at versaille -- within the limit of constitute society in this somewhat legal phraseology love be bind to sex age and social class it be either natural or unnatural legitimate or the reverse but this be a mere trickle of water from the deep spring of love which be as the law of gravitation that keep the star in they course and care nothing for the way that we trace for it this infinite love fulfil itself between soul far remove by time and space across the century it unite the thought of the living and the dead weave close and chaste tie between old and young heart through it friend be nearer to friend the child be closer in spirit to the old man than be husband or wife in the whole course of they life between father and child these tie often exist unconsciously and the world as we forefather use to say count so little in comparison with love eternal that the position be sometimes reverse and the younger may not always be the most childlike how many son be there who feel a devout paternal affection for a old mother and do we not often see ourselves small and humble under the eye of a child the look with which the bambino of botticellus contemplate the innocent virgin be heavy with a sad unconscious experience and as old as the world the affection of clerambault and rosine be of this sort fine religious above the reach of reason that be why in the depths of the troubled sea below the pain and the conflict of conscience cause by the war a secret drama go on without sign almost without word between these heart unite by a sacred love this unavowed sentiment explain the sensitiveness of they mutual reaction at first rosine draw away in silence disappoint in she affection she secret worship tarnish by the effect of the war on she father she stand apart from he like a little antique statue chastely drape at once clerambault become uneasy he sensibility sharpen by tenderness feel instantly this _ nolus I tangere _ and from this arise a unexpressed estrangement between the father and daughter word be so coarse one would not dare to speak even in the purest sense of disappointed love but this inner discord of which neither ever speak a word be pain to both of they make the young girl unhappy and irritated clerambault he know the cause well enough but he pride refuse to admit it though little by little he be not far from confess that rosine be right he be ready to humiliate himself but he tongue be tie by false shame and so the difference between they mind grow wider while in they heart each long to yield in the confusion that follow maxime 's death this inward prayer press more on the one less able to resist clerambault be prostrate by he grief he wife aimlessly busy and rosine be out all day at she war work they only come together at meal but it happen that one evening after dinner clerambault hear she mother violently scold rosine who have speak of wounded enemy whom she want to take care of madame clerambault be as indignant as if she daughter have commit a crime and appeal to she husband he weary vague sad eye have begin to see he look at rosine who be silent she head bent wait for he reply you be right my little girl he say rosine start and flush for she have not expect this she raise she grateful eye to he and they look seem to say : you have come back to I at last after the brief repast they usually separated each to eat out he heart in solitude clerambault sit before he writing-table and weep he face hide in he hand rosine 's look have pierce through to he suffer heart he soul lose stifle for so long have come to be as it be before the war oh the look in she eye he listen wipe away he tear he wife have lock herself into maxime 's room as she do every evening and be folding and unfold he clothes arrange the thing leave behind he go into the room where rosine sit alone by the window sew she be absorb in thought and do not hear he come till he stand before she till he lay he gray head on she shoulder and murmur : my little girl then she heart melt also she take the dear old head between she hand with its rough hair and answer : my dear father neither need to ask or to explain why he be there after a long silence when he be calmer he look at she and say : it seem as if i have wake up from a frightful dream but she merely stroke he hair without speak you be watch over I be you not i see it be you unhappy she just bow she head not daring to look at he he stoop to kiss she hand and raise he head he whisper : my good angel you have save I when he have go back to he room she stay there without move fill with emotion which keep she for long still with droop head she hand clasp on she knee the wave of feeling that flow through she almost take away she breath she heart be burst with love happiness and shame the humility of she father overcome she and all at once a passionate impulse of tender filial piety break the bond which paralyse she soul and body as she stretch out she arm towards the absent and throw herself at the foot of she bed thank god beseech he to give all the suffer to she and happiness to the one she love the god to whom she pray do not give ear for it be on the head of this young girl that he pour the sweet sleep of forgetfulness but clerambault have to climb he calvary to the end alone in he room the lamp put out in darkness clerambault look within himself he be determine to pierce to the bottom of he timid lie soul which try to hide itself on he head he could still feel the coolness of he daughter 's hand which have efface all he hesitation he would face this monster truth though he be tear by its claw which never relax once they have take hold with a firm hand in spite of he anguish he begin to tear off in bleed fragment the covering of mortal prejudice passion and idea foreign to he real nature which cling to he first come the thick fleece of the thousand-headed beast the collective soul of the herd he have hide under it from fear and weariness it be hot and stifle a dirty feather-bed but once wrap in it one can not move to throw it off or even wish to do so there be no need to will or to think one be sheltered from cold from responsibility laziness cowardice come away with it let the chilly wind blow through the rent you shrink at first but already this breath have shake the torpor the enfeebled energy begin to stagger to its foot what will it find outside no matter what we must see sick with disgust he see first what he be loath to believe how this greasy fleece have stick to he flesh he could sniff the musty odour of the primitive beast the savage instinct of war of murder the lust for blood like live meat tear by he jaw the elemental force which ask death for life far down in the depths of human nature be this slaughter-house in the ditch never fill up but cover with the veil of a false civilisation over which hang a faint whiff from the butcher 's shop this filthy odour finally sober clerambault with horror he tear off the skin of the beast whose prey he have be ah how thick it be -- warm silky and beautiful and at the same time stink and bloody make of the lowest instinct and the highest illusion to love give ourselves to all be a sacrifice for all be but one body and one soul we country the sole life what then be this country this living thing to which a man sacrifice he life the life of all but he conscience and the conscience of other what be this blind love of which the other side of the shield be a equally blinded hate it be a great error to take the name of reason from that of love say pascal and we have no good cause to think they oppose for love and reason be in truth the same love be a precipitation of think to one side without consider everything but it be always reason well let we consider everything be not this love in a great measure the fear of examine all thing as a child hide he head under the sheet so as not to see the shadow on the wall country a hindoo temple : man monster and god what be she the earth we tread on the whole earth be the mother of we all the family it be here and there with the enemy as with ourselves and it ask nothing but peace the poor the worker the people they be on both side equally miserable equally exploit thinker have a common field and as for they rivalry and they vanity they be as ridiculous in the east as in the west the world do not go to war over the quarrel of a vadius or a trissotin the state but the state and the country be not the same thing the confusion be make by those who find profit in it the state be we strength use and abuse by man like ourselves no better than ourselves often worse we be not dupe by they and in time of peace we judge they fairly enough but let a war come on they be give _ carte blanche _ they can appeal to the lowest instinct stifle all control suppress liberty and truth destroy all humanity they be master we must stand shoulder to shoulder to defend the honor and the mistake of these masacarille array in borrow plume we be all answerable do you say terrible net-work of word responsible no doubt we be for the best and the worst of we people it be a fact as we well know but that it be a duty that bind we to they injustice and they insanity i deny it there can be no question as to community of interest no one think clerambault have have more joy in it or say more in praise of its greatness it be good and healthy it make for rest and strength to plunge the bare stiff cold ego into the collective mind as into a bath of confidence and fraternal gift it unbend give itself breathe more deeply man need he fellow-man and owe himself to he but in order to give out he must possess he must be something but how can he be if he self be merge in other he have many duty but the highest of all be to be and remain himself even when he sacrifice and give all that he be to bathe in the soul of other would be dangerous as a permanent state one dip for health 's sake but do not stay too long or you will lose all moral vigor in we day you be plunge from childhood whether you like it or not into the democratic tub society think for you impose its morality upon you its state act for you its fashion and its opinion steal from you the very air you breathe you have no lung no heart no light of you own you serve what you despise you lie in every gesture word and think you surrender become nothing what do it profit we all if we all surrender for the sake of whom or what to satisfy blind instinct or rogue do god rule or do some charlatan speak for the oracle let we lift the veil and look the hidden thing behind it in the face we country a great noble word the father brother embrace brother that be not what you false country offer I but a enclosure a pit full of beast trench barrier prison bar my brother where be they where be those who travail all over the world cain what hast thou do with they i stretch out my arm a wave of blood separate we in my own country i be only a anonymous instrument of assassination my country but it be you who destroy she my country be the great community of mankind you have ravage it for thought and liberty know not where to lay they head in europe today i must rebuild my house the home of we all for you have none yours be a dungeon how can it be do where shall i look or find shelter they have take everything from I there be not a free spot on earth or in the mind all the sanctuary of the soul of art of science religion they be all violate all enslaved i be alone lose nothing remain to I but death \* \* \* \* \* when he have tear everything away there remain nothing but he naked soul and for the rest of the night it could only stand chill and shiver but a spark live in this spirit that shiver in this tiny be lose in the universe like those shape which the primitive painter represent come out of the mouth of the die with the dawn the feeble flame stifle under so many falsehood begin to revive and be relight by the first breath of free air nothing could again extinguish it \* \* \* \* \* upon this agony or parturition of the soul there follow a long sad day the repose of a broken spirit in a great silence with the ache relief of duty perform clerambault sit with he head against the back of he armchair and think he body be feverish he heart heavy with recollection the tear fall unnoticed from he eye while out of door nature awake sadly to the last day of winter like he strip and bare but still there tremble a warmth beneath the icy air which be to kindle a new fire everywhere part two it be a week before clerambault could go out again the terrible crisis through which he have pass have leave he weak but resolve and though the exaltation of he despair have quiet down he be stoically determine to follow the truth even to the end the remembrance of the error in which he mind have delight and the half-truth on which it have feed make he humble he doubt he own strength and wish to advance step by step he be ready to welcome the advice of those wiser than himself he remember how perrotin listen to he former confidence with a sarcastic reserve that irritated he at the time but which now attract he he first visit of convalescence be to this wise old friend perrotin be rather short-sighted and selfish and do not take the trouble to look carefully at thing that be not necessary to he be a closer observer of book than of face but he be none the less strike by the alteration in clerambault 's expression my dear friend say he have you be ill yes ill enough answer clerambault but i have pull myself together again and be better now it be the cruelest blow of all say perrotin to lose at we age such a friend as you poor boy be to you the most cruel be not he loss say the father it be that i contribute to he death what do you mean my good friend say perrotin in surprise how can you imagine such thing to add to you trouble it be i who shut he eye say clerambault bitterly and he have open mine perrotin push aside the work which accord to he habit he have continue to ruminate upon during the conversation and look narrowly at he friend who bent he head and begin he story in a indistinct voice sad and charge with feeling like a christian of the early time make public confession he accuse himself of falsehood towards he faith he heart and he reason when the apostle see he lord in chain he be afraid and deny he but he be not bring so low as to offer he service as executioner he clerambault have not only desert the cause of human brotherhood he have debase it he have continue to talk of fraternity while he be stir up hatred like those lie priest who distort the scripture to serve they wicked purpose he have knowingly alter the most generous idea to disguise murderous passion he extol war while call himself a pacifist profess to be humanitarian previously put the enemy outside humanity oh how much franker it would have be to yield to force than to lend himself to its dishonour compromise it be thanks to such sophistry as he that the idealism of young man be throw into the arena those old poisoner the artist and thinker have sweeten the death-brew with they honeyed rhetoric which would have be find out and reject by every conscience with disgust if it have not be for they falsehood the blood of my son be on my head say clerambault sadly the death of the youth of europe in all country lie at the door of european thought it have be everywhere a servant to the hangman perrotin lean over and take clerambault 's hand my poor friend say he you make too much of this no doubt you be right to acknowledge the error of judgment into which you have be draw by public opinion and i may confess to you now that i be sorry to see it but you be wrong to ascribe to yourself and other thinker so much responsibility for the event of today one man speak another act but the speaker do not move the other to action they be all drift with the tide this unfortunate european thought be a bit of drift-wood like the rest it do not make the current it be carry along by it it persuade people to yield to it say clerambault instead of help the swimmer and bid they struggle against it it say : let yourself go no my friend do not try to diminish its responsibility it be the greatest of all we thought have the best place from which to see its business be to keep watch and if it see nothing it be through lack of good-will for it can not lay the blame on its eye which be clear enough you know it and so do i now that i have come to my sens the same intelligence which darken my eye have now tear away the bandage how can it be at the same time a power for truth and for falsehood perrotin shake he head yes intelligence be so great and so high that she can not put herself at the service of any other force without derogation for if she be no longer mistress and free she be degrade it be a case of roman master debase the greek he superior and make he he purveyor -- _ graeculus _ sophist _ laeno _ to the vulgar the intelligence be a sort of maid-of-all-work and in this position she display the sly dishonest cleverness of she kind sometimes she be employ by hatred pride or self-interest and then she flatter these little devil dress they up as idealism love faith liberty and social generosity for when a man do not love he neighbor he say he love god he country or even humanity sometimes the poor master be himself a slave to the state under threat of punishment the social machine force he to act which be repugnant but the complaisant intelligence persuade he that these be fine and glorious and perform by he of he own free will in either case the intelligence know what she be about and be always at we disposition if we really want she to tell we the truth but we take good care to avoid it and never to be leave alone with she we manage so as to meet she only in public when we can put lead question as we please when all be say the earth go round none the less _ e pur se muove _ -- the law of the world be obey and the free mind behold they all the rest be vanity the passion faith sincere or insincere be only the paint face of that necessity which rule the world without care for we idol : family race country religion society progress progress indeed the great illusion humanity be like water that must find its level and when the cistern brim over a valve open and it be empty again a catastrophic rhythm the height of civilisation and then downfall we rise and be cast down thus perrotin calmly unveil he thought she be not much accustomed to go naked but she forget that she have a witness and undressed as if she be alone she be extremely bold as be often the thought of a man of letter not oblige to suit the action to the word but who much prefer on the contrary not to do so the alarmed clerambault listen with he mouth open certain word revolt he other pierce he to the heart he head swam but he overcome he weakness for he be determine to lose nothing of these profundity he press perrotin with question : and he on he part flattered and smile complaisantly unrolled he pyrrhonian vision as peaceable as they be destructive the vapor of the pit be rise all about they and clerambault be admire the ease of this free spirit perch on the edge of the abyss and enjoy it when the door open and the servant come in with a card which he give to perrotin at once the terrible phantom of the brain vanish a trap-door shut out the emptiness and a official drawing-room rug cover it perrotin rouse himself and say eagerly : certainly show he in at once turn to clerambault he add : pardon I my dear friend it be the honorable under-secretary of state for public instruction he be already on he foot and go to meet he visitor a stage-lover look fellow with the blue clean-shaven chin of a priest or a yankee who hold he head very high and wear in the gray cut-a-way which clothe he well-rounded figure the rosette which be display alike by we hero and we lackey the old gentleman present clerambault to he with cheerful alacrity : mr agénor clerambault -- mr hyacinth monchéri and ask the honorable under-secretary of state to what he owe the honor of he visit the honorable under-secretary not in the least surprise by the obsequious welcome of the old scholar settle himself in he armchair with the lofty air of familiarity suitable to the superior position he hold over the two representative of french letter he represent the state speak haughtily through he nose and bray like a dromedary he extend to perrotin a invitation from the minister to preside over a solemn contest of embattled intellectual from ten nation in the great amphitheatre of the sorbonne -- a imprecatory meeting he call it perrotin promptly accept and profess himself overcome by the honor he servile tone before this licensed government ignoramus make a striking contrast with he bold statement a few moment before and clerambault somewhat take aback think of the _ graeculus _ mr chéri walk out with he head in the air like a ass in a sacred procession accompany by perrotin to the very threshold and when the friend be once more alone clerambault would have like to resume the conversation but he could not conceal that he be a little chill by what have pass he ask perrotin if he mean to state in public the opinion he have just profess and perrotin refuse naturally laugh at he friend 's simplicity what be more he caution he affectionately against proclaim such idea from the house-tops clerambault be vex and dispute the point but in order to make the situation clear to he and with the utmost frankness perrotin describe he surroundings the great mind of the higher university which he represent officially : historian philosopher professor of rhetoric he speak of they politely but with a deep half-concealed contempt and a touch of personal bitterness for in spite of he prudence the less intelligent of he colleague look on he with suspicion he be too clever he say he be like a old blind man 's dog in a pack of bark cur force to do as they do and bark at the passer-by clerambault do not quarrel with he but go away with pity in he heart he stay in the house for several day for this first contact with the outside world have depress he and the friend on whom he have rely for guidance have fail he miserably he be much trouble for clerambault be weak and unused to stand alone poet as he be and absolutely sincere he have never feel it necessary to think independently of other he have let himself be carry along by they think make it he own become its inspired voice and mouth-piece now all be suddenly change notwithstanding that night of crisis he doubt return upon he for after fifty a man 's nature can not be transform at a touch no matter how much the mind may have retain the elasticity of youth the light of a revelation do not always shine like the sun in a clear summer sky but be more like a arc-light which often wink and go out before the current become strong when these irregular pulsation fade out the shadow appear deeper and the spirit totter and then -- it be hard for clerambault to get along without other people he decide to visit all he friend of whom he have many in the literary world in the university and among the intelligent _ bourgeoisie _ he be sure to find some among they who better than he could divine the problem which beset he and help he in they solution timidly without as yet betray he own mind he try to read theirs to listen and observe but he have not realize that the veil have fall from he eye and the vision that he see of a world once well-known to he seem strange and cold the whole world of letter be mobilise so that personality be no longer to be distinguish the university form a ministry of domesticated intelligence its function be to draw up the act of the state its master and patron the different department be know by they professional twist the professor of literature be above all skilful in develop moral argument oratorically under the three term of the syllogism they mania be a excessive simplification of argument they put high-sounding word in the place of reason and make too much of a few idea always the same lifeless for lack of color or shade they have unearth these weapon of a so-called classic antiquity the key to which have be jealously guard throughout the age by academic mameluke and these eloquent antiquated idea be falsely call humanities though in many respects they offend the common-sense and the heart of humanity as it be today still they bear the hall-mark of rome prototype of all we modern state and they authorised exponent be the state rhetorician the philosopher excel in abstract construction they have the art of explain the concrete by the abstract the real by its shadow they systematise some hasty partial observation melt they in they alembic and from they deduce law to regulate the entire world they strive to subject life multiple and many-sided to the unity of the mind that be to _ they _ mind the time-serving trickery of a sophistical profession facilitate this imperialism of the reason they know how to handle idea twist stretch and tie they together like strip of candy it would have be child 's play for they to make a camel pass through the eye of a needle they could also prove that black be white and could find in the work of emanuel kant the freedom of the world or prussian militarism just as they see fit the historian be the bear scribe attorney and lawyer of the government charge with the care of its charter its title-deed and case and arm to the tooth for its future quarrel what be history after all the story of success the demonstration of what have be do just or unjust the defeat have no history be silent you persian of salami slave of spartacus gaul arab of poitier albigens irish indian of both america and colonial people generally when a worthy man revolt against the injustice of he day put he hope in posterity by way of consolation he forget that this posterity have but little chance to learn of former event all that can be know be what the advocate of official history think favourable to the cause of they client the state a lawyer for the adverse party may possibly intervene -- someone of another nation or of a oppress social or religious group but there be small chance for he the secret be keep too well orator sophist and pleader the three corporation of the faculty of letter -- letter of state sign and patent the study of the scientific ought to have protect they better from the suggestion and contagion of the outside world -- that be if they confine themselves to they trade unfortunately they have be tempt from it for the apply science have take so large a place in practical affair that expert find themselves throw into the foremost rank of action and expose to all the infection of the public mind they self-respect be directly interested in the victory of the community which can as easily assimilate the heroism of the soldier as the folly and falsehood of the publicist few scientific man have have the strength to keep themselves free for the most part they have only contribute the rigor the stiffness of the geometrical mind add to professional rivalry always more acute between learn body of different nationality the regular writer poet and novelist who have no official tie they at least should have the advantage of they independence but unfortunately few of they be able to judge for themselves of event which be beyond the limit of they habitual preoccupation commercial or aesthetic the greater number and not the least known be as ignorant as fish it would be best for they to stick to they shop accord to they natural instinct but they vanity have be foolishly tickled and they have be urge to mix themselves up with public affair and give they opinion on the universe they can naturally have but scatter view on such subject and in default of personal judgment they drift with the current react with extreme quickness to any shock for they be ultra-sensitive with a morbid vanity which exaggerate the thought of other when it can not express they own this be the only originality at they disposal and god know they make the most of it what remain the clergy it be they who handle the heaviest explosive the idea of justice truth right and god and they make this artillery fight for they passion they absurd pride of which they be quite unconscious cause they to lay claim to the property of god and to the exclusive right to dispose of it wholesale and retail it be not so much that they lack sincerity virtue or kindness but they do lack humility they have none however much they may profess it they practice consist in adore they navel as they see it reflect in the talmud or the old and new testament they be monster of pride not so very far remove from the fool of legend who think himself god the father be it so much less dangerous to believe oneself he manager or he secretary clerambault be strike by the morbid character of the intellectual species in the _ bourgeois _ caste the power of organization and expression of idea have reach almost monstrous proportion the equilibrium of life be destroy by a bureaucracy of the mind which think itself much superior to the simple worker certainly no one can deny that it have its use it collect and classify thought in its pigeon-hole and put they to various purpose but the idea rarely occur to it to examine its material and renew the content of think it remain the vain guardian of a demonetised treasure if only this mistake be a harmless one but idea that be not constantly confront with reality which be not frequently dip into the stream of experience grow dry and take on a toxic character they throw a heavy shadow over the new life bring on the night and produce fever what a stupid thraldom to abstract word of what use be it to dethrone king and by what right do we jeer at those who die for they master if it be only to put tyrannic entity in they place which we adorn with they tinsel it be much better to have a flesh and blood monarch whom you can control -- suppress if necessary -- than these abstraction these invisible despot that no one know now nor ever have know we deal only with the head eunuch the priest of the hidden crocodile as taine call he the wire-pulling minister who speak in the idol 's name -- ah let we tear away the veil and know the creature hide inside of we there be less danger when man show frankly as a brute than when he drape himself in a false and sickly idealism he do not eliminate he animal instinct he only deify and try to explain they but as this can not be do without excessive simplification -- accord to the law of the mind which in order to grasp must let go a equal amount -- he disguise and intensify they in one direction everything that depart from the straight line or that interfere with the strict logic of he mental edifice he deny worse he pull it up by the root and command that it be destroy in the name of sacred principle it therefore follow that he cut down much of the infinite growth of nature and allow to stand only the tree of the mind that he choose -- generally those that flourish in desert and ruin and which there grow abnormally of such be the crush predominance of one single tyrannous form of the family of country and of the narrow morality which serve they the poor creature be proud of it all and it be he who be the victim humanity do not dare to massacre itself from interested motive it be not proud of its interest but it do pride itself on its idea which be a thousand time more deadly man see he own superiority in he idea and will fight for they but herein i perceive he folly for this warlike idealism be a disease peculiar to he and its effect be similar to those of alcoholism they add enormously to wickedness and criminality this sort of intoxication deteriorate the brain fill it with hallucination to which the living be sacrifice what a extraordinary spectacle see from the interior of we skull a throng of phantom rise from we overexcited brain : justice liberty right country we poor brain be all equally honest but each accuse the other of insincerity in this fantastic shadowy struggle we can distinguish nothing but the cry and the convulsion of the human animal possess by devil below be cloud charge with lightning where great fierce bird be fight the realist the man of affair swarm and gnaw like flea in a skin with open mouth and grasp hand secretly exciting the folly by which they profit but in which they do not share o think monstrous and splendid flower spring from the humus of we time-honoured instinct in truth thou art a element penetrate and impregnate man but thou dost not spring from he thy source be beyond he and thy strength greater than he we sens be fairly well-adapted to we need but we thought be not it overflow and madden we very very few among we man can guide themselves on this torrent the far greater number be sweep along at random trust to chance the tremendous power of thought be not under man 's control he try to make it serve he and he greatest danger be that he believe that it do so but he be like a child handle explosive there be no proportion between these colossal engine and the purpose for which he feeble hand employ they sometimes they all blow up together how guard against this danger shall we stifle think uproot live idea that would mean the castration of man 's brain the loss of he chief stimulus in life but nevertheless the _ eau-de-vie _ of he mind contain a poison which be the more to be dread because it be spread broadcast among the mass in the form of adulterated drug rouse thee man and sober thyself look about shake off idea free thyself from thine own thought and learn to govern thy gigantic phantom which devour themselves in they rage and begin by take the capital from the name of those great goddess country liberty right come down from olympus into the manger and come without ornament without arm rich only in you beauty and we love i do not know the god of justice and liberty i only know my brother-man and he act sometimes just sometimes unjust and i also know of people all aspire to real liberty but all deprive of it and who all more or less submit to oppression the sight of this world in a fever-fit would have fill a sage with the desire to withdraw until the attack be over but clerambault be not a sage he know this and he also know that it be vain to speak but none the less he feel that he must that he should end by speak he wish to delay the dangerous moment and he timidity which shrink from single combat with the world seek about he for a companion in think the fight would not be so hard if there be two or three together the first whose feeling he cautiously sound be some unfortunate people who like he have lose a son the father a well-known painter have a studio in the rue notre dame des champ he name be omer calville and the clerambault be neighbourly with he and he wife a nice old couple of the middle class devoted to each other they have that gentleness common to many artist of they day who have know carrière and catch remote reflection of tolstoïsm which like they simplicity appear a little artificial for though it harmonise with they real goodness of heart the fashion of the time have add a touch of exaggeration those artist who sincerely profess they religious respect for all that life be less capable than anyone else of understand the passion of war the calville have hold themselves outside the struggle they do not protest they accept it without acquiesce as one accept sickness death or the wickedness of man with a dignified sadness when clerambault read they he burning poem they listen politely and make little response -- but strangely enough at the very time that clerambault cure of he warlike illusion turn to they he find that they have change place with he the death of they son have produce on they the opposite effect and now they be awkwardly take part in the conflict as if to replace they lose boy they snuff up eagerly all the stench in the papers and clerambault find they actually rejoice in they misery over the assertion that the united state be prepare to fight for twenty year what would become of france of europe in twenty year he try to say but they hastily put this think away from they with much irritation almost as if it be improper to mention or even to think of such a thing the question be to conquer at what price that could be settle afterwards -- conquer suppose there be no more conqueror leave in france never mind so long as the other be beat no it should not be that the blood of they son have be shed in vain and to avenge he death must other innocent life also be sacrifice think clerambault and in the heart of these good people he read the answer : why not the same idea be in the mind of all those who like the calville have lose through the war what they hold dearest -- a son a husband or a brother let the other suffer as we have we have nothing leave to lose be there nothing leave in truth there be one thing only on which the fierce egotism of these mourner keep jealous guard they faith in the necessity of these sacrifice let no one try to shake that or doubt that the cause be sacred for which these dear one fall the leader of the war know this and well do they understand how to make the most of such a lure no by these sad fire-side there be no place for clerambault 's doubt and feeling of pity they have no pity on we think the unhappy one why should we pity they some have suffer less but what characterise nearly all of these _ bourgeois _ be the reverence they have for the great slogan of the past : committee of public safety the country in danger plutarch _ de viris _ horace -- it seem impossible for they to look at the present with eye of today perhaps they have no eye to see with outside of the narrow circle of they own affair how many of we anemic _ bourgeoisie _ have the power to think for themselves after they have reach the age of thirty it would never cross they mind they thought be furnish to they like they provision only more cheaply for one or two cent a day they get they from they papers the more intelligent who look for think in book do not give themselves the trouble to seek it also in life and think that one be the reflection of the other like the prematurely age they member become stiff and they mind petrified in the great flock of those ruminate soul who feed on the past the group of bigot pin its faith to the french revolution be easily distinguish among the backward _ bourgeoisie _ they be reckon incendiary in former day -- about the time of the 16th of may or a little later like quinquagenarian grow stolid and settle they look back with pride to they wild conduct and live on the memory of the emotion of by-gone day if they mirror show they no change the world have alter around they without they suspect it while they continue to copy they antiquated model it be a curious imitative instinct a slavery of the brain to remain hypnotised by some point in the past instead of try to follow proteus in he course -- the life of change one pick up the old skin which the young snake have throw off long ago and try to sew it together again these pedantic admirer of old revolution believe that those of the future will be make on the same line they will not see that the new liberty must have a gait of its own and will overleap barrier before which its grandmother of ninety-three stop out of breath they be also much more vex by the disrespect of the young people who have go by they than they be by the spiteful yelping of the old whom they have leave behind this be only natural for these young folk make they feel they age and then it be they turn to yelp so it ever shall be as they grow older there be very few man willing to let life take its own course and who be generous enough to look at the future through the eye of they junior as they own sight grow dim the greater number of those who love liberty in they youth want to make a case of it now for the new brood because they can no longer fly themselves the follower of the national revolutionary cult -- in the style of danton or of robespierre -- be the bitterest adversary of the internationalism of today though they do not always agree perfectly amongst themselves and the friend of danton and robespierre with the shadow of the guillotine between they hurl the epithet of heretic at each other with the deadliest threat they do however all agree on one point and devote to destruction those who do not believe that liberty be shoot out of the mouth of cannon those who dare to feel the same aversion towards violence whether it be exert by caesar demo or he satellite or even if it be in the name of right and liberty itself the face underneath be the same no matter what mask may be worn clerambault know several of these fanatic but there be no point in discuss with they whether the right or its counterfeit be only on one side in war it would have be equally sensible to argue about the holy inquisition with a manichee lay religion have they great seminary and secret society where they deposit they doctrinal treasure with great pride he who depart from these be excommunicate -- until he in turn belong to the past when he become a god and can excommunicate in future himself \* \* \* \* \* if clerambault be not tempt to convert these harden intellectual with they stiff helmet of truth he know other who have not the same proud certainty far from it those who sin rather through softness and pure dilettantism -- arsène asselin be one of these a amiable parisian unmarried a man of the world clever and sceptical and as much shock by a defect in sentiment as in expression how could he like extreme of thought which be the culture in which the germ of war develop he critical and sarcastic spirit incline he towards doubt so there be no reason why he should not have understand clerambault 's point of view and he come within a ace of do so he choice depend on some fortuitous circumstance but from the moment that he turn he face in the other direction it be impossible for he to go back and the more he stick in the mud the more obstinate he grow french self-respect can not bear to admit its mistake it would rather die in defense of they but french or not how many be there in the world who would have the strength of mind to say : i have make a mistake we must begin all over again better deny the evidence to the bitter end and then break down alexandre mignon be a before-the-war pacifist and a old friend of clerambault 's he be a _ bourgeois _ of about he own age intellectual a member of the university and justly respect for the dignity of he life he should not be confound with those parlor pacifist cover with official decoration and grand cordon of international order for whom peace be a gilt-edged investment in quiet time for thirty year he have sincerely denounce the dangerous intrigue of the dishonest politician and speculator of he country he be a member of the league for the rights of man and love to make speech for either cause as it might happen it be enough if he client purported to be oppress it do not matter if the victim have be a would-be oppressor himself he blundering generosity sometimes make he ridiculous but he be always like he do not object to the ridicule nor do he dread a little unpopularity as long as he be surround by he own group whose approbation be necessary to he as a member of a group which be independent when they all hold together he think that he be a independent person but this be not the case union be strength they say but it accustom we to lean upon it as alexandre mignon find to he cost the death of jaurès have break up the group and lack one voice -- the first to speak -- all the other fail they wait for the password that no one dare to give when the torrent break over they these generous but weak man be uncertain and be carry away by the first rush they do not understand nor approve of it but they could make no resistance from the begin desertion begin in they rank produce largely by the terrible speech-maker who then govern the country -- demagogue lawyer practice in all the sophistry of republican idealogy : war for peace lasting peace at the end -lrb- _ requiescat _ -rrb- in these artifice the poor pacifist see a way to get out of they dilemma it be not a very brilliant way and they be not proud of it but it be they only chance they hope to reconcile they pacific principle with the fact of violence by means of big talk which do not sound to they as outrageous as it really be to refuse would have be to give themselves up to the war-like pack which would have devour they alexandre mignon would have have courage to face the bloody jaw if he have have he little community at he back but alone it be beyond he strength he let thing go at first without commit himself but he suffer pass through agony something like those of clerambault but with a different result he be less impulsive and more intellectual in order to efface he last scruple he hide they under close reasoning and with the aid of he colleague he laboriously prove by a + b that war be the duty of consistent pacifism he league have every advantage in dwelling on the criminal act of the enemy but do not dwell on those in its own camp alexandre mignon have occasional glimpse of the universal injustice a intolerable vision on which he close he shutter in proportion as he be swaddle in he war argument it become more difficult for he to disentangle himself and he persist more and more suppose a child carelessly pull off the wing of a insect it be only a piece of nervous awkwardness but the insect be do for and the child ashamed and irritated tear the poor creature to piece to relieve he own feeling the pleasure with which he listen to clerambault 's _ mea culpa _ may be imagine but the effect be surprising mignon already ill at ease turn on clerambault whose self-accusation seem to point at he and treat he like a enemy in the sequel no one be more violent than mignon against this living remorse \* \* \* \* \* there be some politician who would have understand clerambault better for they know as much as he do and perhaps more but it do not keep they awake at night they have be use to mental trickery ever since they cut they first tooth and be expert at _ combinazione _ they have the illusion of serve they party cheaply gain by a few compromise here and there to think and walk straightforwardly be the one thing impossible to these flabby shuffler who back or advance in spiral who drag they banner in the mud by way of assure its triumph and who to reach the capitol would have crawl up the step on they stomach \* \* \* \* \* here and there some clear-sighted spirit be hide but they be easier to guess at than to see they be melancholy glow-worm who have put out they lantern in they fright so that not a gleam be visible they certainly have no faith in the war but neither do they believe in anything against it -- fatalist pessimist all it be clear to clerambault that when personal energy be lack the highest quality of head and heart only increase the public servitude the stoicism which submit to the law of the universe prevent we from resist those which be cruel instead of say to destiny : no thus far and no farther if it push on you will see the stoic stand politely aside as he murmur : please come in -- cultivate heroism the taste for the superhuman even the inhuman choke the soul with its sacrifice and the more absurd they be the more sublime they appear -- christian of today more generous than they master render all to caesar a cause seem sacred to they from the moment that they be ask to immolate themselves to it to the ignominy of war they piously kindle the flame of they faith and throw they body on the altar the people bend they back and accept with a passive ironic resignation no need to borrow trouble age and age of misery have roll over this stone but in the end stone do wear down and become mud clerambault try to talk with one and another of these people but find himself everywhere oppose by the same hidden half-unconscious resistance they be arm with the will not to hear or rather with a remarkable not-will to hear they mind be as impervious to contrary argument as a duck 's feather to water man in general be endowed for they comfort with a precious faculty they can make themselves blind and deaf when it do not suit they to see and hear and when by chance they pick up some inconvenient object they drop it quickly and forget it as soon as possible how many citizen in any country know the truth about the divide responsibility for the war or about the ill-omened part play by they politician who themselves deceive pretend with great success to be ignorant if everyone be try to escape from himself it be clear that a man will run faster from someone who like clerambault would help he to recover himself in order to avoid they own conscience intelligent serious honorable man do not blush to employ the little trick of a woman or a child try to get its own way and dread a discussion which might unsettle they they would seize on the first awkward expression use by clerambault they would separate it from the context dress it up if necessary and with raise voice and eye start from they head feign a indignation which they end by feel sincerely they would repeat _ mordicus _ even after the proof and if oblige to admit it would rush off bang the door after they : can not stand any more of that but two or perhaps ten day after they would come back and renew the argument as if nothing have happen some treacherous one provoke clerambault to say more than he intend and have gain they point explode with rage but even the most good-natured tell he that he lack good sense -- good of course meaning my way of think there be the clever talker also who have nothing to fear from a contest of word begin a argument in the flattering hope that they could bring the wander sheep back to the fold it be not he main idea that they dispute so much as its desirability they would appeal to clerambault 's better side : certainly of course i think as you do or almost as you do i understand what you mean but you ought to be cautious my dear friend not to trouble the conscience of those who have to fight you can not always speak the truth at least not all at once these fine thing may come about in fifty year perhaps we must wait and not go too fast for nature wait until the appetite of the exploiter and the folly of the exploit be equally exhaust when the thinking of clear-sighted better sort give way to the blindness of coarser mind it go directly contrary to that nature which it profess to follow and against the historical destiny which they themselves make it a point of honor to obey for do we respect the plan of nature when we stifle one part of its thought and the higher at that the theory which would lop off the strongest force from life and bend it before the passion of the multitude would result in suppress the advance-guard and leave the army without leader when the boat lean over must i not throw my weight on the other side to keep a even keel or must we all sit down to leeward advanced idea be nature 's weight intend to counter-balance the heavy stubborn past without they the boat will upset the welcome they will receive be a side issue they advocate can expect to be stone but whoever have these thing in he mind and do not speak they be a dishonoured man he be like a soldier in battle to whom a dangerous message be entrust be he free to shirk it why do not everyone understand these thing when they see that persuasion have no effect on clerambault they unmask they battery and violently tax he with absurd criminal pride they ask he if he think himself cleverer than anyone else that he set himself up against the entire nation on what do he find this overweening self-confidence duty consist in be humble and keep to one 's proper place in the community when it command we duty be to bow to it and whether we agree or not we must carry out its order woe to the rebel against the soul of he country to be in the right and in opposition to she be to be wrong and in the hour of action wrong be a crime the republic demand obedience from she son the republic or death say clerambault ironically and this be a free country free yes because there have always be and always will be some soul like mine which refuse to bend to a yoke which they conscience disavow we be become a nation of tyrant there be no great advantage in take the bastille in the old day one run the risk of perpetual imprisonment if one make so bold as to differ from the prince -- the fagot if you do not agree with the church but now you must think with forty million of man and follow they in they frantic contradiction one day you must scream : down with england tomorrow it will be : down with germany and the next day it may be the turn of italy and _ da capo _ in a week or two today we acclaim a man or a idea tomorrow we shall insult he and anyone who refuse risk dishonor -- or a pistol bullet this be the most ignoble and shameful servitude of all by what right do a hundred a thousand one or forty million of man demand that i shall renounce my soul each of they have one like mine forty million of soul together often make only one which have deny itself forty million of time i think what i think go you and do likewise the living truth can be re-born only from the equilibrium of oppose thought to make the citizen respect the city it must be reciprocal each have he soul it be he right and he first duty be to be true to it i have no illusion and in this world of prey i do not attribute a exaggerated importance to my own conscience but however small we may be or little we may do we must exist we be all liable to err but deceive or not a man should be sincere a honest mistake be not a lie but a stage on the road to truth the real lie be to fear the truth and try to stifle it even if you be a thousand time right if you resort to force to crush a sincere mistake you commit the most odious crime against reason itself if reason be persecutor and error persecute i be for the victim for error have rights as well as truth truth -- the real truth be to be always seek what be true and to respect the effort of those who suffer in the pursuit if you insult a man who be strive to hew out he path if you persecute he who wish and perhaps fail to find less inhuman road for human progress you make a martyr of he you way be the best the only one you say follow it then and let I follow mine i do not oblige you to come with I so why be you angry be you afraid lest i should prove to be in the right the impression leave on clerambault 's mind by he last interview with perrotin be one of sadness and pity but on the whole he decide to go again to see he have by now arrive at a better understanding of he ironical and prudent attitude towards the world if he have retain but small esteem for perrotin 's character on the other hand the great intelligence of the old scholar continue to command he highest admiration he still see in he a guide towards the light perrotin be not exactly delighted to see clerambault again the other day he have be oblige to commit a little cowardly act he do not mind that for he be use to it but it be under the eye of a incorruptible witness and he be too clever not to have retain a disagreeable memory of the incident he foresee a discussion and he hate to discuss with people who have conviction -- there be no fun in it they take everything so seriously -- however he be courteous weak good-natured and unable to refuse when anyone attack he vigorously he try at first to avoid serious question but when he see that clerambault really need he and that perhaps he might save he from some imprudence he consent with a sigh to give up he morning clerambault related to he all that he have do and the result he realize that the world around serve other god than he for he have share the same faith and even now be impartial enough to see a certain grandeur and beauty in it since these last trial however he have also see its horror and absurdity he have abandon it for a new ideal which would certainly bring he into conflict with the old with brief and passionate touch clerambault explain this new ideal and call on perrotin to say if to he it seem true or false entreat he friend to lay aside consideration of tact or politeness to speak clearly and frankly strike by clerambault 's tragic earnestness perrotin change he tone and answer in the same key it amount to this that you think i be wrong ask clerambault distressed i see that i be alone in this but i can not help it do not try to spare I now but tell I be i wrong to think as i do no my friend reply perrotin gravely you be right then you agree that i ought to fight against these murderous mistake ah that be another matter ought i to betray the truth when it be clear to I truth my poor friend no do not look at I like that i shall not follow pilate 's example and ask : what be truth like you and longer than you perhaps i have love she but truth my dear sir be higher than you than i than all those that ever have or ever will inhabit the earth we may believe that we obey the great goddess but in fact we serve only the _ dî minore _ the saint in the side chapel alternately adore and neglect by the crowd the one in honor of whom man be now kill and mutilate themselves in a corybantic frenzy can evidently be no longer yours nor mine the ideal of the country be a god great and cruel who will leave to the future the image of a sort of bugaboo crono or of he olympian son whom christ superseded you ideal of humanity be the highest ring of the ladder the announcement of the new god -- who will be dethrone later on by one higher still who will embrace more of the universe the ideal and life never cease to evolve and this continual advance form the genuine interest of the world to the liberal mind but if the mind can constantly rise without rest or interruption in the world of fact progress be make step by step and a scant few inch be gain in the whole of a lifetime humanity limp along and you mistake the only one be that you be two or three day ' journey ahead of it but -- perhaps with good reason -- that be one of the mistake most difficult to forgive when a ideal like that of country begin to age with the form of society to which it be strongly bind the slightest attack make it ferocious and it will blaze out furiously in its exasperation the reason be that it have already begin to doubt itself do not deceive yourself these million of man who be slaughter each other now in the name of patriotism have no longer the early enthusiasm of 1792 or 1813 even though there be more noise and ruin today many of those who die and those who send they to they death feel in they heart the horrible touch of doubt but entangled as they be too weak to escape or even to imagine a way of salvation they proclaim they injured faith with a kind of despair and throw themselves blindly into the abyss they would like to throw in also those who first raise doubt in they by word or action to wish to destroy the dream of those who be die for its sake be to wish to kill twice over clerambault hold out he hand to stop he : -- ah you have no need to tell I that and it torture I do you think i be insensible to the pain of these poor soul whose faith i undermine respect the belief of other offend not one of these little one my god what can i do help I to get out of this dilemma shall i see wrong do let man go to ruin -- or risk injure they wind they faith draw hatred upon myself when i try to save they show I the law save yourself but that would be to lose myself if the price be the life of other if we do nothing you and i no effort would be too great -- the ruin of europe of the whole world be imminent perrotin sit quietly he elbow on the arm of he chair he hand fold over he buddha-like belly he twirl he thumb look kindly at clerambault shake he head and reply : you generous heart and you artistic sensibility urge you too far my friend but fortunately the world be not near its end this be not the first time and there will be many other what be happen today be painful certainly but not in the least abnormal war have never keep the earth from turn on its axis nor prevent the evolution of life it be even one of the form of its evolution let a old scholar and philosopher oppose he calm inhumanity to you holy man of sorrow in spite of all it may bring you some benefit this struggle this crisis which alarm you so much be no more than a simple case of systole a cosmic contraction tumultuous but regulate like the folding of the earth crust accompany by destructive earthquake humanity be tighten and war be its _ seismo _ yesterday in all country province be at war with each other before that in each province city fight together now that national unity have be reach a larger unity develop it be certainly regrettable that it should take place by violence but that be the natural method of the explosive mixture of conflicting element in conflict a new chemical body will be bear will it be in the east or in europe i can not tell but surely what result will have new property more valuable than its part the end be not yet the war of which we be now witness be magnificent -lrb- i beg you pardon i mean magnificent to the mind where suffering do not exist -rrb- greater finer conflict still be prepare these poor childish people who imagine that they can disturb the peace of eternity with they cannon shot the whole universe must first pass through the retort we shall have a war between the two america one between the new world and the yellow continent then the conqueror and the rest of the world that be enough to fill up a few century and i may not have see all my eye be not very good naturally each of these shock will lead to social struggle it will all be accomplish in about a dozen century -lrb- i be rather incline to think that it will be more rapid than it seem by comparison with the past for the movement become accelerate as it proceed -rrb- no doubt we shall arrive at a rather impoverished synthesis for many constituent element some good some bad will be destroy in the process the one be too delicate to resist the hostile environment the other injurious and impossible to assimilate then we shall have the celebrated united state of the whole world and this union will be all the more solid because as be probable man will be menace by a common danger the canal of mar the drying-up or cooling-off of the planet some mysterious plague the pendulum of poe in short the vision of a inevitable death overwhelming the human race there will be great thing to behold the genius of the race stretch to the uttermost in its last agony there will be on the other hand very little liberty human multiplicity when near its end will fuse itself into a unity of will do we not see the beginning already thus without abrupt mutation will be effect the reintegration of the complex in the one of old empedocle ' hatred in love and what then after that a rest and then it will all begin over again there can be no doubt a young cycle the new kalpa the world will turn once more on the re-forged wheel and what be the answer to the riddle the hindoo would tell you siva siva who create and destroy destroy and create what a hideous dream that be a affair of temperament wisdom liberate to the hindoo buddha be the deliverer as for I curiosity be a sufficient reward it would not be enough for I and i can not content myself either with the wisdom of a selfish buddha who set himself free by desert the rest i know the hindoo as you do and i love they but even among they buddha have not say the last word of wisdom do you remember that bodhisattva the master of pity who swear not to become buddha never to find freedom in nirvana until he have cure all pain redeem all crime console all sorrow perrotin smile and pat clerambault 's hand affectionately as he look at he troubled face dear old bodhisattva he say what do you want to do and whom would you save oh i know well enough say clerambault hang he head i know how small i be how little i can do the weakness of my wish and protestation do not think I so vain but how can i help it if i feel it be my duty to speak you duty be to do what be right and reasonable not to sacrifice yourself in vain do you certainly know what be in vain can you tell beforehand which seed will germinate and which will turn out sterile and perish but you sow seed nevertheless what progress would ever have be make if those who bear the germ of it have stop terrify before the enormous mass of accumulate routine which hang ready to crush they above they head i admit that a scholar be bind to defend the truth that he have discover but be this social question you mission you be a poet keep to you dream and may they prove a defense to you before consider myself as a poet i consider myself as a man and every honest man have a mission a mind like yours be too precious and valuable to be sacrifice it would be murder yes you be willing to sacrifice people who have little to lose he be silent for a moment and then go on : perrotin i have often think that we man of thought artist all of we we do not live up to we obligation not only now but for a long time perhaps always we be custodian of the portion of truth that be in we a little light which we have prudently keep for ourselves more than once this have trouble I but i shut my eye to it then now they have be unsealed by suffer we be the privileged one and that lay duty upon we which we have not fulfil we be afraid of compromise ourselves there be a aristocracy of the mind which claim to succeed to that of blood but it forget that the privilege of the old order be first purchase with blood for age mankind have listen to word of wisdom but it be rare to see the wise man offer themselves as a sacrifice though it would do no harm if the world should see some of they stake they life on they doctrine as in the heroic day sacrifice be the condition of fecundity to make other believe you must believe first yourself and prove it man do not see a truth simply because it exist it must have the breath of life and this spirit which be ours we can and ought to give if not we thought be only amusement of dilettante -- a play which deserve only a little applause man who advance the history of the world make stepping-stone of they own life how much higher than all we great man be the son of the carpenter of galilee humanity know the difference between they and the savior but do he save it ` when jahveh speak : ` tis my desire he people work to feed the fire ' you circle of flame be the last terror and man exist only to break through that he may come out of it free free repeat perrotin with he quiet smile yes free it be the highest good but few reach it although the name be common enough it be as exceptional as real beauty or real goodness by a free man i mean one who can liberate himself from himself he passion he blind instinct those of he surroundings or of the moment it be say that he do this in obedience to the voice of reason but reason in the sense that you give it be a mirage it be only another passion harden intellectualised and therefore fanatical no he must put himself out of sight in order to get a clear view over the cloud of dust raise by the flock on the road of today to take in the whole horizon so as to put event in they proper place in the scheme of the universe then say perrotin he must accommodate himself to the law of that universe not necessarily say clerambault he can oppose they with a clear conscience if they be contrary to right and happiness liberty consist in that very thing that a free man be in himself a conscious law of the universe a counter-balance to the crush machine the automaton of spitteler the bronze _ ananké _ i see the universal be three part of he still embedded in the clay the bark or the stone undergo the implacable law of the matter in which he be encrust he breath and he eye alone be free i hope say he look and he breath declare i will with the help of these he struggle to release himself we be the look and the breath that be what make a free man the look be enough for I say perrotin gently and without the breath i should die exclaimed clerambault in a man of think there be a wide interval between the word and the deed even when a thing be decide upon he find pretext for put it off to another day for he see only too clearly what will follow what pain and trouble and to what end in order to calm he restless soul he pour out a flood of energetic language on he intimate friend or to himself alone and in this way gain the illusion of action cheaply enough in the bottom of he heart he do not believe in it but like hamlet he wait till circumstance shall force he hand clerambault be brave enough when he be talk to the indulgent perrotin but he have scarcely get home when he be seize again by he hesitation sharpen by he sorrow he sensitiveness anticipate the emotion of those around he he imagine the discord that he word would cause between himself and he wife and worse without exactly know why he be not sure of he daughter 's sympathy and shrink from the trial the risk be too great for a affectionate heart like he matter stand thus when a doctor of he acquaintance write that he have a man dangerously wound in he hospital who have be in the great champagne offensive and have know maxime clerambault go at once to see he on the bed he see a man who might have be of any age he lay still on he back swathe like a mummy he thin peasant-face all wrinkled and brown with the big nose and gray beard emerge from the white bandage outside the sheet you could see he right hand rough and work-worn a joint of the middle-finger be miss -- but that do not matter it be a peace injury he eye look out calmly under the bushy eyebrow they clear gray light be unexpected in the burn face clerambault come close and ask he how he do and the man thank he politely without give detail as if it be not worth the trouble to talk about oneself you be very good sir i be get on all right but clerambault persist affectionately and it do not take long for the gray eye to see that there be something deeper than curiosity in the blue eye that bent over he where be you wound ask clerambault oh a little of everywhere it would take too long to tell you sir but as he visitor continue to press he : there be a wound wherever they could find a place shoot up all over i never should have think there would have be room enough on a little man like I clerambault find out at last that he have receive about a score of wound seventeen to be exact he have be literally sprinkle -- he call it interlard -- with shrapnel wound in seventeen place cry clerambault i have only a dozen leave say the man do they cure the other no they cut my leg off clerambault be so shocked that he almost forget the object of he visit great heaven what agony we suffering in comparison be a drop in the ocean he put he hand over the rough one and press it the calm gray eye take in clerambault from he foot to the crape on he hat you have lose someone yes say clerambault pull himself together you must have know sergeant clerambault surely say the man i know he he be my son the gray eye soften ah sir i _ be _ sorry for you i should think i do know he poor little chap we be together for nearly a year and a year like that count i can tell you day after day we be like mole burrow in the same hole we have we share of trouble do he suffer much well sir it _ be _ pretty bad sometimes hard on the boy just at the first you see he be not use to it like we you come from the country i be labourer on a farm you have to live with the beast and you get to be like 'em but it be the truth i tell you now sir that man do treat each other worse than the beast ` be kind to the animal ' that be on a notice a joker stick up in we trench but what be not good enough for they be good enough for we all right i be not kick thing be like that we have to take it as it come but you could see that the little sergeant have never be up against it before the rain and the mud and the meanness the dirt worst of all everything that you touch you food you skin full of vermin he come close to cry i could see once or twice when he be new to it i would not let on that i notice for the boy be proud do not want any help but i would jolly he try to cheer he up lend he a hand sometimes he be glad to get it you see you have to get together but before long he could stick it out as well as anybody then it be he turn to help I i never hear he squeal and we have gay time together -- must have a joke now and then no matter what happen it keep off bad luck clerambault sit and listen with a heavy heart be he happier towards the last he ask yes sir i think he be what you call resigned just like we all be i do not know how it be but you all seem to start out with the same foot in the morning we be all different but somehow after a while it seem as if we be grow alike it be better too that way you do not mind thing so much all in a bunch it be only when you get leave and after you come back -- it be bad nothing go right any more you ought to have see the little sergeant that last time clerambault feel a pang as he say quickly : when he come back he be very low i do not know as i ever see he so bad before a agonised expression come over clerambault 's face and at he gesture the wounded man who have be look at the ceiling while he talk turn he eye and understand for he add at once : he pull himself together again after that tell I what he say to you tell I everything say clerambault again take he hand the sick man hesitate and answer i do not think i just remember what he say then he shut he eye and lay still while clerambault bent over he and try to see what be before those eye under they closed lid \* \* \* \* \* a icy moonless night from the bottom of the hollow _ boyau _ one could see the cold sky and the fix star bullet rattle on the hard ground maxime and he friend sit huddle up in the trench smoking with they chin on they knee the lad have come back that day from paris he be depress would not answer question shut himself up in a sulky silence the other have leave he all the afternoon to bear he trouble alone now here in the darkness he feel that the moment have come and sit a little closer for he know that the boy would speak of he own accord a bullet over they head glance off knock down a lump of frozen turf hullo old gravedigger say the other do not get too fresh might as well make a end of it now say maxime that be what they all seem to want give the boche you skin for a present i 'll say you be generous it be not only the boche they all have a hand in it who all all of they back there where i come from in paris friend and relation the people on the other side of the grave the live one -- as for we we be as good as dead in the long silence that follow they could hear the scream of a shell across the sky maxime 's comrade blow out a mouthful of smoke well youngster he say it do not go right back there this time do it -- i guess as much i do not know why when one be hurt and the other be not they have not much to say to one another oh they suffer too not the same you can not make a man know what a toothache be unless he feel it can not be do go to they all snuggle up in they bed and make they understand how it be out here it be nothing new to I i do not have to wait for the war always have live like this but do you believe when i be work in the soil sweating all the fat off my bone that any of they bother they head about I i do not mean that there be any harm in they nor much good either but like anybody else they do not see how it be to understand a thing properly you have get to take hold of it yourself take the work and the hurt if not and that be what it be you know -- might as well make up you mind -- no use try to explain that be the way thing be and we can not do anything about it life would not be worth live if it be as bad as that why not by gosh i have stick it out all this time and you be just as good as I better because you have get more brain and can learn that be the way to get on the harder it be the more it teach you and then when you be together like we here and thing be rocky it be not a pleasure exactly but it be not all pain the worst be to be off by yourself and you be not lonesome be you boy maxime look he in the face as he answer : i be back there but i do not feel it here with you \* \* \* \* \* the man who lay on the bed say nothing of what have be pass before he closed eye he turn they tranquilly on the father whose agonised look seem to implore he to speak and then with a awkward kindness he try to explain that if the boy be down-heart it be probably because he have just leave home but _ they _ have cheer he up as well as they could they know how he feel he have never know what it be to have a father himself but when he be a kid he use to think what luck it would be to have one so i think i might try i speak to he sir like you would yourself and he soon quiet down he say all the same there be one thing we get out of this bloom war that there be lot of poor devil in the world who do not know each other but be all make alike sometimes we call 'em we brother in sermon and place like that but no one take much stock in it if you want to know it be true you have to slave together like we -- he kiss I then sir clerambault rise and bend over the bandaged face kiss the wounded man 's rough cheek tell I something that i can do for you he say you be very good sir but there be not much you can do now i be so use up no leg and a broken arm i be no good -- what could i work at besides it be not sure yet that i shall pull through we 'll have to leave it at that if i go out good-bye if not can not do anything but wait there be plenty of train as clerambault admire he patience he repeat he refrain : i have get the habit there be no merit in be patient when there be nothing else to do a little more or less what do it matter it be like life this war be clerambault saw that in he egotism he have ask the man nothing about himself he do not even know he name my name it be a good fit for I -- courtoi aimé be what they call I -- aimé that be the christian name fine for a unlucky fellow like I and courtoi on the top of it queer enough be not it i never have a family come out of a orphan asylum my foster-father a farmer down in champagne offer to bring I up and you can bet he do it i have all the training i want but anyhow it learn I what i have to expect i have have all that be come to I thereupon he tell in a few brief dry phrase without emotion of the series of bad luck which have make up he life marriage with a girl as poor as himself -- hunger wedding thirst as they say sickness and death the struggle with nature -- it would not be so bad if man would only help _ homo homini homo _ all the social injustice weigh on the under dog as he listen clerambault could not keep down he indignation but aimé courtoi take it as a matter of course that be the way it always have be and always will be some be bear to suffer other not you can not have mountain without valley the war seem perfectly idiotic to he but he would not have lift a finger to prevent it he have in he way the fatalist passivity of the people which hide itself on gallic soil behind a veil of ironic carelessness the no use in get in a sweat about it of the trench then there be also that false pride of the french who fear nothing so much as ridicule and would risk death twenty time over for something they know to be absurd rather than be laugh at for a act of unusual common-sense you might as well try to stop the lightning as talk against war when it hail there be nothing to do but to cover over you cold-frame if you can and when it be over go round and see how much be leave of you crop and they will keep on do this until the next hailstorm the next war to the end of time no use get in a sweat it would never occur to they that man can change man this stupid heroic resignation irritated clerambault profoundly the upper class be charm with it no doubt for they owe they existence to it -- but it make a danaïd 's sieve of the human race and its age-long effort since all its courage its virtue and its labor be spend in learn how to die but when he look at the fragment of a man before he he heart be pierce with a infinite pity what could this wretched man do symbol as he be of the mutilate sacrifice people for so many century he have bleed and suffer under we eye while we he more fortunate brother have only encouraged he to persevere throw he some careless word of praise from a distance which cost we nothing what help have we ever give he nothing at all in action and little enough in word we owe to he sacrifice the leisure to think but all the fruit of we thought we have keep for ourselves we have not give he a taste of it we be afraid of the light of impudent opinion and the ruler of the hour who call to we say : put it out you who have the light hide it if you wish to be pardon oh let we be coward no more for who will speak if we do not the other be gag and must die without a word a wave of pain pass over the feature of the wounded man with eye fix on the ceiling he big mouth twist he tooth obstinately clench he could say no more -- clerambault go away he mind be make up the silence of this soldier on he bed of agony have bring he to a decision he would speak part three clerambault come back from the hospital shut himself into he room and begin to write he wife try to come in to discover what he be do it seem as if the good woman have a suspicion a intuition rare with she which give she a sort of obscure fear of what she husband might be about to do but he succeed in keep she away until he have finish ordinarily not a line of he be spare to he family it be a pleasure to he simple-hearted affectionate vanity and a duty towards they love also which none of they would have neglect this time however he do neglect it for reason which he would not admit to himself for though he be far from imagine the consequence of he act he be afraid of they objection he do not feel sure enough to expose himself to they and so prefer to confront they with the accomplished fact he first word be a cry of self-accusation : _ forgive we ye dead _ this public confession begin with a inscription a musical phrase of david 's lament over the body of he son absalom : _ oh absalom my son my son _ _ i have a son whom i loved and send to he death you father of mourning europe million of father widow of you son enemy or friend i do not speak for myself only but for you who be stain with they blood even as i be you all speak by the voice of one of you -- my unhappy voice full of sorrow and repentance _ _ my son die for yours by yours -- how can i tell -- like yours i lay the blame on the enemy and on the war as you must also have do but i see now that the chief criminal the one whom i accuse be myself yes i be guilty and that mean you and all of we you must listen while i tell you what you know well enough but do not want to hear _ _ my son be twenty year old when he fall in this war twenty year i have love he protect he from hunger cold and sickness save he from darkness of mind ignorance error and all the pitfall that lie in the shadow of life but what do i do to defend he against this scourge which be come upon we _ _ i be never one of those who compound with the passion of jealous nationality i love man and they future brotherhood be a joy to I why then do i do nothing against the impending danger against the fever that brood within we against the false peace which make ready to kill with a smile on its lip _ _ i be perhaps afraid to displease other afraid of enmity it be true i care too much to love above all to be love i fear to lose the good-will of those around I however feeble and insipid such a feeling may be it be a sort of play act by ourselves and other no one be deceive by it since both side shrink from the word which might crack the plaster and bring the house about we ear there be a inward equivocation which fear to see clearly in itself want to make the best of everything to reconcile old instinct and new belief mutually destructive force like the idea of country and humanity war and peace we be not sure which side to take we lean first one way and then the other like a see-saw afraid of the effort need to come to a decision and choose what slothful cowardice be here all whitewash over with a comfortable faith in the goodness of thing which will we think settle themselves and we continue to look on and glorify the impeccable course of destiny pay court to blind force _ _ fail we other thing -- and other man -- have choose and not till then do we understand we mistake but it be so dreadful to admit it and we be so unaccustomed to be honest that we act as if we be in sympathy with the crime in proof of this sympathy we have give up we own son whom we love with all we heart more than life -- if we could but give we life for theirs -- but not more than we pride with which we try to veil the moral confusion the empty darkness of mind and heart _ _ we will say nothing of those who still believe in the old idol grim envious blood be-spattered as she be -- the barbarous country these kill sacrifice themselves and other but at least they know what they do but what of those who have cease to believe -lrb- like I alas and you -rrb- they son be sacrifice to a lie for if you assert what you doubt it be a falsehood and they offer up they own child to prove this lie to themselves and now that we beloved have die for it far from confess it we hide we head still deeper not to see what we have do after we son will come other all the other offer up for we untruth _ _ i for my part can bear it no longer when i think of those who still live do it soothe my pain to inflict injury on other be i a savage of homer 's time that i should believe that the sorrow of my dead son will be appease and he craving for light satisfied if i sprinkle the earth which cover he with the blood of other man 's son -- be we at that stage still -- no each new murder kill my son again and heap the heavy mud of crime over he grave he be the future if i would save the future i must save he also and rescue father to come from the agony that i endure come then and help I cast out these falsehood surely it be not for we sake that man wage these combat between nation this universal brigandage what good be it to we a tree grow up straight and tall stretch out branch around it full of free-flowing sap so be a man who labor calmly and see the slow development of the many-sided life in he vein fulfil itself in he and in he son be not this the first law the first of joy brother of the world which of you envy the other or would deprive they of this just happiness what have we to do with the ambition and rivalry covetousness and ill of the mind which they dignify with the name of patriotism we country mean you father and son all we son -- come and save they _ clerambault ask no one 's advice but as soon as he have write these page he take they to the editor of a small socialist paper nearby he come back much relieved as he think : that be off my mind i have speak out at last but in the follow night a weight on he heart tell he that the burden be still there heavier than ever he rouse himself what have i do he feel that he have be almost immodest to show he sacred sorrow to the public and though he do not foresee the anger he article would provoke he know the lack of comprehension the coarse comment which be in themselves a profanation day pass and nothing happen silence the appeal have fall on the ear of a inattentive public the publisher be little known the pamphlet carelessly issue there be none so deaf as those who will not hear and the few reader who be attract by clerambault 's name merely glance at the first line and throw it aside think : the poor man 's head have be turn by he sorrow -- a good pretext for not wish to upset they own balance a second article follow in which clerambault take a final leave of the bloody old fetish falsely call country or rather in opposition to the great flesh-eater the she-wolf of rome on whose altar man be now offer up he set the August mother of all live the universal country : _ to she whom we have love _ _ there can be nothing more bitter than to be part from she whom one have love i lacerate my own heart when i tear country from it -- dear beautiful and good as she seem there be some ardent lover so blind that they can forget all the joy and love of former day and see only the change in the loved one and the harm that she have do they if it be only possible for I to be like that but i can not it be impossible for I to forget i must see thee always as i love thee when i trust and see in thee my guide and my best friend -- oh my country why hast thou desert and betray I if i be the only one to suffer i could hide the sad disenchantment under the memory of my former affection but i behold thy victim these trust devoted youth -- i see myself in they as i be -- and how greatly thou hast deceive we thine be as the voice of fraternal love thou calledst we that we might all be unite all brother -- no more isolation to each be lend the strength of million of other and we be teach to love we sky we soil and the work of we hand that in they we should love each other more for thy sake now where have we be lead do we unite to increase and grow stronger to hate and destroy we have know too much of these isolate hatred in the past each have he load of evil thought but at least we know they to be evil but now we soul be poison since

be mad people of the earth instead of defend you country you be kill she _ you _ be you country and the enemy be you brother million of god 's creature love one another _ the same silence as before seem to swallow up this last cry clerambault live outside of popular circle where he would have find the warm sympathy of simple healthy mind not the slightest echo of he thought come to he he know that he be not really alone though he seem so two apparently contradictory sentiment -- he modesty and he faith -- unite to say to he : what you think other have think also you be too small this truth be too great to exist only in you the light that you weak eye have see have shone also for other see where now the great bear incline to the horizon -- million of eye be look at it perhaps but you can not see they only the far-off light make a bond between they sight and yours the solitude of the mind be only a painful delusion it have no real existence for even the most independent of we be member of a spiritual family this community of spirit have no relation to time or space its element be disperse among all people and all age conservative see they in the past but the revolutionist and the persecute look to the future for they past and future be not less real than the immediate present which be a wall beyond which the calm eye of the flock can see nothing the present itself be not what the arbitrary division of state nation and religion would have we believe in we time humanity be a bazaar of idea unsorted and throw together in a heap with hastily construct partition between they so that brother be separate from brother and throw in with stranger every country have swallow up different race not form to think and act together so that each one of these spiritual family or families-in-law which we call nation comprise element which in fact form part of different group past present or future since these can not be destroy they be oppress they can escape destruction only by some subterfuge apparent submission inward rebellion or flight and voluntary exile they be _ heimatlo _ to reproach they for lack of patriotism be to blame irishman and pole for they resistance to english and prussian absorption no matter where they be man remain loyal to they true country you who pretend that the object of this war be to give the right of self-determination to all people when will you restore this right to the great republic of free soul disperse over the whole world however cut off from the world clerambault know that this republic exist like the rome of sertorius it dwelt in he and though they may be unknown each to the other it dwell in every man to whom it be the true country the wall of silence which surround clerambault 's word fall all at once but it be not a friendly voice which answer he it seem rather as if stupidity and blind hatred have make a breach where sympathy have be too weak to find a way several week have pass and clerambault be think of a new publication when one morning leo camus burst noisily into he room he be blue with rage as with the most tragic expression he hold up a newspaper before clerambault 's eye : read that he command and stand behind he brother-in-law as he read he go on : what do the beastly thing mean clerambault be dismayed to find himself stab by what he have believe to be a friendly hand a well-known writer a colleague of perrotin 's a serious honorable man and one always on good term with he have denounce he publicly and without hesitation though he have know clerambault long enough to have no doubt as to the purity of he intention he hold he up as a man dishonour a historian well use to the manipulation of text he seize upon detach phrase of clerambault 's pamphlet and brandish they as a act of treason a personal letter would not have satisfy he virtuous indignation he choose a loud yellow journal a laboratory of blackmail despise by a million frenchman who nevertheless swallow all its humbug with open mouth i can not believe it stammer clerambault who feel helpless before this unexpected hostility there be no time to be lose declare camus you must answer answer but what can i say the first thing of course be to deny it as a base invention but it be not a invention say clerambault look camus in the face it be the turn of the latter to look as if he have be strike by lightning you say it be not -- not he stammer i write the pamphlet say clerambault but the meaning have be distort by this article camus could not wait for the end of the sentence but begin to howl : you write a thing like that you a man like you clerambault try to calm he brother-in-law beg he not to judge until he know all but camus would do nothing but shout call he crazy and scream : i do not know anything about all that have you write against the war or the country yes or no i write that war be a crime and that all country be stain by it without allow clerambault to explain himself farther camus spring at he as if he mean to shake he by the collar but restrain himself he hiss in he face that he be the criminal and deserve to be try by court-martial at once the raise voice bring the servant to listen at the door and madame clerambault run in try to appease she brother in a high key clerambault volunteer to read the obnoxious pamphlet to camus but in vain as he refuse furiously declare that the papers have tell he all he want to know about such filth -lrb- he say all papers be liar but act on they falsehood none the less -rrb- then in a magisterial tone he call on clerambault to sit down and write on the spot a public recantation clerambault shrug he shoulder say that he be accountable to nothing but he own conscience -- that he be free no roar camus do you mean that i be not free to say what i think you be not free you have no right to say such thing cry the exasperated camus you country have claim on you and you family first of all they ought to shut you up he insist that the letter should be write that very moment but clerambault simply turn he back on he so he leave bang the door after he and vow that he would never set foot there again that all be over between they after this poor clerambault have to submit to a string of question from he wife who without know what he have do lament he imprudence and ask with tear : why why he have not keep silent have they not trouble enough what be this mania he have for talk and particularly for talk differently from other people while this be go on rosine come back from a errand and clerambault appeal to she tell she in a confused manner of the painful scene that have just take place and beg she to sit down there by he table and let he read the article to she without even take off she hat and glove rosine do sit down near he and listen sensibly sweetly and when he have do kiss he and say : yes i think it be fine -- but dear papa why do you do it clerambault be completely take aback what you ask why i do it do not you think it be right i do not know yes i believe it must be right since you say so but perhaps it be not necessary to write it not necessary but if it be right it must be necessary but if it make such a fuss that be no reason against it but why stir people up look here my little girl you think as i do about this do you not yes papa i suppose so you only suppose come now you detest the war as i do and wish it be over everything that i write there i have say to you and you agree yes papa then you think i be right yes papa she put she arm around he neck but we do not have to write everything that we think clerambault much depressed try to explain what seem so evident to he rosine listen and answer quietly but it be clear that she do not understand when he have finish she kiss he again and say : i have tell you what i think papa but it be not for I to judge you know much better than i with that she go into she room smile at she father and not in the least suspect that she have just take away from he he greatest support this abusive attack be not the only one for when the bell be once tie on the cat it never cease to ring however the noise would have be drown in the general tumult if it have not be for a persistent voice which lead the chorus of malignity against clerambault unhappily it be the voice of one of he oldest friend the author octave bertin for they have be school-fellow at the lycée henrus iv bertin a little parisian quick-witted elegant and precocious have welcome the awkward enthusiastic advance of the overgrown youth fresh from the country -- ungainly in body and mind he clothes always too short for he long leg and arm a mixture of innocence simplicity ignorance and bad taste always emphatic with overflow spirit yet capable of the most original sally and striking image none of this have escape the sharp malicious eye of young bertin neither clerambault 's absurdity nor the treasure of he mind and after think he over he have decide to make a friend of he clerambault 's unfeigned admiration have something to do with this decision for several year they share the superabundance of they youthful idea both dream of be artist they read they literary attempt to each other and engage in interminable discussion in which bertin always have the upper hand he be apt to be first in everything clerambault never think of contest he superiority he be much more likely to use he fist to convince anyone who deny it he stand in open-mouthed admiration before he brilliant friend who win all the university prize without seem to work for they and whom he teacher think destine to the highest honor -- official and academic of course bertin be of the same mind as he teacher he be in haste to succeed and believe that the fruit of triumph have more flavor when one 's tooth be young enough to bite into it he have scarcely leave the university when he find mean to publish in a great parisian review a series of essay which immediately bring he to the notice of the general public and without pause to take breath he produce one after another a novel in the style of d'annunzio a comedy in rostand 's vein a book on love another on reform in the constitution a study of modernism a monograph on sarah bernhardt and finally the dialogue of the live the sarcastic but measure spirit of this last work obtain for he the position of column writer on one of the lead daily have thus enter journalism he stay in the profession and become one of the ornament of the pari of letter while clerambault 's name be still unknown the latter have be slow in gain the mastery over he inward resource and be so occupy in struggle with himself that he have no time for the conquest of the public he first work which be publish with difficulty be not read by more than a dozen people it be only fair to bertin to say that he be one of the dozen and that he appreciate clerambault 's talent he be even ready to say so when opportunity serve and as long as clerambault be unknown he take pleasure in defend he it be true that he would sometimes add a friendly and patronising piece of advice to he praise which if clerambault do not always follow he receive with the old affectionate respect in a little while clerambault become known and even celebrate bertin somewhat surprised sincerely please by he friend 's success -- the least bit vex by it perhaps -- intimate that he think it exaggerate and that the better clerambault be the obscure clerambault before he reputation be make he would even undertake to prove this to clerambault himself sometimes who neither agree nor disagree for how could he tell who think very little about it he head be always full of some new work the two old comrade remain on excellent term but little by little they begin to see less of one another the war have make bertin a furious jingo in the old day at school he use to scandalise clerambault 's provincial mind by he impudent disrespect for all value political and social -- country morality and religion in he literary work he continue to parade he anarchism but in a sceptical worldly bored sort of manner which be to the taste of he rich clientèle now before this clientèle and the rest of those who purvey to it he brethren of the popular press and theater the contemptible parny 's and crebillon jr 's of the day he suddenly assume the attitude of brutus immolate he son it be true he himself have none but perhaps that be a regret to he clerambault do not dream of find fault with he for these opinion but he do not dream either that he old friend and amoralist would come out against he as the defender of he outraged country but be it a question simply of he country there be a personal note in the furious diatribe that bertin hurl at he that clerambault could not understand in the general mental confusion bertin naturally shock by clerambault 's idea might have remonstrate with he frankly face to face but without any warning he begin by a public denunciation on the first page of he paper appear a article of the utmost virulence he attack not only he idea but he character speaking of clerambault 's tragic struggle with he conscience as a attack of literary megalomania bring on by undeserved success it seem as if he expressly choose word likely to wind clerambault and he end by summon he to retract he error in a tone of the most insulting superiority the violence of this article from so well-known a author make a event in pari of the clerambault case it occupy the reporter for more than a week a long time for these feather-headed gentry hardly anyone read what clerambault have actually write it be not worth while bertin have read it and newspaper man do not make a practice of take unnecessary trouble besides it be not a question of reading but of judgment a strange sort of sacred union be form over clerambault clerical and jacobin come together to condemn he and the man whom they admire yesterday be drag in the mud today the national poet become at once a public enemy and all the myrmidon of the press attack he with heroic invective the greater number of they united bad faith with a remarkable ignorance very few know clerambault 's work they scarcely know he name or the title of he book but that no more keep they from disparage he now than it have hinder they from praise he when he be the fashion now in they eye everything that he have write be taint with bochism though all they quotation be inexact in the excitement of he investigation one of they foist upon clerambault the authorship of another man 's book the author of which pale with fright protest with indignation dissociate himself entirely from he dangerous fellow-author uneasy at they intimacy with clerambault some of he friend do not wait to have it recall but meet it halfway write open letter to which the papers give a conspicuous place some like bertin couple they public censure with a demand that he should confess himself in the wrong and other less considerate cast he off in the bitterest and most insulting term clerambault be crush by all this animosity it could not arise solely from he article it must have be long dormant in the heart of these man and why so much hidden hatred -- what have he do to they a successful artist do not suspect that besides the smile of those around there be also tooth only wait for the opportunity to bite clerambault do he best to conceal the insult in the papers from he wife like a schoolboy try to spirit away he bad mark he watch for the post so as to suppress the obnoxious sheet but at last they venom seem to poison the very air among they friend in society madame clerambault and rosine have to bear many painful allusion small affront even insult with the instinct of justice which characterise the human beast and especially the female they be hold responsible for clerambault 's idea though he wife and daughter know little of they and disapprove what they know -lrb- they critic do not understand they either -rrb- the more polite be reticent taking pain not to mention clerambault 's name or ask after he -- you do not speak of rope you know in the house of a man who have be hang and this calculate silence be worse than open abuse you would have say that clerambault have do something dishonest or immodest madame clerambault would come back full of bitterness and rosine suffer too though she pretend not to mind one day a friend whom they meet in the street cross to the other side turn away she head so as to avoid bow to they and rosine be exclude from a benevolent society where she have work hard for year woman be particularly active in this patriotic reprobation clerambault 's appeal for reconciliation and pardon have no more violent opponent -- and it be the same everywhere the tyranny of public opinion be a engine of oppression invent by the modern state and much more despotic than itself in time of war certain woman have prove its most ferocious instrument bertrand russell cite the case of a unfortunate man conductor on a tramway marry with child and honourably discharge from the army who kill himself on account of the insult and persecution of the woman of middlesex in all country poor wretch like he have be pursue crazed drive to death by these war-maddened bacchante this ought not to surprise we if we have not foresee this madness it be because we like clerambault hitherto have live on comfortable accept opinion and idealisation in spite of the effort of woman to approximate the fallacious ideal imagine by man for he pleasure and tranquillity the woman of the present day weak cut-off trim into shape as she be come much closer than man to the primitive earth she be at the source of we instinct and more richly endowed with force which be neither moral nor immoral but simply animal if love be she chief function it be not the passion sublimate by reason but love in the raw state splendidly blind mingling selfishness and sacrifice equally irresponsible and both subservient to the deep purpose of the race the tender flowery embellishment with which the couple always try to veil the force that affright they be like arch of tropical vine over a rush stream they object be to deceive man could not bear life if he feeble soul see the great force as they be that carry he along he ingenious cowardice strive to adapt they mentally to he weakness he lie about love about hatred about he god and above all he be false about woman and about country if the naked truth be show to he he would fear to fall into convulsion and so he substitute the pale chromo of he idealism the war have break through the thin disguise and clerambault see the cruel beast without the mantle of feline courtesy in which civilisation drape itself among clerambault 's former friend the most tolerant be those belong to the political world deputy minister past or future accustomed to drive the human flock they know just what it be worth clerambault 's daring seem merely foolish to they what they think in they heart be twenty time worse but they think it silly to speak it dangerous to write it more dangerous still to answer it you make a thing know when you attack it and condemnation only give it greater importance they best advice would have be to keep silent about these unlucky article which the sleepy stumbling public would have neglect if leave to itself this be the course usually follow by germany during the war if the authority do not see they way clear to suppress rebellious writer they hide they under some flowery humbug the political spirit of the french democracy however be more outspoken and more narrow-minded silence be unknown to it and far from conceal its hatred it spit they forth from the house-top like that of rude french liberty open she mouth and bawl anyone who differ from she opinion of the moment be declare a traitor forthwith there be always some yellow journal to tell at what price the independent voice be buy and twenty fanatic to stir up the crowd against it once start there be nothing to do but wait until the fit have pass off but in the meantime look out for yourself prudent folk join in the hue and cry from a safe distance the editor of the magazine which have be proud to publish clerambault 's poem for year whisper to he that all this row be absurd -- that there be really nothing in he case but that on account of he subscriber he should have to scuttle he he be awfully sorry hope there be no hard feeling in short without be rude he make the whole thing look ridiculous alas for human nature even perrotin laugh at clerambault in a brilliantly sarcastic interview and consider himself to be still he friend at bottom in he own house clerambault now find himself without support he old helpmate who for thirty year have see only through he eye repeat he word without even understand they be now afraid indignant at what he have write reproach he bitterly for the scandal the harm do to the name of the family to the memory of he dead son to the sacred cause of vengeance to he country rosine be always loving but she have cease to understand he a woman 's mind make but few demand if she heart be satisfy so it be enough for she that she father be no longer one of the hater that he remain compassionate and kind she do not want he to translate he sentiment into theory nor above all to proclaim they she have much affectionate common-sense and as long as matter of feeling be safe she do not care for the rest not understand the inflexible exigence of logic which push a man to the utmost consequence of he faith she have cease to understand and she hour have pass -- the time when without know it she have accept and fulfil a maternal mission towards she father when he be weak broken and uncertain she have sheltered he under she wing rescue he conscience and give back to he the torch which he have let fall from he hand now she part be accomplish she be once more the loving little daughter somewhat in the shade who look on at the great event of life with eye that be almost indifferent and in the depths of she soul treasured devoutly the afterglow of the wonderful hour through which she have live -- all uncomprehend it be about this time that a young man home on leave come to see clerambault daniel favre be a friend of the family a engineer like he father before he he have long be a admirer of clerambault for he keen intelligence be not limit to he profession indeed the extend flight of modern science have bring he domain close to that of poetry it be itself the greatest of poem daniel be a enthusiastic reader of clerambault 's writings they correspond affectionately know each other 's family and the young man be a frequent visitor perhaps not solely for the pleasure of converse with the poet he be a nice fellow about thirty year old tall well set-up with good feature a timid smile and eye which look startlingly light in he sunburnt face they be all glad to see he and clerambault be not the only member of the family who enjoy he visit david might easily have be assign to duty in a munitions factory but he have apply for a dangerous post at the front where he have quickly be promote to the rank of lieutenant have a few day in town he go to see clerambault madame clerambault and rosine be out so the poet be alone and welcome he young friend with delight but daniel respond awkwardly answer question somewhat at random and at last abruptly bring up the subject which he have at heart he say that he have hear talk at the front of clerambault 's article and he feel very badly people say -- they make out that -- well he have hear severe thing about they he know people be often unjust but he have come -- here he press clerambault 's hand in a timid friendly way -- he have come to entreat he not to desert all those who love he he remind he of the devotion that have inspire the poet who have celebrate the tradition of french soil and the glory of the race in this hour of trial he implore stand by we i have never be closer to you than now answer clerambault and he add : you say that people blame what i have write dear boy what do you think of it yourself i confess i have not read it say daniel i do not want to for fear that it might disturb my affection for you or hinder I in my duty you faith can not be very strong if a few line of print can shake it my conviction be firm enough say daniel a little miff but there be certain thing which it be wisest not to discuss that be something that i should not have expect to hear from a scientific man say clerambault the truth can lose nothing by discussion truth no but love -- love of country my dear daniel you go farther than i i do not place truth in opposition to love of country on the contrary i endeavor to reconcile they daniel try to cut the matter short the country be not a subject for discussion be it a article of faith you know i do not believe in religion protest daniel i have no faith in any of they but that be the very reason what should we have leave on earth if it be not for we country i think that there be many great and beautiful thing in the world and country be only one of they but i be not discuss the love but the way of loving there be only one say daniel and what be that we must obey the ancient symbol love with bandaged eye i only want to open they no no let we alone it be hard enough already do not make it any worse for we in a few phrase temperate yet break by emotion daniel bring up the terrible picture of the week that he have spend in the trench the disgust and the horror of what he have bear himself the suffering he have see in other have inflict on they but my dear fellow if you see this shameful thing why not try to prevent it because it be impossible to be sure of that you might at least make the attempt the conflict between man be the law of nature kill or be kill so be it and can it never be change no never say daniel in a tone of sad obstinacy it be the law there be some scientific man from whom science seem to hide the truth it contain so that they can not see reality at the bottom of the net they embrace the whole field that have be discover but would think it impossible and even ridiculous to enlarge it beyond the limit already trace by reason they only believe in a progress that be chained to the inside of the enclosure clerambault know only too well the supercilious smile with which the idea of inventor be put aside by learn man from the official school there be certain form of science which accord perfectly with docility david 's manner show no irony it express rather a stoical baffled kind of melancholy in abstract question he do not lack courage of thought but when face with the fact of life he be a mixture or rather a succession of timidity and stiffness diffident modesty and firmness of conviction in short he be a man like other man complex and contradictory not all in one piece the trouble be that in a intellectual and a man of science the piece lap over one another and the joining show clerambault sit silent for a few moment and then begin to utter the thought that have pass through he mind nevertheless say he the result of science itself be changeful for the last twenty year all we conception of chemistry and physiology have be go through a crisis which have alter and make they much more fruitful why should not the so-called law which regulate human society -- or rather the state of chronic brigandage among nation -- why should not they also be change be there no place in you mind for the hope of a higher future we could not go on at all say daniel if we have not the hope of establish a new order more just and humane many of my comrade hope through this war to put a end to all war i have not that confidence and do not go so far as that but i do know certainly that we france be in danger and that if she be conquer humanity will fall with she the defeat of any people be that of humanity for we be all necessary and the union of all nation would be the only true victory any other ruin the victor as well as the vanquish every day that this war last the precious blood of france be shed and she run great risk of permanent exhaustion daniel stop he with a gesture of irritation and pain oh he know too well no one better than he that france be die each day from she heroic effort that the pick of she youth she strength she intelligence the vital sap of the race be pour out in torrent and with it the wealth the labor the credit of the people of france france bleeding at every vein would follow the path that spain have tread four century ago the path that lead to the desert of the escurial yes but let no one speak to he of a peace that would put a end to this agony until the adversary be totally crushed no one ought to respond to the advance that germany be then make -- they ought not to be consider or even mention and then like the politician the general the journalist and million of poor creature who repeat at the top of they voice the lesson teach they david cry : to the last man clerambault look at he with affectionate pity poor boy brave yet so timid that he shrink from the thought of discuss the dogma of which he be the victim he scientific mind dare not revolt against the stupidity of this bloody game where death for france as well as for germany -- perhaps more than for germany be the stake yes he do revolt but would not admit it to himself he try again to influence clerambault : you idea perhaps be right and true but this be not the time not now in twenty or even fifty year we must first conquer finish we task find the freedom of the world the brotherhood of man on the enduring victory of france poor daniel can he not see that even at the best the victory be doom to be tarnish by excess and that then it will be the turn of the vanquish to set they mind on a frantic revenge and a just victory each nation desire the end of war through its own triumph and from one such victory to another humanity will go down to its defeat as daniel stand up to go he press clerambault 's hand and remind he with much feeling of he poem where in the heroic word of beethoven he exalt the suffer out of which joy be bear _ durch leiden freude _ he sigh ah how well they understand we sing of suffering and we deliverance but they be enamoured of it and now we hymn of deliverance will become a song of oppression for other man clerambault could not answer he have a real love for this young man one of those who sacrifice themselves for the war know well that they have nothing to gain and the greater they sacrifice the stronger they faith blessing on they but if only they would consent not to immolate all mankind on the same altar rosine come in just as clerambault and daniel reach the door of the apartment she start with pleasure at the sight of the visitor and daniel 's face light up also clerambault could not help notice the sudden gaiety of the two young people rosine urge daniel to come in again for a few moment and talk to she a little daniel hesitate do come back but refuse to sit down and in a constrain way make a vague excuse for go away clerambault who guess what be pass in he daughter 's heart beg he to promise that he would come at least once more before the end of he leave daniel much embarrassed say no at first then yes without fix a time and at last on be urge by clerambault he do say when they might expect he and take leave but he manner be still rather cool rosine stand there absorb she look troubled but when she father smile at she she come quickly and kiss he the day he have fix come and go but no daniel appear they wait for he the next day and the one after that he have go back to the front a few day later clerambault persuade he wife to go with rosine to see daniel 's parent the icy coldness with which they be receive just stop short of offence madame clerambault come home vow that as long as she live she would never set foot again in that house it be all rosine could do to restrain she tear the following week a letter arrive from daniel to clerambault though he seem a little shamefaced about he attitude and that of he parent he try rather to explain than to apologise for it he speak of the tie of admiration respect and friendship which unite he to clerambault and allude discreetly to the hope that he have form of one day become closer yet but he add that clerambault have disturb these dream of the future by the regrettable position that he have see fit to adopt in the life and death crisis through which the country be now pass a position render worse by the wide publicity give to clerambault 's word these word little understand perhaps but certainly imprudent have raise a storm of opposition on account of they almost sacrilegious character the feeling of indignation be unanimous among the man at the front as well as in the circle of friend at home he parent know what he hope have be but they now absolutely refuse to allow it and in spite of the pain this cause he he do not feel it right to disregard these scruple spring as they do from a profound devotion to the wounded country a officer who have the honor to offer he life for france could not think of a union which would be regard as he adhesion to these unfortunate theory public opinion would condemn it such a view would be unjust undoubtedly but it be a thing that must always be reckon with the opinion of a whole people be respectable no matter how extreme and unfair it may appear and clerambault have make a grave mistake in try to brave it daniel entreated he to acknowledge this mistake and try to rectify if possible efface the deplorable effect produce by article write in a different key he urge this upon he as a duty -- towards he country and himself -- let it be understand that it be also a duty towards one dear to both of they in end he letter he bring forward other consideration where the word opinion constantly recur so as at last to take the place of reason and conscience as clerambault read he smile recall a scene of spitteler 's the king epimetheus be a man of firm conscience but when the time come to put it to the proof he could not lay he hand upon it see it try to escape run after it and finally throw himself flat on he stomach to look for it under the bed clerambault reflect that one might be a hero under the fire of the enemy but a timid small boy before the opinion of he fellow-citizen he show the letter to rosine and in spite of the partiality of love she be hurt that she friend should have wish to do violence to she father 's conviction she conclusion be that daniel do not love she enough and she say that she own feeling be not sufficiently strong to endure such exaction even if clerambault have be willing to yield she would not have consent to such a injustice whereupon she kiss she father try to laugh bravely and to forget she cruel disappointment a glimpse of happiness however be not so easily forget especially if there remain a faint chance of its renewal she think of it constantly and after a time clerambault feel that she be grow away from he it be difficult not to feel bitterly towards those for whom we sacrifice ourselves and in spite of herself rosine hold she father responsible for she lose happiness a strange phenomenon now make itself apparent in clerambault 's mind he be cast down but strengthen at the same time he suffer because he have speak and yet he feel that he should speak again for he have cease to belong to himself he written word hold and constrain he he be bind by he thought as soon as it be publish that which the fountain send forth return again to the fountain bear in a hour of mental exaltation he work prolonged and reproduce itself in he mind which would otherwise have fall exhaust a artist 's thought be the ray of light from the depths the best of himself the most enduring it support he lower nature man whether he like it or not lean on he work and be lead by they they have a existence outside of he own and so restore he lose vigor recall he to he duty guide and command he clerambault would have prefer to remain silent but he write once more this time he do not go very far tremble poor carcass you know where i be go to drag you say turenne to he body before the battle the carcass of clerambault be not more courageous though the conflict to which it be drive be of a humbler sort it be none the less hard for he be alone with no army at he back as he watch by he arm he be a pitiable spectacle in he own eye he see himself a ordinary man of a timid rather cowardly disposition depend greatly on the affection and approval of other it be terribly painful to break these tie to meet the hatred of other halfway be he strong enough to resist all he doubt come back upon he what force he to speak who would listen to he and what good would it do do not the wisest people set he the example of silence nevertheless he brain be firm and continue to dictate to he what he should write he hand also write it down without the alteration of a word there seem to be two man in he one who throw himself on the ground in terror and cry : i will not fight and the other who drag he along by the collar without try to persuade he say simply : yes you will it would be praise he too highly to say that he act in this manner through bravery he feel that he could not act otherwise even if he have wish to stop something force he to go on to speak it be he mission he do not understand it do not know why he be choose he the poet of tenderness make for a calm peaceful life free from sacrifice while other man -- strong war-like good fighter with the soul of athlete -- remain unemployed but it be of no use to dispute it the word have go forth and there be nothing for it but to obey when the stronger of he two soul have once assert itself the duality of he nature lead he to yield to it entirely a more normal man would have try to unite they or combine they or find some kind of compromise to satisfy the demand of the one and the prudence of the other but with clerambault it be everything or nothing whether he like it or not once he have choose he road he follow it straight before he and the same cause that have make he accept absolutely the view of those around he drive he to cast off every consideration now that he have begin to see the falsehood which have deceive he if he have be less misted he would not have unmask they thus the brave-man-in-spite-of-himself set off like oedipus for the fight with the sphinx country who await he at the crossroads bertin 's attack draw the attention of several politician to clerambault they belong to the extreme left and find it difficult to conciliate the opposition to the government -- they reason for existence -- with the sacred union form against the enemy ' invasion they republish the first two article in a socialist paper which be then balance itself between contradiction oppose the war and at the same time vote for credit you could see in its page eloquent statement of internationalism side by side with the appeal of minister who be preach a nationalist policy in this seesaw clerambault 's lightly lyrical page where the attack on the idea of country be make with caution and the criticism cover up by devotion would have be take as a harmless platonic protestation unfortunately the tooth of censure have fasten themselves upon some phrase with the tenacity of ant they might have escape notice in the general distraction of think if it have not be for this in the article address _ to she whom we have love _ the word country appear the first time couple with a invocation to love the critic keep this but cut it out when it occur further on dissociate from such flattering expression the word awkwardly conceal under this extinguisher shine all the more brightly in the mind of the reader -- but this they be too dull to perceive and great importance be thus give to writings which have not much in themselves it must be add that all mind be then in a passive state in which the slightest word of liberal humanitarianism take on a extraordinary importance particularly if sign by a well-known name the _ pardon ask of the dead _ be more effective than the other ever could be its sadness touch the mass of simple heart to whom the war be agony the authority have be indifferent up to now but at the first hint of this they try to put a stop to it they have sense enough to know that rigorous measure against clerambault would be a mistake but they could put pressure on the paper through influence behind the scene a opposition to the writer show itself on the staff of the paper naturally they do not blame the internationalism of he view they merely stigmatise it as _ bourgeois _ sentimentality clerambault furnish they with fresh argument by a new article where he aversion to war seem incidentally to condemn revolution as well poet be proverbially bad politician it be a reply to _ the appeal to the dead _ that barrès like a owl perch on a cypress in a graveyard have wail forth _ to the living _ _ death rule the world you that be live rise and shake off the yoke it be not enough that the nation be destroy they be bid to glorify death to march towards it with song they be expect to admire they own sacrifice to call it the most glorious the most enviable fate but how untrue this be life be the great the holy thing and love of life be the first of virtue the man of today have it no longer this war have show that and even worse it have prove that during the last fifteen year many have hope for these horrible upheaval -- you can not deny it no man love life who have no better use for it than to throw it into the jaw of death life be a burden to many -- to you rich of the middle-class reactionary conservative whose moral dyspepsia take away you appetite everything taste flat and bitter everything bore you it be a heavy burden also to you proletarian poor unhappy discourage by you hard lot in the dull obscurity of you life hopeless of any change for the better -- oh ye of little faith -- you only chance of escape seem to be through a act of violence which lift you out of the mire for one moment at least even if it be the last anarchist and revolutionist who have preserve something of the primitive animal energy rely on these quality to liberate themselves in this way they be the strong but the mass of the people be too weary to take the initiative and that be why they eagerly welcome the sharp blade of war which pierce through to the core of the nation they give themselves up to it darkly voluptuously it be the only moment of they dim life when they can feel the breath of the infinite within they -- and this moment be they annihilation _

illimitable horizon _ insensible to the revolutionary heat of this appeal the staff of the newspaper only fasten its attention on the few line where clerambault seem to lump all violence together those of the leave along with those of the right what do this poet mean by give lesson to the socialist in a party paper in the name of what theory he be not even a socialist he be nothing but a tolstoyian anarchist let he go back to he exercise in style and he middle-class where he belong some larger-minded spirit remonstrate in vain that with or without any label liberal idea ought to be welcome and that those of clerambault however ignorant he might be of the party doctrine be more truly socialistic than those of member of the party who join in the work of national slaughter these view be over-ruled clerambault 's article be return to he after spend some week in the bottom of a drawer on the pretext that there be so many current item that they take up all the space and that the paper have too much copy already clerambault take he article to a small review which be more attract by he name than by he idea the upshot be that the review be call down and suspend by police order the day after the article appear though it have be whitewash through and through clerambault however persist the most rebellious people in the world be those who be force to rebellion after a lifetime of submission i remember once to have see a big sheep so worry by a dog that he finally throw himself upon he the dog be overcome by this unexpected reversal of the law of nature and run away howl with surprise and terror the dog-state be too sure of its own fang to feel afraid of a few mutinous sheep but the lamb clerambault no longer calculate the danger he simply put he head down and but generous and weak nature be prone to pass without transition from one extreme to another so from a intensely gregarious feeling clerambault have jump at one bind to the extreme of individual isolation because he know it so well he could see nothing around he but the plague of obedience that social suggestion of which the effect be everywhere manifest the passive heroism of the army excite to frenzy like million of ant absorb in the general mass the servility of assembly despise the head of they government but sustain he by they vote even at the risk of a explosion bring about by one bolter the sulky but well-drilled submission of even the liberal party sacrifice they very reason for existence to the absurd fetish of abstract unity this abdication this passion represent the true enemy in clerambault 's eye and it be he task he think to break down its great suggestive power by awaken doubt the spirit that eat away all chain the chief seat of the disease be the idea of nation this inflamed point could not be touch without howl from the beast clerambault attack it at once without glove _ what have i to do with you nation can you expect I to love or hate a nation it be man that i love or hate and in all nation you will find the noble the base and the ordinary man yes and everywhere be few great or low while the ordinary abound like or dislike a man for what he be not for what other be and if there be one man who be dear to I in a whole nation that prevent I from condemn it you talk of struggle and hatred between race race be the color of life 's prism it bind they together and we have light woe to he who shatter it i be not of one race i belong to life as a whole i have brother in every nation enemy or ally and those you would thrust upon I as compatriot be not always the nearest the family of we soul be scatter through the world let we re-unite they we task be to undo these chaotic nation and in they place to bind together more harmonious group nothing can prevent it on the anvil of a common suffering persecution will forge the common affection of the tortured people _ clerambault do not pride himself on he logic but only try to get at the popular idol through the joint of he armor often he do not deny the nation-idea but accept it as natural at the same time attack national rivalry in the most forcible manner this attitude be by no mean the least dangerous _ i can not interest myself in struggle for supremacy between nation it be indifferent which color come up for humanity gain no matter who be the winner it be true that in the contest of peace the most vital intelligent and hard-working people will always excel but if the defeat competitor or those who feel themselves fall behind be to resort to violence to eliminate they successful rival it would be a monstrous thing it would mean the sacrifice of the welfare of mankind to a commercial interest and country be not a business firm it be of course unfortunate that when one nation go up another be apt to go down but when big business in my country interfere with smaller trade we do not say that it be a crime of lèse-patriotism despite the fact that it may be a fight which bring ruin and death to many innocent victim _ _ the exist economic system of the world be calamitous and bad it ought to be remedy but war which try to swindle a more fortunate and able competitor for the benefit of the inexpert or the lazy make this vicious system worse it enrich a few and ruin the community _ _ all people can not walk abreast on the same road they be always pass each other and be outstrip in they turn what do it matter since we be all in the same column we should get rid of we silly self-conceit the pole of the world 's energy be constantly change often in the same country in france it have pass from roman provence to the loire of the valois now it be at pari but it will not stay there always the entire creation swing in alternate rhythm from germinate spring to die autumn commercial method be not immutable any more than the treasure beneath the earth be inexhaustible a people spend itself for century without count the cost its very greatness will lead to its decline it be only by renounce the purity of its blood and mix with other nation that it can subsist we old man today be send the young one to death it do not make they younger and they be kill the future _ _ instead of rage against the law of life a wholesome people will try to understand they and see its real progress not in a stupid obstinacy which refuse to grow old but in a constant effort to advance with the age change and become greater to each epoch its own task it be merely sloth and weakness if we cling all we life to the same one learn to change for in that be life the factory of humanity have work for all of we labor for all people of the world each man take pride in the work of all the rest for the travail the genius of the whole earth be ours also _ these article appear here and there whenever possible in some little sheet of advanced literary and anarchistic view in which violent attack on person take the place of a reasoned-out campaign against the order of thing they be nearly illegible deface as they be by the censor besides when a article be reprint in another paper he would let pass with a capricious forgetfulness what he have cut out the day before and cut what he have pass then it take close study to make out the sense of the article after this treatment but the remarkable thing be that the adversary of clerambault not he friend go to this trouble ordinarily at paris these squall do not last long the most vindictive enemy train to war of the pen know that silence be a sharper weapon than insult and get more out of they animosity by keep it quiet but in the hysterical crisis in which europe be struggle there be no guide even for hatred clerambault be continually be recall to the public mind by the violent attack of bertin though he never fail to conclude each one in which he have discharge he venom with a disdainful : he be not worth speaking of bertin be only too familiar with the weakness defect of mind and small absurdity of he former friend he could not resist the temptation to touch they with a sure hand and clerambault sting and not wise enough to hide it let himself be draw into the fight retaliate and prove that he too could draw blood from the other thus a fierce enmity arise between the two the result might have be foresee up to this time clerambault have be inoffensive confine himself on the whole to moral dissertation he polemic do not step outside the circle of idea it might as well have be apply to germany england or ancient rome as to the france of today to tell the truth like nine-tenth of he class and profession he be ignorant of the political fact about which he declaim so that he trumpeting could hardly disturb the leader of the day in the midst of the tumult of the press the noisy passage of arm between clerambault and bertin have two consequence in the first place it force clerambault to play with more care and choose a less slippery ground than logomachy and on the other it bring he in contact with man better inform as to the fact who furnish he with the necessary information a short time before there have be form in france a little society semi-clandestine for independent study and free criticism on the war and the cause that have lead up to it the government always vigilant and ready to crush any attempt at freedom of thought nevertheless do not consider this society dangerous its member be prudent and calm man of letter before all who avoid notoriety and contented themselves with private discussion it be think better policy to keep they under observation and between four wall these calculation prove to be wrong for truth modestly and laboriously discover though know only to five or six can not be uproot it will spring from the earth with irresistible force clerambault now learn for the first time of the existence of these passionate seeker after truth who recall the time of the dreyfus case in the general oppression they apostolate behind closed door take on the appearance of a little early-christian group in the catacomb thanks to they he discover the falsehood as well as the injustice of the great war he have have a faint suspicion of they but he have not dream how far the history that touch we most closely have be falsify and the knowledge revolt he even in he most critical moment he simplicity would never have imagine the deceptive foundation on which repose a crusade for the right and as he be not a man to keep he discovery to himself he proclaim it loudly first in article which be forbid by the censor and then in the shape of sarcastic apologue or little symbolic tale touch with irony the voltairian apologue slip through sometimes owe to the inattention of the censor and in this way clerambault be mark out to the authority as a very dangerous man those who think they know he best be surprise he adversary have call he sentimental and assuredly so he be but he be aware of it and because he be french he could laugh at it and at himself it be all very well for sentimental german to have a thick-headed belief in themselves deep down in a eloquent and sensitive creature like clerambault the vision of the gaul -- always alert in he thick wood -- observe let nothing escape and be ready for a laugh at everything the surprising thing be that this under-spirit will emerge when you least expect it during the darkest trial and in the most pressing danger the universal sense of humor come as a tonic to clerambault and he character scarcely free from the convention in which it have be bind take on suddenly a vital complexity good tender combative irritable always in extreme -- he know it and that make he worse -- tearful sarcastic sceptical yet believe he be surprise when he see himself in the mirror of he writings all he vitality hitherto prudently shut into he _ bourgeoi _ life now burst forth develop by moral solitude and the hygiene of action clerambault see that he have not know himself he be as it be new-born since that night of anguish he learn to taste a joy of which he have never before have a idea -- the giddy joy of the free lance in a fight all he sens string like a bow glad in a perfect well-being this improved state however bring no advantage to clerambault 's family he wife 's share of the struggle be only the unpleasantness a general animosity that finally make itself feel even among the small tradespeople of the neighborhood rosine droop she secret heart-ache wear upon she all the more because of she silence but if she say nothing she mother complain enough for two she make no distinction between the fool who affront she and the imprudent clerambault who cause all the trouble so that at every meal there be awkward remark mean to induce he to keep still all this be of no use reproach whether speak or silent pass over he head he be sorry of course but he have throw himself into the thick of the fight and with a somewhat childish egotism he thrust aside anything that interfere with this new interest circumstance however come to madame clerambault 's assistance a old relation who have bring she up die leave she little property in berry to the clerambault the mourning be a good excuse for quit pari which have now become detestable and for tear the poet from he dangerous surroundings there be also the question of money and of rosine who would be better for change of air clerambault give in and they all three go to take possession of they small inheritance and remain in berry during the rest of the summer and autumn it be in the country a respectable old house just outside a village from the agitation of pari clerambault pass at once to a stagnant calm and in the long silent day all that break the monotony be a cock crow in a farm-yard or a cow lowing in the meadow clerambault be too much work up to adapt himself to the slow and placid rhythm of nature formerly he have adore it and be in harmony with the country people from whom he family have come now however the peasant with whom he try to talk seem to he creature from another planet certainly they be not infect by the virus of war they show no emotion and no hatred for the enemy but then they have no animosity either against war which they accept as a fact certain keen good-natured observation show that they be not take in as to the merit of the case but since the war be there they make the most they could out of it they might lose they son but they do not mean to lose money not that they be heartless grief have mark they deeply though they speak little of it but after all man pass away -- the land be always there they at least have not like the _ bourgeois _ in city send they child to death through national fanaticism only they know how to get something in exchange for what they give and it be probable that they son would have think this perfectly natural because you have lose someone you love must you lose you head too we peasant do not lose theirs it be say that in the country district of france more than a million new proprietor have be make by the war the mind of clerambault be alien to all this he and these people do not speak the same language they exchange some vague condolence but when he be talk to a _ bourgeois _ a peasant always complain it be a habit a way of defend himself against a possible appeal to he pocketbook they would have talk in the same way about a epidemic of fever clerambault be always the parisian in they eye he belong to another tribe and if they have thought they would not tell they to he this lack of response stifle clerambault 's word impressionable as he be he could no longer hear himself all be silence he have friend unknown and at a distance who try to communicate with he but they voice be intercept by postal spy -- one of the disgrace of we time on the pretext of suppress foreign espionage we government make spy of its own citizen and not content with a watch on politics it violate a man 's thought and teach its agent how to listen at door like lackey the premium thus put on baseness fill this country -- and all the other -- with volunteer detective gentleman man of letter many of they slacker who buy they own security with the safety of other call they denunciation by the name of patriotism thanks to these informer those of liberal opinion could not get in touch with one another that great monster the state -- prick by its bad conscience -- suspect and fear half a dozen liberal-minded people alone weak and destitute and each one of these liberal surround by spy eat he heart out in he jail and ignorant that other suffer with he feel himself slowly die freezing in the polar ice of he despair clerambault be too hot-blooded to let himself be bury under this snowy shroud but the soul be not all the body be a plant which need human soil deprive of sympathy reduce to feed on itself it perish in vain do clerambault try to prove to himself that million of other mind be in agreement with he own it could not replace the actual contact with one living heart faith be sufficient for the spirit but the heart be like thoma it must touch to be convinced clerambault have not foresee this physical weakness he feel stifle he body seem on fire he skin burn he life seem to be dry up at the source it be as if he be under a exhaust vacuum-bell a wall keep he from the air one evening like a consumptive after a bad day he have be wander about the house from room to room as if in search of a breath of fresh air when a letter come that have somehow slip through the mesh of the net a old man like himself a village schoolmaster in a remote valley of dauphiny write thus : the war have take everything from I of those whom i use to know some have be kill and the rest be so altered that i hardly recognize they they have trample on all that make life worth have to I my hope of progress my faith in a future of brotherly reason i be ready to die in my despair when a paper in which you be speak of insultingly draw my attention to you article : _ to the dead _ and _ to she whom we love _ i weep with joy as i read they i be not then leave alone to suffer i be not solitary -- you do believe then my dear sir tell I that you still have faith in these thing they really exist and can not be destroy i must tell you how much good it do I to know that for i have begin to doubt you must forgive I but i be old and alone and very weary god bless you sir i can die in peace now that thanks to you i know that i have not be deceive instantly it be as if a window have be open to the air clerambault 's lung be fill he heart beat strongly again life seem to be renew and to flow once more in a full channel how deep be the need we have of love from one another a hand stretch out in the hour of my agony make I feel that i be not a branch tear from the tree but a living part of it we save each other i give my strength which would be nothing if it be not take truth alone be like a spark strike from a stone dry harsh ephemeral will it die out no for it have kindle another soul and a new star have rise on the horizon the new star be see but for a few moment then a cloud cover it and it vanish forever clerambault write the same day to he unknown friend tell he effusively of all he trial and dangerous opinion but no answer come some week later clerambault write again but without success such be he longing for a friend with whom to share he trouble and he hope that he take the train to grenoble and from there make he way on foot to the village of which he have the address but when joyful with the surprise he bring he knock at the door of the schoolhouse the man who open it evidently understand nothing of he errand after some explanation it appear that this be a newcomer in the village that he predecessor have be dismiss in disgrace a month before and order to a distance but that the trouble of the journey have be spare he for he have die of pneumonia the day before he be to have leave the place where he have live for thirty year he be there still but under the ground clerambault see the cross over the newly-made mound but he never know if he lose friend have at least receive he word of sympathy it be better for he to remain in doubt for the letter have never reach they destination even this gleam of light have be deny to the poor old schoolmaster the end of this summer in berry be one of the most arid period in clerambault 's life he talk with no one he write nothing and he have no way of communicate directly with the work people he have always make himself like on the rare occasion on which he have come into contact with they -- in a crowd on holiday or in the workingman 's school but shyness on both side hold he back each feel he inferiority with pride on the one hand and awkwardness on the other for clerambault know that in many essential respects he be inferior to the intelligent workman he be right for from they rank will be recruit the leader of the future the best class of these man contain many honest and virile mind able to understand clerambault with a untouched idealism they still keep a firm hold on reality and though they daily life have accustom they to struggle disappointment and treachery they be train to patience young as some of they be they be veteran of the social war and there be much that they could have teach clerambault they know that everything be for sale that nothing be to be have for nothing that those who desire the future happiness of man must pay the price now in they own suffering that the smallest progress be gain step by step and be lose often twenty time before it be finally conquer there be nothing final in this world these man solid and patient as the earth would have be of great use to clerambault and he vivid intelligence would have be like a ray of sunshine to they unfortunately both he and they have to bear the result of the archaic caste system injurious as it be and fatal to the community not less than to the individual raising between the pretended equal of we so-called democracy the excessive inequality of fortune education and life journalist supply the only means of communication between caste and caste and they form a caste by themselves represent neither the one side nor the other the voice of the newspaper alone now break the silence that surround clerambault and nothing could stop they brekekekex coax coax the disastrous result of a new offensive find they as always bravely at they post once more the optimist oracle of the pontiff of the rear-guard be prove to be wrong but no one seem to notice it other prophecy succeed and be give out and swallow with the same assurance neither those who write nor those who read saw that they have deceive themselves in all sincerity they do not know it they do not remember what they have write the day before what can you expect from such feather-headed creature who do not know if they be on they head or they heel but it must be allow that they know how to fall on they foot after one of they somersault one conviction a day be enough for they and what do the quality matter since they be fresh every hour towards the end of the autumn in order to keep up the morale which sink before the sadness of the come winter the press start a new propaganda against german atrocity it go across perfectly and the thermometer of public opinion rise to fever heat even in the placid berry village for several week all sort of cruel thing be say the curé take part and preach a sermon on vengeance clerambault hear this from he wife at breakfast and say plainly what he think of it before the servant who be wait at table the whole village know that he be a boche before night and every morning after that he could read it write up on he front door madame clerambault 's temper be not improve by this and rosine who have take to religion in the disappointment of she young love be too much occupy with she unhappy soul and its experience to think of the trouble of other the sweetest nature have time when they be simply and absolutely selfish leave to himself alone deprive of the means of action clerambault turn he heated thought back on himself nothing now hold he from the path of harsh truth there be nothing between he and its cold light he soul be shrivel like those _ fuoruscitus _ who throw from the wall of the cruel city gaze at it from without with faithless eye it be no longer the sad vision of the first night of he trial when he bleeding wound still link he with other man all tie be now break as with open eye he spirit sink down whirling into the abyss the slow descent into hell from circle to circle alone in the silence i see you you myriad of herd people hug together perforce in shoal to spawn and to think each group of you like the bee have a special sacred odour of its own the stench of the queen-bee make the unity of the hive and give joy to the labor of the bee as with the ant whosoever do not stink like I i kill o you bee-hive of man each of you have its own peculiar smell of race religion moral and approve tradition it impregnate you body you wax the brood-comb of you hive it permeate you entire life from birth to death and woe to he who would wash himself clean of it he who would sense the mustiness of this swarm-thinking the night-sweat of a hallucinated people should look back at the rite and belief of ancient history let he ask the quizzical herodotus to unroll for he the film of human wanderings the long panorama of social custom sometimes ignoble or ridiculous but always venerate of the scythian the gata the issedone the gindare the nasamone the sauromate the lydian the lybian and the egyptian biped of all color from east to west and from north to south the great king who be a man of wit ask the greek who burn they dead to eat they and the hindoo who eat they to burn they and be much amuse by they indignation the wise herodotus who doff he cap though he may grin behind it will not judge they himself and do not think it fair to laugh at they he say : ` if it be propose to all man to choose between the best law of different nation each one would give the preference to he own so true it be that every man be convince that he own country be the best nothing can be truer than the word of pindar : _ custom be the sovereign of all man _ ' it be true everyone must drink out of he own trough but you would at least think that we would allow other to do likewise but not at all we can not enjoy we own without spit in that of we neighbor it be the will of god -- for a god we must have in some shape in that of man or beast or even of a thing a black or red line as in the middle age -- a blackbird a crow a blazon of some kind we must have something on which to throw the responsibility of we insanity now that the coat-of-arm have be supersede by the flag we declare that we be free from superstition but at what time be they darker than they be now under we new doctrine of equality we be all oblige to smell exactly alike we be not even free to say that we be not free that would be sacrilege with the pack on we back we must bawl out : ` liberty forever ' under the order of she father the daughter of cheop make herself a harlot that she might contribute by she body to the building of the pyramid and now to raise the pyramid of we massive republic million of citizen prostitute they conscience and themselves body and soul to falsehood and hate we have become past master in the great art of lie true it be always know but the difference between we and we forefather be that they know themselves to be liar and be not far from admit it in they simple way it be a necessity of nature -- they relieve themselves before the passer-by as you see man do today in the south ' i shall lie ' say darius innocently one should not be too scrupulous when it be useful to tell a lie those who speak the truth want the same thing as those who tell falsehood we do so in the hope of gain some advantage and we be truthful for the same reason and that people may feel confidence in we thus though we may not follow the same road we be all aim at the same thing for if there be naught to gain a truth-teller would be equally ready to lie and a liar to tell the truth ' -- we my dear contemporary be more modest we do not look on at each other tell falsehood on the curb it must be do behind four wall we lie to ourselves and we never confess it not even to we innermost self no we do not lie we ` idealise ' come let we see you eye and let they see clearly if you be free man free what be you free from and which of you be free in you country today be you free to act no since the state dispose of you life so that you must either assassinate other or be yourselve assassinate be you free to speak or to write no for they imprison you if you dare to speak you mind can you even think for yourselve not unless it be _ sub rosa _ -- and the bottom of a cellar be none too secure be silent and wary for there be sharp eye on you to keep you from action there be sentry corporal with stripe on they arm and sentry too over you mind church and university that prescribe what you may believe and what you may not what do you complain of they say even if you be not complain you must not fatigue you mind by think repeat you catechism be we not tell that this catechism be freely agree to by the sovereign people -- a fine sovereignty truly idiot who puff out you cheek over the word democracy democracy be the art of usurp the people 's place of shear they wool off closely in this holy name for the benefit of some of democracy 's good apostle in peace time the people only know what go on through the press which be buy and tell what to say by those whose interest it be to hoodwink the public while the truth be keep under lock and key in war time it be even better for then it be the people themselves who be lock up allow that they have ever know what they want it be no longer possible for they to speak above they breath obey _ perinde ac cadaver _ ten million of corpse the living be hardly better off depress as they be by four year of sham patriotism circus-parade tom-tom threat bragging hatred informer trial for treason and summary execution the demagogue have call in all the reserve of obscurantism to extinguish the last gleam of good sense that linger in the people and to reduce they to imbecility it be not enough to debase they they must be so stupefied that they wish to be debase the formidable autocracy of egypt persium and syrium make plaything of the life of million of man and the secret of they power lay in the supernatural light of they pseudo-divinity from the extreme limit of the age of credulity every absolute monarchy have be a theocracy in we democracy however it be impossible to believe in the divinity of humbug shaky and discredit like some of we moth-eaten minister we be too close to they we know they dirty trick so they have invent the idea of conceal god behind they drop-curtain god mean the republic the country justice civilisation the name be paint up on the outside each booth at the fair display in huge many-coloured poster the picture of its beautiful giantess million crowd around to see it but they do not tell we what they think when they come out perhaps they find it difficult to think at all some stay inside and other have see nothing but those who stand in front of the stage gaping they know god be there for they have see he picture the wish that we have to believe in he -- that be the god of each one of we why do this desire flame up so furiously because we do not want to see the truth -- and therefore _ because we do see it _ therein lie the tragedy of humanity it refuse to see and know as a last resort it be force to find divinity in the mire let we on we part dare to look the truth in the face the instinct of murder be deeply engrave in the heart of nature it be a truly devilish instinct since it seem to have create being not only to eat but to be eat one species of cormorant eat fish the fisherman exterminate the bird and the fish disappear because they feed on the excrement of the bird who devour they thus the chain of being be like a serpent eat he own tail if only we be not sentient being do not witness we own torture we might escape from this hell there be two way only : that of buddha who efface within himself the painful illusion of life and the religious way which throw the veil of a dazzling falsehood over crime and sorrow those who devour other be say to be the choose people who work for god the weight of sin throw into one of the scale of life find its counterpoise beyond in the dream where all wound and sorrow be to be cure the form of the beyond vary from people to people and from time to time and these variation be call progress though it be always the same need of illusion we terrible consciousness insist on see and reckon with the unjust law for if we do not give it something to bite on fill its maw somehow it will howl with hunger and fear cry out : ' i must have belief or death ' and that be why we go in flock for security to make a common certainty out of we individual doubt what have we to do with truth most man think that truth be the adversary of course they do not say this but by a tacit agreement what they call truth be a sickening mixture of much falsehood and very little truth which serve to paint over the lie so that we get deceit and eternal slavery not the monument of faith and love be the most durable those of servitude last much longer rheim and the parthenon fall to ruin but the pyramid of egypt defy the age all about they be the desert its mirage and its move sand when i think of the million of soul swallow up by the spirit of slavery in the course of century -- heretic revolutionist rebel lay and clerical -- i be no longer surprise at the mediocrity that spread like greasy water over the world we who have so far keep we head above the gloomy surface what be we to do in face of the implacable universe where the stronger eternally crush the weaker and be crush by a stronger yet in he turn shall we resign ourselves to a voluntary sacrifice through pity or weariness or shall we join in and cut the throat of the weak without the shadow of a illusion as to the blind cosmic cruelty what choice be leave but to try to keep out of the struggle through selfishness -- or wisdom which be another form of the same thing in the crisis of acute pessimism which have seize upon clerambault during these month of inhuman isolation he could not contemplate even the possibility of progress that progress in which he have once believe as man do in god the human species now appear to he as devote to a murderous destiny after have ravage the planet and exterminate other species it be now to be destroy by its own hand it be the law of justice man only become ruler of the world by treachery and force -lrb- above all by treachery -rrb- those more noble than he have perhaps -- or certainly -- fall under he blow he have destroy some degraded and brutalised other during the thousand of year in which he have share life with other being he have feign -- falsely -- not to comprehend they not to see they as brother suffer loving and dream like himself in order to exploit they to torture they without remorse he man of thought have tell he that these creature can not think that he alone possess this gift and now he be not far from say the same thing of he fellow-men whom he dismember and destroy butcher murderer you have have no pity why should you implore it for yourself today of all the old friendship that have once surround clerambault one only remain he friendship with madame mairet whose husband have be kill in the argonne françois mairet be not quite forty year old when he meet with a obscure death in the trench he be one of the foremost french biologist a unpretending scholar and hard worker a patient spirit but celebrity be assure to he before long though he be in no haste to welcome the meretricious charmer as she favor have to be share with too many wire-puller the silent joy that intimacy with science bestow on she elect be sufficient for he with only one heart on earth to taste they with he he wife share all he thought she come of a scholarly family be rather younger than he one of those serious loving weak yet proud heart that must give but only give themselves once she existence be bind up in mairet 's interest perhaps she would have share the life of another man equally well if circumstance have be different but she have marry mairet with everything that be he like many of the best of woman she intelligence be quick to understand the man whom she heart have choose she have begin by be he pupil and become he partner help in he work and in he laboratory research they have no child and have every thought in common both of they be freethinker with high ideal destitute of religion as well as of any national superstition in 1914 mairet be mobilise and go simply as a duty without any illusion as to the cause that he be call upon to serve by the accident of time and country he letter from the front be clear and stoical he have never cease to see the ignominy of the war but he feel oblige to sacrifice himself in obedience to fate which have make he a part of the error the suffering and the confused struggle of a unfortunate animal species slowly evolve towards a unknown end he family and the clerambault have know each other in the country before either of they be transplant to pari this acquaintance form the basis of a amicable intercourse solid rather than intimate -- for mairet open he heart to no one but he wife -- but rest on a esteem that nothing could shake they have not correspond since the beginning of the war each have be too much absorb by he own trouble man who go to fight do not scatter they letter among they friend but generally concentrate on one person whom they love best and to whom they tell everything mairet 's wife as always be he only confidante he letter be a journal in which he think aloud and in one of the last he speak of clerambault he have see extract from he first article in some of the nationalist papers which be the only one allow at the front where they be quote with insulting comment he speak of they to he wife say what comfort he have find in these word of a honest man drive to speak out and he beg she to let clerambault know that he old friendship for he be now all the warmer and closer he also ask madame mairet to send he the succeed article but he die before they could reach he when he be go the woman who have live only for he try to draw nearer to the people who have be near to he in the last day of he life she write to clerambault and he who be eat he heart out in he provincial retreat lack even the energy to get away welcome she letter as a deliverance he return at once to pari and they both find a bitter joy in evoke together the image of the absent they form the habit of meeting on one evening in the week when they would so to speak immerse themselves in recollection of he clerambault be the only one of he friend who could understand the tragedy hide under a sacrifice gilded by no patriotic illusion at first madame mairet seem to find comfort in show all that she have receive she read he letter full of disenchanted confidence they reflect on they with deep emotion and she bring they into the discussion of the problem that have cause the death of mairet and of million of other in this keen analysis nothing stop clerambault and she be not a woman to hesitate in the search for truth but nevertheless clerambault soon become aware that he word make she uneasy though he be only say aloud thing that she know well and that be strongly confirm by mairet 's letter namely the criminal futility of these death and the sterility of all this heroism she try to take back she confidence or even to minimize the meaning of they with a eagerness that do not seem perfectly sincere she bring to mind saying of she husband 's which apparently show he more in sympathy with general opinion and imply that he approve of it one day clerambault be listen while she read a letter which she have read to he before he notice that she skip a phrase in which mairet express he heroic pessimism and when he remark on it she appear vex after this she manner become more distant she annoyance pass into coldness then irritation till it even grow into a sort of smother hostility and finally she avoid he though without a open rupture clerambault feel that she have a grudge against he and that he should see no more of she the truth be that at the same time that clerambault pursue he relentless analysis which strike at the foundation of current belief a inverse process of reconstruction and idealisation be go on in the mind of madame mairet she grief long to convince itself that after all there have be a holy cause and the dead man be no longer there to help she to bear the truth where two stand together there may be joy in the most terrible truth but when one be alone they be mortal clerambault understand it all and he quick sympathy warn he of the pain he cause and share for he make the suffering of this woman he own he nearly reach the point of approve she revolt against himself for he know she deep hidden sorrow and that the truth that he bring be powerless to help it -- still worse it add one evil more insoluble problem those who be bereave can not dispense with the murderous delusion of which they be the victim and if these be tear away they suffer become intolerable family that have lose son husband and father must need believe that it be for a just and holy cause and statesman be force to continue to deceive themselves and other for if this be to cease life would be insupportable to themselves and to those whom they govern how unfortunate be man he be the prey of he own idea have give up everything to they and find that each day he must continue to give more lest the gulf open under he foot and he be swallow up in it after four year of unheard-of pain and ruin can we possibly admit that it be all for nothing that not only we victory will be more ruinous still but that we ought not to have expect anything else that the war be absurd and we self-deceiver never we would rather die to the last man when one man find that he have throw away he life he sink down in despair what would it be in the case of a nation of ten nation or of civilisation as a whole clerambault hear the cry that go up from the multitude : life at any cost save we no matter how but you do not know how to save yourselve the road you follow only lead on to fresh catastrophe to a infinite mass of suffer no matter how frightful they be not as bad as what you offer we let we die with we illusion rather than live without they such a life as that be a death in life \* \* \* \* \* _ he who have decipher the secret of life and find the answer _ say the disenchanted but harmonious voice of amiel _ be no longer bind on the great wheel of existence he have quit the world of the living when illusion vanish nothingness resume its eternal reign the bright bubble have burst in infinite space and we poor thought be dissolve in the immutable repose of the limitless void _ \* \* \* \* \* unluckily this repose in the void be the worst torture for a man of the white race he would rather endure any torment that life may bring do not tear they from I he cry you kill I when you destroy the cruel falsehood by which i live clerambault bitterly adopt the name that a nationalist paper have give he in derision : the one against all yes he be the common enemy the destroyer of we life-giving illusion he could not bear this the thought of make other suffer be too painful to he how then be he to get out of this tragic no-thoroughfare wherever he turn he find the same insolvable dilemma either a fatal illusion or death without it i will accept neither the one nor the other whether you accept it or no you must yield -- for the way be bar nevertheless i shall pass through part four clerambault be pass through a new danger-zone he solitary journey be like a mountain ascension where a man find himself suddenly envelop in fog cling to a rock unable to advance a step he could see nothing in front of he and no matter to which side he turn he could hear beneath he the roar of the torrent of suffer even so he could not stand still though he hang over the abyss and he hold threaten to give way he have reach one of these dark turning and to make it worse the news that day as bark out by the press make the heart ache by its insanity useless hecatomb which the induce egotism of the world behind the line think natural cruelty on all side criminal reprisal for crime -- for which these good people clamour and loudly applaud the horizon that surround the poor human creature in they burrow have never seem so dark and pitiless clerambault ask himself if the law of love that he feel within himself have not be design for other world and different humanities the mail have bring he letter full of fresh threat and know that in the tragic absurdity of the time he life be at the mercy of the first madman who happen to turn up he hope secretly that he might not have long to wait but be of good stock he keep on he way he head up as usual work steadily and methodically at he daily task so as to gain the end no matter what that might be of the path whereon he have set he foot he remember that on this day he have promise to go and see he niece aline who have just be confine she be the daughter of a sister who have die and who have be very dear to he a little older than maxime she have be bring up with he as she grow into girlhood she develop a complicated character restless and discontented always think of herself she want to be love and to tyrannise she have also too much curiosity dangerous experience be a attraction to she and with all this she be rather dry but emotional vindictive and high-tempered still when she choose she could be tender and attractive maxime and she have play the game together and carry it pretty far so that it have be necessary to watch they closely in spite of he irony maxime have be catch by the dark eye that pierce through he with they electric thrill and aline be irritated and attract by maxime 's mockery they have love and quarrel furiously and then they have both go on to something else she have shoot arrow into several other heart and then when she think the right time have come -- there be always a time for everything -- she have marry in the most reasonable way a successful prosperous man of business head of a firm which sell artistic and ecclesiastical furniture in the rue bonaparte she be about to have a child when she husband be order to the front there could be no doubt of she ardent patriotism for self-love include one 's country clerambault would never have expect to find any sympathy in she for he theory of fraternal pity she have little enough for she friend but none at all for she enemy she would have ground they in a mortar with the same cold satisfaction that she feel when she torment heart or tease insect because something or somebody have vex she as the fruit within she ripened she attention be concentrate upon it all the strength of she heart seem to flow inward the war recede the cannon of noyon sound no longer in she ear when she speak of the war -- which she do less and less every day -- you would have think that she be talk of some distant colonial expedition of course she remember the danger that threaten she husband and pity he naturally : -- poor dear boy with a little smile as much as to say he have not much luck not very clever you know but she do not dwell on the subject and thank heaven it leave no trace on she mind she have pay she score she think and she conscience be at rest now she be in haste to go back to the world 's most serious task one really would have suppose that the whole world hang on the egg that she be about to lay clerambault have be so absorb by he struggle that he have not see aline for month and have therefore be unable to follow the change in she mood rosine might have speak of it before he but he have pay no attention within the last twenty-four hour he have hear in quick succession of the birth of the baby and of the fact that aline 's husband be miss like maxime and he immediately picture to himself the suffering of the young mother he think of she as he have always know she -- vibrate between pleasure and pain but always feel the latter more keenly give herself up to it and even when she be happy finding reason for distress she be violent too bitter agitate fight against fate and apt to be vex with everyone around she he be not sure that she be not angry with he personally on account of he idea about reconciliation now that she must be breathe out vengeance he know that he attitude be a scandal in the family and that no one would be less disposed to tolerate it than aline but no matter how she receive he he feel that he must go to she and help she in any way that he affection could suggest expect a storm but resign to it he climb up the stair and ring the bell at he niece 's door he find she lie in bed with the infant which she have have place by she side she look calm and young with a sweet expression of beam happiness on she face she be like the bloom older sister of the tiny baby at whom she look with adoring laughter as he lay there wave he little spidery leg he mouth open hardly alive as yet still dream of the dark warm place from which he have come she greet clerambault with a cry of triumph : oh uncle dear how sweet of you to come do look at he do you ever see such a darling she be so proud of she wonderful masterpiece that she be positively grateful to anyone who would look at he clerambault have never see she so pretty and so sweet he hardly see the child though he go through all the antic that politeness require make inarticulate admire noise which the mother expect and snap up like a bird he see only she happy face she lovely smile eye and hear she charming childish laughter how good it be to see anyone so happy all the thing that he have come prepared to say to she go clean out of he head -- all useless and out of place the only thing necessary be to gaze on the infant wonder and share the delight of the hen over she chick join in she delicious cluck of innocent vanity the shadow of the war however do pass before he eye for a moment the thought of the brutal useless carnage the dead son the miss husband and as he bent over the child he could not help think with a sad smile : why bring child into the world if it be to butcher they like this i wonder what will happen to this poor little chap twenty year hence thought like these do not trouble the mother they could not dim she sunshine all care seem far away she could see nothing but the joy that a man be bear into the world this man-child be to each mother in turn the incarnation of all the hope of humanity the sadness and folly of the present day what do they matter it be _ he _ perhaps who will put a end to they he be for every mother the miracle the promise messiah just as he be go clerambault venture a word of sympathy as to she husband she sigh deeply : poor armand i be sure that he be take prisoner have you have any news ask clerambault no no but it be more than probable i be almost certain if not you know i should have hear she seem to brush away the disagreeable thought as if it be a fly -lrb- go away how do it get in here -rrb- then she add the smile come back into she eye : it will be much better for he he can rest i be easier about he there than when he be in the trench and then she mind spring back to she world 's wonder : will not he be glad when he see the treasure the good god have send I it be when clerambault stand up to go that she condescend to remember that there be sorrow still in the world she think of maxime 's death and do drop a word of pretty sympathy but how clear it be that at bottom she be completely indifferent absolutely so though full of good-will which be something with she more surprising still soften by she new happiness she have a glimpse of the tired face and sad heart of the old man she have a vague recollection that he have do something foolish and have trouble in consequence and instead of scold he as he deserve she forgive he tacitly with a magnanimous smile like a little princess dear uncle she say with a affectionate if slightly patronise tone : you must not worry yourself it will all come out right give I a kiss as clerambault go away he be amuse by the consolation he have receive from she whom he have go to console he realize how slight we suffering must appear in the eye of indifferent nature all she concern be for the bloom of the come spring let the dead leaf fall now to the ground the tree will grow all the better and put forth fresh foliage in due season lovely beloved spring those who can never bloom again find you very cruel gentle spring those who have lose all that they love they hope they strength they youth -- everything that make life worth live to they the world be full of mutilate body and soul some bitterly lament they lose happiness and some yet more miserable sorrowing for what have be deny they the cup dash from they lip in the full bloom of love and of they twenty year \* \* \* \* \* clerambault come home one evening at the end of January wet and chill through with the fog after stand at a wood-yard he have stand for hour in line wait he turn in the crowd and after all they have be tell that there would be no distribution that day as he come near the house where he live he hear he name and a young man who be talk to the janitor turn and hold out a letter look rather embarrassed as clerambault come forward the right sleeve of he coat be pin up to the shoulder and there be a patch over he right eye he be pale and evidently have be lay up for month clerambault speak pleasantly to he and try to take the letter but the man draw it back quickly say that it be of no consequence now clerambault then ask if he would not come up and talk to he a little while but the other hesitated and the poet might have perceive that he be try to get away but not be very quick at see into other people 's mind he say good-naturedly : my flat be rather high up this seem to touch the visitor on a tender point and he answer : i can get up well enough and turn towards the staircase clerambault now understand that besides he other wound the heart within he have be wound to the quick they sit down in the fireless study and like the room it be some time before the conversation thaw out all that clerambault could get out of the man be short stiff answer not very clear and give in rather a irritated tone he learn that he name be julian moreau that he have be a student at the faculty of letter and have just pass three month at val-de-grace he be live alone in paris in a room over in the latin quarter though he have a widow mother and some other relation in orlean he do not explain at first why he be not with they all at once after a short silence he decide to speak and in a low voice hoarse at first but soften as he go on he tell clerambault that he article have be bring into he trench by a man just back from leave and hand about from one to the other to he they have be a real blessing they answer to the cry of he inmost soul : thou shalt not lie the papers and review make he furious they have the impudence to show the soldier a false picture of the army trumped-up letter from the front a cheap comedy style of courage and inappropriate joke all the abject boasting of actor safe at home speechifying over the death of other it be a insult to be slobber over with the disgusting kiss of these prostitute of the press as if they suffering be a mockery clerambault 's writings find a echo in they heart not that he understand they no one could understand who have not share they hardship but he pity they and speak humanely of the unfortunate in all camp he dare to speak of the injustice common to all nation which have lead to the general suffering he could not take away they trouble but he do raise it into a atmosphere where it could be bear if you only know how we crave a word of real sympathy it be all very well to be harden or old -- there be grey-haired bent man among we -- but after what we have see suffer and do to other there be time when we be like lost child look for they mother to console they even we mother seem far away at time we get strange letter from home as if we be desert by we own flesh and blood clerambault hide he face in he hand with a groan what be the matter say moreau be you ill you remind I of all the harm that i do you no it be other people that do the harm yes i as much as the other you must try to forgive we all you be the last who ought to say so if the truth be know i should be among the first for i be one of the few who see clearly how wicked i be he begin to inveigh against he generation but break off with a discourage gesture : none of that do any good tell I about yourself he voice be so humble that moreau be really touch to see the older man blame himself so severely all he distrust melt away and he throw wide the door of he bitter wounded spirit confess that he have come several time as far as the house but could not make up he mind to leave he letter he never do consent to show it since he come out of the hospital he have not be able to talk to anyone these people back here sicken he with they little preoccupation they business they pleasure the restriction to they pleasure they selfishness they ignorance and lack of comprehension he feel like a stranger among they more than if he be with african savage besides -- he stop the angry word seem to stick in he throat -- it be not only these people -- he feel a stranger to all the world cut off from normal life from the pleasure and work of other man by he infirmity he be a mere wreck blind and maim the poor fellow be absurdly ashamed of it he blush at the pity glance that people throw at he in pass -- like a penny that you give turn away you head at the same time from the unpleasant sight for in he sensitiveness he exaggerate he ugliness and be disgust by he deformity he dwell on he lose joy and ruin youth when he see couple in the street he could not help feeling jealous the tear would come into he eye even this be not all and when he have pour out the bitterness of he heart -- and clerambault 's compassion encourage he to speak further -- he get down to the worst of the trouble which he and he comrade feel like a cancer that one do not dare to look at through he obscure violent and miserable talk clerambault at last make out what it be that tear the heart of these young man it be easy enough for dried-up egotist wither intellectual to sneer at this love of life in the young and they despair at the loss of it but it be not alone they ruin blast youth that press on these poor soldier -- though that be terrible enough -- the worst be not to know the reason for this sacrifice and the poisonous suspicion that it be all in vain the pain of these victim could not be soothe by the gross appeal of a foolish racial supremacy nor by a fragment of ground fight for between state they know now how much earth a man need to die on and that the blood of all race be part of the same stream of life clerambault feel that he be a sort of elder brother to these young man the sense of this and he duty towards they give he a strength that he would not otherwise have have and he charge they messenger with word of hope and consolation you suffering be not throw away he say it be true that they be the fruit of a cruel error but the error themselves be not all lose the scourge of today be the explosion of evil which have ravage europe for age pride and cupidity it be make up of conscienceless state the disease of capitalism and be become the monstrous machine call civilisation full of intolerance hypocrisy and violence everything be break up all must be do over again it be a tremendous task but do not speak of discouragement for yours be the greatest work that have ever be offer to a generation the fire of the trench and the asphyxiate gas that blind you come as much from agitator in the rear as from the enemy you must strive to see clearly to see where the real fight lie it be not against a people but against a unhealthy society found on exploitation and rivalry between nation on the subordination of the free conscience to the machine-state the people resign or sceptical would not have see this with the tragical clearness in which it now appear without the painful disturbance of the war i do not bless this pain leave that to the bigot of we old religion we do not love sorrow and we all want happiness but if sorrow must come at least let it be of some use do not let you suffering add to those of other you must not give way you be teach in the army that when the order to advance be once give in a battle it be more dangerous to fall back than to go on so do not look back leave you ruin behind you and march on towards the new world as he speak the eye of he young auditor seem to say : tell I more more yet more even than hope give I certainty tell of the victory which will come soon man need to be tempt and decoy even the best of they in exchange for any sacrifice they make for a ideal you have to promise they if not immediate realisation at least a eternal compensation as all the religion do jesus be follow because they think that he would give they victory here or hereafter -- but he who would speak the truth can not promise or assure man of victory the risk be not to be ignore perhaps it will never come in any case it will be a long time to disciple such a thought be crushingly pessimistic not so for the master who have the serenity of a man who have reach the mountain top can see over all the surrounding country while they can only see the steep hill-side which they must climb how be he to communicate he calm to they if they can not look through the eye of the master they can always see he eye from which be reflect the vision deny to they there they can read the assurance that he who know the truth -lrb- as they believe -rrb- be deliver from all they trial the eye of julian moreau seek in clerambault 's eye for this security of soul this inward harmony and poor anxious clerambault have it not but be he sure that it be not there look at julian humbly he see he see that julian have find it in he and as a man climb up through a fog suddenly find himself in the light he see that the light be in he and that it have come to he because he need it to shine upon another after the wounded man have go away somewhat comfort clerambault feel slightly daze and sit drinking in the strange happiness that the heart feel when however unfortunate itself it have be able to help another now or in the future how profound be the instinct for happiness the plenitude of be all aspire to it but it be not the same for all there be some that wish only to possess to other sight be possession and to other yet faith be sight we be link of a chain and this instinct unite we from those who only seek they own good or that of they family or they country up to the be which embrace million of being and desire the good of all there be those who have no joy of they own can almost unconsciously bestow it on other as clerambault have do for they can see the light on he face while he own eye be in shadow the look of he young friend have reveal a unknown treasure to poor clerambault and the knowledge of the divine message with which he be entrust re-established he lose union with other man he have only contend with they because he be they hardy pioneer they christopher columbus force he way across the desert ocean that he might open the road to the new world they deride but follow he for every true idea whether understand or not be a ship under weigh and the soul of the past be draw after in its wake from this day onward he avert he eye from the irreparable present of the war and its dead and look towards the living and the future which be in we hand we be hypnotise obsess by the thought of those that we have lose and the morbid temptation to bury we heart in they grave but we must tear ourselves away from the baleful vapor that rise as in rome from the way of the tomb march on this be no time to halt we have not yet earn the right to rest with they for there be other who need we there like the wreck of the grand army you can see in the distance those who drag themselves along search on the dreary plain for the half-effaced path the thought of the sombre pessimism which threaten to overwhelm these young man after the war be a grave anxiety to clerambault the moral danger be a serious one of which the government take no notice at all they be like bad coachman who flog they horse up a steep hill at a gallop it be true that the horse reach the top but as the road go on he stumble and fall founder for life with what a gallant spirit we young man rush to the assault in the beginning of the war and then they ardor gradually diminish but the horse be still in harness and the shaft hold he up a factitious excitement be keep up all around he he daily ration be seasoned with glitter hope and though the strength go out of it little by little the poor creature could not fall down could not even complain he have not the strength to think the countersign all about these victim be to hear nothing to stop the ear and to lie day after day the battle-tide ebb and leave wreck on the sand man wound and maim and through they the depths of this human ocean be bring to the light these poor wretch ruthlessly tear from life move helplessly in the void too feeble to cling to the passion of yesterday or dream of tomorrow some ask themselves blindly and other with a cruelly clear insight why they have be bear what life mean _ since he who be destroy suffer and he who destroy have no pleasure and be shortly destroy himself tell I what no philosopher can explain whom do it please and to whose profit be this unfortunate life of the universe which be only preserve by the injury or death of all the creature which compose it _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : leopardus -rrb- it be necessary to answer these man to give they a reason for living but there be no such need for a man of clerambault 's age he life be over and all he require be to free he conscience as a sort of public bequest to young people who have all they life before they it be not enough to contemplate truth across a heap of corpse whatever the past may have be the future alone count for they let we clear away the ruin what cause they the most pain they own suffering no it be they lack of faith in the altar on which this suffering be lay -- -lrb- do a man regret if he sacrifice himself for the woman he love or for he child -rrb- -- this doubt poison they take away the courage to pursue they way because they fear to find only despair at the end this be why people say to you : never shake the ideal of country it ought rather to be build up what a derision as if it be possible to restore a lose faith by force of will we deceive ourselves we know it in the bottom of we heart and this consciousness kill courage and joy let we be brave enough to reject that in which we no longer believe the tree drop they leaf in the autumn in order that they may put forth new leaf in the spring out of you past illusion make fire as the peasant do with the fall leave the fresh grass the new faith will grow all the more thickly for it be there wait nature do not die it change shape continually like she let we cast off the garment of the past look carefully and reckon up these hard year you have fight and suffer for you country and what have you gain by it you have discover the brotherhood of the man who fight and suffer be the price too high no if you will listen to you heart if you will dare to open it to the new faith which have come to you when you least expect it the thing that disappoint and drive we to despair be that we cling to what we have at the beginning and when we no longer trust that we feel that all be lose a great nation have never reach the object seek and so much the better for almost always what be reach be superior to what be seek though different it be not wise to start out with we wisdom ready make but to gather it sincerely as we go along you be not the same man that you be in 1914 if you dare admit it then dare to act it also that will be the chief gain -- perhaps the only one -- of the war but do you really care so many thing conspire to intimidate you the weariness of these year old habit dread of the effort need to examine yourself to throw away what be dead and stand for what be live we have we do not know what respect for the old a lazy preference for what we be accustom to even if it be bad fatal then there be the indolent need for what be easy which make we take a trodden path rather than hew out a new one for ourselves be it not the ideal of most frenchman to accept they plan of life ready-made in childhood and never change it if only this war which have destroy so many of you hearth could force you to come out from you ash to find other health to seek other truth the wish to break with the past and adventure themselves in unknown region be not lack to these young man they would rather have prefer to go ahead without stop and they have scarcely leave the old world when they expect to take possession of the new -- no hesitation no middle course they want absolute solution either the docile servitude of the past or revolution these be moreau 's view he look upon clerambault 's hope of social revolution as a certainty and in the exhortation to win truth patiently step by step he hear a appeal to violent action which would conquer it at once he introduce clerambault to two or three group of young intellectual with revolutionary tendency they be not very numerous for here and there you would see the same face but they gain a importance which they would not otherwise have have from the watch which be keep on they by the authority silly people in power arm to the tooth with million of bayonet police and court of justice at they command yet uneasy and afraid to let a dozen freethinker meet to discuss they these circle have not the air of conspiracy and though they rather invite persecution they activity be confine to word what else be there for they to do but talk they be separate from the mass of they fellow thinker who have be draw into the army or the war-machine which would only give they up when they be past service what of the youth of europe remain behind the line there be the slacker who often descend to the lowest depths of meanness to make other fight so that it should be forget that they do not fight themselves set these aside the representative -- _ rarus nante _ -- of the younger generation in civil life be those discharge from the army for physical incapacity and a few broken-down wreck of the war like moreau in these mutilate or diseased body the spirit be like a candle light behind broken window twist and smoky it seem as if a breath would extinguish it but it be all the more ardent for know what to expect from life sudden change from extreme pessimism to a equally extreme optimism would occur and these violent oscillation of the barometer do not always correspond with the course of event pessimism be easily explain but its contrary be more remarkable and it would have be difficult to account for it they be just a handful of people without means of action and every day seem to give the lie to they idea but they appear more contented as thing grow worse they hope be in the worst that mad belief proper to fanatical and oppressed minority anti-christ be to bring back christ the new order would rise when the crime of the old have bring it to ruin and it do not disturb they that they and they dream might be sweep away also these young irreconcilable wish above all to prevent the partial realisation of they dream in the old order of thing all or nothing how foolish to try to make the world better let it be perfect or go to piece it be a mysticism of the great overturn of the revolution and it affect the mind of those least religious they even go farther than the church foolish race of man always this faith in the absolute which lead ever to the same intoxication but the same disaster always mad for the war between nation for the war of class for universal peace it seem as if when humanity stick its nose out of the boiling mud of the creation it have a sun-stroke from which it have never recover and which at interval subject it to a recurrence of delirium perhaps these mystical revolutionary be forerunner of mutation that be brood in the race -- which may brood for century and perhaps never burst forth for there be million of latent possibility in nature for one realize in the time allot to we humanity and it be perhaps this obscure sentiment of what might be but will not come to pass which sometimes give to this sort of mysticism another form rarer more tragical -- a exalted pessimism the dangerous attraction of sacrifice how many of these revolutionist have we see secretly convince of the overwhelming force of evil and the certain defeat of they cause and yet transport with love for a lose cause _ sed victa catonus _ and fill with the hope of die for she destroy or be destroy the crushed commune give rise to many aspiration not for its victory but for a similar annihilation -- in the heart of the most materialistic there burn forever a spark of that eternal fire that hope so often buffet and deny but still maintain of a imperishable refuge for all the oppress in some better hereafter these young people welcome clerambault with great affection and esteem hope to make he one of themselves some of they read in he idea a reflection of they own while other see in he just a sincere old _ bourgeois _ whose heart have be hitherto he only guide -- a rather insufficient though generous one they hope that he would let himself be teach by they science and like they would follow to they extreme limit the logical consequence of the principle lay down clerambault resist feebly for he know that nothing can be do to convince a young man who have make himself part of a system discussion be hopeless at that age earlier there be some chance to act on he when as it be the hermit-crab be look for he shell and later something may be do when the shell begin to wear and be uncomfortable but when the coat be new the only thing be to let he wear it while it fit he if he grow or shrink he will get another we will force no one but let no one try to put force on we no one in this circle at least in the early day think of constrain clerambault but sometimes it seem to he that he idea be strangely habit in the fashion of he host what unexpected echo he hear on they lip he let he friend talk while he himself say but little but when he have leave they he would feel troubled and rather ironical be those my thought he would say to himself it be terribly difficult for one soul to communicate with another impossible perhaps and who know nature be wiser than we it may be that this be for we good be it right be it even possible for we to utter all we thought we reach a conclusion slowly painfully through a series of trial it be the formulum of the delicate equilibrium between the inward element change the element they proportion they nature the formulum be no longer accurate and will produce different result and if you suddenly communicate you whole thought to another you run the risk of alarming not help he there be case in which if he have understand it might have kill he nature however be prudent and take precaution you friend do not comprehend you because he can not he instinct will not let he all that he get from you thought be the shock when it touch he the ball glance off but it be not so easy to tell in what direction man do not listen with they brain alone but with they disposition and they passion and out of what you offer they each choose he own and reject the rest through a deep instinct of self-defence we mind do not throw open the door to every new idea but rather keep a wary eye on new-comer through a peep-hole the lofty thought of the sage of jesus of socrate how be they receive in those day man who speak such thing be kill twenty year later they be treat as god -- another way of kill they in fact by place they thought at a distance in the kingdom of heaven the world would indeed come to a end if such idea be to be put in practice here and now and they author know this well perhaps they show the greatness of they soul more by what they do not say than by what they do how eloquent be the pathetic silence of jesus the golden veil of the ancient symbol and myth make to shield we weak timid sight too often what be for one the breath of life be for another death or worse murder what be we to do if we hand be full of verity shall we spread they broadcast -- suppose the seed of thought may spring up in weed or poisonous plant poor thinker there be no need to tremble you be not the master of fate but you form part of it you be one of its voice speak then that be the law of you be speak out you whole thought but with kindness be like a good mother it may not be give to she to make man of she child but she can patiently teach they how to make man of themselves if they will you can not set other free in spite of they and from the outside and even if it be possible what good would it do if they do not free themselves tomorrow they will fall back into slavery all you can do be to set a good example and say : there be the road follow it and you will find freedom in spite of he resolution to do the best he could and leave the rest to the god it be fortunate for clerambault that he could not see all the consequence of he idea he thought aspire to the reign of peace and very probably it would contribute in some degree to the stir up of social struggle like all true pacifism however paradoxical this may seem for true pacifism be a condemnation of the present clerambault have no suspicion of the terrible force that would one day make use of he name with a wholly opposite effect he spirit produce a harmony among he young associate by react against they violence he feel the value of life all the more because they hold it in such light esteem and in this respect they be not different from the nationalist whom he oppose very few prefer life to they ideal -- which be we be tell one of man 's noblest quality in spite of all this it be a pleasure to clerambault when he meet a man who love life for its own sake this be a comrade of moreau 's who have also be severely wound he name be gillot and in civil life he have be a industrial designer a shell have plaster he from head to foot he have lose a leg and he ear-drum be break but he have re-act more energetically against he fate than moreau he be small and dark with bright eye full of gaiety in spite of all that he have go through though he agree with moreau in general as to the war and the crime of the social order he view the same event and the same man with different eye from which arise many discussion between the two young man one day moreau have just be tell clerambault of some gloomy experience of the trench : yes say gillot it do happen like that and the worst of it be that it have no effect on we not the least little bit and when moreau protest indignantly : well perhaps you and one or two more may have mind a little -- but most of they do not even notice it he keep on to stop further remonstrance from he friend : i be not try to make out that you be better than the rest old man there be no need for that i only say it because it be so look here he add turn to clerambault those who have come back and write about all this they tell we of course what they feel but they feel more than ordinary mortal because they be artist and naturally everything get on they nerve while the rest of we be tougher now that i think of it that make it more terrible when you read these story that sicken you and make the hair stand up on you head you do not get the full effect think of fellow look on smoking chaffing busy with something else you have to you know or you would go all to piece all the same it be astonishing what human creature can get use to i believe they could make themselves comfortable at the bottom of a sewer it really disgust a man for i be just the same myself you must not suppose that i be like this chap here always stare at a death 's head like everybody else i think the whole thing be idiotic but life be like that as far as i can see we do what we have to do and let it go at that -- the end well one be as good as another whether you lose you own skin or the war come to a end it finish it up all the same and in the meantime you be alive you eat you sleep you bowels -- excuse I one must tell thing as they be do you want to know what be at the bottom of it all sir the real truth be that we do not care for life or not enough in one of you article you say very truly that life be the great thing -- only you would not think so to see most people at this minute not much life about they they all seem drowsy wait for the last sleep it look as if they say to themselves : ` we be flat on we back now no need to stir a inch ' no we do not make enough out of life and then people be always try to spoil it for you from the time you be a child they keep on tell you about the beauty of death or about dead folk in the catechism in the history book they be always shout : ' _ mourir pour la patrie _ ' it be either popery or patriotism whichever you please and then this life of the present day be a perfect nuisance it look as if it be make expressly to take the backbone out of a man there be no more initiative we be all nothing but machine but with no real system we only do piece of work never know where we work will fit in most often it do not fit at all it be all a mess with no good in it for anyone we be throw in on top of one another like herring in a barrel no one know why -- but then we do not know either why we live at all it be not life we be just there they tell we about some time in the dark age when we grandfather take the bastille well you would think to hear the faker talk who run thing now that there be nothing leave to do that we be all in heaven you can see it carve on the monument we know that it be not so there be another pot boil another revolution on the way but the old one do not do such great thing for we after all it be hard to see plain hard to trust anybody there be no one to show we the way to point to something grand and fine above all these swamp full of toad people be always do something to confuse the issue nowadays talk about right justice liberty but that trick be play out good enough to die for but you can not live for thing like that how about the present asked clerambault now there be no go back but i often think that if i have to begin over again -- when do you change you mind about all these thing that be the funniest thing of all it be as soon as i be wound it be like get out of bed in the morning i have hardly slip a leg out of life than i want to draw it in again i have be so well off and never think of it ass that i be i can still see myself as i come to the ground be all tear up around I worse even than the body themselves lie in heap mixed pell-mell like a lot of jack-straw the ground simply reek as if it be itself bleed it be pitch dark and at first i do not feel anything but the cold except that i know i be hit all right i do not know exactly what piece of I be miss but i be not in a hurry to find out i be afraid to know afraid to stir there be only one thing i be sure of that i be alive if i have only a minute leave i mean to hold on to it there be a rocket in the sky i never think what it mean i do not care but the curve it make and the light like a bright flower i can not tell you how lovely it seem i simply drink it in i remember when i be a child one night near la samaritaine there be firework on the river that child seem to be someone else who make I laugh and yet i be sorry for he and then i think that it be a good thing to be alive and grow up and have something somebody no matter who to love even that rocket and then the pain come on and i begin to howl and do not know any more till i find myself in the ambulance there be not much fun in live then it feel as if a dog be gnawing my bone might as well have stay at the bottom of the hole but even then how fine it seem to live the way i use to just live on every day without pain think of that and we never notice it -- without any pain at all none it seem like a dream and when it do let up for a second just to taste the air on you tongue and feel light all over you body -- god almighty to think that it be like that all the time before and i think nothing of it what fool we be to wait till we lose a thing before we understand it and when we do want it and ask pardon because we do not appreciate it before all we hear be : ` too late ' it be never too late say clerambault gillot be only too ready to believe this as a educate workman he be better arm for the fray than moreau or clerambault himself nothing depress he for long fall down pick yourself up again and try once more he would say and he always believe he could surmount any obstacle that bar he way he be ready to march against they on he one leg the quicker the better like the other he be devote to the idea of revolution and find means to reconcile it with he optimism everything be to pass off quietly accord to he for he be a man without rancor it would not have be safe however to trust he too much in this respect there be many surprise in these plebeian character for they be very easily move and apt to change clerambault hear he one day talk with a friend name lagneau on leave from the front they say the poilus mean to knock everything to piece when the war be over maybe before a man of the lower class in france be often charming quick to seize on you idea before you have have a chance to explain it thoroughly but good lord how soon he forget he forget what be say what he answer what he see what he believe what he want but he be always sure of what he say and see and think now when gillot be talk to lagneau he argument be exactly contrary to those he have advance on the previous day to clerambault it be not only that he idea have change but apparently he whole disposition one morning there would be nothing violent enough for he thirst for action and destruction and the next he would talk about go into a little business with lot of money the best of food a tribe of child to bring up and to hell with the rest though they all call themselves sincere internationalist there be few among these poilus who have not preserve the old french prejudice of superiority of race over the rest of the world enemy or friend and even in they own country over the other province or if they be parisian over the rest of france this idea be firmly embed in they mind and they boast of it not maliciously but by way of a joke uncomplaining willing always ready to go like gillot they be certainly capable of make a revolution and then un-making it start another and so on -- tra-la-la -- till all be upset and they be ready to be the prey of the first adventurer who happen along we political fox know well enough that the best way to check a revolution be at the right moment to let it blow over while the people be amuse it look then as if the hour be at hand a year before the end of the war in both camp there be month and week when the infinite patience of the martyrised people seem on the point of give way when a great cry be ready to go up enough for the first time there be the universal impression of a bloody deception it be easy to understand the indignation of the people see billion throw away on the war when before it they leader have haggle over a few hundred thousand for social betterment there be figure that exasperate they more than any speech on the subject someone have calculate that it cost 75000 franc to kill a man that make ten million of corpse and for the same sum we could have have ten million of stockholder the stupidest could see the immense value of the treasure and the horrible the shameful waste for a illusion there be thing more abject still from one end of europe to the other there be vermin fattening on death war-profiteer robber of corpse do not talk to we any more say these young man to themselves of the struggle of democracy against autocracy -- they be all tar with the same brush in all country the war have point out the leader to the vengeance of the people that unworthy middle class political financial intellectual that in a single century of power have heap on the world more exaction crime ruin and folly than king and church have inflict in ten century this be why when the axis of those heroic woodsman lenine and trotzky be hear in the forest many oppressed heart thrill with joy and hope and in every country there be sharpen of hatchet the leading class rise up against the common danger all over europe in both oppose camp there be no negotiation need for they to reach a agreement on this subject for they instinct speak loudly the fiercest enemy of germany through the organ of the _ bourgeoisie _ tacitly give a free hand to the kaiser to strangle russian liberty which strike at the root of that social injustice on which they all live in the absurdity of they hatred they could not conceal they delight when they see prussian militarism -- that monster who afterwards turn on they -- avenge they on these daring rebel naturally this only increase the admiration for these excommunicate defier of the world on the part of the down-trodden mass and the small number of independent spirit the pot begin to boil with a vengeance and to stop it the government of europe shut down the lid and sit on it the stupid class in control keep throw fuel on the flame and then wonder at the alarming rumbling this revolt of the element be attribute to the wicked design of some free speaker to mysterious intrigue to the enemy 's gold to the pacifist and none of they see -- though a child would have know it -- that if they want to prevent a explosion the first thing to do be to put out the fire the god of all these power be force no matter what they be call empire or republic it be the mail fist disguise gloved but hard and sure of itself it become also like a rise tide the law of the oppress a dark struggle between two contrary pressure where the metal have worn thin -- in russium first -- the boiler have burst where there be crack in the cover -- as in neutral country -- the hissing steam escape but a deceitful calm reign over the country at war keep down by oppression to the oppressor this calm be reassure they be arm equally against the enemy or they own citizen the machine of war be double-ended the cover strong make of the best steel and firmly screw down that at least can not be tear off -- no but suppose the whole thing blow up together repress like everyone else clerambault see rebellion gather around he he understand it think it inevitable but that be not a reason for love it he do not believe in the _ amor fatus _ it be enough to understand the tyrant have no claim to be love clerambault 's young friend be not spare of they idea and it surprise they to see how little warmth he show towards the new idol from the north : the rule of the proletariat they have no timorous scruple or half-measure they mean to make the world happy in they way -- perhaps not in its own at one stroke they decree the suppression of all liberty in opposition to theirs the fall middle class be not to be allow to meet or to vote or to have the freedom of the press this be all very well say clerambault but at this rate they will be the new proletariat tyranny will merely change place only for a time be the answer the last oppression which will kill tyranny yes the same old war for right and liberty which be always go to be the war to end war but in the meantime it be stronger than ever and rights like liberty be trample under foot of course they all protest indignantly against this comparison in they eye war and those who wage it be equally infamous none the less say clerambault gently many of you have fight and nearly all of you have believe in it no do not deny it besides the feeling that inspire you have its noble side a great wickedness be show to you and you throw yourselve upon it to root it out in a very fine spirit only you seem to think that there be only one wickedness in the world and that when that have be purge away we shall all return to the golden age the same thing happen at the time of the dreyfus case all the well-meaning people of europe -- i among they -- seem never to have hear before of the condemnation of a innocent man they be terribly upset by it and they turn the world inside out to wash off the impurity alas this be do but both washer and wash grow discourage in the process and when it be all over lo -- the world be just as black as ever it seem as if man be incapable of grasp the whole of human misery he dread to see the extent of the evil and in order not to be overwhelm by it he fix on some one point where he localise all the trouble and will see nothing further all this be human nature and easy enough to understand my friend but we should have more courage and acknowledge the truth that the evil be everywhere among ourselves as well as with the enemy you have find this out little by little in we own country and see the tare in the wheat you want to throw yourselve against you government with the same fury that make you see incarnate evil in the person of the enemy but if ever you recognize that the tare be in you also then you may turn on yourselve in utter despair be not this much to be fear after the revolution we have see where those who come to bring justice find themselves without know why with soil hand and heart you be like big child when will you cease to insist on the absolute good they might have reply that you must will the absolute in order to arrive at the real the mind can dally with shades of meaning which be impossible to action where it must be all or nothing clerambault have the choice between they and they adversary there be no other yes he know it well enough there be no other choice in the field of action where all be determine in advance just as the unjust victory lead inevitably to the revenge which in its turn will be unjust so capitalistic oppression will provoke the proletarian revolution which will follow the bad example and oppress when it have the power -- a endless chain here be a stern greek justice which the mind can accept and even honor as the rule of the universe but the heart can not submit can not accept it its mission be to break the law of universal warfare can it ever come to pass who can tell but in any case it be clear that the hope and wish of the heart be outside the order of nature she mission be rather above nature and in its essence _ religious _ clerambault who be fill with this spirit do not as yet dare to avow it or at least he do not venture to use the word religious that word which the religion that have so little of its spirit have discredit in the eye of today if clerambault himself could not see clearly into he own thought it be hardly to be expect that he young friend should do so and even if they have see they would never have understand they could not bear the idea that a man who condemn the present state of thing as bad and destructive should hesitate at the most energetic method for its suppression they be not wrong from they point of view which be that of immediate action but the field of the mind be greater its battle cover a wider space it do not waste its energy in bloody skirmish even admit the method advocate by he friend clerambault could not accept they axiom that the end justify the means for on the contrary he believe that the means be even more important to real progress than the end what end will there ever be such a thing this idea be irritating and confusing to these young mind it serve to increase a dangerous hostility which have arise in the last five year among the work class against the intellectual no doubt the latter have richly deserve it how far away seem the time when man of thought march at the head of revolution whereas now they be one with the force of reaction even the limited number of those who have keep aloof while blame the mistake of the ring be like clerambault unable to give up they individualism which have save they once but now hold they prisoner outside the new movement of the mass this conclusion once reach by the revolutionist it be but one step to a declaration that the intellectual must fall and not a very long step the pride of the work class already show itself in article and speech while wait for the moment when as in russium it could pass to action and it demand that the intellectual should submit servilely to the proletarian leader it be even remarkable how some of the intellectual be among the most eager in demand this lowering of the position of they group one would have think that they do not wish it to be suppose that they belong to it perhaps they have forget that they do moreau however have not forget it he be all the more bitter in repudiate this class whose shirt of nessus still cling to he skin and it make he extremely violent he now begin to display singularly aggressive sentiment towards clerambault during a discussion he would interrupt he rudely with a kind of sarcastic and bitter irritation it almost seem as if he mean to wind he clerambault do not take offence he rather feel great pity for moreau he know what he suffer and he could imagine the bitterness of a young life spoil like he patience and resignation the moral nourishment on which stomach fifty year old subsist be not suit to he youth one evening moreau have show himself particularly disagreeable and yet he persist in walk home with clerambault as if he could not make up he mind to leave he he walk along by he side silent and frown all at once clerambault stop and put he hand through moreau 's arm with a friendly gesture say with a smile : it be all wrong be not it old fellow moreau be somewhat take aback but he pull himself together and ask drily what make anyone think that thing be all wrong i think so because you be so cross tonight say clerambault good naturally and in answer to a protest murmur yes you certainly be try to hurt I -- just a little i know of course that you would not really -- but when a man like you try to inflict pain on other it be because he be suffer himself be not that true yes it be true say moreau you must forgive I but it hurt I when i see that you be not in sympathy with we action and be you demand clerambault moreau do not seem to understand you yourself repeat clerambault do you believe in it of course i do what a question say moreau indignantly i doubt it say clerambault gently moreau seem to be on the point of lose he temper but in a moment he say more quietly : you be mistaken clerambault turn to walk on all right say he you know you own thought better than i do for some minute they continue in silence then moreau seize he old friend 's arm and say excitedly : how do you know it -- and he resistance have break down he confess the despair hide under he aggressive determination to believe and act he be eat up with pessimism a natural consequence of he excessive idealism which have be so cruelly disappoint the religious soul of former time be tranquil enough they place the kingdom of god so far away that no event could touch it but those of today have establish it on earth by the work of human love and reason so that when life deal a blow at they dream all life seem horrible to they there be day when moreau be tempt to cut he throat humanity seem make of rotteness he see with despair the defeat failure flaw carve on the destiny of the race from the very begin -- the worm in the bud -- and he could not endure the idea of this absurd and tragic fate which man can never escape like clerambault he recognize the poison which be in the intelligence since he have it in he vein but unlike he elder who have pass the crisis and only see danger in the irregularity of thought and not in its essence moreau be madden by the idea that the poison be a necessary part of intelligence he diseased imagination tortured he by all sort of bugbear think appear to he as a sickness set a indelible mark on the human race and he picture to himself in advance all the cataclysm to which it lead already think he we behold reason staggering with pride before the force that science have put at she disposal -- demon of nature obedient to the magical formula of chemistry and distract by this suddenly-acquired power turn to self-destruction nevertheless moreau be too young to remain in the grip of these terror he want action at any price anything sooner than to be leave alone with they why not urge he to act instead of try to hold he back my dear boy say clerambault it be not right to urge another man to a dangerous act unless you be ready to share it i have no use for agitator even if they be sincere who send other to the stake and do not set the example of martyrdom themselves there be but one truly sacred type of revolutionary the crucify but very few man be make for the aureole of the cross the trouble be that we always assign duty to ourselves which be superhuman or inhuman it be not good for the ordinary man to strive after the _ uebermenschheit _ and it can only prove to he a source of useless suffering but each man can aspire to shed light order peace and kindness around he in he little circle and that should be happiness enough not quite enough for I say moreau doubt would creep in it must be all or nothing i know you revolution would leave no place for doubt you heart be hard and burn you brain like geometric pattern everything or nothing no shading but what would life be without it it be its greatest charm and its chief merit as well fragile beauty and goodness weakness everywhere we must offer love and help day by day and step by step the world be not transform by force or by a miracle in the twinkling of a eye but second by second it move forward in infinity and the humblest who feel it partake of infinity patience and let we not think that one wrong efface will save humanity it will only make one day bright but other day and more light will come each will bring its sun you would not wish to stay its course we have not the time to wait for all this say moreau every day bring we frightful problem which must be decide on the spot if we be not to be the master then we shall be victim we do i say not ourselves alone we be already victimise but all that be dear to we all that hold we to life hope in the future the salvation of humanity see the thing that press upon we the agonising question as to those who will come after we and those who have child this war be not yet over and it be only too evident that its crime and falsehood have sow the seed of new war near at hand why do we have child for what do they grow up to be butcher like this look where you will there be no answer be we to leave these crazy country this old continent and emigrate but where be they fifty acre of ground on the globe where independent honest people can take refuge we must be on one side or the other you see well enough that we have to choose between patriotism and revolution if not what remain non-resistance be that what you would have but there be nothing in that unless you have religious faith otherwise it be only the resignation of the lamb lead to the slaughter unfortunately the greater number decide on nothing prefer not to think turn they eye away from the future blind by the hope that what they have see and suffer will not recur that be why we must decide for they whether they want it or not make they quicken they step save they in spite of themselves revolution mean a few man who will for all humanity i do not think that i should like it say clerambault if another decide for I and on the other hand i should not want to usurp another man 's will i should prefer to leave each one free and not interfere with the liberty of other but i know that i be ask too much only what be impossible say moreau when you begin to will you can not stop halfway there be just two sort of man those who have too great will-power -- like lenine and a couple of dozen man in the whole course of history -- and those who have too little who can decide nothing like we I if you like it be clear enough despair be all that drive I to will anything why despair say clerambault a man 's fate be make every day by himself and none know what it will be it be what we be if you be cast down so also be you fate we shall never have strength enough answer moreau sadly do not you believe that i see what infinitely small chance of success a revolution would have now in we country under present condition think of all the destruction the economic loss the demoralisation the fatal lassitude cause by the war and he add : it be not true what i tell you the first time we meet about all my comrade feel as i do rebel against the suffering gillot tell you there be only a few of we and the other be good fellow for the most part but weak as water they can see how thing be clearly enough but sooner than run they head against a wall they would rather not think about it or pass it off with a joke we french be always ready to laugh it be we treasure and we ruin it be a fine thing but what a hold it give to we oppressor ` let they sing as long as they be willing to pay ' as the italian say ` let we laugh so long as we be ready to die ' we might say and then this terrible force of habit that gillot be talk about a man will get use to no matter what ridiculous or painful condition provide they last long enough and that he have company he become habituate to cold to heat to death and to crime he whole force for resistance be use in adapt himself and then he curl up in he corner and do not dare to stir for fear that any change will bring back the pain we be all so terribly tired when the soldier come back they will have only one thought -- to sleep and forget how about the excitable lagneau who talk about blow everything to piece i have know lagneau since the beginning of the war and he have be in succession royalist revanchard annexationist internationalist socialist anarchist bolshevist and i-don ` t-give-a damnist he will finish as a reactionary and will be send to make food for cannon against the enemy that we government will pick out among we adversary or we friend of today do you suppose that the people be of we way of think perhaps or they may agree with the other they will take up all opinion one after the other you be a revolutionary then because you be discourage say clerambault laughing there be plenty like that among we gillot come out of the war more optimistic than he go in gillot be the forgetful sort but i do not envy he that say moreau bitterly but you ought not to upset he say clerambault gillot need all the help you can give he help from I say moreau incredulously he be not naturally strong and if you would make he so you must let he see that you believe in he do you think belief come by willing to have it you know whether that be true no i think be the answer belief come through love by love of those who believe be it not always through love and only in that way that we learn to trust moreau be touch he have be a clever youth eat up by the craving for knowledge and like the rest of he class he have suffer for lack of brotherly affection true human intercourse be banish from the education of today but this vital sentiment hitherto repress have revive in the trench fill with live suffer flesh throw together at first it be hard to let oneself go the general harden the fear of sentimentality or of ridicule tend to put barrier between heart but when moreau be lay up he sheath of pride begin to give way and clerambault have little difficulty in break through it the best thing about this man be that false pride melt before he for he have none of he own people show to he as he to they they real self they weakness and they trouble which we be teach to hide from a silly idea of self-respect moreau have unconsciously learn to recognize at the front the superiority of man who be he social inferior brother-soldier or non-com among these he have be much draw to gillot he be glad that clerambault should have appeal to he on behalf of he friend for he secret wish always be to be of some use to another man at the next opportunity clerambault whisper to gillot that he ought to be optimistic for two and cheer moreau up and thus each find help in the need of help the other accord to the great principle of life : give and it shall be give unto you no matter in what time one live nor what misfortune overtake one all be not lose as long as there remain in the heart of the race a spark of manly friendship blow it into a flame draw closer these cold solitary heart if only one of the fruit of this war of nation could be the fusion of the best among all class the union of the youth of many country -- of the manual labourer and the thinker -- the future would be re-bear through they mutual aid but if unity be not one want to dominate the other neither be it that one prefer to be dominate but this be precisely however what these young revolutionary think and insist upon with a curious sort of self-will they snub clerambault on the principle that intelligence should be at the service of the proletariat dienen dienen which be the last word even of the proud wagner more than one lofty spirit bring low have say the same if they could not rule supreme they would serve clerambault reflect : the rarest thing be to find honest people who want to be simply my equal but if we must choose tyranny for tyranny i prefer that which hold the body of aesop and epictetus in slavery but leave they mind free to that which promise only material liberty and enslave the soul this intolerance make he feel that he could never attach himself to any party no matter what it be between the two side war or revolution he could frankly state he preference for one revolution for it alone offer some hope for the future which the war could only destroy but to prefer a party do not mean that you yield to it all independence of think it be the error and abuse of democracy that they wish that all should have the same duty and impose the same task on all but in a advance community there be multiple task while the main body fight to gain a immediate advantage in progress there be other who should maintain eternal value far above the victor of tomorrow or yesterday and which be beyond all the rest and throw light on the way above the smoke of battle clerambault have allow himself to be too long blind by this smoke he could not plunge into a fresh fight but in this short-sighted world it be a impropriety almost a fault to see more clearly than you neighbor this sardonic truth be bring home to he in a discussion with these young st just they point out he mistake impertinently enough by compare he to the astrologer who fall into the pit : they say poor creature if you eye what lie beneath can hardly spy think you you gaze can pierce the sky he have enough sense of humor to see the justice of the comparison yes he be of the number of : those whom phantom alarm while some serious harm threaten they or they farm even so he say do you think that you republic will have no need of astronomer just as the first one could get along without chemist or be they all to be mobilise in that case there would be a good chance of you all find yourselve together at the bottom of the well be that what you want i should not object so much if it be only a question of share you fate but when it come to join in you hatred you have some of you own from what i have hear say one of the young man just at this moment another man come in with a newspaper in he hand and call to clerambault : congratulation old boy i see you enemy bertin be dead the irascible journalist have die in a few hour from a attack of pneumonia for the last six month he have pursue with fury anyone whom he suspect of work for peace or even of wish for it from one step to another he have come to look upon not only the country as sacred but the war also and among those whom he attack most fiercely clerambault have a foremost place bertin could not pardon the resistance to he onslaught clerambault 's reply have at first only irritated he but the disdainful silence with which he latest invective have be meet drive he beside himself he swollen vanity be deeply wounded and nothing would have satisfy he but the total annihilation of he adversary to he clerambault be not only a personal enemy but a foe to the public and in the endeavor to prove this he make he the center of a great pacifist plot at any other time this would have seem absurd in everyone 's eye but now no one have eye to see with during the last week bertin 's fury and violence have go beyond anything that he have write before they be a threat against anyone who be convict or suspect of the dangerous heresy of peace in this little reunion the news of he death be receive with noisy satisfaction and he funeral oration be preach with a energy that yield nothing in this line to the effort of the most famous master but clerambault absorb in the newspaper account scarcely seem to hear one of the man stand near tap he on the shoulder and say : this ought to be a pleasure to you clerambault start : pleasure he say pleasure -- he take he hat and go out it be pitch dark in the street outside all the light have be out on account of a air-raid before he mind there flower the fine clear-cut face of a boy of sixteen with its warm pale skin and dark soft eye the curling hair the mobile smile mouth the tone of the sweet voice -- bertin as he be when they first meet at about the same age they long evening talk the tender confidence the discussion the dream for in those day bertin too be a dreamer and even he common-sense he precocious irony do not protect he from impossible hope and generous scheme for the renovation of the human race how fair the future have appear to they youthful eye and in those moment of ecstatic vision how they heart have seem to melt together in loving friendship and now to see what life have make of they both this rancorous struggle bertin 's insane determination to trample under foot those early dream and the friend who still cherish they -- and he too clerambault who have let himself be carry away by the same murderous impulse try to render blow for blow to draw blood from he adversary could it be that at the first moment when he hear of the death of he former friend -- he be horrify at himself -- but do he not feel it as a relief what be it that possess we all what wicked insanity that turn we against we better self lose in these thought he have wander from the road and now perceive that he be walk in the wrong direction he could see the long arm of the search-light stretch across the sky hear the tremendous explosion of the zeppelin bomb over the city and the distant growling of the fort in the aerial fight the enraged people tear each other to piece and to what end that they all might be as bertin be now reach the extinction which await all man and all country and those rebel who be plan more violence other sanguinary idol to set up against the old one new god of carnage that man carve for himself in the vain hope of ennoble he deadly instinct good god why do they not see the imbecility of they conduct in face of the gulf that swallow up each man that die all humanity with he these million of creature who have but a moment to live why do they persist in make it infernal by they atrocious and absurd quarrel about idea like wretch who cut each other 's throat for a handful of spurious coin throw to they we be all victim under the same sentence and instead of unite we fight among ourselves poor fool on the brow of each man that pass i can see the sweat of agony efface it by the kiss of peace as he think this a crowd of people rush by -- man and woman shriek with joy there be one of they down one go the brute be burn up and the bird of prey in the air rejoice in they turn over every handful of death that they scatter on the town like gladiator die in the arena for the pleasure of some invisible nero alas my poor fellow-prisoner part five _ they also serve who only stand and wait _ milton once more clerambault find himself wrapt in solitude but this time she appear to he as never before calm and beautiful kindness shine from she face with eye full of affection and soft cool hand which she lay on he fevered forehead he know that now she have choose he for she own it be not give to every man to be alone many groan under it but with a secret pride it be the complaint of the age and prove without those who complain be aware of it that solitude have not marked they for she own that they be not she familiar they have pass the outer door and be cool they heel in the vestibule but they have not have patience to wait they turn to go in or else they recrimination have keep they at a distance no one can penetrate to the heart of friendly solitude unless they have the gift of god 's grace or have gain the benefit of trial bravely accept outside the door you must leave the dust of the road the harsh voice and mean thought of the world egotism vanity miserable rebellion against disappointment in love or ambition -- it must be that like the pure orphic shades whose golden tablet have transmit to we they die voice _ the soul flee from the circle of pain _ and present itself alone and bare _ to the chill fountain which flow from the lake of memory _ this be the miracle of the resurrection he who have cast off he mortal coil and think that he have lose everything find that he be only just enter on he true life not only be other as well as himself restore to he but he see that up to now he have never really possess they outside in the throng how can he see over the head of those who press about he and it be not possible for he to look long into the eye of those who influence he even though they be he dearest for they be press too close against he there be no time no perspective we feel only that we body be crush together closely entwine by we common destiny and toss on the muddy torrent of multitudinous existence clerambault feel that he have not see he son in any real sense until after he death and the brief hour in which he and rosine have recognize each other be one in which the bond of a baleful delusion have be break by the force of suffer now that by means of successive elimination he have arrive at solitude he feel withdraw from the passion of the living but they stand out all the more to he in a kind of lucid intimacy all not only he wife and child but the million of being whom he have think to embrace in a oratorical affection they all paint themselves on the dark background on the sombre river of destiny which sweep humanity away and which he have confound with it appear million of struggle living fragment -- man and each have he own personality each be a whole world of joy and sorrow dream and effort and each be i i bend over he and it be myself i see i say the eye and the heart repeat i my brother at last i understand you for you fault be also mine even to the fury with which you pursue I i recognize that also for it be once more i from this time onward clerambault begin to see man not with the eye in he head but with he heart -- no longer with idea of pacifism or tolstoïsm _ -lrb- another folly -rrb- _ but by seize the thought of he fellow and put himself in they place he begin to discover afresh the people around he even those who have be most hostile to he the intellectual and the politician and he see plainly they wrinkle they white hair the bitter line about they mouth they bent back they shaky leg overwrought nervous ready to break down how much they have age in six month the excitement of the fight have keep they up at first but as it go on and no matter what the issue the ruin become plain each one have he grief and each fear to lose the little -- but that little infinitely precious -- remain to he they try to hide they agony and clench they tooth but all suffer doubt have begin to undermine the most confident hush not a word it will kill I if you speak of it clerambault full of pity thought of madame mairet he must hold he tongue in future -- but it be too late they all know now what he think and he be a living negation and remorse to they many hate he but clerambault no longer resent it he be almost ready to help they to restore they lose illusion these soul be full of a passionate faith which they feel to be threaten and this lend they a quality of tragic pitiable greatness with the politician this be complicate by the absurd trappings of theatrical declamation with the intellectual by the obstinacy of mania but in spite of all the wound be visible you could hear the cry of the heart that cling to belief that call for a heroic delusion this faith be very touching in some young and simple people no declamation no pretension to knowledge only the desperate clinging of a devotion which have give all and in return ask for one word only : it be true thou my beloved my country power divine still livest to whom i have offer up my life and all that i loved -- one could kneel before those poor little black gown before those mother wife and sister one long to kiss the thin hand that tremble with the hope and fear of the hereafter and say : mourn not -- for ye shall be comfort what consolation can one offer when one do not believe in the ideal for which they live and which be kill they -- the long-sought answer finally come to clerambault almost unconsciously : you must care for man more than for illusion or even for truth clerambault 's warm feeling be not reciprocate and he be more attack than ever though for some month he have publish nothing in the autumn of 1917 the anger against he have rise to a unheard-of height the disproportion be really laughable between this rage and the feeble word of one man but it be so all over the world a dozen or so weak pacifist alone surround without means of be hear through any paper of stand speak honestly but not loudly and this let loose a perfect frenzy of insult and threat at the slightest contradiction the monster opinion fall into a epileptic fit the prudent perrotin who as a rule be surprise at nothing keep quiet and let clerambault ruin himself he own way but even he be alarm by this explosion of tyrannical stupidity in history and at a distance it could be laugh at but close at hand it look as if the human brain be about to give way why be it that in this war man lose they mental balance more than in any other at any previous time have the war be really more atrocious that be either childish nonsense or a deliberate forgetfulness of what have happen in we own day under we eye in armenia in the balkan during the repression of the commune in colonial war under new conquistador in china and the congo of all animal we know the human beast have always be the most ferocious then be it because man have more faith in the war of today surely not the western people have reach the point of evolution when war seem so absurd that we could no longer practice it and preserve we reason we be oblige to intoxicate ourselves to go crazy unless we would die the despairing death of darkest pessimism and that be why the voice of one sane man throw into fit of rage all the other who want to forget they be afraid that this voice would wake they up and that they would find themselves sober disgraced and without a rag to cover they it be all the worse because at this time the war be go badly and the fine hope of victory and glory which have be light up so many time be begin to die out it begin to be probable no matter which way you look at it that the war would be a failure for everybody neither interest nor ambition nor ideal would get anything out of it and the bitter useless sacrifice see at close range with nothing gain make man who feel themselves responsible furious they be force either to accuse themselves or throw the blame on other and the choice be quickly make the disaster be attribute to all those who have foresee the defeat and try to prevent it every retreat of the army every diplomatic blunder find a excuse in the machination of the pacifist and these unpopular gentry to whom no one listen be invest by they opponent with the formidable power of organise defeat in order that none should be ignorant of this a writing be hang about they neck with the word defeatist like they brother-heretic of the good old day all that remain be to burn they and if the executioner be not at hand there be at least plenty of assistant at first by way of get they hand in the authority pick out inoffensive people -- woman teacher anyone who be little known and unable to defend himself and then they turn they attention to something bigger it be a good chance for a politician to rid himself of a dangerous rival of anyone possess of secret or likely to rise in the future above all accord to the old receipt they take care to mix accusation throw into the same bag vulgar sharper and those whose character and mind make they uneasy so that in all this mess the blindfold public do not attempt to distinguish between a honest man and a scamp in this way those who be not sufficiently compromise by they action find themselves involve in those of they associate and if these be lack the authority stand ready if necessary to supply they make to order to fit the accusation when xavier thouron first come to see clerambault how could anyone know if he be in the secret service he might very well have come of he own accord and it be impossible to say what he intention be perhaps he hardly know himself in the purlieus of a great city there be always unscrupulous adventurer rush about seek whom they may devour they have ravenous appetite and curiosity to match and anything will do to fill up this ache void they be willing to say black be white all be grist that come to they mill and they be capable of throw you into the water one minute and jump in to save you the next they be not too careful of they skin but the animal inside have to be feed and amuse if he stop make face and stuff for one moment he might die of boredom and disgust at he own vacancy but he be too clever for that he will not stop to think until he die -- splendidly on he foot like the roman emperor no one could have tell thouron 's real object when he go for the first time to clerambault 's house as usual he be very busy excited and on the scent of he know not what he be one of those great journalist -- they be rare in the profession -- who without take the trouble to read a thing can give you a vivid brilliant account of it which often by a miracle prove to be fairly just he say he little piece to clerambault without too many mistake and appear to believe it perhaps he do while the word be on he lip why not he be a sort of pacifist himself from time to time it depend on the direction of the wind or the attitude of certain of he brother-writer whom he sometimes follow and occasionally oppose clerambault could never cure himself of a childlike trust in anyone who come to he and he allow himself to be touch -- besides the press of he country have not spoil he of late so he pour out the inmost thought of he heart while thouron take it all in with the deepest interest a acquaintance thus closely form could not of course stop there letter be exchange in which one speak and the other lead he on thouron persuade clerambault to put he idea in the form of little popular pamphlet which he undertake to distribute among the work class clerambault hesitate and refuse at first the partisan of the reign order and injustice pretend hypocritically to disapprove of the secret propaganda of a new truth clerambault see no harm in it when no other way be possible -lrb- all persecute faith have they catacomb -rrb- but he do not feel himself suit to such a course of action it be more he part to say what he think and take the consequence and he feel sure that the word would spread of itself without he hawk it about he would have blush to admit it but perhaps a secret instinct hold he back from the offer of service make he by this eager drummer but he could not altogether restrain he zeal thouron publish in he paper a sort of apologium for clerambault he tell of he visit and they conversation and he explain and paraphrase the thought of the poet clerambault be astonish when he read they he hardly know he own idea again but nevertheless he could not altogether deny they for bury among thouron 's commentary he find literal and accurate quotation from he letter these however be even more confuse the same word and phrase graft on other context take on a accent and a color that he have not give they add that the censor in he zeal for the safety of the country have tamper with the quotation cut out here and there a word half a line or the end of a paragraph -- all perfectly innocent but this suppression suggest the worst iniquity to the over-excited mind of the reader all this be like oil on the flame and the effect be soon feel clerambault do not know which way to turn to keep he champion quiet and yet he could not be angry with he for thouron have he share of threat and insult but he be use to thing of this kind and they fall from he like water off a duck 's back after this common experience thouron claim special rights over clerambault and have try without success to make he buy share in he newspaper he put he on the list of honourary member without he knowledge and think it very strange that clerambault be not delight when he find it out a few week later they relation be slightly cool by this incident but thouron continue to parade the name of he distinguished friend from time to time in he article the latter let this go on think himself fortunate to get off so easily he have rather lose sight of he when he hear one day that thouron have be arrest he be implicate in a rather shabby money affair which be as usual ascribe to plot of the enemy the court follow the lead of those higher-up could not fail to find a connection between these shady transaction and thouron 's so-called pacifism this have show itself in he paper in a irregular incoherent way subject to attack of exterminism but none the less it be all suppose to be part of the great defeatist scheme and the examination of he correspondence allow the authority to drag in anyone they choose as he have carefully keep every letter from man of all shades of opinion there be plenty to choose from and they soon find what they want it be only through the papers that clerambault hear that he be on the list and they breathe a triumphant : at last we have get he all be now clear for if a man think differently from the rest of the world be it not plain as daylight that there must be some low motive underneath it all seek and you will find they have find and without go further one pari newspaper announce the treason of clerambault there be no trace of this in the indictment but justice do not feel that it be she business to correct people 's mistake clerambault be summon before the magistrate and beg in vain to be tell of what offence he be accuse the judge be polite show he the consideration due to a man of he notoriety but seem in no haste to dismiss the case it almost look as if he be wait for something for what why for the crime of course madame clerambault have not the temper of a roman matron nor even of that high-spirited jewess in the celebrated affair which cut france in two some twenty year ago who cling more closely to she husband on account of the public injustice she have the timid instinctive respect of the french _ bourgeoisie _ for the official verdict though she know that there be no grounds for the accusation against clerambault she feel that it be a disgrace to be accuse which also affect she and this she could not bear in silence unfortunately in reply to she reproach clerambault take the worst possible line without mean it for instead of try to defend himself he only say : my poor wife it be awfully hard on you yes you be right and then wait till the shower be over but this tone upset madame clerambault who be furious because she feel she have no hold on she husband she know perfectly that though he appear to agree with she she could not turn he from he course of action despairing of success she go off to pour she trouble into the ear of she brother leo camus make no attempt to disguise he opinion that the best thing she could do be to get a divorce which he represent to she as a duty this however be go a little too far she be after all a respectable _ bourgeoise _ and the traditional horror of divorce re-awaken she profound fidelity and make she think the remedy worse than the disease so they remain unite on the surface but intimacy between they be go rosine be out nearly all day for in order to forget she unhappiness she be take a course in trained nursing and she pass a large part of she time away from home even when she be at home she thought seem far away and clerambault have never regain he former place in he daughter 's heart another fill it now -- daniel she treat she father coldly he be the cause of she separation from the man of she heart and this be a way of punish he and though she be too just not to reproach herself still she could not alter injustice be sometimes a consolation daniel have not forget any more than rosine he be not proud of he conduct but it rather soften he remorse to throw the blame on he surroundings on the tyrannical opinion which have coerce he but in he heart he be discontent with himself accident come to the assistance of this sulk pair of lover daniel be seriously but not dangerously wounded and be evacuate back to pari during he convalescence he be walk one day near the square of the bon marché when he see rosine he stand still a moment but as she come forward without hesitation they go on into the square and begin a long conversation which beginning by embarrassment and interrupt by numerous reproach and avowal lead finally to a perfect understanding between they they be so absorb in they tender explanation that they do not see madame clerambault when she come near and the good lady overcome by this unexpected meeting hurry home to tell the news to she husband in spite of they estrangement she could not keep this to herself he listen to she indignant recital for she could not bear that she daughter should have anything to do with a man whose family have affront they and when she have finish he say nothing at first accord to he present habit until at last he shake he head smile and say : good enough madame clerambault stop short shrug she shoulder turn to go but with she hand on the door of she room she look back and say : these people insult you rosine and you agree to have nothing more to do with they and now _ you daughter _ be make advance to this man who have refuse she and you say it be ` good enough ' i can not understand you any longer you must be out of you mind clerambault try to show she that he daughter 's happiness do not consist in agreement with he idea and that rosine be quite right to get rid of the consequence of he foolishness where they affect herself you foolishness that be the first word of sense that you have say in year you see yourself that i be right say he and make she promise to let rosine arrange she romance as she please the girl be radiant when she come in but she say nothing of what have pass madame clerambault hold she tongue with great difficulty and the father see with tender amusement the happiness that shine once more on the face of he child he do not know exactly what have happen but he guess that rosine have throw he and he idea overboard -- sweetly of course but still -- the lover have make it up at they parent ' expense and both have blame with admirable justice the old people 's exaggeration on either side the year in the trench have emancipate daniel from the narrow fanaticism of he family without impair he patriotism and rosine in exchange have gently admit that she father have be mistake they agree with little difficulty for she be naturally calm and fatalistic which suit perfectly with daniel 's stoical acceptance of thing as they be they have decide therefore to go through life together without pay any more attention to the disagreement of those who have come before they as the say be -- though it would be more exact to say those whom they be leave behind they the future also trouble they little like million of other human being they only ask they share of happiness at the moment and shut they eye to everything else madame clerambault be annoy that she daughter say nothing of the event of the morning and soon go out again rosine and she father sit dreamily he by the window smoking and she with a unread magazine before she she look absently about the room with happy eye try to recall the detail of the scene between she and daniel she glance fall on she father 's weary face and its melancholy expression strike she sharply she get up and stand behind he lay she hand on he shoulder and say with a little sigh of compassion that try to conceal she inward joy : poor little papa clerambault look at rosine whose eye in spite of herself shine with happiness : and my little girl be not ` poor ' any longer be she rosine blush : why do you say that she ask clerambault only shake he head at she and she lean forward lay she cheek against he : she be no longer poor he repeat no she whisper she be very very rich tell I about this fortune of hers she have -- first of all -- she dear papa oh you little fraud say clerambault try to move so that he could see she face but rosine put she hand over he eye : no i do not want you to look at I or say anything to I she kiss he again and say caressingly : poor dear little papa rosine have now escape from the care that weigh on the house and it be not long before she fly away from the nest altogether for she have pass she examination and be send to a hospital in the south both the clerambault feel painfully the loss to they empty fireside but the man be not the more lonely of the two he know this and be sincerely sorry for he wife who have not either the strength of mind to follow he path nor to leave he as for he he feel that now no matter what happen he would never be bereft of sympathy persecution would arouse it and lead the most reserved people to express they feel a very precious evidence of this come to he at this time one day when he be alone in the apartment the bell ring and he go to open the door a lady be there whom he do not know she hold out a letter mention she name as she do so in the dim light of the vestibule she have take he for the servant but at once see she mistake as he try to persuade she to come in no say she i be only a messenger and she go away but when she have go he find a little bunch of violet that she have lay on a table near the door the letter be as follow : _ tu ne cede mali sed contra audentior ito _ you fight for we and we heart be with you pour out you trouble to we and i will give you my hope my strength and my love i be one who can act only through you the youthful ardor of these last mysterious word touch and puzzle clerambault he try to remember the lady as she stand on he threshold she be not very young fine feature grave dark eye in a worn face where have he see she before the fugitive impression fade as he try to hold it he see she again two or three day later not far from he in the luxembourg garden she walk on and as he cross the path to meet she she stop and wait for he he thank she and ask why she have go away so quickly the other day without say who she be and as he speak it come to he that he have know she for a long time he use to see she formerly in the luxembourg or in the neighbouring street with a tall boy who must have be she son every time they pass each other they eye use to meet with a half-smile of respectful recognition and though he do not know they name and they have never exchange a word they be to he part of those friendly shadow which throng about we daily life not always notice when they be there but which leave a gap when they disappear at once he thought leap from the woman before he to the young companion whom he miss from she side in these day of mourn you could never tell who might be still in the land of the living but he cry impulsively : it be you son who write to I yes say she he be a great admirer of yours we have both feel draw to you for a long time he must come to see I he can not do that why not be he at the front no he be here after a moment 's silence clerambault ask : have he be wound would you like to see he say the mother clerambault walk beside she in silence not daring to ask any question but at last he say : you be fortunate at least that you can have he near you always she understand and hold out she hand : we be always very close to one another she say and clerambault repeat : at least he be near you i have he soul she answer they have now reach the house a old seventeenth century dwelling in one of the narrow ancient street between the luxembourg and st sulpice where the pride of old france still subsist in retirement the great door be shut even at this hour madame froment pass in ahead of clerambault go up two or three step at the back of a paved court and enter the apartment on the ground floor dear edmé say she as she open the door of the room i have a surprise for you guess what it be clerambault see a young man look at he as he lay extend on a couch the fair youthful face light up by the setting sun with its intelligent eye look so healthy and calm that at first sight the thought of illness do not present itself you he exclaim you here he look younger than ever with this joyful surprise on he face but neither the body nor the arm which be cover move in the least and clerambault come nearer saw that the head alone seem to be alive mamma you have be give I away say edmé froment do you not want to see I say clerambault bend over he that be not just what i mean but i be not very anxious to be see why not i should like to know say clerambault in a tone which he try to make gay because a man do not ask visitor to the house when he be not there himself where be you if one may ask i could almost swear that i be shut up in a old egyptian mummy -- he glance at the bed and he immovable body : there be no life leave in it he say you have more life than any of we say a voice beside they clerambault look up and see on the other side of the couch a tall young man full of health and strength who seem to be about the same age as edmé who smile and say to clerambault : my friend chastenay have enough vitality to lend I some and to spare if that be only literally true say the other and the two friend exchange a affectionate glance chastenay continue : i should in that case only be give back a part of what i owe you then turn to clerambault he add : he be the one who keep we all up be it not so madame fanny indeed yes i could not do without my strong son say the mother tenderly they take advantage of the fact that i can not defend myself say edmé to clerambault you see i can not stir a inch be it a wound paralysis -- clerambault do not dare to ask for detail but after a pause : do you suffer much he inquire i ought to wish that it be so perhaps for pain be a tie between we and the shore however i confess that i prefer the silence of this body in which i be encase let we say no more about it my mind at least be free and if it be not true that it ' _ agitat molem _ ' do often escape i know say clerambault it come to see I the other day not for the first time it have be there before and i who think myself desert do you recall say edmé the word of randolph to cecil -- ' _ the voice of a man alone can in one hour put more life into we than the clang of five hundred trumpet sound continuously _ ' that always remind I of you say chastenay but edmé go on as if he have not hear he : you have wake we all up clerambault look at the brave calm eye of the paralytic and say : you eye do not look as if they need to be wake they do not need it now say edmé the farther off one be the better one see but when i be close to everything i see very little tell I what you see now it be get late say edmé and i be rather tire will you come another time tomorrow if you will let I as clerambault go out chastenay join he he feel the need of confide to a heart that could feel the pain and grandeur of the tragedy of which he friend have be at once the hero and the victim edmé froment have be strike on the spinal column by a explode shell young as he be he be one of the intellectual leader of he generation handsome ardent eloquent overflow with life and vision loving and beloved nobly ambitious and all at once at a blow -- a living death he mother who have centre all she pride and love on he now see he condemn for the rest of he day to this terrible fate they have both suffer terribly but each hide it from the other and this effort keep they up they take great pride in each other she have all the care of he wash and feed he like a little child and he keep calm for she sake and sustain she on the wing of he spirit ah say chastenay it make one feel ashamed -- when i think that i be alive and well that i can reach out my arm to life that i can run and leap and draw this bless air into my lung as he speak he stretch out he arm raise he head and breathe deeply i ought to feel remorseful he add lower he voice and the worst be that i do not clerambault could not help smile it be not very heroic continue chastenay and yet i care more for froment than for anyone on earth and he fate make I wretchedly unhappy but all the same when i think of my luck to be here at this moment when so many be go and to be well and sound i can hardly keep from show how glad i be it be so good to live and be whole poor edmé you must think I terribly selfish no what you say be perfectly natural and healthy if we be all as sincere as you humanity would not be the victim of the wicked notion of glory in suffer you have every right to enjoy life after the trial you have pass through and as he speak he touch the croix de guerre which the young man wear on he breast i have be through they and i be go back say chastenay but there be no merit in that there be nothing else that i can do i be not try to deceive you and pretend that i love to smell powder you can not go through three year of war and still want to run risk and be indifferent to danger even if you do feel like that in the beginning i be so -- i may frankly say i do go in for heroism but i have lose all that it be really part ignorance and part rhetoric and when one be rid of these the nonsense of the war the idiotic slaughter the ugliness the horrible useless sacrifice must be clear to the narrowest mind if it be not manly to fly from the inevitable it be not necessary either to go in search of what can be avoid the great corneille be a hero behind the line those whom i have know at the front be almost hero in spite of themselves that be the true heroism say clerambault that be froment 's kind say chastenay he be a hero because there be nothing else that he can be not even a man but the dearest thing about he be that in spite of everything he be a real man the truth of this remark be abundantly evident to clerambault in a long conversation that he have with froment the next day if the courage of the young man do not desert he in the ruin of he life it be all the more to he credit as he have never profess to be a apostle of self-abnegation he have have great hope and robust ambition fully justify by he talent and vigorous youth but unlike he friend chastenay he have never for a moment cherish any illusion as to the war the disastrous folly of it have be clear to he at once and this he owe not only to he own penetrate mind but to that inspiring angel who from he earliest infancy have weave the soul of she son from she own pure spirit whenever clerambault go to see edmé madame froment be almost always there but she keep in the background sit at the window with she work only stop occasionally to throw a tender glance at she son she be not a woman of exceptional cleverness but she have what may be call the intelligence of the heart and she mind have be cultivate by the influence of she husband -- a distinguished physician much older than herself thus it have happen that she whole life have be fill by these two profound feeling a almost filial love for she husband and a more passionate sentiment for she son dr froment a cultivate man with much originality of mind which he conceal under a grave courtesy as if he fear to wind other by he distinction have travel all over europe as well as in egypt persium and indium he have be a student of science and of religion and he special interest have be the new form of faith appear in the world such as babism christian science and theosophical doctrine as he have keep in touch with the pacifist movement and be a friend of baroness suttner whom he have know in vienna he have long see the catastrophe approach which threaten he and all he love but man of courage as he be and accustom to the indifference of nature he have not try to delude he family as to the future but have rather seek to strengthen they soul to meet the danger that hang over they head more than all he word he example be sacred to he wife for the son have be yet a child at the time of he father 's death dr froment have suffer from a cancer of the intestine and during the whole course of the slow and painful disease he have follow he ordinary occupation up to the last minute sustain the courage of he loved one by this serene fortitude this noble picture which dwell in madame froment 's heart and which she worship in secret be to she what religion be to other woman to this though she have no clear belief in the future life she pray especially in difficult moment as if to a ever-present helpful friend and by a singular phenomenon sometimes observe after death the essence of she husband 's soul seem to have pass into hers for this reason she son have grow up in a atmosphere of placid thought while most of the young generation before 1914 be feverish restless aggressive irritated by delay when the war break out there be no need for madame froment to protect herself or she son against the national excess they be both stranger to such idea but they make no attempt to resist the inevitable they have watch the come of this misfortune for so long all that they could do now be to bear it bravely while try to preserve what be the most precious thing to they they soul ' faith madame froment do not consider it necessary to be _ au-dessus de la mêlée _ in order to lead it and she accomplish in she limited sphere simply but more efficaciously what be attempt by writer in germany and england -- a form of international reconciliation she have keep in touch with many old friend and without be trouble in circle infect by the war-spirit or ever undertake useless demonstration against the war she be a check on insane manifestation of hatred by she simple presence she quiet word and manner she good judgment and the respect inspire by she kindness in family that be sympathetic she distribute message from liberal european among other clerambault 's article though without he knowledge it be a source of satisfaction when she see that they heart be touch a greater joy still be to see that she son himself be transform edmé froment be not in the least a tolstoyan pacifist at first he think the war more a folly than a crime and if he have be free he would have withdraw like perrotin into high dilettantism of art and think without attempt the hopeless task of fight the prevail opinion for which he then feel more contempt than pity since he forced participation in the war he have be oblige to acknowledge that this folly be so largely expiate by suffer that it would be superfluous to add anything to it man have make he own hell upon earth and there be no need of further condemnation he be on leave at pari when he come across clerambault 's article which show he that there be something better for he to do than to set himself up as a judge of he companion in misery that it would be far nobler to try to deliver they while take he share of the common burden the young disciple be dispose to go farther than he master clerambault who be naturally affectionate and rather weak find he joy in communion with other man and suffer even when divide in spirit from they error he be a confirm self-doubter he be prone to look in the eye of the crowd for agreement with he idea he exhaust himself in futile effort to reconcile he inward belief with the aspiration and the social struggle of he time froment who have the soul of a chieftain in a helpless body dauntlessly maintain that for he who bear the torch of a lofty ideal it be a absolute duty to hold it high over the head of he comrade that it would be wrong to confuse it in the other illuminations the commonplace of democracy that voltaire have less wit than mr everybody be nonsense _ democritus ait unus mihus pro populo est _ to I a individual be as good as a thousand we modern faith see in the social group the summit of human evolution but where be the proof froment think the greatest height be reach in a individual superiority million of man have live and die to produce one perfect flower of thought for such be the superb and prodigal way of nature she spend whole people to make a jesus a buddha a aeschylus a vincus a newton or a beethoven but without these man what would the people have be or humanity itself we do not hold with the egotist ideal of the superman a man who be great be great for all he fellow he individuality express and often guide million of other it be the incarnation of they secret force of they highest desire it concentrate and realize they the sole fact that a man be christ have exalt and lift generation of humanity fill they with the divine energy and though nineteen century have since pass million have not cease to aspire to the height of this example though none have attain to it thus understand the ideal individualist be more productive for human society than the ideal communist who would lead we to the mechanical perfection of the bee-hive and at the very least he be indispensable as corrective and complement this proud individualism state by froment with burn eloquence be a support to clerambault 's mind prone to waver and undecided from good-nature self-distrust and the wish to understand other froment render clerambault another important service more in the current of world-thought and through he family come in closer contact with foreign thinker a accomplished linguist besides froment could bring to mind those other man in all nation who great in they isolation fight for the right to a free conscience it be a console spectacle all the work under the surface of thought suppress but struggle towards truth and the knowledge that the worst tyranny that have crush the soul of humanity since the inquisition have fail to stifle the indomitable will to remain free and true no doubt these lofty individuality be rare but they power be all the greater the fine outline be more striking see against the dark horizon in the fall of the nation to the foot of the precipice where million lie in a shapeless mass they voice seem to rise with the only human note and they action gain emphasis from the anger with which it be meet a century ago chateaubriand write : it be vain to struggle longer henceforward the only important thing be to be he do not know that to be in we time be oneself be free imply the greatest of combat those who be true to themselves dominate through the level down of the rest clerambault be not the only one to feel the benefit of of froment 's energy for at he bedside he be sure to find some friend who come perhaps without admit it more to get comfort than to bring it two or three of these be young about edmé 's age the other man over fifty old friend of the family or those who have know froment before the war one of these have be he professor a old hellenist with a sweet absent smile then there be a grey-haired sculptor he face plough by deep tragic line a country gentleman clean-shaved red-cheeked with the massive head of a old peasant and finally a doctor he have a white beard he face be worn and kind and you be strike by the strange expression of he eye one seem to look sharply at you and the other be sad and dreamy there be little resemblance between these man who sometimes meet at the invalid 's house all shades of thought could be find in the group from the catholic to the freethinker and the bolshevist -- one of froment 's young friend profess to be of this opinion in they you could find the trace of the most various intellectual ancestry the ironic lucian appear in the old professor the count de coulange be wont to solace himself in the evening on he estate with cattle and fertiliser but also revel in the gorgeous texture of froissart 's style like cloth of gold and the countrified juicy talk of that rascal gondus -- the count certainly have the old french chronicler in he vein the sculptor wrinkle he brow in the effort to find metaphysics in rodin and beethoven and dr verrier have a streak of the marvellous in he disposition this he satisfy by the hypothesis of biology and the wonder of modern chemistry though he would glance at the paradise of religion with the disenchanted smile of the man of science he bear he part in the sad trial of the time but the era of war with all its gory glory fade for he before the heroic discovery of thought make by a new newton the german einstein in the midst of the general distraction these man all differ in the form of they mind and in they temperament but they all agree in this they belong to no party each thought for himself and each respect and love liberty in himself or in other what else matter in we day all the old framework be break down religious political or social it be but small progress if we call ourselves socialist or republican rather than monarchist if these caste accept nationalism of state faith or class there be now only two sort of mind : those shut up behind bar and those open to all that be alive to the entire race of man even we enemy these man few though they may be compose the true international which rest on the worship of truth and universal life they know well that they be each too weak to embrace alone they great ideal but it be infinite and can embrace they all unite in one object they push on by they separate way towards the unknown god these independent spirit be all draw towards edmé froment at this time because they obscurely see in he the point where they could meet the clearing from which every path in the forest be visible froment have not always try to bring other together as long as he be well and strong he too have take he own way but since he course have be cut short after a time of bitter despondency of which he say nothing he have place himself at the cross-road as he could not possibly act himself he be better able to view the whole field and take part in spirit he see the different current : country revolution contest between state and class science and faith -- like a stream 's conflicting force with its rapid whirlpool and reef it may sometimes slacken or turn its course but it always flow on irresistibly -lrb- even reaction be carry forward -rrb- and he the poor youth stake at he cross-road take all these current unto he the entire stream edmé remind clerambault sometimes of perrotin but he and froment be world apart the latter also deny nothing of what be and wish to understand everything but he be a fiery spirit he whole soul be fill with order movement and feeling with he all life and death go forward and upward and he body lay there motionless it be a dark hour the turn of the year 1917-18 in the foggy winter night man wait for the supreme onslaught of the german army which rumor have foretell for month past the gotha raid on pari have already begin those who want to fight to the end pretend confidence the papers keep on boasting and clemenceau have never sleep better in he life but the tension show in the increase bitterness of feeling among civilian the agonised public turn on the suspect among they the defeatist and the pacifist and for day at a time the baying of a accuse public pursue these miserable creature and hunt they down and spy swarm of all sort patriotic denouncer half-crazed witness when towards the end of march the long-threatened great offensive against pari begin the sacred fury between fellow-citizen reach its height and there be no doubt that if the invasion have succeed before the german have arrive at the gate of the city the gallows at vincenne that altar of the country 's vengeance would have know many victim innocent or guilty accuse or condemn clerambault be often shout at in the street but he be not alarmed perhaps because he do not realize the danger one day moreau find he in a group of people dispute with a excited young man who have speak to he in a most insulting manner while they be talk the shell from a big bertha explode close by clerambault take no notice and go on quietly explain he position to the angry young man there be something positively comic in this obstinacy and the circle of listener be quick to feel it like true frenchman and begin to exchange joke not entirely of a refined nature but perfectly good-natured moreau catch hold of clerambault 's arm and try to drag he away but he stop and look at the laugh crowd the absurdity of the situation strike he in he turn and he too burst out laugh what a old fool i be say he to moreau who be still intent on get he away you have better look out for you be not the only fool in this town be the somewhat impertinent answer but clerambault would not understand what he mean the case against he have enter on a new phase he be now accuse of infraction of the law of the 5th of August 1914 -- a act to repress indiscretion in time of war he be accuse of pacifist propaganda among the work class where it be say that thouron have distribute clerambault 's writings with the consent of the author but there be no foundation for this as thouron be in a position to testify that clerambault have no knowledge of such propaganda and have certainly not authorise it it appear however singularly enough that thouron would not swear to anything of the sort he attitude be strange for instead of state the fact he equivocate as if he have something to hide it almost look as if he wish this to be notice which would have arouse suspicion if he have not be so careful unfortunately these suspicion seem to glance at clerambault though he say nothing against he or against anyone in fact he refuse to tell anything but he let it be understand that if he choose but he do not choose clerambault be confront with he and he attitude be perfect really chivalrous he lay he hand on he heart and declare that be have the admiration of a son for the great master and friend and when clerambault get impatient beg he to state simply just what have pass between they the other would do nothing but protest he undying devotion he would rather say nothing more he have nothing to add to he testimony it be all he fault he leave with a increase reputation while clerambault be suppose to have sheltered himself behind he devoted henchman the press unhesitatingly accuse clerambault of cowardice and meanwhile the case drag on clerambault appear every day to answer useless question with no decision in sight it might have be suppose that a man accuse without proof and subject for so long to injurious suspicion would have be entitle to the sympathy of the public but on the contrary everyone be more down on he than before they blame he because he be not already convict all sort of absurd story be in circulation about he it be assert that expert have discover through the shape of some letter misprint in a pamphlet of clerambault 's that it have come from a german press and this humbug be readily swallow by man who be suppose to be intelligent before the war -- only four year ago but it seem century so all these worthy folk pass sentence on a fellow-citizen on the slightest information it be not the first time and it will not be the last the best opinion be indignant that he should still be at liberty and reactionary papers fear that they prey would escape try to intimidate justice by loud accusation and demand that the case should be remove from the civil court and bring before a court-martial this excitement soon develop into one of those paroxysm which in pari be generally brief but violent for this sensible people do go crazy periodically it may be ask why man who be kind for the most part and naturally give to mutual tolerance not to say indifference should have these explosion of furious fanaticism when they seem to lose all feeling as well as common-sense some will tell you that this people be feminine in its virtue as well as in its vice that the delicate nerve and fine sensibility which cause it to excel in matter of taste and art also make it susceptible to attack of hysteria but i be of opinion that any people be manly only by accident if by a man you mean a reasonable creature -- a flattering but baseless idea man only use they reason from time to time and be soon wear out by the effort of think so those do they a favor who act for they encourage they in the direction of the least effort and not much be require to hate a new idea do not condemn they the friend of all who be persecute have say with he heroic indulgence : they know not what they do a active nationalist newspaper be eager in stir up the evil instinct that lay below the surface it live on the exploitation of hatred and suspicion which it call work for the regeneration of france -- france be reduce to this paper and its friend it publish cleramboche a collection of sanguinary article like those which succeed so well against jaurés it rouse people by declare that the traitor owe he safety to occult influence and that he would make he escape if he be not carefully watch and finally it appeal to popular justice victor vaucoux hate clerambault not that he know he at all it be not necessary to know a man in order to hate he but if he have know he he would have detest he still more he be he bear enemy before he even know that clerambault exist there be race among mind more antagonistic to each other in all country than those divide by a different skin or uniform he be a well-to-do _ bourgeois _ from the west of france and belong to a family of former servant of the empire who have be sulk for the last forty year in a sterile opposition he have a small property in the charente where he spend the summer and pass the rest of the time in paris have instinct for government which he could not satisfy he lay the blame for this on he family and on life and thus thwart he character have grow tyrannical so that he act the despot unconsciously to those nearest to he as a right and duty that could not be dispute the word tolerance have no meaning for he for _ he could not make a mistake _ nevertheless he possess intelligence and moral vigor he even have a heart but all wrap about and knot like a old tree-trunk till such force of expansion as he have within he be stunt he could absorb nothing from the outside when he read or travel he see everything with hostile eye he one wish be to go home and as the bark be too thick to be penetrate all he sap come from the foot of the tree -- from the _ dead _ he be the type of that portion of the race which stubborn but outworn have not life enough to spread itself abroad and shrink into a sentiment of aggressive self-defence this look with suspicion and antipathy on the young force which overflow around it at home and abroad grow nation and class all the passionate awkward attempt at social and moral improvement like poor barrès and he dwarf hero -lrb- 1 -rrb- such people want wall and barrier frontier and enemy in this state of siege vaucoux live and he family be force to live in the same way he wife who be a sweet sad effaced kind of person find the only method of escape -- and die left alone with he grief -- of which he make a kind of rampart as of everything about he -- have only one son thirteen year of age he have mount guard before he youth and bring he up to do the same strange that a man should bring a son into the world to fight against the future perhaps the boy if let alone would have find out life by instinct but in the father 's shut-up house a sort of jail he be he father 's prey they have few friend few book few or rather one newspaper whose petrified principle correspond to vaucoux ' need for conservation in the corpse-like meaning of the word as he son or he victim could not get away from he he inoculate he with all he own mental disease like those insect which deposit they egg in the living body of other and when the war break out he take he at once to a recruiting station and make he enlist for a man of he sort country be the noblest of thing -- the holy of holy he do not need to breathe the thrilling suggestion of the crowd he head be already turn and besides he never go with the crowd he carry country about with he -- the country and the past -- the eternally past -lrb- footnote 1 : simon and i then understand we hatred of stranger and barbarian and we egotism in which we include ourselves and we entire small moral family -- _ the first care of he who would wish to live must be to surround himself with high wall but even in he close garden he must introduce only those who be guide by the same feeling and interest analogous to he own _ a free man in three line three time this free man express the idea of shutting-up closing and surround with wall -rrb- he son be kill like clerambault 's son and the son of million of other father for the faith and the ideal of those father in which they do not believe vaucoux have none of clerambault 's doubt he do not know the meaning of the word and if he could have permit himself such a feeling he would have despise the idea hard man as he be he have love he son passionately though he have never show it and he could think of no better way to prove it now than by a ferocious hatred for those who have kill he not of course reckoning himself among the number there be not many method of revenge open to a man of he age rheumatic and stiff in one arm but he try to enlist and be reject he feel that something must be do and all that he have leave be he brain alone in he desert house with the memory of he dead wife and child he sit for hour brood on these vindictive thought and like a beast shake the bar of its cage wait for the chance to spring he mind rage furiously against the inhibition the war put upon he with its iron circle of the trench the clamor of the press draw he attention to clerambault 's article which be intensely distasteful to he the idea of snatch he precious hatred away from between he tooth from the slight acquaintance that he have with clerambault before the war he feel a antipathy for he as a writer on account of the new form of he art and as a man for numerous reason : he love of life and other man he democratic ideal he rather silly optimism and he european aspiration at the very first glance with the instinct of a rheumatic in mind and body vaucoux have class clerambault as one of those pestilent person who open door and window and make a draught in that close house he country that be as he understand the term in he mind there could be no other after this there be no need for the vociferation of the papers in the author of the appeal to the living and the pardon from the dead he see at once a agent of the enemy and with he thirst for revenge he know the opportunity have come nothing can be more convenient than to detest those who differ from you especially when you do not understand they but poor clerambault have not this resource for he do understand perfectly these good people have have to bear injury from the enemy of course because they be strike by they but also frankly because of injustice with a capital i for in they short-sightedness it fill the field of vision the capacity to feel and judge be very limit in a ordinary man submerge as he be in the species he cling to any driftwood and just as he reduce the infinite number of shades in the river of light to a few color the good and evil that flow in the vein of the world be only perceptible to he when he have bottle a few sample choose among those around he all good and bad then he have in he flask and on these he can expend he whole power of liking or repulsion witness the fact that to million of excellent people the condemnation of dreyfus or the sinking of the lusitanium remain the crime of the century they can not see that the path of social life be pave with crime and that they walk over it in perfect unconsciousness profit by injustice that they make no effort to prevent of all these which be the worst those which rouse long echo in the conscience of mankind or those which be know alone to the stifled victim naturally we worthy friend have not arm long enough to embrace all the misery of the world they can only reach one perhaps but that they press close to they heart and when they have choose a crime they pour out upon it all the pent-up hatred within they -- when a dog have a bone to gnaw it be wiser not to touch he clerambault have try to take he bone away from the dog and if he be bite he have no right to complain in point of fact he do not do so man be in the right to fight injustice wherever they see it perhaps it be not they fault if they often see no more than its big toe like gulliver 's at brobdignag well we must each do what we can and these people could bite it be good Friday and the rise tide of invasion sweep up towards the ile de france even this day of sacred sorrow have not stop the massacre for the lay war know nothing of the truce of god christ have be bombard in one of he church and the news of the murderous explosion at st gervai that afternoon spread at nightfall through the darkened city wrap in its grief its rage and its fear the sad little group of friend have gather at froment 's house each one have come hope to meet the other without previous appointment they could see nothing but violence all about they in the present as well as in the future in the enemy 's camp in they own on the side of revolutionist and reactionary as well they agony and they doubt meet in one think the sculptor be say : we holiest conviction we faith in peace and human brotherhood rest in vain on reason and love be there any hope then that they can conquer man we be too weak clerambault half-unconsciously as the word of isaiah come to he mind utter they aloud : darkness cover the earth and the cloud envelop the people he stop but from the faintly-lighted bed come froment 's voice continue : rise for on the top of the mountain the light shineth forth yes the light will dawn say madame froment she be sit on the foot of the bed in the dark near clerambault he lean forward and take she hand it be as if a thrill widen through the room like a ripple over water why do you say that ask the count de coulange because i see _ he _ plainly i can see _ he _ too say clerambault he whom do you mean asked doctor verrier but before the answer could come they all know the word that would be say : he who bear the light the god who will conquer be you wait for a god say the old professor do you believe in miracle we be the miracle for be it not one that in this world of perpetual violence we have keep a constant faith in the love and the union of man christ be expect for century say coulange bitterly and when he come he be neglect crucify and then forget except by a handful of poor ignorant wretch good if you like but narrow the handful grow larger and for the space of a man 's life faith be in flower but afterwards it be spoil and betray by success by ambitious disciple by the church and so on for century _ adveniat regnum tuum _ where be the kingdom of god within we say clerambault we trial and we hope all go to form the eternal christ it ought to make we happy to think of the privilege that have be bestow on we to shelter in we heart the new god like the babe in the manger and what proof have we of he come say the doctor we existence say clerambault we suffering say froment we misunderstand faith say the sculptor the fact alone that we be go on clerambault we be a living paradox throw in the face of nature which deny it a hundred time must the flame be kindle and go out before it burn steadily every christ every god be try in advance through a series of forerunner they be everywhere lose in space lose in the age but though widely-separated all of these lonely soul see the same luminous point on the horizon -- the glance of the savior -- who be come he be already come say froment when they separate with a deep mutual feeling but in silence -- for they fear to break the religious charm which hold they -- each find himself alone in the dark street but in each be the memory of a vision which they could hardly understand the curtain have fall but they could never forget that they have see it rise a few day after clerambault who have be again summon before the magistrate come home splash with mud from head to foot he hat which he hold in he hand be a mere rag and he hair be soak the woman who open the door exclaim at the sight of he but he sign to she to keep still and go into he room rosine be away so the husband and wife be alone in the flat where they only meet at meal say as little to each other as possible however hear the exclamation of the servant madame clerambault fear some new misfortune and go to look for she husband she too cry out when she see he : good lord what have you be do now i slip and fall say he try to wipe off the trace of the accident you fall -- turn round what a state you be in one can not have a moment 's peace when you be around you never look where you be go there be mud up to you eyelid all over you face yes i must have strike myself there what unlucky people we be you ` think ' that you strike you cheek you trip and fall and look he in the face she cry : it be not true i do fall i assure you no i know it be not true tell I someone strike you he do not answer they strike you the brute my poor husband to think that anyone should strike you and you so good who never do harm to anyone in you life how can people be so wicked and she burst into tear as she throw she arm around he my dear girl say he much touch it be not worth all these tear see you be get all muddy you ought not to touch I that do not matter say she i have more spot than that on my conscience forgive I forgive you for what why do you say such thing because i have be wicked to you myself i have not understand you -- -lrb- i do not think i ever shall -rrb- -- but i do know that whatever you do you only mean what be right i ought to have stand up for you and i have not do it i be angry with you foolishness but it be really i that be the fool and it vex I too when you get everyone down on you but now it be really too unjust that a lot of man who be not fit to tie you shoe that they should strike you let I kiss you poor muddy face it be so sweet to find each other again -- when she have have a good cry on clerambault 's neck she help he to dress then she bath he cheek with arnica and carry off he clothes to brush they at table she eye dwell on he with the old affectionate care while he try to calm she fear by talk of familiar thing to be alone together without the child take they back to the old day the early time of they marriage and the memory have a sad quiet sweetness -- as the evening angelus spread through the grow gloom a last softened glory from the angelus of noon about ten o'clock the bell ring and moreau come in with he friend gillot they have read the evening papers which give a account of the incident -- from they point of view some speak of the spontaneous indignation of the crowd and approve of the rebuke inflict by popular contempt other and they be the more serious sheet deprecate lynch law in the public street as a matter of principle but blame the weakness of the authority who be afraid to throw light on all the fact it be not impossible that this mild criticism of the government be inspire by the government itself for politician know how to manage so that they hand may be force when they have a end in view of which they be not exactly proud the arrest of clerambault seem imminent and moreau and he comrade be very uneasy but clerambault sign to they to say nothing before he wife and after a few word on the event of the day which they treat rather lightly he take they both into he study and ask they to tell he plainly what be the matter they show he a vicious article in the nationalist paper which have be active against clerambault for week and which be so encourage by the manifestation of the day that it call on all its friend to renew the attack the next morning moreau and gillot foresee that there would be trouble when clerambault go to the palais and they have come to beg he to stay in the house know he timidity they think that there would be no difficulty in persuade he to this but just as it have be the day moreau have find he dispute in the street he do not now seem to grasp the situation stay at home why i be perfectly well we think it would be more prudent on the contrary it would do I good to go out for a little while you do not know what might happen as to that one never know it will be time enough to worry when it come to be perfectly frank then you be in danger the feeling have be work up against you for a long time till now you be so hate that people 's eye almost start out of they head at the sound of you name -- idiot they know nothing about you but what they see in the papers but they leader want a row they have be so stupid that you article have have much more publicity than they intend they be afraid that you idea will spread and they want to make a example of you that will discourage anyone who might be dispose to follow you if that be true say clerambault and i really have follower -- something i do not know before -- this be not the moment to keep out of the way if they want to make a example of I i can not balk they this be say in so pleasant a way that they ask themselves if he really understand you be take a terrible risk persist gillot well my friend everyone have to take risk nowadays it ought at least to be of some use -- why play into they hand there be no need to throw yourself into the jaw of the wolf it seem to I on the contrary that it might be very useful say clerambault and that the wolf would find himself in the wrong box after all let I explain to you this will spread we idea for violence always consecrate the persecute cause they want to intimidate and so they will everyone will be frighten -- they own side all the hesitater and timorous folk let they be unjust it will rebind on they own head he seem to forget that it might also fall on he they see that he have make up he mind and feel a increase respect for he but they also feel much more anxious and this lead they to say : if that be the case we will get all we friend together and go with you no no what a ridiculous idea nothing will happen after all see that they remonstrance be useless moreau make a last attempt : you can not keep I from come with you say he i be a obstinate man myself you can not get rid of I i will wait for you if i have to sit on that bench outside you door all night go and spend the night in you bed my dear fellow say clerambault and sleep soundly come with I in the morning if you like but it will be time lose nothing be go to happen -- but kiss I all the same after a affectionate hug they go towards the door when gillot pause a moment : we must look after you a little you know say he we feel as if you be a sort of father to we so i be say clerambault with he beam smile he own boy be in he mind he close the door and stand for some minute with the lamp in he hand in the vestibule before he realize where he be it be nearly midnight and he be very tired but instead of go into the bedroom he mechanically turn again towards he study -- the apartment the house the street be all asleep almost without see it he stare vaguely at the light shine on the frame of a engraving of rembrandt 's the resurrection of lazarus which hang on the opposite wall a dear figure seem to enter the room it come in silently and stand beside he be you satisfy now he think be this what you wish and maxime answer : yes then add with meaning : i have find it very hard to teach you papa yes say clerambault there be much that we can learn from we son and they smile at each other in the silence when clerambault at last go to bed he wife be sound asleep she be one of those people whom nothing can keep awake who sink into profound slumber as soon as they head touch the pillow but clerambault could not follow she example he lay on he back with he eye open stare into the darkness all through the rest of the night there be pale glimmer from the street in the half-shadow and a quiet star or two high up in a dark sky one seem to be fall in a great half-circle -- it be only a airplane keep watch over the sleep city clerambault follow its sweep with he eye and seem to fly with it the distant hum of the human planet come faintly to he ear like a strange music of the sphere not foresee by ionian sage he feel happy for the burden be lift from he body and soul he whole be seem to be relax to float in air picture of the past day with its agitation and fatigue pass before he eye but do not disturb he a old man hustle by a mob of young _ bourgeois _ he could hear they loud voice too loud -- but now they have vanish like face that you catch a glimpse of from a move train the train fly on and the vision disappear in the roar tunnel there be the sombre sky again and the mysterious star still fall silent space around the clear darkness and the cool fresh air blow on he soul all infinity in one tiny drop of life in a heart whose spark flicker to its end but know it be free and that its vast home be near like a good steward of the treasure place in he charge clerambault make up the account of he day he look back on he attempt he effort he impulse he mistake how little remain of he life for nearly all that he have build up he have afterwards destroy with he own hand he have first state then deny and have never cease to wander in the forest of doubt and contradiction often tear and bruise with no guide but the star half-see through the branch what meaning have there be in this long troubled course now end in darkness one only he have be free free what be this freedom then which intoxicate he so completely this liberty of which he be the master and the slave -- this imperious need to be free he know well enough that no more than other be he emancipate from the eternal bond but the order that he obey differ from other all be not alike the word liberty be only one of the clear high command of the invisible sovereign who rule the world whom we call necessity she it be who excite those of the advance-guard to rebel and cause they to break with the heavy past which the blind multitude drag along behind it for she be the battle-field of the eternal present where the past and the future must ever strive together and on this field the ancient law be conquer that they may give place to new law which will be conquer in they turn o liberty thou art always in chain but they be not the heavy fetter of the past for each struggle have enlarged thy prison who can tell perhaps later when the prison wall have be throw down but in the meanwhile those whom thou wouldst save resist thee thou art call the public enemy or the one against all to think that this nickname should have be fasten on the weak ordinary clerambault but he do not remember that at this moment he thought be fill with the one who have always exist ever since man have be know on the earth the one who have never cease to fight they folly that they may be deliver -- _ the one whom all oppose _ how many time throughout the age have they reject and crush he but in the midst of he agony a supernatural joy sustain he he be the sacred golden seed of liberty which fall from we know not what sheaf and in the darkness of destiny have sow the germ of light ever since the first chaos in the depths of the savage heart of man the frail atom find shelter it fight against elementary law which grind and bend live thing but tirelessly the small golden seed grow and man the weakest of all creature march against nature and fight she each step cost a drop of he blood in this gigantic duel he have have to fight nature not only in the world without but within himself since he be a part of she this be the hardest battle that wage by the man divide against himself and in the end who will conquer on the one side be nature with she chariot of iron in which she hurl world and people into the abyss and on the other be only -- the word it be no wonder that you laugh ye slave no wonder the servant of force say that it be like a cur bark at the wheel of a express-train yes if man be only a fragment of matter writhe in vain beneath the hammer of fate but there be a spirit within he which know how to smite achille on he heel and goliath in he forehead let he but wrench off a nut the swift train be overturn its course stay planetary swirl obscure mass of human-kind roll down through the age light by flash of the liberating spirit : buddha the sage jesus -- all breaker of chain i can see the lightning come feel it thrill through I like spark that fly up beneath the horse 's hoof the air vibrate with it as the thick cloud of hate come together with a crash the flame spring up if you be alone against the world have you cause to complain you have escape the crush yoke fight you way through like a nightmare in which one struggle and tear oneself out of the dark water you sink choke and all at once with a despairing effort you throw yourself beyond the reach of the wave and sink exhaust but safe on the shore these people wind I so much the better i shall wake up in the free air yes threatening world i be indeed free from you fetter i can never be chained again and my detest will with which i so often have to fight my will be now in you you want like I to be free and that make you suffer and make you my enemy but now even if you kill I you have see the light in I and once see you can no longer reject it

soon will be _ the one with all _ i shall no longer be solitary i feel that i have never be in truth alone my brother of the world you may indeed be scatter afar over the earth like a handful of grain but i know that you be here beside I the thought of a man be not solitary the idea which grow in he spring up in other when he feel it in he heart let he rejoice no matter how unhappy how injured he may be for it be the earth revive the first spark in a lonely soul be the point of the ray which will pierre the night so welcome light break through the night which be around and within I clerambault the fresh light of day return ever young and new untouched by the stain of man which the sun drink up like a morning mist madame clerambault wake and when she see she husband with open eye she think that he too have just wake up you have a good sleep say she i do not think you stir all night long he do not contradict she but think of the vast distance he have traverse in the spirit that fiery bird that fly through the night but feeling that he have come back to earth he get up at the same hour another man rise who have also pass a sleepless night who have also evoke he dead son and thought of clerambault whom he do not know with fierce hatred a letter come from rosine by the first mail contain a secret that clerambault have guess long ago daniel have speak to he parent and the marriage would take place the next time he come home from the front she go through the form of ask the consent of she father and mother but she know that she wish be theirs she letter radiate happiness and a triumphant security that nothing could shake the sad riddle of the agonised world have find a answer and in the absorption of she young love the universal suffering do not seem too high a price for the flower that bloom for she on this bloody stem in the midst of it all she be tender and compassionate as usual remember the trouble of other she father and he worry but she seem to put she happy arm about they with a simple affectionate conceit as if she say : please do not worry any more over all these idea darling it be foolish of you to be sad when you see that happiness be come clerambault smile tenderly as he read the letter no doubt happiness be on the way but some of we can not wait for it greet it from I my little rose and do not let it fly away about eleven o'clock the count de coulange come to ask after he he have see moreau and gillot mount guard before the door they have come to escort clerambault accord to they promise but they have not dare to come up because they be a hour too early clerambault send for they laugh at they excess of zeal and they admit that they have think he perfectly capable of sneak out of the house without wait for they a idea which he confess have cross he mind the news from the front be good during the last few day the german offensive have waver strange sign of weakness begin to appear and well-founded rumor make it evident that there be a secret disorganisation in the formidable mass people say that the limit of he strength have be pass and that the athlete be exhaust there be talk also of contagion from the russian revolutionary spirit bring by the german troops that have be on the eastern front with the usual mobility of the french mind the pessimist of yesterday begin to shout for the approach victory already moreau discount the calming down of passion and the return to common sense the reconciliation of the nation and the triumph of clerambault 's idea would follow shortly he advise they not to deceive themselves too much and amuse himself by describe what would happen when peace be sign for peace would have to come some day i be go to pretend say he that i be hover over the town -- like the devil on two stick -- the first night after the armistice i see innumerable sorrowing heart behind shutter close against the shout in the street heart strain all through these year towards a victory that would lend mean to they grief and now they can let go -- or break down sleep die perhaps the politician will reflect on the quickest and most lucrative way to exploit the success or turn a somersault if they have guess wrong the professional soldier will keep the war go as long as they can and when that be stop they will plan for another in the shortest possible time before-the-war pacifist will all come out of they hole and be find at they post with touch demonstration of joy while they old leader who have be beat the drum in the rear for over five year will reappear with olive branch in they hand smile and talk of brotherly love the man who swear never to forget when they be in the trench will accept all the explanation and congratulation that be offer they it be such a bear not to forget five year of exhausting fatigue make you accept anything through sheer weariness or boredom or the wish to finish it all so the flourish of triumph will drown the cry of the vanquish the one thought of most people will be to go back to they sleepy before-the-war habit first they will dance on the grave and then lie down and go to sleep on they till after a while the war will be only something to boast about in the evening perhaps they will succeed in forget it so entirely that the dance of death can be resume -- not all at once of course but later when we have have a good rest so there will be peace everywhere till the time when it will be war everywhere again in the meaning that be now give to the word my friend peace and war be just different label for the same bottle it remind I of what king bomba say of he valiant soldier dress they in red or in green as you choose they will take to they heel just the same one say peace and the other war but neither mean anything there be only universal servitude multitude sweep along like the ebb and flow of tide and this will continue as long as no strong soul raise themselves above the human ocean as long as no one dare to fight against the fate that sway these great mass fight against nature say coulange would you resist she law there be no immutable law say clerambault law like being live change and die it be the duty of the spirit not to accept these as the stoic teach we but rather to modify and shape they to we need law be the outside form of the soul and if it grow they must grow also the only just law be those that suit I be i wrong in think that the shoe should be make to fit the foot not the foot for the shoe i do not say that you be wrong say the count we force nature all the time in cattle-breeding so that even the shape and instinct of the animal be modify why not the human creature no far from blame you i maintain on the contrary that the object and the duty of every man worthy of the name be just as you say to alter human nature it be the source of all real progress even to strive after the impossible have a concrete value but that do not mean that we shall succeed in what we undertake it be possible that we may not succeed for ourselves and we child it be even more probable perhaps we unhappy nation the entire west be on the downward path there be many thing that make I fear that we be hasten to we fall we vice and we virtue which be almost equally injurious the pride and hatred the jealous spite worthy of a big village the endless chain of revenge the blind obstinacy the cling to the past with its superannuated conception of honor and duty which cause we to sacrifice the future for the past all these make I fear that the terrible warning of this war have teach nothing to we slothful and turbulent heroism there be a time when i should have be overwhelm by such a think as this but now i feel lift above it as i be above my own mortal body the only tie between I and it be make of pity my spirit be brother to that which on the other side of the globe be now touch by the new fire do you remember the beautiful word of the seer of st jean d'acre -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb-
