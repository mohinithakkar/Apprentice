produce by suzanne shell david kline and pg distribute proofreader zane gray the desert of wheat 1919 chapter i late in June the vast northwestern desert of wheat begin to take on a tinge of gold lend a austere beauty to that endless rolling smooth world of treeless hill where mile of fallow ground and mile of wave grain slope up to the far-separated home of the heroic man who have conquer over sage and sand these simple home of farmer seem lose on a immensity of soft gray and golden billow of land insignificant dot here and there on distant hill so far apart that nature only seem accountable for those broad square of alternate gold and brown extend on and on to the wave horizon-line a lonely hard heroic country where flower and fruit be not nor bird and brook nor green pasture whirling string of dust loop up over fallow ground the short dry wheat lay back from the wind the haze in the distance be drab and smoky heavy with substance a thousand hill lay bare to the sky and half of every hill be wheat and half be fallow ground and all of they with the shallow valley between seem big and strange and isolate the beauty of they be austere as if the hand of man have be hold back from make green he home site as if the immensity of the task have leave no time for youth and freshness year long year be there in the round-hilled many-furrowed gray old earth and the wheat look a century old here and there a straight dusty road stretch from hill to hill become a thin white line to disappear in the distance the sun shine hot the wind blow hard and over the boundless undulating expanse hover a shadow that be neither hood of dust nor hue of gold it be not physical but lonely wait prophetic and weird no wild desert of wasteland once the home of other race of man and now go to decay and death could have show so barren a acreage half of this wander patchwork of square be earth brown and gray curry and disk and roll and comb and harrow with not a tiny leaf of green in all the mile the other half have only a faint golden promise of mellow harvest and at long distance it seem to shimmer and retreat under the hot sun a singularly beautiful effect of harmony lay in the long slowly rise slope in the round hill in the endless curving line on all side the scene be heroic because of the labor of horny hand it be sublime because not a hundred harvest nor three generation of toiling man could ever rob nature of its limitless space and scorching sun and sweeping dust of its resistless age-long creep back toward the desert that it have be \* \* \* \* \* here be grow the most bounteous the richest and finest wheat in all the world strange and unfathomable that so much of the bread of man the staff of life the hope of civilization in this tragic year 1917 should come from a vast treeless waterless dreary desert this wonderful place be a immense valley of considerable altitude call the columbium basin surround by the cascade mountain on the west the coeur d'alene and bitter root mountain on the east the okanozan range to the north and the blue mountain to the south the valley floor be basalt from the lava flow of volcano in age past the rainfall be slight except in the foot-hill of the mountain the columbium river make a prodigious and meandering curve border on three side what be know as the bend country south of this vast area across the range begin the fertile many-watered region that extend on down into verdant oregon among the desert hill of this bend country near the center of the basin where the best wheat be raise lay widely separated little town the name of which give evidence of the mixed population it be of course a exceedingly prosperous country a fact manifest in the substantial little town if not in the crude and unpretentious home of the farmer the acreage of farm run from a section six hundred and forty acre up into the thousand \* \* \* \* \* upon a morning in early July exactly three month after the united state have declare war upon germany a sturdy young farmer stride with darkly trouble face from the presence of he father at the end of a stormy scene he have promise he father that he would abandon he desire to enlist in the army kurt dorn walk away from the gray old clapboard house out to the fence where he lean on the gate he could see for mile in every direction and to the southward away on a long yellow slope rise a stream of dust from a motor-car must be anderson -- come to dun father mutter young dorn this be the day he remember when the wealthy rancher of ruxton be to look over old chri dorn 's wheat-fields dorn owe thirty-thousand dollar and interest for year mostly to anderson kurt hate the debt and resent the visit but he could not help acknowledge that the rancher have be lenient and kind long since kurt have sorrowfully realize that he father be illiterate hard grasp and grow worse with the burden of year if we have rain now -- or soon -- that section of bluestem would square father soliloquize young dorn as with keen eye he survey a vast field of wheat short smooth yellow in the sun but the cloudless sky the haze of heat rather betoken a continue drought there be reason indeed for dorn to wear a dark and troubled face as he watch the motor-car speed along ahead of its stream of dust pass out of sight under the hill and soon reappear to turn off the main road and come toward the house it be a big closed car cover with dust the driver stop it at the gate and get out be this chri dorn 's farm he ask yes reply kurt whereupon the door of the car open and out step a short broad man in a long linen coat come out lenore a ' shake off the dust he say and he assist a young woman to step out she also wear a long linen coat and a veil besides the man remove he coat and throw it into the car then he take off he sombrero to beat the dust off of that phew the golden valley never see dust like this in a million year i be chokin ' for water a ' listen to the car she be boilin ' then as he step toward kurt the rancher show himself to be a well-preserved man of perhaps fifty-five of powerful form begin to sag in the broad shoulder he face bronze by long exposure to wind and sun he have keen gray eye and they look be that of a man use to deal with he kind and well disposed toward they hello be you young dorn he ask yes sir reply kurt step out i be anderson from ruxton come to see you dad this be my girl lenore kurt acknowledge the slight bow from the veil young woman and then hesitate he add will not you come in no not yet i be chokin ' for air a ' water bring we a drink reply anderson kurt hurry away to get a bucket and tin cup as he draw water from the well he be think rather vaguely that it be somehow embarrassing -- the fact of mr anderson be accompany by he daughter kurt be afraid of he father but then what do it matter when he return to the yard he find the rancher sit in the shade of one of the few apple-tree and the young lady be stand near in the act of remove bonnet and veil she have throw the linen coat over the seat of a old wagon-bed that lay near good water be scarce here but i be glad we have some say kurt then as he set down the bucket and offer a brimming cupful to the girl he see she face and he eye meet hers he drop the cup and stare then hurriedly with flushing face he bent over to recover and refill it ex-excuse I i be -- clumsy he manage to say and as he hand the cup to she he avert he gaze for more than a year the memory of this very girl have haunt he he have see she twice -- the first time at the close of he one year of college at the university of californium and the second time on the street in spokane in a glance he have recognize the strong lithe figure the sunny hair the rare golden tint of she complexion the blue eye warm and direct and he have sustain a shock which momentarily confuse he good water hey dissent anderson after drink a second cup boy that be wet but it be not water to drink come down in the foot-hill a ' i 'll show you my ranch 's call ` many water ' a ' you can not keep you foot dry i wish we have some of it here reply kurt wistfully and he wave a hand at the broad swell slope the warm breath that blow in from the wheatland feel dry and smell dry you be in for a dry spell inquire anderson with interest that be keen and kindly as well father say so and i fear it too -- for he never make a mistake in weather or crop a hot dry spell this summer hum boy do you know that wheat be the most important thing in the world to-day you mean on account of the war reply kurt yes i know but father do not see that all he see be -- if we have rain we 'll have bumper crop that big field there would be a record -- at war price and he would not be ruin ruin oh he mean i would close on he hum say what do you see in a big wheat yield -- if it rain mr anderson i would like to see we debt pay but i be think most of wheat for starve people i -- i have study this wheat question it be the biggest question in this war kurt have forget the girl and be unaware of she eye bent steadily upon he anderson have rouse to the interest of wheat and to a deeper study of the young man say dorn how old be you he ask twenty-four and kurt 's my first name be the reply will this farm fall to you yes if my father do not lose it hum old dorn will not lose it never fear he raise the best wheat in this section but father never own the land we have have three bad year if the wheat fail this summer -- we lose the land that be all be you a -- american query anderson slowly as if tread on dangerous ground i be snapped kurt my mother be american she be dead father be german he be old he be rabid since the president declare war he 'll never change that be hell what be you goin ' to do if you country call you go reply kurt with flash eye i want to enlist father and i quarrel over that until i have to give in he be hard -- he be impossible i 'll wait for the draft and hope i be call boy it be that spirit germany 's rouse a ' the best i can say be god help she have you a brother no i be all father have well it make a tough place for he a ' you too humor he he be old a ' when you be call -- go a ' fight you 'll come back if i only know that -- it would not be so hard hard it sure be hard but it 'll be the makin ' of a great country it 'll weed out the riffraff see here kurt i be goin ' to give you a hunch have you have any dealin 's with the iww yes last harvest we have trouble but nothing serious when i be in spokane last month i hear a good deal stranger have approach we here too -- mostly alien i have no use for they but they always get father 's ear and now to tell the truth i be worried boy you need to be reply anderson earnestly we be all worried i be goin ' to let you read over the law of that iww organization you be to keep mum now mind you i belong to the chamber of commerce in spokane somebody get hold of these by-law of this so-called labor union we have have copy make a ' every honest farmer in the northwest be goin ' to read they but carryin ' one around be dangerous i reckon these day here anderson hesitate a moment peer cautiously around and then slip fold sheet of paper from he inside coat pocket he evidently make ready to hand they to kurt lenore where 's the driver he ask he be under the car reply the girl kurt thrill at the soft sound of she voice it be something to have be haunt by a girl 's face for a year and then suddenly hear she voice he be new to I -- that driver -- a ' i be not trustin ' any new man these day go on anderson here now dorn read that a ' if you do not get red-headed -- without finish he last muttered remark he open the sheet of manuscript and spread they out to the young man curiously and with a little rush of excitement kurt begin to read the very first rule of the iww aim to abolish capital kurt read on with slowly grow amaze consternation and anger when he have finish he look without speech be a question anderson hasten to answer it be straight goods he declare they be the sure-enough rule of that gang we make certain before we act now how do they strike you why that be no labor union reply kurt hotly they be outlaw thief blackmailer pirate i -- i do not know what dorn we be up against a bad outfit a ' the northwest will see hell this summer there be trouble in montana and idaho stranger be driftin ' into washington from all over we must organize to meet they -- to prevent they gettin ' a hold out here it be a labor union mostly alien with dishonest a ' unscrupulous leader some of they american they aim to take advantage of the war situation in the newspaper they rave about shorter hour more pay acknowledgment of the union but any fool would see if he read they law i show you that this iww be not straight mr anderson what step have you take down in you country query kurt so far all i have do be to hire my hand for a year give they high wages a ' caution they when stranger come round to feed they a ' be civil a ' send they on but we can not do that up here in the bend say dorn seriously we need say a hundred thousand man in harvest-time and not ten thousand all the rest of the year sure you can not but you 'll have to organize somethin' up here in this desert you could have a heap of trouble if that outfit get here strong enough you would better tell every farmer you can trust about this iww i have only one american neighbor and he live six mile from here reply dorn olsen over there be a swede and not a naturalized citizen but i believe he be for the we and there be -- dad interrupt the girl i believe we driver be listen to you very uninteresting conversation she speak demurely with laughter in she low voice it make dorn dare to look at she and he meet a blue blaze that be instantly avert anderson growl evidently some very hard name under he breath he look just then be full of characteristic western spirit then he get up lenore i reckon you talk 'll be more interesting than mine he say dryly i 'll go see dorn a ' get this business over i would rather go with you hurriedly reply kurt and then as though realize a seeming discourtesy in he word he face flame and he stammer : i -- i do not mean that but father be in bad mood we just quarrel -- i tell you -- about the war and -- mr anderson -- i be -- i be a little afraid he 'll -- well son i be not afraid interrupted the rancher i 'll beard the old lion in he den you talk to lenore please do not speak of the war say kurt appealingly not a word unless he start roarin ' at uncle sam declare anderson with a twinkle in he eye and turn toward the house he 'll roar all right say kurt almost with a groan he know what a ordeal await the rancher and he hate the fact that it could not be avoid then kurt be confuse astounded infuriate with himself over a situation he have not bring about and could scarcely realize he become conscious of pride and shame and something as black and hopeless as despair have not i see you -- before ask the girl the query surprised and thrill kurt out of he self-centered thought i do not know have you where he answer face she it be a relief to find that she still avert she face at berkeley in californium the first time and the second at spokane in front of the davenport she reply first -- and -- second you -- you remember both time he burst out incredulously yes i do not see how i could have help remember she laugh be low musical a little hurry yet cool dorn be not familiar with girl he have work hard all he life there among those desert hill and during the few year he father have allow he for education he know wheat but nothing of the eternal feminine so it be impossible for he to grasp that this girl be not wholly at she ease she word and the cool little laugh suddenly bring home to kurt the immeasurable distance between he and a daughter of one of the richest rancher in washington you mean i -- i be impertinent he begin struggle between shame and pride i -- i stare at you oh i must have be rude but miss anderson i -- i do not mean to be i do not think you see I -- at all i do not know what make I do that it never happen before i beg you pardon a subtle indefinable change perceptible to dorn even in he confused state come over the girl i do not say you be impertinent she return i remember see you -- notice I that be all self-possessed aloof and kind miss anderson now become a impenetrable mystery to dorn but that only accentuate the distance she have intimate lay between they she kindness sting he to recover he composure he wish she have not be kind what a singular chance that have bring she here to he home -- the daughter of a man who come to demand a long-unpaid debt what a dispelling of the vague thing that have be only a dream dorn gaze away across the yellowing hill to the dim blue of the mountain where roll the oregon despite the color it be gray -- like he future i hear you tell father you have study wheat say the girl presently evidently try to make conversation yes all my life reply kurt my study have mostly be under my father look at my hand he hold out big strong hand scar and knot with horny palm uppermost and he laugh i can be proud of they miss anderson but i have a splendid year in californium at the university and i graduate from the washington state agricultural college you love wheat -- the raising of it i mean she inquire it must be that i do though i never have such a thought wheat be so wonderful no one can guess who do not know it the clean plump grain the sowing on fallow ground the long wait the first tender green and the change day by day to the deep wave field of gold -- then the harvest hot noisy smoky full of dust and chaff and the great combine-harvester with thirty-four horse oh i guess i do love it all i work in a spokane flour-mill too just to learn how flour be make there be nothing in the world so white so clean so pure as flour make from the wheat of these hill next you 'll be tell I that you can bake bread she rejoin and she laugh be low and sweet she eye shine with soft blue gleam indeed i can i bake all the bread we use he say stoutly and i flatter myself i can beat any girl you know you can beat mine i be sure before i go to college i do pretty well but i learn too much there now my mother and sister and brother jim all the family except dad make fun of my bread you have a brother how old be he one brother -- jim we call he he -- he be just past twenty-one she falter the last few word kurt feel on common ground with she then the sudden break in she voice the change in she face the shadow of the blue eye -- these be eloquent oh it be horrible -- this need of war she exclaim yes he reply simply but maybe you brother will not be call call why he refuse to wait for the draft he go and enlist dad pat he on the back if anything happen to he it 'll kill my mother jim be she idol it would break my heart oh i hate the very name of german my father be german say kurt he be be fifty year in america -- eighteen year here on this farm he always hate england now he be bitter against america i can see a side you can not see but i do not blame you -- for what you say forgive I i can not conceive of mean that against any one who be live here so long oh it must be hard for you i 'll let my father think i be force to join the army but i be go to fight against he people we be a house divide against itself oh what a pity the girl sigh and she eye be dark with brooding sorrow a step sound behind they mr anderson appear sombrero off mop a very red face he eye gleam with angry glint he mouth and chin be work he flop down with a great explosive breath kurt you old man be a -- a -- son of a gun he exclaim vociferously manifestly liberation of speech be a relief the young man nod seriously and knowingly i hope sir -- he -- he -- he do -- you just bet you life he call I a lot in german but i know cuss word when i hear they i try to reason with he -- tell he i want my money -- be here to help he get that money off the farm some way or other a ' he swear i be a capitalist -- a enemy to labor a ' the northwest -- that i a ' my kind have cause the war kurt gaze gravely into the disturbed face of the rancher miss anderson have wide-open eye of wonder sure i could have stand all that go on anderson fume but he order I out of the house i get mad a ' would not go then -- by george he pull my nose a ' call I a bloody englishman kurt groan in the disgrace of the moment but amazingly miss anderson burst into a silvery peal of laughter oh dad that be -- just too -- good for -- anything you meet you -- match at last you know you always -- boast of you drop of english blood and you be sensitive -- about you big nose he must be over seventy growl anderson as if seek for some excuse to palliate he restraint i be mad -- but it be funny the working of he face finally set in the huge wrinkle of a laugh young dorn struggle to repress he own mirth but unguardedly he happen to meet the dancing blue eye of the girl merry provocative full of youth and fun and that be too much for he he laugh with they the joke 's on I say anderson a ' i can take one now young man i think i gather from you amiable dad that if the crop of wheat be full i would get my money otherwise i could take over the land for my part i would never do that but the other interested might do it even for the little money involve i try to buy they out so i would have the whole mortgage they would not sell mr anderson you be a square man and i 'll do -- declare kurt come out a ' show I the wheat interrupted anderson lenore do you want to go with we i do reply the daughter and she take up she hat to put it on kurt lead they through the yard out past the old barn to the edge of the open slope where the wheat stretch away down and up as far as the eye could see chapter ii we have get over sixteen hundred acre in fallow ground a half-section in rye another half in wheat -- turkey red -- and this section you see six hundred and forty acre in bluestem say kurt anderson 's keen eye sweep from near at hand to far away down the gentle billowy slope and up the far hillside the wheat be two foot high begin to be thick and heavy at the head as if struggle to burst a fragrant dry wheaty smell mingle with dust come on the soft summer breeze and a faint silken rustle the greenish almost blue color near at hand gradually in the distance grow lighter and then yellow and finally take on a tinge of gold there be a living spirit in that vast wheat-field dorn it be the finest wheat i have see exclaimed anderson with the admiration of the farmer who aspire high in fact it be the only fine field of wheat i have see since we leave the foot-hill how be that late spring and dry weather reply dorn most of the farmer ' report be poor if we get rain over the bend country we 'll have only a average yield this year if we do not get rain -- then flat failure miss anderson evince a interest in the subject and she want to know why this particular field identical with all the other for mile around should have a promise of a magnificent crop when the other have no promise at all this section lay fallow a long time reply dorn snow last here on this north slope quite a while my father use a method of soil cultivation intend to conserve moisture the seed wheat be especially select and if we have rain during the next ten day this section of bluestem will yield fifty bushel to the acre fifty bushel ejaculate anderson bluestem why do you call it that when it be green and yellow query the girl it be a name there be many variety of wheat bluestem be best here in this desert country because it resist drought it produce large yield it do not break and the flour-mill rate it very high bluestem be not good in wet soil anderson tramp along the edge of the field peer down here and there pull a shaft of wheat and examine it the girl gaze with dreamy eye across the undulating sea and dorn watch she we have a ranch -- thousand of acre -- but not like this she say what be the difference ask dorn she appear pensive and in doubt i hardly know what would you call this -- this scene why i call it the desert of wheat but no one else do he reply i name father 's ranch ` many water ' i think those name tell the difference be not my desert beautiful no it have a sameness -- a monotony that would drive I mad it look as if the whole world have go to wheat it make I think -- oppress I all this mean that we live by wheat alone these bare hill they be too open to wind and sun and snow they look like the toil of age miss anderson there be such a thing as love for the earth -- the bare brown earth you know we come from dust and to dust we return these field be human to my father and they have come to speak to I -- a language i do not understand yet but i mean -- w hat you see -- the grow wheat here the field of clod over there the wind and dust and glare and heat the eternal sameness of the open space -- these be the thing around which my life have center and when i go away from they i be not content anderson come back to the young couple carry some head of wheat in he hand smut he exclaim show both diseased and healthy specimen of wheat have to hunt hard to find that smut be the bane of all wheat-growers i never see so little of it as there be here in fact we know scarcely nothin ' about smut a ' its cure if there be any you farmer who raise only grain have get the work down to a science this bluestem be not beard wheat like turkey red have that beard anythin ' to do with smut i think not the parasite or fungus live inside the wheat never hear that before no wonder smut be the worst trouble for wheat-raiser in the northwest i have field literally full of smut a ' we never be rid of it one farmer have one idea a ' some one else another what could be of greater importance to a farmer we be at war the man who claim to know say that wheat will win the war a ' we lose million of bushel from this smut that be to say it be a terrible fact to face i would like to get you idea dorn happen to glance again at miss anderson a act that seem to be grow habitual read curiosity and interest and something more in she direct blue eye the circumstance embarrass he though it tug at the flood-gate of he knowledge he could talk about wheat and he do like to yet here be a girl who might be suppose to be bore still she do not appear to be that warm glance be not politeness yes i would like to hear every word you can say about wheat she say with a encouraging little nod sure she would add anderson with a affectionate hand on she shoulder she be a farmer 's daughter she 'll be a farmer 's wife he laugh at this last sally the girl blush dorn smile and shake he head doubtfully i imagine that good fortune will never befall a farmer he say well if it should she reply archly just consider how i might surprise he with my knowledge of wheat indeed mr dorn i be interested i have never be in the bend before -- in you desert of wheat i never before feel the greatness of love the soil -- or care for it -- of grow thing from seed yet the bible teach that and i read my bible please tell we the more you say the more i 'll like it dorn be not proof against this eloquence and he quote two of he authority heald and woolman of the state agricultural experiment station where he have study for two year bunt or stinking smut be cause by two different species of microscopic fungus which live as parasite in the wheat plant both be essentially similar in they effect and they life-history _ tilletium tritici _ or the rough-spored variety be the common stinking smut of the pacific region while _ tilletium foetans _ or the smooth-spored species be the one generally find in the eastern united state the smut ` berry ' or ` ball ' from a infected head contain million of minute body the spore or ` seed ' of the smut fungus these reproduce the smut in somewhat the same way that a true seed develop into a new plant a single smut ball of average size contain a sufficient number of spore to give one for each grain of wheat in five or six bushel it take eight smut spore to equal the diameter of a human hair normal wheat grain from a infected field may have so many spore lodge on they surface as to give they a dark color but other grain which show no difference in color to the naked eye may still contain a sufficient number of spore to produce a smutty crop if seed treatment be not practice when live smut spore be introduce into the soil with the seed wheat or exist in the soil in which smut-free wheat be sow a certain percentage of the wheat plant be likely to become infected the smut spore germinate and produce first a stage of the smut plant in the soil this first stage never infect a young seedle direct but give rise to secondary spore or sporida from which infection thread may arise and penetrate the shoot of a young seedling and reach the grow point here the fungus thread keep pace with the growth of the plant and reach maturity at or slightly before harvest-time since this disease be cause by a internal parasite it be natural to expect certain response to its presence it should be note first that the smut fungus be live at the expense of its host plant the wheat and its effect on the host may be summarize as follow : the consumption of food the destruction of food in the sporulate process and the stimulating or retarding effect on normal physiological process badly smut plant remain in many case under-size and produce fewer and smaller head in the fife and bluestem variety the infected head previous to maturity exhibit a darker green color and remain green longer than the normal head in some variety the infected head stand erect when normal one begin to droop as a result of the increase weight of the ripening grain a crop may become infected with smut in a number of different way smut be originally introduce with the seed and many farmer be still plant it every season with they seed wheat wheat take from a smutty crop will have countless number of loose spore adhering to the grain also a certain number of unbroken smut ball these be always a source of danger even when the seed be treat with fungicide before sowing there be also chance for the infection of a crop if absolutely smut-free seed be employ first soil infection from a previous smutty crop second soil infection from wind-blown spore experiment have show that separated spore from crushed smut ball lose they effective power in from two to three month provide the soil be moist and loose and in no case do they survive a winter it do not seem probable that wheat smut will be control by any single practice but rather by the combine use of various method : crop rotation the use of clean seed seed treatment with fungicide cultural practice and breed and selection of variety failure to practice crop rotation be undoubtedly one of the main explanation for the general prevalence of smut in the wheat-field of eastern washington even with a intervene summer fallow the smut from a previous crop may be a source of infection experience show that a fall stubble crop be less liable to smut infection than a crop follow summer fallow the apparent explanation for this condition be the fact that the summer fallow become infected with wind-blown spore while in a stubble crop the wind-blown spore as well as those originate from the previous crop be bury in plow if clean seed or properly treat seed have be use by all farmer we should never have have a smut problem high per cent of smut indicate either soil infection or imperfect treatment the principle of the chemical treatment be to use a poison which will kill the superficial spore of the smut and not materially injure the germinate power of the seed the hot-water treatment be only recommend when one of the chemical ` steep ' be not effective certain cultural practice be beneficial in reduce the amount of smut in all case while the value of other depend to some extent upon the source of the smut spore the factor which always influence the amount of smut be the temperature of the soil during the germinate period the amount of soil moisture and the depth of seed where seed-borne spore be the only source of infection attention to the three factor mention will give the only cultural practice for reduce the amount of smut early seeding have be practice by various farmer and they report a marked reduction in smut the replowing of the summer fallow after the first fall rain be generally effective in reduce the amount of smut very late planting -- that be four or five week after the first good fall rain -- be also a effective practice fall tillage of summer fallow other than plow seem to be beneficial no smut-immune variety of wheat be know but the standard variety show vary degree of resistance spring wheat generally suffer less from smut than winter variety this be not due to any superior resistance but rather to the fact that they escape infection if only spring wheat be grow we smut problem would largely disappear but a return to this practice be not suggest since the winter wheat be much more desirable it seem probable that the condition which prevail during the grow season may have considerable influence on the per cent of smut in any give variety \* \* \* \* \* when dorn finish he discourse to receive the thanks of he listener they walk back through the yard toward the road mr anderson who lead the way halt rather abruptly hum who be those man talkin ' to my driver he query dorn then see a couple of stranger stand near the motor-car engage in apparently close conversation with the chauffeur upon the moment they glance up to see mr anderson approach and they rather hurriedly depart dorn have note a good many stranger lately -- man whose garb be not that of farmer whose face seem foreign whose action be suspicious i 'll bet a hundred they be iww 's declare anderson take my hunch dorn the stranger pass on down the road without look back wonder where they 'll sleep to-night muttered dorn anderson rather sharply ask he driver what the two man want and the reply he get be that they be inquire about work do they speak english go on the rancher well enough to make themselves understand reply the driver dorn do not get a good impression from the shifty eye and air of taciturnity of mr anderson 's man and it be evident that the blunt rancher restrain himself he help he daughter into the car and then put on he long coat next he shake hand with dorn young man i have enjoy meetin ' you a ' have sure profit from same he say which make up for you dad i 'll run over here again to see you -- around harvest-time a ' i 'll be wishin ' for that rain thank you if it do rain i 'll be happy to see you reply dorn with a smile well if it do not rain i will not come i 'll put it off another year a ' cuss they other feller into holdin ' off too you be very kind i do not know how i would -- we would ever repay you in that case do not mention it say how far do you say it be to palmer we 'll have lunch there it be fifteen mile -- that way answer dorn if it be not for -- for father i would like you to stay -- and break some of my bread dorn be look at the girl as he speak she steady gaze have be on he ever since she enter the car and in the shade of she hat and the veil she be adjust she eye seem very dark and sweet and thoughtful she brightly nod she thanks as she hold the veil aside with both hand i wish you luck good-by she say and close the veil still dorn could see she eye through it and now they be sweeter more mysterious more provocative of haunt thought it flash over he with dread certainty that he have fall in love with she the shock strike he mute he have no reply for the rancher 's hearty farewell then the car lurch away and dust rise in a cloud chapter iii with a strange knock of he heart high up toward he throat kurt dorn stand stock-still watch the move cloud of dust until it disappear over the hill no doubt enter he mind the truth the fact be a year old -- a long-familiar and dreamy state -- but its meaning have not be reveal to he until just a moment past everything have change when she look out with that sweet steady gaze through the part veil and then slowly close it she have change there be something intangible about she that last moment baffle haunt he lean against a crooked old gate-post that as a boy he have climb and the thought come to he that this spot would all he life be vivid and poignant in he memory the first sight of a blue-eyed

need any proof of the crookedness of the iww he have see it in glidden 's guilty face the man have be suddenly frightened and surprise too have be prominent in he countenance then kurt remember how anderson have intimate that the secret of the iww have be long hide kurt keen and quick in he sensibility divine that there be something powerful back of this glidden 's cunning and assurance could it be only the power of a new labor organization that might well be great but the idea do not convince kurt during a hurry and tremendous preparation by the government for war any disorder such as menaced the country would be little short of a calamity it might turn out a fatality this so-called labor union intend to take advantage of a crisis to further its own end yet even so that fact do not wholly explain glidden and he subtlety some nameless force loom dark and sinister back of glidden 's meaning and it be not peril to the wheatland of the northwest alone like a huge dog kurt shake himself and launch into action there be sense and pleasure in muscular activity and it lessen the habit of worry soon he ascertain that only morgan have return to work in the field andrew and jansen be nowhere to be see jansen have leave four horse hitch to a harrow kurt go out to take up the work thus abandon it be a long field and if he have earn a dollar for every time he have traverse its length during the last ten year he would have be a rich man he could have walk it blindfold it be fallow ground already plow disked rolled and now the last stage be to harrow it loosen the soil conserve the moisture morgan far to the other side of this section have the better of the job for he harrow be a new machine and he could ride while drive the horse but kurt use a old harrow have to walk the four big horse plod at a gait that make kurt step out to keep up with they to keep up to drive a straight line to hold back on the rein be labor for a man it speak well for kurt that he have follow that old harrow hundred of mile that he could stand the strain that he love both the physical sense and the spiritual meaning of the toil drive west he face a wind laden with dust as dry as powder at every sheeted cloud whipping back from the hoof of the horse and the steel spike of the harrow he have to bat he eye to keep from be blind the smell of dust clog he nostril as soon as he begin to sweat under the hot sun the dust cake on he face itch stinging burning there be dust between he tooth drive back east be a relief the wind whip the dust away from he and he could catch the fragrance of the newly turn soil how brown and clean and earthy it look where the harrow have cut and ridge the soil do not look thirsty and parched but that which be unharrowed cry out for rain no cloud in the hot sky except the yellow cloud of dust on that trip east across the field which face the road dorn see pedestrian in two and three pass by once he be hail but make no answer he would not have be surprise to see a crowd yet traveler be scarce in that region the sight of these man some of they carry bag and satchel be disturb to the young farmer where be they go all appear outward bind toward the river they come of course from the little town the railroad the city at this season with harvest-time near at hand it have be in former year no unusual sight to see string of laborer pass by but this year they come earlier and in greater number with the wind in he face however dorn saw nothing but the horse and the brown line ahead and half the time they be wholly obscure in yellow dust he begin think about lenore anderson just ponder that strange steady look of a girl 's eye and then he do not mind the dust or heat or distance never could he be cheat of he thought and those of she even the painful one give birth to a comfort that he know must abide with he henceforth on lonely labor such as this perhaps in the lonelier watch of a soldier 's duty she have be curious aloof then sympathetic she have study he face she have be a eloquent-eyed listener to he discourse on wheat but she have not guess he secret not until she last look -- strange deep potent -- have he guess that secret himself so with mind both busy and absent kurt dorn harrow the fallow ground abandon by he man and when the day be do with the sun set hot and coppery beyond the dim dark range he guide the tired horse homeward and plod back of they weary and spend he be to learn from morgan at the stable that the old man have discharge both andrew and jansen and jansen liberating some newly assimilate poison have threaten revenge he would see that any hire man would learn a thing or two so that they would not sign up with chri dorn in a fury the old man have drive jansen out into the road sober and moody kurt put the horse away and wash the dust grime from sunburnt face and hand he go to he little attic room where he change he damp and sweaty clothes then he go down to supper with mind make up to be lenient and silent with he old and sorely try father chris dorn sit in the light of the kitchen lamp he be a huge man with a great round bullet-shaped head and a shock of gray hair and bristle grizzled beard he face be broad heavy and seem sodden with dark brooding think he eye under bushy brow be pale gleam of fire he look immovable as to both bulk and will never before have kurt dorn so acutely feel the fix contrary ruthless nature of he parent never have the distance between they seem so great kurt shiver and sigh at once then be hungry he fall to eat in silence presently the old man shove he plate back and wipe he face he growl in german : i discharge andrew and jansen yes i know reply kurt it be not good judgment what 'll we do for hand i 'll hire more man be come for the harvest but they all belong to the iww protest kurt and what be that in scarcely subdue wrath kurt describe in detail and to the best of he knowledge what the iww be and he end by declare the organization treacherous to the united state how 's that ask old dorn gruffly kurt be actually afraid to tell he father who never read newspaper who know little of what be go on that if the ally be to win the war it be wheat that would be the greatest factor instead of that he say if the iww inaugurate strike and disorder in the northwest it would embarrass the government then i 'll hire iww man say old dorn kurt battle against a rise temper this blind old man be he father but i 'll not have iww man on the farm retort kurt i just punch one iww solicitor i 'll run this farm if you do not like my way you can leave darkly assert the father kurt fall back in he chair and stare at the turgid bulge forehead and hard eye before he what could be behind they have the war bring out a twist in he father 's brain why be german so impossible my heaven father would you turn I out of my home because we disagree he ask desperately in my country son obey they father or they go out for themselves i have not be a disobedient son declare kurt and here in america son have more freedom -- more say america have no sense of family life -- no honest government i hate the country a ball of fire seem to burst in kurt that kind of talk infuriate I he blaze i do not care if you be my father why in the hell do you come to america why do you stay why do you marry my mother -- a american woman that be rot -- just spiteful rot i have hear you tell what life be in europe when you be a boy you run off you stay in this country because it be a better country than yours fifty year you have be in america -- many year on this farm and you love this land my god father can not you and man like you see the truth aye i can gloomily reply the old man the truth be we 'll lose the land that greedy anderson will drive I off he will not he be fine -- generous assert kurt earnestly all he want be to see the prospects of the harvest and perhaps to help you anderson have not have interest on he money for three year i 'll bet he be pay interest demand by the other stockholder in that bank you borrow from why he be we friend aye and i see more boom the father he fetch he lass up here to make eye at my son i see she -- the sly wench boy you 'll not marry she kurt choke back he mount rage certainly i never will he say bitterly but i would if she would have I what thunder dorn he white lock stand up and shake like the mane of a lion that wheat banker 's daughter never i forbid it you shall not marry any american girl father this be idle foolish rant cry kurt with a high warning note in he voice i have no idea of marry but if i have one -- whom else could i marry except a american girl i 'll sell the wheat -- the land we 'll go back to germany that be maddening to kurt he spring up send dish to the floor with a crash he bent over to pound the table with a fist violent speech choke he and he feel a cold tight blanching of he face listen he ring out if i go to germany it 'll be as a soldier -- to kill german i be do -- i be through with the very name listen to the last word i 'll ever speak to you in german -- the last _ to hell with germany _ then kurt plunge blind in he passion out of the door into the night and as he go he hear he father cry out brokenly : my son oh my son the night be dark and cool a faint wind blow across the hill and it be dry redolent sweet the sky seem a endless curving canopy of dark blue blaze with myriad of star kurt stagger out of the yard down along the edge of a wheat-field to one of the straw-stack and there he fling himself down in a agony oh i be ruin -- ruin he moan the break -- have come poor old dad he lean there against the straw shake and throb with a cold perspiration bathing face and body even the palm of he hand be wet a terrible fit of anger be begin to loose its hold upon he he breathing be labor in gasp and sob unutterable stupidity of he father -- horrible cruelty of he position what have he ever do in all he life to suffer under such a curse yet almost he cling to he wrath for it have be righteous that thing that infernal twist in the brain that be what be wrong with he father he father who have be fifty year in the united state how simple then to understand what be wrong with germany by god i be -- american he pant and it be as if he call to the grave of he mother over there on the dark windy hill that tremendous uprising of he passion have be a vortex a end a decision and he realize that even to that hour there have be a drag in he blood it be over now the hell be do with he soul be free this weak quake body of he house he taint blood and the emotion of he heart but it could not control he mind he will beat by beat the helpless fury in he subside and then he fall back and lay still for a long time eye shut relax and still a hound bay mournfully the insect chirp low incessantly the night wind rustle the silken head of wheat after a while the young man sit up and look at the heaven at the twinkling white star and then away across the shadow of round hill in the dusk how lonely sad intelligible and yet mystic the night and the scene what come to he then be reveal uplifting -- a source of strength to go on he be not to blame for what have happen he could not change the future he have a choice between play the part of a man or that of a coward and he have to choose the former there seem to be a spirit beside he -- the spirit of he mother or of some one who love he and who would have he be true to a ideal and if needful die for it no night in all he life before have be like this one the dream hill with they precious rustling wheat mean more than even a spirit could tell where have the wheat come from that have seed these field whence the first and original seed and where be the sower back in the age the star the night the dark blue of heaven hide the secret in they impenetrableness beyond they surely be the answer and perhaps peace material thing -- life success -- such as have inspire kurt dorn on this calm night lose they significance and be see clearly they could not last but the wheat there the hill the star -- they would go on with they task passion be the dominant side of a man declare itself and that be a matter of inheritance but self-sacrifice with its mercy its succor its seed like the wheat be as infinite as the star he have long make up he mind yet that have not give he absolute restraint the world be full of little man but he refuse to stay little this war that have come between he and he father have be breed of the fume of self-centered mind turn with a infantile fatality to greedy desire he poor old blinded father could be excuse and forgive there be other old man sick cripple idle who must suffer pain but whose pain could be lighten there be baby child woman who must suffer for the sin of man but that suffer need no longer be if man become honest and true he sudden up-flashing love have a few hour back seem a calamity but out there beside the whisper wheat under the passionless star in the dream night it have turn into a blessing he ask nothing but to serve to serve she he country he future all at once he who have always yearn for something unattainable have greatness thrust upon he he tragical situation have evoke a spirit from the god to kiss that blue-eyed girl 's sweet lip would be a sum of joy earthly all-satisfying precious the man in he tremble all over at the daring thought he might revel in such dream and surrender to they since she would never know but the divinity he sense there in the presence of those star do not dwell on a woman 's lip kiss be for the present the all too fleeting present and he have to concern himself with what he might do for one girl 's future it be exquisitely sad and sweet to put it that way though kurt know that if he have never see lenore anderson he would have go to war just the same he be not make a abstract sacrifice the wheat-fields rolling before he every clod of which have be press by he bare foot as a boy the father whose changeless blood have sicken at the son of he loin the life of hope freedom of action of achievement of wonderful possibility -- these seem lose to kurt dorn a necessary renunciation when he yield to the call of war but no loss no sting of bullet or bayonet no torture victory of approach death could balance in

hard ride guess i 'll clean up a little for supper anderson leave the room and while kathleen and rise gleefully squabble over the bundle lenore continue to gaze dreamily out of the window \* \* \* \* \* that night lenore go early to she room despite the presence of some young people from a neighbor village she lock she door and sit in the dark beside she open window a early moon silver the long slope of wheat and make the alfalfa square seem black a cool faint sweet breeze fan she cheek she could smell the fragrance of apple of new-mown hay and she could hear the low murmur of run water a hound bay off somewhere in the field there be no other sound it be a quiet beautiful pastoral scene but somehow it do not comfort lenore she seem to doubt the sincerity of what she see there and love so well moon-blanched and serene lonely and silent beautiful and promising the wide acre of many water and the silver slope and dark mountain beyond do not tell the truth ` way over the dark range a hideous war have stretch out a red hand to she country she only brother have leave he home to fight and there be no tell if he would ever come back evil force be at work out there in the moonlight there have come a time for she to be thoughtful she father 's ask she to ride to the bend country have cause some strange little shock of surprise lenore have dream without think here in the darkness and silence watch the crescent moon slowly sink she do think and it be to learn that she remember singularly well the first time she have see young dorn and still more vividly the second time but the third time seem both clear and vague enough young man have be smite with lenore to enable she to gauge the symptom of these easy-come easy-go attraction in fact they rather repel she but she have find dorn 's manner striking confusing and unforgettable and why that should be so interested she intelligence it be confuse to discover that she could not lay it to the sympathy she have feel for a american boy in a difficult position because she have often think of he long before she have any idea who he be or where he live in the very first place he have be unforgettable for two reason -- because he have be so strike at sight of she that he have gaze unconsciously with a glow on he face and a radiance in he eye as of a young poet spellbound at a inspiration and because he seem the physical type of young man she have idealized -- a strong lithe-limbed blond giant with a handsome frank face clear-cut and smooth ruddy-cheeked and blue-eyed only after meet he out there in the desert of wheat have she feel sympathy for he and now with intelligence and a woman 's intuition bar the old insidious dreamy mood lenore go over in retrospect all she could remember of that meeting and the truth make she sharply catch she breath dorn have fall in love with she intuition declare that while she intelligence repudiate it stranger than all be the thrill which begin somewhere in the unknown depths of she and mount to leave she tingle all over she have tell she father that she do not want to ride to the bend country but she do want to go and that think flash up would not be deny to want to meet a strange young man again be absolutely a new and irritating discovery for lenore it mystify she because she have not have time to like dorn like a acquaintance have nothing to do with the fact and that stunned she could it be -- love at first sight she whisper incredulously as she stare out over the shadow field for I why how absurd -- impossible i -- i only remember he -- a big handsome boy with blaze eye and now i be sorry for he to whisper she amaze and doubt and consternation only augment the instinctive recur emotion she feel something she could not explain and that something be scarcely owe to this young man 's pitiful position between duty to he father and love for he country it have to do with he blaze eye intangible dreamlike perception of he as not real of vague sweet fancy that retreat before she introspective question what alarm lenore be a tendency of she mind to shirk this revealing analysis never before have she be afraid to look into herself but now she be find unplumbed well of feeling secret chamber of dream into which she have never let the light strange instinctive activity more physical than mental when in she life before have she experience a nameless palpitation of she heart long she sit there stare out into the night and the change in the aspect of the broad space now dark and impenetrable and mysterious seem like the change in the knowledge of herself once she have flatter herself that she be a inch of crystal water now she seem a complex aloof and contrary creature almost on the verge of tumultuous emotion she say she prayer that night a girlish habit resume since she brother have declare he intention of enlist in the army and to that old prayer which she mother have pray before she she add a appeal of she own strange that young dorn 's face should flash out of gloom it be there and she brother 's be fading i wonder -- will he and jim -- meet over there -- on the battle-field she whisper she hope they would like tiger those boy would fight the german she heart beat high then a cold wind seem to blow over she it have a sickening weight if that icy and somber wind could have be trace to its source then the mystery of life would have be clear but that source be the cause of war as its effect be the horror of woman a hideous and monstrous thing exist out there in the darkness lenore passionately love she brother and this black thing have take he away why could not woman who suffer most have some word in the regulation of event if woman could help govern the world there would be no war at last encroach drowsiness dull the poignancy of she feeling and she sink to sleep chapter vi singing of bird at she window awaken lenore the dawn stream in bright and sweetly fragrant the wheat-fields seem a rosy gold and all that open slope call to she thrillingly of the beauty of the world and the happiness of youth it be not possible to be morbid at dawn i hear i hear she whisper from a thousand slope far and wide at the breakfast-table when there come opportunity she look up serenely and say father on second thought i will go the bend thank you anderson lay down he knife and fork and he eye open wide in surprise change you mind he exclaim that be a privilege i have you know she reply calmly mrs anderson appear more anxious than surprised daughter do not go that will be a fearful ride hum sure glad to have you lass add anderson with he keen eye on she let I go too begged rise kathleen be solemnly gaze at lenore with the wise penetrate eye of extreme youth lenore i 'll bet you have get a new beau up there she declare lenore flush scarlet she be less angry with she little sister than with the incomprehensible fact of a playful word bring the blood stingingly to she neck and face kitty you forget you manners she say sharply kit be fresh she be a awful child add rise with a superior air i do not say a thing cry kathleen hotly lenore if it be not true why would you blush so red hush you silly child order the mother reprovingly lenore be glad to finish that meal and to get outdoors she could smile now at that shrewd and terrible kitty but recollection of she father 's keen eye be confusing lenore feel there be really nothing to blush for still she could scarcely tell she father that upon awaken this morning she have find she mind make up -- that only by go to the bend country could she determine the true state of she feeling she simply dare not accuse herself of be in unusually radiant spirit because she be go to undertake a long hard ride into a barren desert country the grave and thoughtful mood of last night have go with she slumber often lenore have find problem decide for she while she sleep on this fresh sweet summer morning with the sun bright and warm presage a hot and glorious day lenore want to run with the wind to wade through the alfalfa to watch with strange and renewed pleasure the wave of shadow as they go over the wheat all she life she have know and love the field of wave gold but they have never be to she what they have become overnight perhaps this be because it have be say that the issue of the great war the salvation of the world and its happiness its hope depend upon the million of broad acre of golden grain bread be the staff of life lenore feel that she be change and grow if anything should happen to she brother jim she would be heiress to thousand of acre of wheat a pang shot through she heart she have to drive the cold think away and she must learn -- must know the bigness of this question the woman of the country would be call upon to help to do they share she run down through the grove and across the bridge come abruptly upon nash she father 's driver he have the car out good morning he say with a smile doff he cap

day with its deep blue and white cloud and shine green and golden field then any one might think what he like and have proof for he torment but marry i not much do i want a husband get shoot the path lenore tread so lightly lead along a great peach and apple orchard where the tree be set far apart and the soil be cultivate so that not a weed nor a blade of grass show the fragrance of fruit in the air however do not come from this orchard for the tree be young and the reddening fruit rare down the wide aisle she see the thick and abundant green of the older orchard at length lenore reach the alfalfa-field and here among the mound of newly cut hay that smell so fresh and sweet she want to roll and she have to run two great wagon with four horse each be be load lenore know all the workman except one sila warner a old gray-headed farmer have be with she father as long as she could remember whar you goin ' lass he call as he halt to wipe he red face with a huge bandana it be too hot to run the way you be a-doin ' oh sila it be a grand morning she reply why so ` tis pitchin ' hay hyar make I think it be hot he say as she trip on now lass do not go up to the wheat-field but lenore hear heedlessly and she run on till she come to the uncut alfalfa which impede she progress a wonderful space of green and purple stretch away before she and into it she wade it come up to she knee rich thick soft and redolent of blossom and ripeness hard tramp it soon get to be she grow hot and breathless and she leg ache from the force expend in make progress through the tangled hay at last she be almost across the field far from the cutter and here she fling herself to roll and lie flat and gaze up through the deep azure of sky wonderingly as if to penetrate its secret and then she hide she face in the fragrant thickness that seem to force a whisper from she i wonder -- how will i feel -- when i see he -- again oh i wonder the sound of the whisper word the question the inevitableness of something involuntary prove traitor to she happy dream she assurance she composure she try to burrow under the hay to hide from that tremendous bright-blue eye the sky suddenly she lay very quiet feel the strange glow and throb and race of she blood sense the mystery of she body try to trace the thrill to control this queer tremulous internal state but she find she could not think clearly she could only feel and she give up try it be sweet to feel she rise and go on another field lay beyond a gradual slope cover with a new growth of alfalfa it be a light green -- a contrast to the rich darkness of that behind she at the end of this field run a swift little brook clear and musical open to the sky in place and in other hide under flowery bank bird sing from invisible covert a quail send up clear flutelike note and a lark carol seemingly out of the sky lenore wet she foot cross the brook and climb the little knoll above she sit down upon a stone to dry they in the sun it have a burn that feel good no matter how hot the sun ever get there she like it always there seem air to breathe and the shade be pleasant from this vantage-point a favorite one with lenore she could see all the alfalfa-field the hill crown by the beautiful white-and-red house the acre of garden and the mile of orchard the grazing and grain field begin behind she the brook murmur below she and the bird sing she hear the bee hum by the air out here be clear of scent of fruit and hay and it bear a drier odor not so sweet she could see the workman first those among the alfalfa and then the man and woman too bend over on the vegetable-garden likewise she could see the gleam of peach apple pear and plum -- a colorful and mixed gleam delightful to the eye wet or dry it seem that she foot refuse to stay still and once again she be wander a gray slate-colored field of oats invite she step and across this stretch she see a long yellow slope of barley where the man be cut beyond wave the golden field of wheat lenore imagine that when she reach they she would not desire to wander farther there be two machine cut on the barley slope one draw by eight horse and the other by twelve when lenore have cross the oat-field she discover a number of strange man lounge in the scant shade of a line of low tree that separate the field here she see adam the foreman and he espy she at the same moment he have be sit down talk to the man at once he rise to come toward lenore be you father with you he ask no he be too slow for I reply lenore who be these man they be stranger look for job iww man query lenore in lower voice surely must be he reply adam be not a young not a robust man and he seem to carry a burden of worry you father say he would come right out i hope he do not say lenore bluntly father have a way with he you know yes i know and it be the way we be need here in the valley reply the foreman significantly be that the new harvester-thresher father just buy ask lenore point to the huge machine shine and creep behind the twelve horse yes that be the mccormack and it be a dandy return adam with machine like that we can get along without the iww i want a ride on it declare lenore and she run along to meet the harvester she wave she hand to the driver bill jone another old hand long employ by she father bill haul back on the many-branched rein and when the horse stop the clatter whir roar of the machine also cease howdy miss reckon this be a regular iww hold-up worse than that bill gaily reply lenore as she mount the platform where another man sit on a bag of barley lenore do not recognize he he look rugged and honest and beam upon she watch out fer yer dress he say point with grimy hand to the dusty wheel and brace so near she let I drive bill she ask wal now i wisht i could he reply dryly you sure can drive miss but drivin ' be not all this here job what can not i do i 'll bet you -- i never see a girl that could throw anythin ' straight do you well not so very i forget how you drive the horse go ahead do not let I delay the harvest bill call sonorously to he twelve horse and as they bent and strained and begin to bob they head the clattering roar fill the air also a cloud of dust and thin fly stream of chaff envelop lenore the high stalk of barley in wide sheet fall before the cutter upon a apron to be carry by feeder into the body of the machine the straw denude of its grain come out at the rear to be drop while the grain stream out of a tube on the side next to lenore to fall into a open sack it make a short shift of harvest lenore like the even nodding rhythm of the plod horse and the way bill throw a pebble from a sack on he seat to hit this or that horse not keep in line or pull he share bill 's aim be unerr he never hit the wrong horse which would have be the case have he use a whip the grain come out in so tiny a stream that lenore wonder how a bag be ever fill but she see presently that even a tiny stream if run steadily soon make bulk that be proof of the value of small thing even atom no marvel be it that bill and he helper be as grimy as stoker of a furnace lenore begin to choke with the fine dust and to feel she eye smart and to see it settle on she hand and dress she then have appreciation of the nature of a ten-hour day for workman cut eighteen acre of barley how would they ever cut the two thousand acre of wheat no wonder many man be need lenore sympathize with the operator of that harvester-thresher but she do not like the dirt if she have be a man though that labor hard as it be would have appeal to she harvest the grain be beautiful whether in the old slow method of threshing or with one of these modern man-saving machine she jump off and the big ponderous thing almost gifted with intelligence it seem to lenore roll on with its whir roar draw its cloud of dust and leave behind a litter of straw it develop then that adam have walk along with the machine and he now address she will you be stay here till you father come he ask no mr adam why do you ask you ought not come out here alone or go back alone all these strange man some of they hard customer you 'll excuse I miss but this harvest be not like other harvest i 'll wait for my father and i 'll not go out of sight reply lenore thank the foreman for he thoughtfulness she walk away and soon she stand at the edge of the first wheat-field the grain be not yet ripe but near at hand it be a pale gold the wind out of the west wave and sweep the wheat while the almost imperceptible shadow follow a road half overgrown with grass and goldenrod border the wheat-field and it wind away down toward the house she father appear mount on the white horse he always ride lenore sit down in the grass to wait for he nod stalk of goldenrod lean to she face when look at closely how truly gold they color yet it be not such a gold as that of the rich blaze of ripe wheat she be admit to she consciousness a jealousy of anything comparable to wheat and suddenly she confess that she natural love for it have be augment by a subtle grow sentiment not sentiment about the war or the need of the ally or meaning of the staff of life she have sense young dorn 's passion for wheat and it have make a difference to she no use lie to myself she soliloquize i think of he i can not help it i run out here wild restless unable to reason just because i would decide to see he again -- to make sure i -- i really do not care how furious -- how ridiculous i 'll feel -- when -- when -- lenore do not complete she thought because she be not sure nothing could be any truer than the fact that she have no idea how she would feel she begin sensitively to distrust herself she who have always be so sure of motive so contented with thing as they be have be strike by a absurd fancy that haunt because it be fiercely repudiate and scorn that would give she no rest until it be prove false but suppose it be true a succeed blankness of mind awake to the clip-clop of hoof and she father 's cheery halloo anderson dismount and throw he bridle he sit down heavily beside she you can ride back home he say lenore know she have be reprove for she wander out there and she make a motion to rise he big hand hold she down no hurry now i be here grand day be not it a ' i see the barley 's goin ' they sack look good to I lenore wait with some perturbation she have a guilty conscience and she fear he mean to quiz she about she sudden change of front regard the bend trip so she could not look up and she could not say a word jake say that

front seat and behind nash 's back he have slyly wink at lenore as if to compliment she on the evident success of they deep plot lenore at the first opportunity that present shot nash a warning glance which be sincere enough jake have begin to use keen eye and there be no tell what he might do the morning be cool sweet fresh with a red sun presage a hot day the big car hum like a droning bee and

and lean comfortably back she resign herself to wait and to endure by the flight of a crow it be about a hundred mile from anderson 's ranch to palmer but by the round-about road necessary to take the distance be a great deal longer lenore be well aware when they get up on the desert and the time come when she think she would suffocate there appear to be intolerable hour in which no one speak and

anderson 's enter the car she whisper in jake 's ear : i be find out thing tell you -- later the cowboy look anything but convinced and he glance with narrow eye at nash as that worthy hurry back to the car with a lurch and a leap the car leave palmer behind in a cloud of dust the air be furnace-hot oppressive and exceedingly dry lenore 's lip smart so that she continually moisten they on all side stretch dreary parched wheat-fields anderson shake he head sadly jake say : be not thet too bad not half grow a ' sure too late now near at hand lenore see the short immature dirty-whitish wheat and she realize that it be ruin it be be gettin ' worse jake remark anderson most of this will not be cut at all a ' what be cut will not yield seedling i see a yellow patch here a ' there on the north slope but on the most part the bend 's a failure father you remember dorn 's section that promise so well ask lenore yes but it promise only in case of rain i look for the worst reply anderson regretfully it look like storm-cloud over there say lenore point far ahead through the drift veil of heat far across the bare dreamy hill of fallow and the blast field of wheat stand up some huge white columnar cloud a vivid contrast to the coppery sky by george there be a thunderhead exclaim anderson jake what do you make of that look good to I reply jake who be always hopeful lenore bear the hot wind and the fine choke dust without cover she face she want to see all the hill and valley of this desert of wheat she heart beat a little faster as look across that waste on waste of heroic labor she realize she be near the end of a ride that might be momentous for she the very aspect of that wide treeless expanse with all its overwhelming meaning seem to make she a stronger and more thoughtful girl if those endless wheat-field be indeed ruin what a pity what a tragedy not only would young dorn be ruin but perhaps many other toiling farmer somehow lenore feel no hopeless certainty of ruin for the young man in whom she be interested there on that slope speak up anderson point to a field which be yellow in contrast to the surround gray field there be a half-section of fair wheat but such tinge of harvest gold be not many in half a dozen mile of dreary hill where be the beautiful shadow in the wheat wonder lenore not a breath of wind appear to stir across those field as the car near the top of a hill the road curve into another and lenore see a dusty flash of another car pass on ahead suddenly jake lean forward boss i see somethin' throw out of thet car -- into the wheat he say what -- mebbe it be a bottle reply anderson peer ahead nope sure be not thet there i see it again watch boss lenore strain she eye and feel a stir of she pulse jake 's voice be perturb be it strange that nash slow up a little where there be no apparent need then lenore see a hand flash out of the side of the car ahead and throw a small glint object into the wheat there see it again say jake i see jake mark that spot nash slow down yell anderson lenore gather from the look of she father and the cowboy that something be amiss but she could not guess what it might be nash bent sullenly at he task of drive i reckon about here say jake wave he hand stop she order anderson and as the car come to a halt he get out follow by jake wal i mark it by thet rock declare the cowboy so do i respond anderson let 's get over the fence a ' find what it be they throw in there jake rest a lean hand on a post and vault the fence but anderson have to climb laboriously and painfully over the barbed-wire obstruction lenore marvel at he silence and he persistence anderson hate wire fence presently he get over and then he divide he time between search in the wheat and peer after the strange car that be draw far away lenore saw jake pick up something and scrutinize it i 'll be dog-goned he mutter then he approach anderson what be thet jake you can lambaste I if i ever see the likes reply anderson but it look bad let 's rustle after that car as anderson clamber into he seat once more he look dark and grim catch that car ahead he tersely order nash whereupon the driver begin to go through he usual motion in start lenore what do you make of this query anderson turn to show she a small cake of some gray substance soft and wet to the touch i do not know what it be reply lenore wonderingly do you no a ' i would give a lot -- say nash hurry overhaul that car anderson turn to see why he order have not be obey he look angry nash make hurry motion the car tremble the machinery begin to whir -- then come a tremendous buzz roar a violent shake of the car follow by sharp explosion and silence you strip the gear shout anderson with the red fading out of he face no but something 's wrong reply nash he get out to examine the engine anderson manifestly control strong feeling lenore see jake 's hand go to she father 's shoulder boss he whisper we can not ketch thet car now anderson resign himself avert he face so that he could not see nash who be tinker with the engine lenore believe then that nash have deliberately stall the engine or disorder something so as to permit the escape of the strange car ahead she see it turn off the long straight road ahead and disappear to the right after some minute ' delay nash resume he seat and start the car once more from the top of the next hill lenore see the dorn farm and home all the wheat look parched she remember however that the section of promising grain lay on the north slope and therefore out of sight from where she be look as bad as any say anderson good-by to my money lenore shut she eye and thought of herself she inward state she seem calm and glad to have that first part of the journey almost end she motive in come be not now the impel thing that have actuate she when next the car slow down she hear she father say drive in by the house then lenore open she eye see the gate the trim little orchard with its scant shade the gray old weatherbeaten house which she remember so well the big porch look invite as it be shady and hold a old rocking-chair and a bench with blue cushion a door stand wide open no one appear to be on the premise nash blow you horn a ' then hunt around for somebody say anderson come get out lenore you must be half dead oh no only half dust and half fire reply lenore laughing as she step out what a relief to get rid of coat veil bonnet and to sit on a shady porch where a faint breeze blow just at that instant she hear a low distant rumble thunder it thrill she jake bring she a cold refresh drink and she send he back after another she wet she handkerchief and bath she hot face it be indeed very comfortable there after that long hot ride miss lenore i see thet nash

forget all about he the sight of he jealous face somehow add to she strange exhilaration they cross the road from the house and face the west have free prospect of the mile of billowy hill and the magnificent ordnance of the storm-cloud the deep low muttering of thunder seem a grand and welcome music lenore steal a look at dorn to see he barehead face upturn entranced it be only a rain-storm come down in the valley country such storm be frequent at this season too common for they meaning to be appreciate here in the desert of wheat rain be a blessing life itself the creamy-white rounded edge of the approach cloud come and coalesce spread and mushroom under they the body of the storm be purple light now and then by a flash of lightning long drift veil of rain gray as thin fog hang suspend between sky and earth listen exclaimed dorn a warm wind laden with dry scent of wheat strike lenore 's face and wave she hair it bring a silken sweeping rustle a whispering of the bearded grain the soft sound thrill lenore it seem a sweet hopeful message that wait have be reward that the drought could be break again and more beautiful than ever before in she life she see the wave of shadow as they come forward over the wheat ripple like breeze over the surface of a golden lake they come in long broken line move follow change until the whole wheat-field seem in shadowy motion the cloud pageant roll on above and beyond lenore feel a sweet drop of rain splash upon she upturned face it seem like a caress there come a pattering around she suddenly rise a damp faint smell of dust beyond the hill show a gray pall of rain come slowly charge with a low roar the whisper of the sweeping wheat be swallow up lenore stand she ground until heavy rain drop fall thick and fast upon she sinking through she thin waist to thrill she flesh and then with a last gay call to those two man lover of wheat and storm she run for the porch there they join she anderson puffing and smile dorn

reverence it fresh cool fragrance of a renew soil fill the air all that dusty gray hue of the earth have vanish and it be wet and green and bright even as she gaze the water seem to sink in as it fall a precious relief to thirsty soil the thunder roll away eastward and the storm pass the thin cloud follow soon clear away from the western sky rain-washed and blue with a rainbow curve down to bury its exquisite hue in the golden wheat chapter viii the journey homeward hold many incalculable difference from the uncertain doubt and fear that have torment lenore on the outward trip for a long time she feel the warm tight clasp of dorn 's hand on hers as he have say good-by very evidently he believe that be to be he last sight of she lenore would never forget the gaze that seem to try to burn

numb though anderson 's timely visit might turn out as providential as the saving rain-storm the wheat wave and rustle as if with renew and burst life the exquisite rainbow still shine a beautiful promise in the sky but dorn could not be happy in that moment this day lenore anderson have seem a bewildering fulfilment of the sweetness he have imagine be latent in she she have mean what be beyond he to understand she have gently put a hand to he lip to check the bitter word and he have dare to kiss she soft finger the thrill the sweetness the incomprehensible and perhaps imagine response of she pulse would never leave he he watch the big car until it be out of sight the afternoon be only half advanced and there be numberless task to do he decide he could think and plan while he work as he be about to turn away he espy another automobile this one come from the opposite direction to that anderson have take the sight of it remind dorn of the iww trick of throw phosphorus cake into the wheat he be suspicious of that car it slow down in front of the dorn homestead turn into the yard and stop near where dorn stand the dust have cake in layer upon it someone hail he and ask if this be the dorn farm kurt answer in the affirmative whereupon a tall man wear a long linen coat open the car door to step out in the car remain the driver and another man my name be hall announce the stranger with a pleasant manner i be from washington dc i represent the government and be in the northwest in the interest of the conservation commission you name have be recommend to I as one of the progressive young wheat-grower of the bend particularly that you be a american located in a country exceedingly important to the united state just now -- a country where foreign-born people predominate kurt somewhat startle and awed manage to give a courteous greet to he visitor and ask he into the house but mr hall prefer to sit outdoors on the porch he throw off hat and coat and take a easy chair he produce some cigar will you smoke he ask offer one kurt decline with thanks he be aware of this man 's penetrate yet kindly scrutiny of he and he have begin to wonder this be no ordinary visitor have you be draft abruptly query mr hall yes sir mine be the first number reply kurt with a little pride do you want exemption swiftly come the second query it shock dorn then sting he no he say forcibly you father 's sympathy be with germany i understand well sir i do not know how you understand that but it be true -- to my regret and shame you want to fight go on the official i hate the idea of war but i -- i guess i want to fight maybe that be because i be feel scrappy over these iww trick dorn the iww be only one of the many phase of war that we must meet return mr hall and then for a moment he thoughtfully draw upon he cigar young man i like you talk and i 'll tell you a secret my name 's not hall never mind my name for you it be uncle sam whereupon with a win and fascinating manner that seem to kurt at once intimate and flattering he begin to talk fluently of the meaning of he visit and of its cardinal importance the government be look far ahead prepare for a tremendous and perhaps a lengthy war the food of the country must be conserve wheat be one of the most vital thing in the whole world and the wheat of america be incalculably precious -- only the government know how precious if the war be short a wheat famine would come afterward if it be long the famine would come before the war end but it be inevitable the very outcome of the war itself depend upon wheat the government expect a nation-wide propaganda by the german interest which would be carry on secretly and boldly in every conceivable way to alienate the labor organization to bribe or menace the harvester to despoil crop and particularly to put obstacle in the way of the raising and harvest the transport and store of wheat it would take a army to protect the nation 's grain dorn be earnestly besought by this official to compass he district to find out who could be depend upon by the united state and who be antagonistic to impress upon the mind of all he neighbor the exceed need of greater and more persistent cultivation of wheat i accept i 'll do my best reply kurt grimly i 'll be go some the next two week it be deplorable that most of the wheat in this section be a failure say the official but we must make up for that next year i see you have one magnificent wheat-field but fact be i hear of that long before i get here yes where ejaculate kurt quick to catch a significance in the other 's word i have motor direct from wheatly and i be sorry to say that what i have now to tell you be not pleasant you father sell this wheat for eighty thousand dollar in cash the money be see to be pay over by a mill-operator of spokane and you father be report to be suspiciously interested in the iww man now at wheatly oh that be awful exclaimed kurt with a groan how do you learn that from american farmer -- man that i have be instruct to approach the same as in you case the information come quite by accident however and through my inquire about the iww father have not be rational since the president declare war he be very old i have have trouble with he he might do anything my boy there be multitude of irrational man nowadays and the number be grow i advise you to go at once to wheatly and bring you father home it be openly say that he be take risk with that large sum of money risk why i can not understand that the wheat 's not harvest yet let alone haul to town and to-day i learn the iww be work a trick with cake of phosphorus to burn the wheat kurt produce the cake of phosphorus and explain its significance to the curious official cunning devil who but a german would ever have think of that he exclaim german science to such end the german put they supreme knowledge i wonder what my father will say about this phosphorus trick i just wonder he love the wheat he wheat have take prize at three world 's fair maybe to see we wheat burn would untwist that twist in he brain and make he american i doubt it only death change the state of a real german physical moral and spiritual come ride back to glencoe with I i 'll drop you there you can hire a car and make wheatly before dark kurt run indoors think hard as he change clothes he tell the housekeeper to tell jerry he be call away and would be back next day put money and a revolver in he pocket he start out but hesitate and halt he happen to think that he be a poor shot with a revolver and a fine one with a rifle so he go back for he rifle a small high-power repeat gun that he could take apart and hide under he coat when he reach the porch the official glance from the weapon to kurt 's face and say with a flash of spirit : it appear that you be in earnest i be something tell I to take this respond kurt as he dismount the rifle i have already have one run-in with a iww i know tough customer when i see they these foreigner be the kind i do not want near I and if i see one try to fire the wheat i 'll shoot he leg off i be inclined to think that uncle sam would not deplore you shoot a little higher dorn you be fine you be all i hear you be shake hand kurt tingle all over as he follow the official out to the car and take the seat give he beside the driver back to glencoe be the order and then even if conversation have be in order it would scarcely have be possible that driver could drive he have no fear and he know he car kurt could drive himself but he think that if he have be as good as this fellow he would have choose one of two magnificent service for the army -- a ambulance-driver at the front or a aeroplane scout on the way to glencoe several squad of idle and march man be pass all of whom bear the earmark of the iww sight of they make kurt hug he gun and wonder at himself never have he be a coward but neither have he be one to seek a fight this suave distinguished government official by he own significant metaphor uncle sam go abroad to find true heart have work powerfully upon kurt 's temper he sense event he revolve in mind the need for he to be cool and decisive when face the circumstance that be sure to arise at glencoe which be reach so speedily that kurt could scarcely credit he eye the official say you 'll hear from I good-by and good luck kurt hire a young man he know to drive he over to wheatly all the way kurt brood about he father 's strange action the old man have leave home before the rain-storm how do he know he could guarantee so many bushel of wheat as the selling-price indicate kurt divine that he father have act upon one of he strange weather prophecy for he must have be absolutely sure of rain to save the wheat darkness have settle down when kurt reach wheatly and leave the car at the railroad station wheatly be a fairly good-sized little town there seem to be a unusual number of man on the dark street dim light show here and there kurt pass several time near group of converse man but he do not hear any significant talk most of the store be open and well fill with man but to kurt 's sharp eye there

seat at the nearest table a buxom german waitress come for he order he give it while he gaze around at he grim-faced old father and the burly neuman and he ear throb to the beat of he blood he hand tremble on the table he thought flash almost too swiftly for comprehension it take a stern effort to gain self-control evil of some nature be afoot neuman 's presence there be a strange disturbing fact kurt have make two guess both alarmingly correct if he have any more illusion or hope he dispel they he father have be win over by this arch conspirator of the iww and despite he father 's close-fistedness where money be concern that eighty thousand dollar or part of it be in danger kurt wonder how he could get possession of it if he could he would return it to the bank and wire a warn to the spokane buyer that the wheat be not safe he might persuade he father to turn over the amount of the debt to anderson while think and plan kurt keep a eye on he father and rather neglect he

he just keep the dim shadow in range they be head for some freight-car that stand upon a side-track the dark figure disappear behind they then one figure reappear come back kurt crouch low this man pass within a few yard of kurt and he be whisper to himself after he be safely out of earshot kurt steal on stealthily until he reach the end of the freight-car here he pause listen he think he hear low voice but he could not see the man he be follow no doubt they be wait in the secluded gloom for the other man apparently necessary for that secret conference kurt have sense this event and he have determine to be present he try not to conjecture it be best for he to apply all he faculty to the task of slip unseen and unheard close to these man who have involve he father in some dark plot not long after kurt hide himself on the other side of the freight-car he hear soft-padded footstep and subdue voice dark shape appear to come out of the gloom they pass he he distinguish low guttural voice speak german these man three in number be scarcely out of sight when kurt lay he rifle on the project shelf of the freight-car and follow they presently he come to deep shadow where he pause low voice draw he on again then a light make he thrill now and then the light appear to be darken by move figure a dark object loom up to cut off kurt 's view it be a pile of railroad tie and beyond it loom another steal along these he soon see the light again quite close by its glow he recognize he father 's huge frame back to he and the burly neuman on the other side and glidden whose dark face be work as he talk these three be sit evidently on a flat pile of tie and the other two man stand behind kurt could not make out the meaning of the low voice press closer to the freight-car he cautiously and noiselessly advance glidden be importune with expressive hand and swift low utterance he face gleam dark hard strong intensely string with cord quiver muscle with eye apparently green orb of fire he speak in german kurt dare not go closer unless he want to be discover and not yet be he ready for that he might hear some word to help explain he father 's strange significant intimation about anderson must -- have -- money glidden be say to kurt 's eye treachery gleam in that work face neuman bent over to whisper gruffly in dorn 's ear one of the silent man stand rub he hand together old

run along the several car to the first one where he grasp he rifle and keep on he hear he father 's roar like that of a mad bull and shrill yell from the other man kurt laugh grimly they would never catch he in the dark while he run he stuff the money into he inside coat pocket beyond the railroad station he slow down to catch he breath he breast be heave he pulse hammering and he skin be stream the excitement be the greatest under which he have ever labor now -- what shall -- i do he pant a freight-train be lumber toward he and the head-light be almost at the station the train appear to be go slowly through without stop kurt hurry on down the track a little farther then he wait he would get on that train and make he way somehow to ruxton there to warn anderson of the plot against he life chapter x kurt ride to adrian on that freight and upon arrive in the yard there he jump off only to mount another head south he mean to be travel while it be dark no passenger-train run at night and he want to put as much distance between he and wheatly as possible before daylight he have pile into a open box-car it be empty at least of freight and the floor appear to have a thin covering of hay the train gathering headway make a rattle rolling roar kurt hesitate about get up and grope back in the pitch-black corner of the car he feel that it contain a presence besides he own and suddenly he be startle by a object blacker than the shadow that sidle up close to he kurt could not keep the cold chill from chase up and down he back the object be a man who reach for kurt and feel of he with a skinny hand iww he whisper hoarsely in kurt 's ear yes reply kurt be that adrian where you get on it sure be answer kurt with grim humor than you be the feller sure reply kurt it be evident that he have embark upon a adventure when do we stall this freight not while we be on it you can gamble other dark form sidle out of the gloomy depths of that cavern-like corner and draw close to kurt he realize that he have fall in with iww man who apparently have take he for a expect messenger or leader he be importune for tobacco drink and money and he judge that he beg companion consist of a american tramp a austrian a negro and a german fine society to fall into that eighty thousand dollar become a tremendous burden how many man on this freight query kurt think he could ask question better than answer they and he be tell there be about twenty-five all of whom expect money at this information kurt rather closely press he hand upon the revolver in he side coat pocket by ask question and make judicious reply he pass what he feel be the dark mark in that mixed company of iww man and at length one by one they melt away to they warmer corner leave kurt by the door he do not mind the cold he want to be where at the first indication of a stop he could jump off the train with he hand on he gun and hug the bulge coat pocket close to he kurt settle himself for what he believe would be interminable hour he strain eye and ear for a possible attack from the riffraff iww man hide there in the car and that be why perhaps that it seem only a short while until the train bump and slow preparatory to stop the instant it be safe kurt jump out and steal away in the gloom a fence obstruct further passage he peer around to make out that he be in a road thereupon he hurry along it until he be out of hearing of the train there be light in the east heralding a dawn that kurt surely would welcome he sit down to wait and address to he bewildered judgment a query as to whether or not he ought to keep on carry the burdensome rifle it be not only heavy but when daylight come it might attract attention and he bulge coat would certainly invite curiosity he be in a predicament nevertheless he decide to hang on to the rifle he almost fall asleep wait there with he back against a fence-post the dawn come and then the rosy sunrise and he discover not half a mile away a good-sized town where he believe he surely could hire a automobile wait grow to be so tedious that he decide to risk the early hour and proceed toward the town upon the outskirts he meet a farmer boy who in reply to a question say that the town be connell kurt find another early riser in the person of a blacksmith who evidently be a yankee and proud of it he own a car that he be willing to hire out on good security kurt satisfy he on that score and then proceed to ask how to get across the copper river and into golden valley the highway follow the railroad from that town to kahlotus and there cross a big trunk-line railroad to turn south toward the river in half a hour during which time kurt be enable to breakfast the car be ready it be a large car rather ancient and the worse for wear but its owner assure kurt that it would take he where he want to go and he need not be afraid to drive fast with that inspiring knowledge kurt start off before ten o'clock kurt reach kilo far across the copper river with the blue mountain in sight and from there less confusing direction to follow he have be lucky he have pass the wreck of the freight-train upon which he have ride from adrian he car have be surround by rough man and only quick wit save he at least delay he have be hail by more than one group of tramp iww man and he have pass camp and freight-yard where idler be

gold have a tinge of rich ripe brown kurt 's father await he a haggard gloomy-faced man unkempt and hollow-eyed be it you who rob I he shout hoarsely yes reply kurt he have catch the eager hope and fear in the old man 's tone kurt expect that confession would bring on he father 's terrible fury a mood to dread but old dorn show immense relief he sit down in he relaxation from what must have be intense strain kurt see a weariness a shade in the gray line face that have never be there before what do you do with the money ask the old man i banked it in kilo reply kurt then i wire you miller in spokane so you be safe if we can harvest the wheat old dorn nod thoughtfully there have come a subtle change in he presently he ask kurt if man have be hire for the harvest no i have not see any i would trust reply kurt and then he briefly outline anderson 's plan to insure a quick and safe harvesting of the grain old dorn object to this on account of the expense kurt argue with he and patiently try to show he the imperative need of it dorn apparently be not to be win over however he be remarkably mild in comparison with what kurt have expect father do you realize now that the man you be deal with at wheatly be dishonest i mean with you they would betray you old dorn have no answer for this evidently he have sustain some kind of shock that he be not willing to admit look here father go on kurt in slow earnestness he speak in english because nothing would make he break he word and ever again speak a word of german and he father be not quick to comprehend english can not you see that the iww mean to cripple we wheat farmer this harvest no reply old dorn stubbornly but they do they do not _ want _ work if they accept work it be for a chance to do damage all this iww talk about more wages and shorter hour be deceit they make a bold face of discontent that be all a lie the iww be out to ruin the great wheat-fields and the great lumber forest of the northwest i do not believe that declare he father stoutly what for kurt mean to be careful of that subject no matter what for it do not make any difference what it be for we have get to meet it to save we wheat now will not you believe I will not you let I manage the harvest i will not believe reply old dorn stubbornly not about _ my _ wheat i know they mean to destroy they be against rich man like anderson but not I or my wheat there be where you be wrong i 'll prove it in a very few day but in that time i can prepare for they and outwit they will you let I go ahead reply old dorn gruffly it be a concession that kurt be amaze and delight to gain and he set about at once to act upon it he change he clothes and satisfied he hunger then saddle he horse he start out to visit he farmer neighbor the day bid fair to be rich in experience jerry the foreman be patrolling he long beat up and down the highway jerry carry a shot-gun and look like a sentry the man under he be on the other side of the section of wheat and the ground be so rolling that they could not be see from the highway jerry be unmistakably glad and relieved to see kurt some goin 's - on he declare with a grin since you leave there be be one hundred and sixteen iww tramp along this here road have you have any trouble inquire kurt wal i reckon it be not trouble but every time i take a peg at some sneak i sort of break out sweatin ' cold you shoot at they sure i shoot when i see any loafin ' along in the dark two of they shoot back at I a ' after thet i be not particular to aim high reckon i be about dead for sleep i 'll relieve you to-night reply kurt jerry do not the wheat look great wal i reckon a ' walkin ' along here when it be quiet a ' no wind blowin ' i can just hear the wheat crack it be gittin ' ripe fast a ' sure the biggest crop we ever raise but i be tellin ' you -- when i think how we 'll ever harvest it my inside just sink like lead kurt then outline anderson 's plan which be receive by the foreman with eager approval and the assurance that the neighbor farmer would rally to he call kurt find he nearest neighbor olsen cut a thin scarcely ripe barley olsen be run a new mccormack harvester and appear delighted with the machine but cast down by the grain prospects he do not intend to cut he wheat at all it be a dead loss two section -- twelve hundred a ' eighty acre he repeat gloomily a ' the third bad year dorn i can not pay the interest to my bank olsen 's sun-dried and wind-carved visage be as hard and rugged and heroic as this desert that have resist he for year kurt saw under the line and the bronze all the toil and pain and unquenchable hope that have make olsen a type of the man who have cultivate this desert of wheat i 'll give you five hundred dollar to help I harvest say kurt bluntly and briefly state he plan olsen whistle he compliment anderson 's shrewd sense he speak glowingly of that magnificent section of wheat that absolutely must be save he promise kurt every horse and every man on he farm but he refuse the five hundred dollar oh say you 'll have to accept it declare kurt you have do I good turn assert olsen but nothing like this why this will be a rush job with all the man and horse and machine and wagon i can get it 'll cost ten -- fifteen thousand dollar to harvest that section even at that and pay anderson we 'll clear twenty thousand or more olsen you have get to take the money all right if you insist i be needin ' it bad enough reply olsen further conversation with olsen glean the fact that he be the only farmer in they immediate neighborhood who do not have at least a little grain worth harvest but the amount be small and would require only slight time olsen name farmer that very likely would not take kindly to dorn 's proposition and have best not be approach the majority however would stand by he irrespective of the large wage offer because the issue be one to appeal to the pride of the bend farmer olsen appear surprisingly well inform upon the tactic of the iww and predict that they would cause trouble but be run out of the country he make the shrewd observation that when even those farmer who sympathize with germany discover that they wheat-field be be menace by foreign influence and protect by the home government they would experience a change of heart olsen say the war would be a good thing for the united state because they would win it and during the win would learn and suffer and achieve much kurt ride away from olsen in a more thoughtful frame of mind how different and interesting the point of view of different man olsen have never take the time to become a naturalized citizen of the united state there have never be anything to force he to do it but he understanding of the worth of the united state and he loyalty to it be manifest in he love for he wheatland in fact they be inseparable probably there be million of pioneer emigrant alien all over the country who be like olsen who need the fire of the crucible to mold they into a unity with american of such american be mold \* \* \* \* \* kurt ride all day and when late that night he get home weary and sore and choke he have enlist the service of thirty-five farmer to help he harvest the now famous section of wheat he father have plainly doubt the willingness of these neighbor to abandon they own labor for the bend exact toil for every hour of every season whether rich or poor in yield likewise he be plainly move by the fact he seamed and shaded face of gloom have a moment of light they will make short work of this harvest he say thoughtfully i should say so retorted kurt we 'll harvest and haul that grain to the railroad in just three day impossible ejaculate dorn you 'll see declare kurt you 'll see who be manage this harvest he could not restrain he little outburst of pride for the moment the great overhang sense of calamity that for long have haunt he fade into the background it do seem sure that they would save this splendid yield of wheat how much that mean to kurt -- in freedom from debt in natural love of the fruition of harvest in the loyalty to he government he realize how strange and strong be the need in he to prove he be american to the very core of he heart he do not yet understand that incentive but he feel it after eat dinner kurt take he rifle and go out to relieve jerry only a few more day and night he exclaim to he foreman then we 'll have all the harvester in the country right in we wheat wal a hell of a lot can happen before then declare jerry pessimistically kurt be bring back to reality rather suddenly but question jerry do not elicit any new or immediate cause for worry jerry appear tire out you go get some sleep say kurt all right bill 's be dividin ' this night watch with I i reckon he 'll be out when he wake up reply jerry and trudge away kurt shoulder he rifle and slowly walk along the road with a strange sense that he be already do army duty in protect property which be at once he own and he country 's the night be dark cool and quiet the heaven be starry bright a faint breeze bring the tiny crackling of the wheat from far distant come the bay of a hound the road stretch away pale and yellow into the gloom in the silence and loneliness and darkness in all around he and far across the dry whisper field there be a invisible presence that have its affinity in he hover over he shadowless and immense and wave in the burst wheat it be life he feel the wheat ripen he feel it in reawaken tenderness for he old father and in the stir of memory of lenore anderson the past active and important hour have leave little room for thought of she but now she come back to he a spirit in keep with he step a shadow under the star a picture of sweet wonderful young womanhood he whole relation of thought toward she have undergo some marvelous change the most divine of gift have be grant he -- a opportunity to save she from harm perhaps from death he have serve she father how greatly he could not tell but if measure by the gratitude in she eye it would have be infinite he recall that expression -- blue warm soft and indescribably strange with its unuttered hidden meaning it be all-satisfying for he to realize that she have be compel to give he a separate and distinct place in she mind he must stand apart from all other she know it have be he fortune to preserve she happiness and the happiness that she must be to sister and mother and that some day she would bestow upon some lucky man they would all owe it to he and lenore anderson know he love she these thing have transform he relation of thought toward she he have no regret no jealousy no fear even the pang of suppress and overwhelming love have go with he confession but he do remember she presence she beauty she intent blue glance and the faint dream smile of she lip -- remember they with a thrill and a wave of emotion and a contraction of he heart he have promise to see she once more to afford she the opportunity no doubt to thank he to try to make he see she gratitude he would go but he wish it need not be he ask no more and see she again might change he fulness of joy to something of pain so kurt tread the long road in the darkness and silence pause and check he dream now and then to listen and to watch he hear no suspicious sound nor do he meet any one the night be melancholy with a hint of fall in its cool breath soon he would be walk a beat in one of the training-camp with a bugle-call in he ear and the turmoil of thousand of soldier in the make around he : soon too he would be walk the deck of a transport look back down the moon-blanched wake of the ship toward home listen to the mysterious moan of the ocean and then soon feel under he foot the soil of a foreign country with hideous and incomparable war shriek its shell fury and its man anguish all about he but no matter how far away he ever get he know lenore anderson would be with he as she be there on that dim lonely starlit country road and in these long hour of he vigil kurt dorn divine a relation between he love for lenore anderson and a terrible need that have grow upon he a need of he heart and he soul more than he need she if even in he wildest dream he have permit himself vision of a earthly paradise he need to prove to he blood and he spirit that he be actually and truly american he have no doubt of he intelligence he reason he choice the secret lay hide in the depths of he and he know it come from the spring of the mother who have beget he he mother have give he birth and by every tie he be mostly hers kurt have be in college during the first year of the world war and he name he fair hair and complexion he fluency in german and he remarkable efficiency in handicraft have open he to many a hint many a veil sarcasm that have sting he like a poison brand there be injustice in all this war spirit it change the mind of man and woman he have not doubt himself until those terrible scene with he father and though he have react to they as a american he have feel the draw burning blood tie he hate everything german and he know he be wrong in do so he have clear conception in he mind of the difference between the german war motive and means and those of the other nation kurt 's problem be to understand himself he great fight be with he own soul he material difficulty and he despairing love have suddenly be transform so that they have lend he spirit wing how many poor boy and girl in america must be helplessly divide between parent and country how many faithful and blind parent obedient to the law of mind and heart set for all time must see a favorite son go out to fight against all they have hold sacred that be all bad enough but kurt have more to contend with no illusion have he of a chastened german spirit a clarify german mind a unbrutalized german heart kurt know he father what would change he father nothing but death death for himself or death for he only son kurt have a incalculable call to prove forever to himself that he be free he have to spill he own blood to prove himself or he have to spill that of a enemy and he prefer that it should be he own but that do not change a vivid and terrible picture which haunt he at time he see a dark wide and barren shingle of the world a desert of desolation make by man where strange windy shriek and thunder boom and awful cry go up in the night and where drift pall of smoke make starless sky and burst of reddish fire make hell suddenly kurt 's slow pacing along the road be halt as be the trend of he thought he be not sure he have hear a sound but he quiver all over the night be far advance now the wind be almost still the wheat be smooth and dark as the bosom of a rest sea kurt listen he imagine he hear far away the faint roar of a automobile but it might have be a train on the railroad sometimes on still night he catch sound like that then a swish in the wheat a soft thud very low unmistakably come to kurt 's ear he listen turn he ear to the wind presently he hear it again -- a sound relate both to wheat and earth in a hot flash he divine that some one have throw fairly heavy body into the wheat-fields phosphorus cake kurt hold he breath while he peer down the gloomy road he heart pound he hand grip the rifle and when he descry a dim form stealthily come toward he he yell halt instantly the form waver move swiftly with quick pad of footfall kurt shot once -- twice -- three time -- and aim as best he could to hit the form either fall or go on out of sight in the gloom kurt answer the excited shout of he man call they to come across to he then he go cautiously down the road peer on the ground for a dark form but he fail to find it and presently have to admit that in the dark he aim have be poor bill come out to relieve kurt and together they go up and down the road for a mile without any glimpse of a skulk form it be almost daylight when kurt go home to get a few hour ' sleep chapter xii next day be one of the rare blistering-hot day with a furnace wind that roar over the wheat-fields the sky be steely and the sun like copper it be a day which would bring the wheat to a head at breakfast jerry report that fresh auto track have be make on the road during the night and that dust and wheat all around the great field show a fresh tramp kurt believe a deliberate and particular attempt have be make to insure the destruction of the dorn wheat-field and he order all hand out to search for the dangerous little cake of phosphorus it be difficult to find they the wheat be almost as high as a man 's head and very thick to force a way through it without tramp it down take care and time besides the soil be soft and the agent who have perpetrate this vile scheme have perfectly match the color kurt almost step on one of the cake before he see it he man be very slow in find any but kurt 's father seem to walk fatally right to they for in a short hundred yard he find three they cause a profound change in this gloomy man not a word do he utter but he become animated by a tremendous energy the search be discourage it be like hunting for dynamite bomb that might explode at any moment all kurt 's dread of calamity return fourfold the intense heat of the day that would ripen the wheat to burst would likewise sooner or later ignite the cake of phosphorus and when jerry find a cake far inside the field away from the road show that powerful have be the arm that have throw it there and how impossible it would be to make a thorough search kurt almost succumb to discouragement still he keep up a frenzied hunting and inspire the laborer to do likewise about ten o'clock a excited shout from bill draw kurt 's attention and he run along the edge of the field bill be sweaty and black yet through it all kurt believe he see the man be pale he point with shake hand toward olsen 's hill kurt vibrate to a shock he see a long circular yellow column rise from the hill slant away on the strong wind dust he cry aghast smoke reply bill hoarsely the catastrophe have fall olsen 's wheat be burn kurt experience a profound sensation of sadness what a pity the burning of wheat -- the destruction of bread -- when part of the world be starve tear dim he eye as he watch the swell column of smoke bill be cursing and kurt gather that the farm-hand be predict fire all around this be inevitable but it mean no great loss for most of the wheat-growers whose yield have fail for kurt and he father if fire get a hold in they wheat it mean ruin kurt 's sadness be burn out by a slow and grow rage bill go hitch up to the big mower order kurt we 'll have to cut all around we field bring drinking water and whatever you can lay a hand on anything to fight fire bill run thump away over the clod then it happen that kurt look toward he father the old man be stand with he arm aloft he face turn toward the burning wheat and he make a tragic figure that wring kurt 's heart jerry come run up fire fire olsen 's burnin ' look by all thet 's dirty they iww 's hev do it kurt we be in fer hell thet wind 's blowin ' straight this way jerry we 'll fight till we drop reply kurt tell the man and father to keep on search for phosphorus cake jerry you keep to the high ground watch for fire start on we land if you see one yell for

the black violently agitate form of the fighter and the cloud of yellow smoke coalesce and drift change to dark and soar high olsen have send three mower abreast down the whole length of the barley-field before the fire reach that line it be a wise move and if anything could do so it would save the day the leap flame thin and high and a mile long curl down the last of the standing wheat and catch the fall barley but here its speed be check it have to lick a way along the ground in desperation in unabated fury the little army of farmer and laborer with no thought of personal gain with

upon he face smoke be not fly so thickly over the western hill through a rift in the cloud peep a star the only other light he see twinkle far down the lane it be that of a lantern dark form bar it now and then slowly kurt recover he breath the man be talk and tired voice ring with assurance that the fire be beat some one call kurt the voice be jerry 's it seem hoarse and strained kurt could see

splendid truth of he father 's last message in the black hour soon to come kurt would have that to sustain he chapter xiii the bright sun of morning disclose that wide rolling region of the bend to be a dreary blacken waste surround one great wheat-field rich and mellow and golden kurt dorn 's neighbor olsen in he kind and matter-of-fact way make obligation seem slight take charge of kurt 's affair and make the necessary and difficult decision nothing must delay the harvesting and transporting of the wheat the woman folk arrange for the burial of old chri dorn kurt sit and move about in a gloomy kind of trance for a day and a half until he father be lay to rest beside he mother in the little graveyard on the windy hill after that he mind slowly clear he keep to himself the remainder of that day avoid the crowd of harvester camp in the yard and adjacent field and at sunset he go to a lonely spot on the verge of the valley where with sad eye he watch the last ray of sunlight fade over the blacken hill all these hour have seem consecrate to he father 's memory to remembered act of kindness and of love of the relation that have go and would never be again reproach and remorse have abide with he until that sunset hour when the load ease off he heart next morning he go out to the wheat-field \* \* \* \* \* what a wonderful harvesting scene greet kurt dorn never have its like be see in the northwest nor perhaps in any other place a huge pall of dust chaff and smoke hang over the vast wheat-field and the air seem charge with a roar the glaring gold of the wheat-field appear to be crisscross everywhere with bob black streak of horse -- bay black whites and red by big move paint machine lift arm and puff straw by immense wagon pile high with sheaf of wheat lumber down to the smoking engine and the thresher that send long stream of dust and chaff over the lifting straw-stack by wagon follow the combine to pick up the plump brown sack of wheat and by a string of empty wagon come in from the road olsen be rush thirty combine thresher three engine threshing-machine forty wagon-team and over a hundred man well know to he there be a guard around the field this unprecedented harvest have attract many spectator from the little town they have come in car and on horseback and on foot olsen trust no man on that field except those he know the wonderful wheat-field be cut into a thousand square and angle and lane and curve the big whir combine pass one another stop and wait and turn out of the way leave everywhere little patch and cube of stand wheat that soon fall before the onslaught of the smaller combine this scene have no regularity it be one of confusion of awkward halt delay hurry of accident the wind blow cloud of dust and chaff alternately clear one space to cloud another and a strange roar add the last heroic touch to this heroic field it be indeed the roar of battle -- man and horse govern the action of machinery and all fight time for in delay be peril to the wheat once kurt run across the tireless and implacable olsen he seem a man of dust and sweat and fury she be half cut a ' over twenty thousand bushel go to the railroad he exclaim a ' we be speedin ' up olsen i do not get what be go on reply kurt all this be like a dream wake up you 'll be out of debt a ' a rich man in three day add olsen and go he way in the afternoon kurt set out to work as he have never work in he life there be need of he strong hand in many place but he could not choose any one labor and stick by it for long he want to do all it be as if this be not a real and wonderful harvest of he father 's greatest wheat yield but something that embody all year all harvest he father 's death the lifting of the old hard debt the day when he have tread the field barefoot and this day when strangely enough all seem over for he peace dwelt with he yet no hope behind he calm he could have find the old dread have he care to look deeply he love these heroic worker of the field it have be give to he -- a great task -- to be the means of create a test for they he neighbor under a ban of suspicion and now he could swear they be as true as the gold of the wave wheat more than a harvest be this most strenuous and colorful of all time ever know in the bend it have a significance that uplift he it be american first kurt begin to load bag of wheat as they fall from the whir combine into the wagon for he powerful arm a full bag contain two bushel be like a toy for a child with a lift and a heave he throw a bag into a wagon they be everywhere these brown bag dot the stubble field appear as if by magic in the wake of the machine they roll off the platform this toil because it be hard and heavy hold kurt for a hour but it could not satisfy he enormous hunger to make that whole harvest he own he pass to pitch sheaf of wheat and then to drive in the wagon from that he progress to a seat on one of the immense combine where he drive twenty-four horse no driver there be any surer than kurt of he aim with the little stone he throw to spur a lagging horse kurt have feel this when as a boy he have beg to be allow to try he hand he like the shifty cloud of fragrant chaff now and then blind and choke he and he like the steady rhythmic tramp of hoof and the roar whir of the great complicated machine it fascinate he to see the wide swath of nod wheat tremble and sway and fall and go slide up into the inside of that grind maw and come out straw and dust and chaff and a slender stream of gold fill the bag this day kurt dorn be grip by the unknown some far-off instinct of future drive he set he spiritual need and make he register with he sens all that be so beautiful and good and heroic in the scene about he strangely now and then a thought of lenore anderson enter he mind and make sudden havoc it tend to retard action he tremble and thrill with a realization that every hour bring closer the meeting he could not avoid and he discover that it be whenever this memory recur that he have to leave off he present task and rush to another only thus could he forget she the late afternoon find he feed sheaf of wheat to one of the steam-thresher he stand high upon a platform and pitch sheaf from the wagon upon the slide track of the ponderous rattle threshing-machine the engine stand off fifty yard or more connect by a endless driving-belt to the thresher here indeed be whistle and roar and whir and the shout of laborer and the smell of smoke sweat dust and wheat kurt have arm of steel if they tire he never know it he toil and he watch the long spout of chaff and straw as it stream from the thresher to lift magically a glisten ever-growing stack and he feel as a last and cumulative change he physical effort and the physical adjunct of the scene pass into something spiritual into he heart and he memory the end of that harvest-time come as a surprise to kurt obsess with he own emotion he have actually help to cut the wheat and harvest it he have see it go swath by swath he have watch the huge wagon lumber away and the huge straw-stack rise without realize that the hour of this wonderful harvest be number sight of olsen come in from across the field and the sudden cessation of roar and action make kurt aware of the end it seem a calamity but olsen be smile through he dust-caked face about he be relaxation a air of finality and a subtle pride we be through he say she tally thirty-eight thousand seven hundred a ' forty-one bushel it be too bad the old man could not live to hear that olsen grip kurt 's hand and wring it boy i reckon you ought to take that a little cheerfuller he go on but -- well it be be a hard time the man be leavin ' now in two hour the last wagon will unload at the railroad the wheat will all be in the warehouse a ' we worry 's end i -- i hope so respond kurt he seem overcome with the passionate longing to show he gratitude to olsen but the word would not flow i -- i do not know how to thank you all my life -- we beat the iww interpose the farmer heartily a ' now what 'll you do dorn why i 'll hustle to kilo get my money send you a check for yourself and man pay off the debt to anderson and then -- but kurt do not conclude he speech he last word be thought-provoking it be turn out well say olsen with satisfaction and shake hand again with kurt he stride back to he horse at last the wide sloping field be bare except for the huge straw-stack a bright procession lumber down the road lead by the long string of wagon fill with brown bag a strange silence have settle down over the farm the wheat be go that wave stretch of gold have fall to the thresher and the grain have be haul away the neighbor have go leave kurt rich in bushel of wheat and richer for the hearty farewell and the grip of horny hand kurt 's heart be full \* \* \* \* \* it be evening kurt have finish he supper already he have pack a few thing to take with he on the morrow he go out to the front of the house star be blinking there be a low hum of insect from the field he miss the soft silken rustle of the wheat and now it seem he could sit there in the quiet darkness in that spot which have be make sweet by lenore anderson 's presence and think of she the meeting soon to come the feeling abide with he then must have be happiness because he be not use to it without deserving anything he have ask a great deal of fate and lo it have be give he all be well that end well he realize now the terrible depths of despair into which he have allow himself to be plunge he have be weak wrong selfish there be something that guide event he need to teach himself all this with strong and repeated force so that when he go to give lenore anderson the opportunity to express she gratitude to see she sweet face again and to meet the strange warm glance of she blue eye so mysterious and somehow mock he could be a man of restraint of pride like any american like any other college man she know this be no time for a man to leave a girl bear a burden of he unsolicited love haunt perhaps by a generous reproach that she might have be a little to blame he have tell she the truth and so far he have be dignified now let he bid she good-by leave no sorrow for she and once out of she impelling presence let come what might come he could love she then he could dare what he have never dare he could surrender himself to the furious insistent sweetness of a passion that be sheer bliss in its expression he could imagine kiss on the red lip that be not for he a husky shout from somewhere in the rear of the house divert kurt 's attention he listen it come again he name it seem a strange call from out of the troubled past that have just end he hurry through the house to the kitchen the woman stand hold a lamp stare at jerry jerry appear to have sink against the wall he face be pallid with drop of sweat stand out with distorted quiver lower jaw he could not look at kurt he could not speak with shake hand he point toward the back of the house fill with nameless dread kurt rush out he see nothing unusual hear nothing rapidly he walk out through the yard and suddenly he see a glow in the sky above the barn then he run so that he could get a unobstructed view of the valley the instant he obtain this he halt as if turn to stone the valley be a place of yellow light he stare with the wheat-fields all burn what be the meaning of such a big light that broad flare have a center low down on the valley floor as he gaze a monstrous flame leap up lighting colossal pillar of smoke that swirl upward and show plainer than in day the big warehouse and line of freight-car at the railroad station eight mile distant my god gasp kurt the warehouse -- my wheat -- on fire clear and unmistakable be the horrible truth kurt hear the roar of the sinister flame transfix he stand there at first hardly able to see and to comprehend for mile the valley be as light as at noonday a awful beauty attend the scene how lurid and sinister the red heart of that fire how weird and hellish and impressive of destruction those black mountain-high cloud of smoke he see the freight-car disappear under this fierce blaze and smoke pall he watch for what seem endless moment he see the change of that fire swift and terrible and only then do kurt dorn awaken to the full sense of the calamity all that work -- olsen 's sacrifice -- and the farmer ' -- my father 's death -- all for nothing whisper kurt they only wait -- those fiend -- to fire the warehouse and the car the catastrophe have fall the wheat be burn he be ruin he wheatland must go to anderson kurt think first and most poignantly of the noble farmer who have sacrifice the little in they wheat-field to save the much in he never could he repay they then he become occupy with a horrible heat that seem to have come from the burning warehouse to all he pulse and vein and to he heart and he soul this fiendish work as have be forecast be the work of the iww behind it be glidden and perhaps behind he be the grasp black lust of german might kurt 's loss be no longer abstract or problematical it be a loss so real and terrible that it confound he he shake and gasp and reel he wring he hand and beat he breast while the tumult sway he the physical hate at last yield up its significance what then be he great loss he could not tell the thing be mighty like the sense of terror and loneliness in the black night not the loss for he farmer neighbor so true in he hour of trial not the loss of he father nor the wheat nor the land nor he ruin future but it must be a loss incalculable and insupportable to he soul he great ordeal have be the need a terrible and incomprehensible need to kill something intangible in himself he have mean to do it and now the need be shift subject to a baser instinct if there be german blood in he poisoning the very well of he heart he could have spill it and so whether living or dead have repudiate the taint that be now clear in he consciousness but a baser spark have ignite all the primitive passion of the forebear he feel burning and drive within he he feel no noble fire he long to live to have a hundredfold he strength and fury to be gifted with a genius for time and place and bloody deed to have the war-gods set he a thousand opportunity to beat with iron mace and cut with sharp bayonet and rend with hard hand -- to kill and kill and kill the hideous thing that be german chapter xiv kurt rush back to the house encounter jerry he order he to run and saddle a couple of horse then kurt get he revolver and a box of shell and throw on he coat he hurry to the barn jerry be lead out the horse it take but short work to saddle they jerry be excite and talkative he ask kurt many question which excite few reply when kurt throw himself into the saddle jerry yell which way down the trail reply kurt and be off aw we 'll break we neck come jerry 's yell after he kurt have no fear of the dark he know that trail almost as well by night as by day he horse be a mettlesome colt that have not be work during the harvest and he plunge down the dim wind trail as if indeed to verify jerry 's fear presently the thin pale line that be the trail disappear on the burn wheat-ground here kurt be at fault as to direction but he do not slacken the pace for that he hear jerry pound along in the rear try to catch up the way the colt jump ditch and wash and other obstruction prove he keen sight kurt let he go and then the ride become both perilous and thrilling kurt could not see anything on the blacken earth but he know from the contour of the hill just about where to expect to reach the fence and the road and he do not pull the horse too soon when he find the gate he wait for jerry who could be hear call from the darkness kurt answer he here be the gate yell kurt as jerry come gallop up good road all the way now lickity-cut then shout jerry to whom the pace have evidently communicate enthusiasm the ride then become a race with kurt draw ahead kurt could see the road a broad pale belt divide the blackness on either side and he urge the colt to a run the wind cut short kurt 's breath beat at he ear and roar about they closer and closer draw the red flare of the die fire casting long ray of light into kurt 's eye the colt be almost run out when he enter the circle of reddish flare kurt see the glowing ruin of the elevator and a long fiery line of box-cars burn to the wheel man be run and shout round in front of the little railroad station and several be on the roof with broom and bucket the freight-house have burn and evidently the station itself have be on fire across the wide street of the little village the roof of a cottage be burn man be on top of it beat the shingle hoarse yell greet kurt as he leap out of the saddle he hear scream of frightened woman on the other side of the burn box-car a long thin column of spark rise straight upward over the ruin of the elevator hang a pall of heavy smoke just then jerry come gallop up he lean face red in the glow thet you kurt say the son of gun be burnin ' down the town he leap off lemme have you bridle i 'll tie the hoss up find out what we can do kurt run here and there possess by impotent rage the wheat be go that fact give he a hollow sickening pang he meet farmer he know they all throw up they hand at sight of he not one could find a voice finally he meet olsen the little wheat farmer be white with passion he carry a gun hello dorn be not this hell they get you wheat he say hoarsely olsen how would it happen be not anybody set to guard the elevator yes but the iww 's drive all the guard off but grimm a ' they beat he up bad nobody have nerve enough to shoot olsen if i run into the glidden i 'll kill he declare kurt so will i but dorn they be a hard crowd they be over there on the side watchin ' the fire a gang of they soon as i can get the man together we 'll drive they out of town there 'll be a fight if i do not miss my guess hurry the man have all of they get they gun come on not yet dorn we be fightin ' fire yet you a ' jerry help all you can indeed it appear there be danger of more than one cottage burn the exceedingly dry weather of the past week have make shingle like tinder and wherever a glowing spark fall on they there straightway be a smolder fire water a scarce necessity in that region have be use until all well and pump become dry it be fortunate that most of the roof of the little village have be construct of galvanized iron beat out blaze and glowing ember with broom be not effective enough when it appear that the one cottage nearest the rain of spark be sure to go kurt thought of the railroad watertank below the station he lead a number of man with bucket to the tank and they soon drown out the smolder place meanwhile the blaze from the box-cars die out leave only the dull glow from the red heap that have once be the elevator however this give forth light enough for any one to be see a few rod distant spark have cease to fall and from that source no further danger need be apprehend olsen have be go from man to man send those who be not arm home for gun so it come about that half a hour after kurt 's arrival a score of farmer villager and a few railroader be collect in a group listen to the pale-faced olsen man there be only a few of we a ' there be hundred mebbe in thet iww gang but we have get to drive they off he say doggedly there be no tellin ' what they 'll do if we let they hang around any longer they know we be weak in number we have get to do some shootin ' to scare they away kurt second olsen in ring voice they have threaten you home he say they have burn my wheat -- ruin I they be the death of my father these be fact i be tell you we can not wait for law or for militia we have get to meet this iww invasion they have take advantage of the war situation they be back by german agent it be now a question of we property we have get to fight the crowd make noisy and determined response most of they have small weapon a few have shot-gun or rifle come on man call olsen i 'll do the talkin ' a ' if i say shoot why you shoot it be necessary to go around the long line of box-cars olsen lead the way with kurt just back of he the man speak but little and in whisper at the left end of the line the darkness be thick enough to make object indistinct once around the corner kurt plainly descry a big dark crowd of man whose face show red in the glow of the huge pile of ember which be all that remain of the elevator they do not see olsen 's man hold on whisper olsen if we get in a fight here we 'll be in a bad place we have nothin ' to hide behind let 's go off -- more to the leave -- a ' come up behind those freight-car on the switch that 'll give we cover a ' we 'll have the iww 's in the light so he lead off to the left keep in the shadow and climb between several line of freight-car all empty and finally come out behind the iww 's olsen lead to within fifty yard of they and be halt by some observant member of the gang who sit with the other on top of a flat-car this man 's yell still the coarse talk and laughter of the gang what be that shout a cold clear voice with authority in it kurt think he recognize the voice and it cause a burst savage sensation in he blood here be a bunch of farmer with gun yell the man from the flat-car olsen halt he force near one of the detach line of box-car which he probably mean to take advantage of in case of a fight hey you iww 's he shout with all he might there be a moment 's silence there be no iww 's here reply the authoritative voice kurt be sure now that he recognize glidden 's voice excitement and anger then give place to deadly rage who be you yell olsen we be tramp watchin ' the fire come the reply you set that fire no we do not kurt motion olsen to be silent as with lift breast he take a involuntary step forward glidden i know you he shout in hard quick tone i be kurt dorn i have meet you i know you voice take you gang -- get out of here -- or we 'll kill you this pregnant speech cause a blank dead silence then come a white flash a sharp report kurt hear the thud of a bullet strike some one near he the man cry out but do not fall spread out a ' hide order olsen a ' shoot fer keep the little crowd break and melt into the shadow behind and under the box-cars kurt crawl under a car and between the wheel from which vantage-point he look out glidden 's gang be there in the red glow most of they now stand the sentry who have give the alarm still sit on top of the flat-car swing he leg he companion however have jump down kurt hear man of he own party crawl and whisper behind he and he see dim dark sprawling form under the far end of the car boss the hayseed have run off call the man from the flat car laughter and jeer greet this sally kurt conclude it be about time to begin proceedings rest he revolver on the side of the wheel behind which he lay he take steady aim at the sentry hold low kurt be not a good shot with a revolver and the distance appear to exceed fifty yard but as luck would have it when he pull trigger the sentry let out a loud bawl of terror and pain and fall off the car to the ground flop and crawl like a cripple chicken he get out of sight below kurt 's shot be a starter for olsen 's man four or five of the shot-gun boom at once then the second barrel be discharge along with a sharper crack of small arm pandemonium break loose in glidden 's gang no doubt at least of the effectiveness of the shot-gun a medley of strange sharp enraged and anguished cry burst upon the air a prelude to a wild stampede in a few seconds that light spot where the iww have group be vacant and everywhere be flee form some swift other slow so far as kurt could see no one have be fatally injure but many have be hurt and that fact augur well for olsen 's force presently a shot come from some hidden enemy it thud into the wood of the car over kurt some one on he side answer it and a heavy bullet striking iron whine away into the darkness then follow flash here and flash there with accompany report and whistle of lead from behind and under and on top of car open up a fire that prove how well arm these so-called laborer be they volley completely drown the desultory firing of olsen 's squad kurt begin to wish for one of the shot-gun it be this kind of weapon that save olsen 's follower there be a hundred chance to one of miss a iww with a single bullet while a shot-gun aim fairly well be generally productive of result kurt stop waste he cartridge some one be hurt behind he car and he crawl out to see a villager name schmidt have be wound in the leg not seriously but bad enough to disable he he have be use a double-barreled breech-loading shot-gun and he wear a vest with row of shell in the pocket across the front kurt borrow gun and ammunition and with these he hurry back to he covert grimly sure of himself at thought of glidden he become hot all over and this heat rather grow with the excitement of battle with the heavy fowling-piece loaded kurt peep forth from behind he protect wheel and watch keenly for flash or move dark figure the iww have begin to reserve they fire to shift they position and to spread out judge from a wider range of the report it look as if they mean to try and surround olsen 's band it be extraordinary -- the assurance and deadly intent of this riffraff gang of tramp labor-agitator in precede year a crowd of iww man have be nothing to worry a rancher vastly different it seem now they act as if they have the great war back of they kurt crawl out of he hiding-place and steal from car to car in search of olsen at last he find the rancher in company with several man peer from behind a car one of he companion be sit down and try to wrap something round he foot olsen they be spread out to surround we whisper kurt that be what bill here just say reply olsen nervously if this keep up we 'll be in a tight place what 'll we do dorn we must not break and run of all thing say kurt they would burn the village tell we man to save they shell if i only could get some crack at a bunch of they together -- with this big shot-gun say we have be watchin ' that car -- the half-size one there -- next the high box-car whisper olsen it be full of they sometimes we see a dozen shot come from it all at once olsen i have a idea return kurt excitedly you fellow keep shooting -- attract they attention i 'll slip below climb on top of a box-car and get a rake-off at that bunch it be risky dorn say olsen with hesitation but if you could get in a few tellin ' shot -- start that gang on the run i 'll try it rejoin kurt and forthwith steal off back toward the shadow it strike he that there be more light then when the attack begin the fire have increase or perhaps the iww have start another at any rate the light be grow stronger and likewise the danger greater as he cross a open space a bullet whiz by he and then another zip by to strike up the gravel ahead these be not random shot some one be aim at he how strange and rage-provoking to be shoot at deliberately what a remarkable experience for a young wheat farmer raise wheat in the great northwest have assume responsibility he have to run and he be the more furious because of that another bullet fly wide hum to he left before he gain the shelter of the farthest line of freight-car here he hide and watch the firing appear to be all behind he and thus encourage he steal along to the end of the line of car and around a bright blaze greet he gaze a isolate car be on fire kurt peer forth to make sure of he bearing and at length find the high derrick by which he have mark the box-car that he intend to climb he could see plainly and steal up to he objective point with little risk to himself until he climb upon the box-car he crouch low almost on hand and knee and finally gain the long shadow of a shed between the track then he run past the derrick to the dark side of the car he could now plainly see the revolver flash and could hear the thud and spang of they bullet striking draw a deep breath kurt climb up the iron ladder on the dark side of the car he have the same sensation that possess he when he be crawl to get a pot-shot at a flock of wild goose only this be mightily more exciting he do not forget the risk he lay flat and crawl little by little every moment he expect to be discover olsen have evidently call more of he man to he side for they certainly be shooting diligently kurt hear a continuous return fire from the car he be risk so much to get a shot at at length he be within a yard of the end of the car -- as far as he need to go he rest a moment he be labor for breath sweating freely on fire with thrill he plan be to raise himself on one knee and fire as many double shot as possible presently he lift he head to locate the car it be half in the bright light half in the shadow lengthwise toward he about sixty or seventy yard distant and full of man he drop he head tingle all over it be a disappointment that the car stand so far away with fine shot he could not seriously injure any of the iww contingent but he be grimly sure of the fright and hurt he could inflict in he quick glance he have see flash of they gun and many red face and dark huddle form kurt take four shell and set they end up on the roof of the car close to he then cock the gun he cautiously raise himself to one knee he discharge both barrel at once what a boom and what a terrify outburst of yell swiftly he break the gun reload fire as before and then again the last two shot be fire at the man pile frantically over the side of the car yell with fear kurt have hear the swish pattering impact of those swarm of small shot the iww gang run pell-mell down the open track away from kurt and toward the light as he reload the gun he see man run from all point to join the gang with a old blunderbuss of a shot-gun he have route the iww it mean relief to olsen 's man but kurt have yet no satisfaction for the burning of he wheat for the cruel shock that have kill he father come on olsen he yell at the top of he lung they be a lot of coward then in he wild eagerness he leap off the car the long jump land he jarringly but he do not fall or lose hold of the gun recover he balance he break into a run kurt be fast on he foot not a young man of he neighborhood nor any of he college-mate could outfoot he in a race and then these iww fellow run like stiff-legged tramp long unused to such mode of action and some of they be limp as they run kurt gain upon they when he get within range he halt short and free two barrel a howl follow the report some of the flee one fall but be drag up and on by companion kurt reload and bound forward like a deer yell for olsen he run until he be within range then stop to shoot again thus he continue until the pursued get away from the circle of light kurt see the gang break up some run one way and some another there be shed and car and pile of lumber along the track afford place to hide kurt be halt by the discovery that he have no more ammunition panting he stop short realize that he have snap a empty gun at man either too tired or too furious or too desperate to run any farther he be out of shell shout a low hard voice that make kurt leap he welcome the rush of dark form and swing the gun round he head make ready to brain the first antagonist who near he but some one leap upon he from behind the onslaught carry he to he knee bound up he break the gun stock on the head of he assailant who go down in a heap kurt try to pull he revolver it become impossible owe to strong arm encircle he wrestle he free himself only to be stagger by a rush of several man all pounce upon he at once kurt go down but once down he heave so powerfully that he throw off the whole crew up again like a cat he begin to fight big and strong and swift with fist like a blacksmith 's kurt bowl over this assailant and that one he think he recognize glidden in a man who keep out of he reach and who be urge on the other kurt lunge at he and finally get he hand on he that be fatal for kurt because in he fury he forget glidden 's comrade in one second he big hand wrench a yell of mortal pain out of glidden then a combined attack of the other render kurt powerless a blow on the head stun he -- make all dark chapter xv it seem that kurt do not altogether lose consciousness for he have vague sensation of be drag along the ground presently the darkness clear from he mind and he open he eye he lay on he back look up he see star through the thin broken cloud of smoke a huge pile of railroad tie loom up beside he he try to take note of he situation he hand be tie in front of he not so securely he imagine that he could not work they free he leg have not be tie both he head and shoulder on the left side pained he severely upon look around kurt presently make out the dark form of a man he appear rigid with attention but that evidently have no relation to kurt the man be listen and watch for he comrade kurt hear no voice or shot after a little while however he think he hear distant footstep on the gravel he hardly know what to make of he predicament if there be only one guard over he escape do not seem difficult unless that guard have a gun hello you he call hello yourself reply the man jerk up in evident surprise what be you name inquire kurt amiably well it be not jj hill or anderson come the gruff response kurt laugh but you would be one of those name if you could now would not you go on kurt my name be dennis gloomily return the man it certainly be _ that _ be the name of all iww 's say kurt say be you the fellow who have the shot-gun i sure be reply kurt i ought to knock you on the head why because i 'll have to eat stand up for a month yes query kurt the seat of my pants must have make a good target for you sure paste it full of birdshot kurt smother a laugh then he feel the old anger leap up do not you burn my wheat be you that young dorn yes i be reply kurt hotly well i do not burn one

you be american that be why well i know i be but i can be american and travel with a labor union can not i no this iww be no labor union it never be they very first rule be to abolish capital they be anarchist and now they be back by german money the iww be a enemy to america all this hamper of railroad destruction of timber and wheat be a aid to germany in the war the united state be at war my god man can not you see it be you own country that must suffer for such deal as this wheat-burning to-night the hell you say ejaculate the man in amaze this glidden be a german agent -- perhaps a spy he be no labor leader what do he care for the interest of such man as you young man if you do not shut up you 'll give I a hankering to go back to real work i hope i do let I give you a hunch throw down this iww outfit go to ruxton and get anderson of ` many water ' ranch to give you a job tell he who you be and that i send you anderson of ` many water ' hey well maybe it 'll surprise you to know that glidden be operate there have a lot of man there and be go there from here no it do not surprise I i hope he do go there for if he do he 'll get kill sssssh whisper the guard here come some of the gang kurt hear low voice and soft footfall some dark form loom up bradford have he come to yet query the brutal voice of glidden nope reply the guard i guess he have a hard knock he be never budge we have get to beat it out of here say glidden it be long after midnight there be a freight-train down the track i want all the gang to board it you run along bradford and catch up with the other what be you go to do with this young fellow query bradford curiously that be none of you business return glidden maybe not but i reckon i 'll ask anyhow you want I to join you iww and i be ask question labor strike -- stand up for you rights -- be one thing and burning wheat or slugging young farmer be another be you go to let this dorn go kurt could plainly see the group of five man bradford standing over the smaller glidden and the other string and silent in the intensity of the moment i 'll cut he throat hiss glidden bradford lunge heavily the blow he strike glidden be square in the face glidden would have have a hard fall but for the obstruction in the shape of he comrade upon whom he be knock they hold he up glidden sag inertly evidently stunned or unconscious bradford back guardedly away out of they reach then wheeling he begin to run with heavy plodding stride glidden 's comrade seem anxiously hold he up peer at he but no one speak kurt see he opportunity with one strong wrench he free he hand feel in he pocket for he gun he be disturb to find that it have be take he have no weapon but he do not hesitate bound up he rush like a hurricane upon the unprepared group he see glidden 's pale face uphold to the light of the star and by it see that glidden be recover with all he might kurt swing as he rush and the blow he give the iww leader far exceed bradford 's glidden be lift so powerfully against one of he man that they both fall then kurt striking right and leave beat down the other two and leap over they he bound away into the darkness shrill pierce yell behind he lend he wing but he run right into another group of iww man dozen in number he think and by the light of what appear to be a fire they see he as quickly as he see they the yell behind be significant enough kurt have to turn to run back and he have to run the gauntlet of the man he have assault they promptly begin to shoot at kurt the whistle of lead be uncomfortably close never have he run so fleetly when he flash past the end of the line of car into comparative open he find himself in the light of a new fire this be a shed perhaps a score of rod or less from the station some one be yell beyond this and kurt think he recognize jerry 's voice but he do not tarry to make sure bullet scatter the gravel ahead of he and singing around he head and hoarse cry behind with a heavy-booted tread of pursuer give kurt occasion to hurry he fly across the freight-yard intend to distance he pursuer then circle round the station to the village once he look back the gang well spread out be not far behind he just come into the light of the new fire no one in it could ever catch he of that kurt be sure suddenly a powerful puff of air like a blast of wind seem to lift he at the same instant a dazzling blinding yellow blaze illuminate the whole scene the solid earth seem to rock under kurt 's fly foot and then a terrific roar appal he he be throw headlong through the air and all about he seem streak and ray and burst of fire he alight to plow through the dirt until the momentum of force have be expend then he lay prone gasping and choke almost blind but sensitive to the rain of gravel and debris the fearful cry of terrify man taste of smoke and dust and the rank smell of explode gasoline kurt get up to grope he way through the murky darkness he could escape now if that explosion have not kill he pursuer it have certainly scare they off he hear man run and yell off to the leave a rumble of a train come from below the village finally kurt get clear of the smoke to find that he have wander off into one of the field opposite the station here he halt to rest a little and to take cognizance of he condition it surprise he to find out that he be only bruised scratch and sore he have expect to find himself full of bullet whew they blow up the gasoline-shed he soliloquize but some of they miscalculate for if i do not lose my guess there be a bunch of iww closer to that gasoline than i be some adventure i get another punch at glidden i feel it in my bone that i would get a crack at he oh for another and that bradford he do make I think how he slug glidden good good there be you old american spirit come out kurt sit down to rest and to listen he find he need a rest the only sound he hear be the rumble of a train gradually draw away a heavy smoke rise from the freight-yard but there be no longer any blaze or patch of red fire perhaps the explosion have smother all the flame it have be a rather strenuous evening he reflect a good deal of satisfaction lay in the fact that he have severely punish some of the iww member if he have not do away with any of they when he think of glidden however he do not feel any satisfaction he fury be go but in its place be a strong judgment that such man should be make example he certainly do not want to run across glidden again because if he do he would have blood on he hand kurt 's chance meeting with the man bradford seem far the most interesting if not thrilling incident of the evening it open up a new point of view how many of the man of that motley and ill-governed iww have grievance like bradford 's perhaps there be many kurt try to remember instance when in the northwest wheat country laborer and farmer have be cheat or deceive by man of large interest it make he grave to discover that he could recall many such instance he own father have long nurse a grievance against anderson neuman he father 's friend have a hard name and there be many who have profit by the misfortune of other that after all be a condition of life he take it for grant then that all member of the iww be not vicious or dishonest he be glad to have this proof the iww have be organize by labor agitator and they be the one to blame and they punishment should be severest kurt begin to see where the war cruel as it would be be go to be of immeasurable benefit to the country it amaze kurt presently to note that dawn be at hand he wait awhile longer want to be sure not to meet any linger member of the iww it appear indeed that they have all go he cross the freight-yard a black ruin still smolder lay where the elevator have be that wonderful wheat yield of he have be destroy in the gray dawn it be hard to realize he feel a lump in he throat several track be litter with the remains of burn freight-car when kurt reach the street he see man in front of the cottage some one hail he and then several shout they meet he half-way jerry and olsen be in the party we be pretty much scare say jerry and he haggard face show he anxiety boy we think the iww have make off with you add olsen extend he hand not much where be they reply kurt go on a freight-train when jerry blow up the gasoline-shed that fix the iww jerry do you do that query kurt i reckon well you nearly blow I off the map i be run just below the shed when that explosion come i be lift and throw a mile think i would never light so far as we can tell nobody be kill say olsen some of we fellow have get bullet-hole to nurse but no one be bad hurt that be good i guess we come out lucky reply kurt you must have have some fight runnin ' off that way after the iww 's we hear you shootin ' a ' the iww 's yellin ' that part be fun tell we what happen to you so kurt have to narrate he experience from the time he steal off with the big shot-gun until he friend see he again it make rather a long story which manifestly be of exceed interest to the villager dorn say one of the man you a ' jerry save this here village from bein ' burn we all have a share i be sure glad they be go now what damage be do it turn out that there have be little hurt to the property of the villager some freight-car full of barley load and bill by the railroad people have be burn and this loss of grain would probably be pay for by the company the loss of wheat would fall upon kurt in the haste of that great harvest and its transportation to the village no provision have be make for loss the railroad company have not accept he wheat for transportation and be not liable olsen accord to we agreement i owe you fifteen thousand dollar say kurt yes but forget it reply olsen you be the loser here i 'll pay it reply kurt but boy you be ruin ejaculate the farmer you can not pay that big price now a ' we do not expect it do not you leave you burning field to come help we save ours query kurt sure but there be not much of mine to burn and so do many of the other man who come to help i tell you olsen that mean a great deal to I i 'll pay my debt or -- or -- but how can you interrupted olsen reasonably sometime when you raise another crop like this year then you could pay the farm will bring that much more than i owe anderson you 'll give up the farm exclaim olsen yes i 'll square myself dorn we will not take that money say the farmer deliberately you 'll have to take it i 'll send you a check soon -- perhaps to-morrow give up you land repeat olsen why that be unheard of land in you family so many year what will you do olsen i wait for the draft just on account of my father if it have not be for he i would have enlist anyway i be go to war that silence the little group of grimy-faced man jerry get we horse and we 'll ride home say kurt the tall foreman stride off kurt sense something poignant in the feeling of the man especially olsen this matter of the iww deal have bring kurt and he neighbor closer together and he think it a good opportunity for a few word about the united state and the war and germany so he launch forth into a eloquent expression of some of he conviction he be still talk when jerry return with the horse at length he break off rather abruptly and say good-by he mount hold on kurt call olsen and leave the group to lay a hand on the horse and to speak low what you say strike I deep it apply pretty hard to we of the bend we have always be farmer with no thought of country a ' that be because we leave we native country to come here i be not german a ' i have never be for germany but many of my neighbor a ' friend be german this war never have come close till now i know german in this country they have leave they fatherland a ' they be lose to that fatherland it may take some time to stir they up to make they see but the day will come take my word for it dorn the german-american of the northwest when it come to a pinch will find themselves a ' be true to the country they have adopt chapter xvi the sun be up broad and bright burning over the darkened wheat-field when kurt and jerry reach home kurt have never see the farm look like that -- ugly and black and bare but the fallow ground hundred of acre of it billow away to the south have not suffer any change of color or beauty to kurt it seem to smile at he to bid he wait for another spring and that thought be poignant for he remember he must leave at once for many water he find when he come to wash the blood and dirt from he person that he bruise be many there be a lump on he head and he hand be skin after change he clothes and pack a few thing in a valise along with he papers he go down to breakfast though preoccupy in mind he gather that both the old housekeeper and jerry be surprised and dismayed to see he ready to leave he have make no mention of he intention and it strike he that this somehow be go to be hard indeed when the moment come he find that speech be difficult and he voice not natural martha -- jerry -- i be go away for good he say huskily i mean to make over the farm to mr anderson i 'll leave you in charge here -- and recommend that you be keep on here 's you money up to date i be go away to the war -- and the chance be i 'll never come back the old housekeeper who have be like a mother to he for many year begin to cry and jerry struggle with a regret that he could not speak abruptly kurt leave they and hurry out of the house how strange that difficult feeling have arise -- emotion he have never consider at all but the truth be that he be leave he home forever all be explain in that first he go to the grave of he father and mother out on the south slope where there be always wind and sun the fire have not desecrate the simple burying-ground there be no grass but a few tree and bush keep it from appear bare kurt sit down in the shade near he mother 's grave and look away across the hill with dim eye something come to he -- a subtle assurance that he mother approve of he go to war kurt remember she -- slow quiet patient hard-working dominate by he father the slope be hot and still with only a rustling of leaf in the wind the air be dry kurt miss the sweet fragrance of wheat what odor there be seem to be like that of burn weed the great undulating open of the bend extend on three side he parent have spend the best of they life there and have now be take to the bosom of the soil they love it seem natural many be the last resting-place of toiler of the wheat there on those hill and surely in the long frontier day and in the age before man innumerable have go back to the earth from which they have spring the dwelling-place of man be beautiful it be only life that be sad in this poignant revealing hour kurt could not resist human longing and regret though he gain incalculable strength from these two grave on the windy slope it be not for any man to understand to the uttermost the meaning of life \* \* \* \* \* when he leave he make he way across some of the fallow land and some of the stubble field that have yield alas so futilely such abundant harvest he boyhood day come back to he when he use to crush down the stubble with he bare foot every rod of the way reveal some memory he go into the barn and climb into the huge airy loft it smell of straw and year of dust and mouse the swallow dart in and out twitter how friendly they be year after year they have return to they nest -- the young bird return to the home of the old home even for bird be a thing of first and vital importance it be a very old barn that have not many more useful year to stand kurt decide that he would advise that it be strengthen there be hole in the rough shingling and board be off the side in the corner and on the rafter be a accumulation of grain dust as thick as snow mouse run in and out almost as tame as the swallow he seem to be take leave of they he recall that he use to chase and trap mouse with all a boy 's savage ingenuity but that boyish instinct along with so many thing so potential then be go now best of all he love the horse most of these be old and have give faithful service for many year indeed there be one -- old badge -- that have carry kurt when he be a boy once he and a neighbor boy have go to the pasture to fetch home the cow old badge be there and nothing would do but that they ride he from the fence kurt mount to he broad back then the neighbor boy full of the devil have strike old badge with a stick the horse set off at a gallop for home with kurt frantically hold on bounce up and down on he back that have be the ride of kurt 's life he father have whip he too for the adventure how strangely vivid and thought-compelling be these ordinary adjunct to he life there on the farm it be only upon give they up that he discover they real mean the hill of bare fallow and of yellow slope the old barn with its horse swallow mouse and odorous loft the cow and chicken -- these appear to kurt in the illuminating light of farewell in they true relation to he for they and the labor of they have make he what he be slowly he go back to the old house and climb the stair only three room be there up-stair and one of these he mother 's have not be open for a long time it seem just the same as when he use to go to she with he stubbed toe and he trouble she have die in that room and now he be a man go out to fight for he country how strange why in he mother 's room he could not answer that puzzling question it sting he and with a last look a good-by and a word of prayer on he lip he turn to he own little room he enter and sit down on the bed it be small with the slope of the roof run down so low that he have learn to stoop when close to the wall there be no ceiling bare yellow rafter and dark old shingle show he could see light through more than one little hole the window be small low and without glass how many time he have sit there lean out in the hot dusk of summer night dream dream that be never to come true alas for the hope and illusion of boyhood so long as he could remember this room be most closely associate with he action and he thought it be a part of he he almost take it into he confidence as if it be human never have he become what he have dare to dream he would yet somehow at that moment he be not ashamed it strike he then what few belongings he really have but he have be teach to get along with little living in that room be over for he he be fill with unutterable sadness yet he would not have have it any different bigger and selfless thing call to he he be bid farewell to he youth and all that it related to a solemn procession of beautiful memory pass through he mind bear of the night there in that room of he boyhood with the wind at the eaves and the rain pattering on the shingle what strong and vivid picture no grief no pain no war could rob he of this best heritage from the past he get up to go and then a blinding rush of tear burn he eye this room seem dearer than all the rest of he home it be hard to leave he last look be magnify transform good-by he whisper with a swell constriction in he throat at the head of the dark old stairway he pause a moment and then with bow head he slowly descend chapter xvii a August twilight settle softly down over many water while lenore anderson dreamily gaze from she window out over the darken field so tranquil now after the day 's harvest toil of late in thoughtful hour such as this she have become conscious of strain of longing she have fight out a battle with herself have confess she love for kurt dorn and surrender to the enchantment of that truth have feel she love grow with every thought of he and every beat of a thrilling pulse in spite of a longing that amount to pain and a nameless dread she could not deny she be happy and she wait with a

magnificent lenore have she chance then but she be absolutely unable to grasp it she blood beat thick and hot if she could only have be sure of herself or be it that she still care too much for herself the moment have not come and in she tumult there be a fleeting fury at dorn 's blindness at he reverence of she that he dare not touch she hand do he imagine she be stone let we say good night she say you be wear out and i be -- not just myself to-morrow we 'll be -- good friend father will take you to you room dorn press the hand she offer and say good-night he follow she to the hall

she heart quake she gaze down upon he with all she soul in she eye she know it and do not care but he could not see good night kurt dorn she call and run to she room composure do not come to she until she be ready for bed with the light out and in she old seat at the window night and silence and starlight always lend lenore strength she pray to they now and to the spirit she know dwelt beyond they and then she whisper what she intelligence tell she be a unalterable fact -- kurt dorn could never be change but she sympathy and love and passion all that be womanly emotion storm at she intelligence and refuse to listen to it nothing short of a great shock would divert dorn from he tragic headlong rush toward the fate he believe unalterable lenore sense a terrible sinister earnestness in he she could not divine its meaning but it be such a drive passion that no man possess it and free to the violence of war could ever escape death even if by superhuman strife and the guidance of providence he do escape death he would have lose something as precious as life if dorn go to war at all -- if he ever reach those blood-red trench in the thick of fire and shriek and ferocity -- there to express in horrible earnestness what she vaguely feel yet could not define -- then so far as she be concern she imagine that she would not want he to come back that be the strength of spirit that breathe out of the night and the silence to she dorn would go to war as no ordinary soldier to obey to fight to do he duty but for some strange unfathomable obsession of he own and therefore if he go at all he be lose war in its inexplicable horror kill the soul of endless horde of man therefore if he go at all she too be lose to the happiness that might have be hers she would never love another man she could never marry she would never have a child so he soul and she happiness be in the balance weigh against a woman 's power it seem to lenore that she feel hopelessly unable to carry the issue to victory and yet on the other hand a tumultuous and wonderful sweetness of sensation call to she insidiously of the infallible potency of love what could she do to save dorn 's life and he soul there be only one answer to that she would do anything she must make he love she to the extent that he would have no will to carry out this desperate intent there be little time to do that the gradual growth of affection through intimacy and understanding be not possible here it must come as a flash of lightning she must bewilder he with the revelation of she love and then by all its incalculable power hold he there it be she father 's wish it would be the salvation of dorn it mean all to she but if to keep he there would make he a slacker lenore swear she would die before lift she lip to he the government would rather he stay to raise wheat than go out and fight man lenore see the sanity the cardinal importance of that as she father see it so from all side she be justified and sit there in the darkness and silence with the cool wind in she face she vow she would be all woman all sweetness all love all passion all that be feminine and terrible to keep dorn from go to war chapter xix

anderson take out a whistle and blow such a shrill blast that it deafen lenore and must have be hear all over the harvest-field not improbably that be a signal agree upon between anderson and he man lenore gather that all have be in readiness for a concerted movement and that she father believe dorn 's action have bring the climax have not i see you before query dorn sharply the man shake he head

easily he have set he heart upon hold this capable young man in the great interest of the wheat business lenore could not understand why she be not pray that he be successful but she be not it be inexplicable and puzzling -- this change in she -- this end of she selfishness yet she shrink in terror from a impinging sacrifice she thrust the think from she with passionate physical gesture and

coincide somewhat with mr anderson 's kathleen you would not have I be a slacker ask dorn gently no but we let jim go be she argument dorn kiss she then turn to lenore let 's go out to the field \* \* \* \* \* it be not a long walk to the alfalfa but by the time she get there lenore 's impending woe be as if it have never be dorn seem strangely gay and unusually demonstrative apparently he forget the war-cloud in the joy of the hour that they be walk in the open seem not to matter to he kurt some one will see you lenore remonstrate you be more beautiful than ever to-day he say by way of answer and try to block she way lenore dodge and run she be fleet and elude he down the lane across the cut field to a huge square stack of bale alfalfa but he catch she just as she get behind its welcome covert lenore be far less afraid of he than of laugh eye breathless she back up against the stack you be -- a -- cannibal she pant but she do not make much resistance you be -- a goddess he reply I of what why of ` many water ' goddess of wheat the sweet wave wheat rich and golden -- the very spirit of life if anybody see you -- maul I -- this way -- i 'll not seem a goddess to he my hair be down

clasp he neck and give he kiss for kiss but she surrender make he think of she she feel he effort to let she go lenore 's heart feel too big for she breast it hurt she cling to he hand and they walk on across the field and across a brook up the slope to one of lenore 's favorite seat and there she want to rest she smooth she hair and brush she dress aware of how he watch she with he heart in he eye have there ever in all the year of the life of the earth be so perfect a day how dazzling the sun what heavenly blue the sky and all beneath so gold so green a lark carol over lenore 's head and a quail whistle in the brush below the brook babble and gurgle and murmur along happy under the open sky and a soft breeze bring the low roar of the harvest field and the scent of wheat and dust and straw life seem so stingingly full so poignant so immeasurably worth live so bless with beauty and richness and fruitfulness lenore you eye be window -- and i can see into you soul i can read -- and first i be uplifted and then i be sad it be he who talk and she who listen this glorious day would be she strength when the -- ah but she would not complete a single bitter thought she lead he away up the slope across the barley-field now cut and harvest to the great swell golden space of wheat far below the engine and harvester be hum here the wheat wave and rustle in the wind it be as high as lenore 's head it be fine wheat observe dorn but the wheat of my desert hill be richer more golden and higher than this no regret to-day murmur lenore lean to he there be magic in those word -- the same enchantment that make the hour fly she lead he at will here and there along the rustling-bordered lane from afar they watch the busy harvest scene with eye that linger long on a great glittering combine with its thirty-two horse plod along i can drive they thirty-two horse she assert proudly no yes will you come i will show you it be a temptation he say with a sigh but there be eye there they would break the spell who be talk about eye now she cry they spend the remainder of that day on the windy wheat-slope high up alone with the beauty and richness of many water beneath they and when the sun send its last ruddy and gold ray over the western hill and the weary harvester plod homeward lenore still linger loath to break the spell for on the way home she divine he would tell she he be soon to leave sunset and evening star they beauty and serenity pervade lenore 's soul surely there be a life somewhere else beyond in that infinite space and the defeat of earthly dream be endurable they walk back down the wheat lane hand in hand as dusk shadow the valley and when they reach the house he tell she gently that he must go but -- you will stay to-night she whisper no it be all arrange he reply thickly they be to drive I over -- my train 's due at eight i have keep it -- till the last few minute they go in together we be too late for dinner say lenore but she be not thinking of that and she pause with head bent i -- i want to say good-by to you -- here she point to the dim curtained entrance of the living-room i would like that too he reply i 'll go up and get my bag wait lenore slowly step to that shadow spot beyond the curtain where she have tell she love to dorn and there she stand pray and fight for strength to let he go for power to conceal she pain the one great thing she could do be to show he that she would not stand in the way of he duty to himself she realize then that if he have tell she sooner if he be go to remain one more hour at many water she would break down and beseech he not to leave she she see he come down-stair with he small hand-bag which he set down he face be white he eye burn but she woman 's love make she divine that this be not a shock to he soul as it be to hers but stimulation -- a man 's strange spiritual accounting to he fellow-men he go first into the dining-room and lenore hear she mother 's and sister ' voice in reply to he presently he come out to enter she father 's study lenore listen but hear no sound there outside a motor-car creak and hum by the window to stop by the side porch then the door of she father 's study open and close and dorn come to where she be stand lenore do precisely as she have do a few night before when she have change the world for he but follow she kiss there be a terrible instant when with she arm around he neck she go blind at the realization of loss she hold to he with a savage intensity of possession it be like give up life she know then as never before that she have the power to keep he at she side but a thought save she from exert it -- the thought that she could not make he less than other man -- and so she conquer lenore i want you to think always -- how you love I he say loved you oh my boy it seem you lot have be hard you have toil -- you have lose all -- and now listen he interrupted and she have never hear he voice like that the thousand of boy who go to fight regard it a duty for we country i have that but more my father be german and he be a traitor the horror for I be that i hate what be german in _ I _ i will have to kill that but you have help I i know i be american i 'll do my duty whatever it be i would have go to war only a beast with my soul kill before i ever get there with no hope -- no possibility of return but you love I can not you see -- how great the difference lenore understand and feel it in he happiness yes kurt i know thank god i have help you i want you to go i 'll pray always i believe you will come back to I life could not be so utterly cruel she break off life can not rob I now -- nor death he cry in exaltation i have you love you face will always be with I -- as now -- lovely and brave not a tear and only that sweet smile like a angel 's oh lenore what a girl you be say good-by -- and go she falter another moment would see she weaken yes i must hurry he voice be a whisper -- almost go he draw a deep breath lenore -- my promise wife -- my star for all the black night -- god bless you -- keep you good-by she spend all she strength in she embrace all she soul in the passion of she farewell kiss then she stand alone totter sink the swift step now heavy and uneven pass out of the hall -- the door close -- the motor-car creak and roll away -- the drone hum cease for a moment of despair shock before the storm break lenore blindly waver there unable to move from the spot that have see the beginning and the end of she brief hour of love then she summon strength to drag herself to she room to lock she door alone in the merciful darkness and silence and loneliness she need not lie nor play false nor fool herself here she have let he go inconceivable and monstrous truth for what it be not now with she that deceive spirit which have make she brave but she be a woman she fall upon she knee beside she bed shudder that moment be the beginning of she sacrifice the sacrifice she share in common now with thousand of other woman before she have pity now she suffer and all that be sweet loving noble and motherly -- all that be womanly -- rise to meet the stretch of gray future with its endless suspense and torture fear its face of courage for the light of day its despair for the lonely night and its vague faith in the lesson of life its possible and sustain and eternal hope of god chapter xxiv camp -- _ October _ -- dear sister lenore -- it be be long since i write you i be sorry dear but i have not just be in shape to write have be transfer to a training-camp not far from new york i do not like it the air be raw penetrate different from we high mountain air in the west so many gray gloomy day and wet -- why you never see a rain in washington fine bunch of boy though we get up in the morning at 4:30 sweep the street of the camp i be glad to get up and sweep for i be near frozen long before daylight yesterday i peel potato till my hand be cramp nine million spud i guess i be wear citizen 's clothes -- too thin by gosh -- and sleep in a tent on a canvas cot with one blanket would not care a -- -lrb- scoose I si -rrb- -- i would not mind if i have a real gun and some real fight to look forward to some life i do not think but i mean to tell you why i be here you remember how i always take to cowboy well i get chummy with a big cow puncher from montana he name be andersen be not that queer he name same as mine except for the last e where i have o he be a swede or norwegian true-blue american well i should smile like all cowboy he be six foot four broad as a door with a flat head of a indian and a huge bulge chin not real handsome but say he be one of the finest fellow that ever live we call he montana there be a lot of rough-neck in we outfit and right away i get in bad you know i never be much on hold my temper anyway i get lick powerful fine as dad would say and i would be all beat up but for montana that make we two fast friend and sure some enemy you bet we have the tough luck to run into six of the rough-neck just outside of the little town where they would be drink i never hear the name of one of that outfit we be not acquaint at all strange how they change my soldier career right at the start this day when we meet they they get fresh and of course i have to start something i soaked that rough-neck si and do not you forget it well it be a fight sure i get lay out -- not knock out for i could see -- but i be not any help to pard montana it look as if he do not need any the rough-neck jump he then one after another he pile they up in the road just a swing -- and down go each one -- cold but the fellow i hit come to and grab up a pick-handle with all he might he soak montana over the head what a awful crack montana go down and there be blood everywhere they take montana to the hospital sew up he head it be not long before he seem all right again but he tell I sometimes he feel queer then they put we on a troop-train with boy from californium and all over and we come east i have not see any of those other western boy though since we get here one day without any warn montana keel over down and out paralysis they take he to a hospital in new york no hope the doctor say and he be get worse all the time but some new york surgeon advise operation anyway so they open that healed-over place in he head where the pick-handle hit -- and what do you think they find a splinter off that pick-handle stick two inch under he skull in he brain they take it out every day they expect montana to die but he do not but he _ will _ die i go over to see he he be unconscious part of the time -- crazy the rest no part of he right side move it break I all up why could not that soak he get have be on the kaiser 's head i tell you lenore a fellow have he eye tooth cut in this get ready to go to war it make I sick i enlist to fight not to be chase into a climate that do not agree with I -- not to sweep road and juggle a wooden gun there be a lot of thing but say i have get to cut out that kind of talk i feel almost as far away from you all as if i be in china but i be nearer france i hope you be well and stand pat lenore remember you be dad 's white hope i be the black sheep you know tell he i do not regard my transfer as a disgrace the officer do not and he need not give my love to mother and the girl tell they not to worry maybe the war will be over before -- i 'll write you often now so cheer up you loving brother jim camp -- _ October _ -- my dearest lenore -- if my writing be not very legible it be because my hand shake when i begin this sweet and sacred privilege of write to my promise wife my other letter be short and this be the second in the week since i leave you what a endless time you must understand and forgive I for not write oftener and for not give you definite address i do not want to be in the western regiment for reason hard to understand i enlist in new york and be try hard to get into the rainbow division with some hope of success there be nothing to I in be a member of a crack regiment but it seem that this one will see action first of all american unit i do not want to be a officer either how will it be possible for I to write you as i want to -- letter that will be free of the plague of myself -- letter that you can treasure if i never come back sleep and wake i never forget the wonderful truth of you love for I it do not seem real when i be with you but now that we be separated i know that it be real mostly my mind contain only two thing -- this constant memory of you and that other terrible thing of which i will not speak all else that i think or do seem to be mechanical the work the training be not difficult for I though so many boy find it desperately hard you know i follow a plow and that be real toil right now i see the brown fallow hill and the great square of gold but vision or thought of home be rare that be well for they hurt like a stab i can not think now of a single thing connect with my training here that i want to tell you yet some thing i must tell for instance we have different instructor and naturally some be more forcible than other we have one at whom the boy laugh he tickle they they like he but he be a ordeal for I the reason be that in we first bayonet practice when we rush and thrust a stuff bag he make we yell _ god damn you german -- die _ i do not imagine this to be general practice in army exercise but the fact be he start we that way i can not forget when i begin to charge with a bayonet those word leap silently but terribly to my lip think of this as reality lenore -- a sad and incomprehensible truth in 1917 all in I that be spiritual reasonable all that be once hopeful revolt at this actuality and its meaning but there be another side that dark one which revel in anticipation it be the cave-man in I hide by night wait with a bludgeon to slay i be begin to be strike by the gradual change in my comrade i fancy that i alone have suffer a retrogression i have a deep consciousness of baseness that be go to keep I aloof from they i seem to be alone with my own soul yet i seem to be abnormally keen to impression i feel what be go on in the soldier ' mind and it shock I set I wonder force I to doubt myself i keep say it must be my peculiar way of look at thing lenore i remember you appeal to I shall i ever forget you sweet face -- you sad eye when you bid I hope in god -- i be try but i do not see god yet perhaps that be because of my morbidness -- my limitation perhaps i will face he over there when i go down into the valley of the shadow one thing however i do begin to see be that there be a divinity in man slowly something divine be reveal itself to I to give up work property friend sister mother home sweetheart to sacrifice all and go out to fight for country for honor -- that indeed be divine it be beautiful it inspire a man and lift he head but alas if he be a think man when he come in contact with the actual physical preparation for war he find that the divinity be the hour of he sacrifice and that to become a good soldier he must change forget grow hard strong merciless brutal humorous and callous all of which be to say base i see boy who be tender-hearted who love life who be bear sufferer who can not inflict pain how many silent cry of protest of wonder of agony must go up in the night over this camp the sum of they would be monstrous the sound of they if voice would be a clarion blast to the world it be sacrifice that be divine and not the making of a efficient soldier i shall write you endlessly the action of write relieve I i feel less burden now sometimes i can not bear the burden of all this unintelligible consciousness my mind be not large enough sometimes i feel that i be go to be every soldier and every enemy -- each one in he strife or he drift or he agony or he death but despite that feeling i seem alone in a horde i make no friend i have no way to pass my leisure but write i can hardly read at all when off duty the boy amuse themselves in a hundred way -- go to town the theater and movie chase the girl -lrb- especially that to judge by they talk -rrb- play boxing game and i be sorry to add many of they gamble and drink but i can not do any of these thing i can not forget what i be here for i can not forget that i be training to kill man never do i forget that soon i will face death what a terrible strange vague thrill that send shiver over I amusement and forgetfulness be past for kurt dorn i be concern with my soul i be fight that black passion which make of I a sleepless watcher and thinker if this war only let I live long enough to understand its meaning perhaps that meaning will be the meaning of life in which case i be longing for the unattainable but underneath it all must be a colossal movement of evolution of spiritual growth -- or of retrogression who know when i ask myself what i be go to fight for i answer -- for my country as a patriot -- for my hate as a individual my time be almost up i go on duty the rain be roar on the thin roof how it rain in this east whole day and night it pour i can not help but think of my desert hill always so barren and yellow with the dust-clouds whirling one day of this rain useless and waste here would have save the bend crop of wheat nature be almost as inscrutable as god lenore good-by for this time think of I but not as lonely or unhappy or uncomfortable out there in the cold raw black wet night i will be neither some one -- a spirit -- will keep beside I as i step the beat i have put unhappiness behind I and no rain or mud or chill will ever feaze I yours with love kurt dorn camp -- _ October _ -- dear sister lenore

for either this morning i do my wash of the past two week and i be so busy that i do not hear the bugle blow and thereby get on the black book which mean that i will not get any time off soon before i forget lenore let I tell you that i have take ten thousand dollar ' life insurance from the government in you favor as beneficiary this cost I only about six and a half dollar per month and in case of my death -- well i be a soldier now please tell rise i have take a fifty-dollar liberty bond of the new issue for she this i be pay at the rate of five dollar per month and it will be deliver to she at the end of ten month both of these of course i be pay out of my government pay as a soldier the money dad send I i spend like water lend to the boy throw away tell he not to send I any more tell he the time have come for jim anderson to make good i have a rich dad and he be the best dad any harum-scarum boy ever have i be go to prove more than one thing this trip we hear so many rumor and none of they ever come true one of they be funny -- that we have so many rich man with political influence in we regiment that we will never get to france be not that the limit but it be funny because if we have rich man i would like to see they still there be thirty thousand soldier here and in my neck of the wood such rumor be laugh and cuss at we hear also that we be go to be order south i wish that would come true it be so cold and drab and muddy and monotonous my friend montana fool everybody he do not die he seem to be hang on lately he recover consciousness tell I he have no feeling on he left side except sometimes he hand itch you know like prickly needle but montana will never be any good again that fine big cowboy he be be one grand soldier it sicken I sometimes to think of the difference between what thrill I about this war game and what we get maybe though -- there go my call i must close love to all jim new york city _ October _ -- dearest lenore -- it seem about time that i have a letter from you i be sure letter be on the way but they do not come quickly the boy complain of the mail service be not it strange that there be not a soul to write I except you jeff my farm-hand will write I whenever i write he which i have not do yet i be on duty here in new york at a armory bazaar it be certainly the irony of fate why do the officer pick on I i would like to know but i have never complain of a order so far and i be stand it several of we -- and they choose the husky boy -- have be send over here for absolutely no purpose that i can see except to exhibit ourselves in uniform it be a woman 's bazaar to raise money for war-relief work and so on the hall be almost as large as that field back of you house and every night it be pack with people mostly young my comrade be have fun out of it but i feel like a fish out of water just the same lenore i be learn more every day if i be not so disgusted i would think this be a wonderful opportunity as it be i regard it only as a experience over which i have no control and that interest I in spite of myself new york be a awful place -- endless narrow torn-up street crowd with hurry throng taxicab car and full of noise and dust i be always choke for air and these street reek where do the people come from and where be they go they look wild as if they have to go somewhere but do not know where that be i have no time or inclination to see new york though under happier circumstance i think i would like to people in the east seem strange to I still as i never mingle with many people in the west i can not say truly whether eastern people be different from western people but i think so anyway while i be in spokane portland san francisco and lo angele i do not think people be greatly concern about the war denver people appear not to realize there be a war but here in new york everything be war you can not escape it you see that war will soon obsess rich and poor alien and neutral and belligerent pacifist and militarist since i write you last i have try to read the newspaper send to we it be hard to tell you which make I the sicker -- the prattle of the pacifist or the mathematics of the military expert both miss the spirit of man neither have any soul i think the german mind must all be mathematical but i want to write about the woman and girl i see here in new york in the camp and town on the train everywhere lenore the war have throw they off they balance i have see and study at close hand woman of all class believe I as the boy say i have think more than twice whether or not i would tell you the stark truth but somehow i be impel to i have a overwhelming conviction that all american girl and mother should know what the truth be they will never be tell lenore and most would never believe if they be tell and that be one thing wrong with people i believe every soldier from the time he enlist until the war be end should be keep away from woman this be a sweeping statement and you must take into account the mind of he who make it but i be not leap at conclusion the soldier boy have terrible peril face they long before they get to the trench not all or nearly all the soldier be go to be vitally affect by the rottenness of great city or by the mushroom hotbed of vice spring up near the camp these evil exist and be be oppose by military and government by police and ymca and good influence of good people but they will never wholly stamp it out nor do i want to say much about the society woman who be rush the officer there may be one here and there with she heart in the right place but with most of they it must be first this something about war that have unbalanced woman and secondly a fad a novelty a new sentimental stunt a fashion set by some leader likewise i want to say but little about the horde of common street-chasing rattled-brained woman and girl who lie in wait for soldier at every corner so to speak all these to be sure may be unconsciously actuate by motive that do not appear on the surface and if this be true they action be less bold less raw than they look what i want to dwell upon be my impression of something strange unbalanced incomprehensible about the frank conduct of so many well-educated refined and good woman i see and about the eagerness restlessness the singular response of nice girl to situation that be not natural to-night a handsome stylishly gown woman of about thirty come up to I with a radiant smile and a strange brightness in she eye there be five hundred couple dance on the floor and the music and sound of slide foot make it difficult to hear she she say : you handsome soldier boy come dance with I i reply politely that i do not dance then she take hold of I and say i 'll teach you i see a wedding-ring on the hand she lay on my arm then i look straight at she madam very soon i 'll be learn the dance of death over in france and my mind 's concern with that she grow red with anger she seem amaze and she snap well you _ be _ a queer soldier later i watch she flirt and dance with a officer overture and advance innumerable have be make to I range from the assure possession-taking onslaught like this woman 's to the slight subtle something feel more than see of a more complex nature and lenore i blush to tell you this but i have be mob by girl they have a thousand way of let a soldier _ know _ i could not begin to tell they but i do not actually realize what it be that be convey that i know and i be positive the very large majority of soldier _ misunderstand _ at night i listen to the talk of my comrade and well -- if the girl only hear many time i go out of hearing and when i can not do that i refuse to hear lenore i be talk about nice girl now i be merciless there be many girl like you -- they seem like you though none so pretty i mean you know there be certain manners and distinction that at once mark a really nice girl for a month i have be throw here and there so that it seem i have see as many girl as soldier i have be send to different entertainment give for soldier at one place a woman get up and invite the girl to ask the boy to dance at another a crowd of girl be line up wear different ribbon and the boy march along until each one find the girl wear a ribbon to match the one he wear that be he partner it be interesting to see the eager mischievous brooding eye of these girl as they watch and wait just as interesting be it to see this boy 's face when he find he partner be ugly and that boy swell with pride when he find he have pick a winner it be all adventure for both boy and girl but i see more than that in it whenever i could not avoid meet a girl i try to be agreeable and to talk about war and soldier and what be go on i do not dance of course and i imagine more than one girl find I a queer soldier it always have touch I though to see and feel the sweetness graciousness sympathy kindness and that other indefinable something in the girl i have meet how they make I think of you lenore no doubt about they heart they loyalty they americanism every soldier who go to france can fight for some girl they make you feel that i believe i have go deeper than most soldier in consider what i will call war-relation of the sex if it be normal then underneath it all be a tremendous inscrutable design of nature or god if that be true actually true then war must be inevitable and right how horrible my thought confound I sometimes anyway the point i want to make be this : i hear a officer tell a irate father whose two daughter have be insult by soldier : my dear sir it be regrettable these man will be punish but they be not greatly to blame because so many girl throw themselves at they head you daughter do not of course but they should not have come here that illustrate the fixed idea of the military all through the rank -- _ woman throw themselves at soldier _ it be true that they do but the idea be false nevertheless because the mass of girl be misunderstand misunderstand -- i can tell you why surely the mass of american girl be nice fine sweet wholesome they be young the news of war liberate something in they that we can find no name for but it must be noble a soldier the very name from childhood be one to make a girl thrill what then the actual thing the uniform invest somehow with chivalry and courage the clean-cut athletic young man somber and fascinating with he intent eye he serious brow or he devil-may-care gallantry the compelling presence of he that breathe of he sacrifice of he near departure to privation to squalid comfortless trench to the fire and hell of war to blood and agony and death -- in a word to fight fight fight for woman so through this beautiful emotion woman lose they balance and many be misunderstand those who would not and could not be bold be susceptible to advance that in a ordinary time would not affect they war invest a soldier with a glamour love at first sight flirtation rash intimacy quick engagement immediate marriage the soldier who be soon go away to fight and perhaps to die strike hard at the very heart of a girl either she be not she real self then or else she be suddenly transport to a womanhood that be instinctive elemental universal for the future she feel what she do not know she surrender because there be a imperative call to the depths of she nature she sacrifice because she be the inspiritor of the soldier the reward for he loss the savior of the race if woman be the spoil of barbarous conqueror they be also the sinew the strength the soul of defender and so however you look at it war mean for woman sacrifice disillusion heartbreak agony doom i feel that so powerfully that i be overcome i be sick at the gaiety and play i be full of fear wonder admiration and hopeless pity for they no man can tell what be go on in the soul of soldier while noble woman be offer love and tenderness throw themselves upon the altar of war hope blindly to send they great spirit march to the front perhaps the man who live through the war will feel the change in he soul if he can not tell it day by day i think i see a change in my comrade as they grow physically stronger they seem to grow spiritually lesser but maybe that be only my idea i see evidence of fear anger sullenness moodiness shame i see a grow indifference to fatigue toil pain as these boy harden physically they harden mentally always ` way off there be the war and that seem closely related to the near duty here -- what it take to make a man these fellow will measure man differently after this experience with sacrifice obedience labor and pain in that they will become great but i do not think these thing stimulate a man 's mind change be go on in I some of which i be unable to define for instance physically i be much bigger and stronger than i be i weigh one hundred and eighty pound as for my mind something be always tug at it i feel that it grow tired it want to forget in spite of my will all of these keen desire of mine to know everything lag and fail often and i catch myself drift i see and feel and hear without think i be only a animal then at these time sight of blood or a fight or a plunge horse or a broken leg -- and these sight be common -- affect I little until i be quicken and think about the meaning of it all at such moment i have a revulsion of feeling with memory come a revolt and so on until i be the distressed inquisitive and morbid person i be now i shudder at what war will make I actual contact with earth explode gun fight comrade striking foe will make brute of we all it be wrong to shed another man 's blood if life be mean for that why do we have progress i can not reconcile a god with all this horror i have misgiving about my mind if i feel so acutely here in safety and comfort what shall i feel over there in peril and agony i fear i shall laugh at death oh lenore consider that to laugh in the ghastly face of death if i yield utterly to a fiendish joy of bloody combat then my mind will fail and that in itself would be evidence of god i do not read over my letter to you i just write forgive I if they be not happier every hour i think of you at night i see you face in the shadow of the tent wall and i love you unutterably faithfully kurt dorn camp -- _ November _ -- dear sister -- it be bad news i have get for you this time something bid I tell you though up to now i have keep unpleasant fact to myself the weather have knock I out my

father shake he head dubiously that be not like jim but make no other comment mr anderson sigh the young sister be not give to worry lenore however be haunt by a unwritten meaning in she brother 's letter week before she have write to dorn and tell he to hunt up jim no reply have yet come from dorn every day augment she uneasiness until it be dreadful to look for letter that do not come all this fortify she however to expect calamity like a bolt out of the clear sky it come in the shape of a telegram from camp -- say that jim be die the shock prostrate the mother jim have be she favorite mr anderson leave at once for the east lenore have the care of she mother and the management of many water on she hand which duty keep she mercifully occupy mr anderson however after a day rally surprisingly lenore sense in she mother the strength of the spirit that sacrifice to a noble and universal cause it seem to be mr anderson 's conviction that jim have be shoot or injure by accident in gun-training or at least by a horse lenore do not share she mother 's idea and be reluctant to dispel it on the evening of the fifth day after mr anderson 's departure a message come say that he have arrive too late to see jim alive mr anderson bear the news bravely though she weaken perceptibly the family wait then for further news none come day after day pass then one evening while lenore stroll in the gloaming kathleen come run to burst out with the announcement of they father 's arrival he have telephone from vale for a car to meet he not long after that lenore who have go to she room hear the return of the car and recognize she father 's voice she run down in time to see he be embrace by the girl and she mother lean with bow head on he shoulder yes i fetch jim -- back he say steadily

home he say with a heavy expulsion of breath i want to clean up a ' have a bite to eat \* \* \* \* \* lenore be so disappointed at fail to hear from dorn that she do not think how singular it be she father do not tell more about jim later he seem more like himself and tell they simply that jim have contract pneumonia and die without any message for he folk at home this prostrated mr anderson again later lenore seek she father in he room he could not conceal from she that he have something heartrending on he mind then there be more than tragedy in he expression lenore feel a leap of fear at what seem she father 's hidden anger she appeal to he -- importune he plainer it come to she that he want to relieve himself of a burden then double she persuasion she finally get he to talk lenore it be not be so long ago that right here in this room jim beg I to let he enlist he be not of age but would i let he go -- to fight for the honor of we country -- for the future safety of we home we all feel the boy 's eagerness he fire he patriotism wayward as he be be we suddenly be proud of he we let he go we give he up he be a part of we flesh a ' blood -- send by we anderson -- to do we share anderson pause in he halt speech and swallow hard he white face twitch strangely and he brow be clammy lenore see that he pierce gaze look far beyond she for the instant that he break down jim be a bear fighter the father resume he be not vicious he just have a leanin ' to help anybody as a lad he fight for he little pard -- always on the right side -- a ' he always fight fair this opportunity to train for a soldier make a man of he he would have make he mark in the war strong a ' game a ' fierce he would he would well he be dead -- he be _ dead _ four month after enlistment he be dead a ' he never have a rifle in he hand he never have he hand on a machine-gun or a piece of artillery he never have a uniform he never have a overcoat he never then mr anderson 's voice shake so that he have to stop to gain control lenore be horrify she feel a burning stir within she lemme get this -- out choke anderson he face now livid he vein bulge i be drive to tell it i be near all day locatin ' jim 's company find the tent where he would live it be cold damp muddy jim 's messmate speak high of he call he a prince they all owe he money he have do many a good turn for they he have only a thin blanket a ' he catch cold all the boy have cold one night he give that blanket to a boy sicker than he be next day he get worse there be mile a ' mile of they tent i like to never find the hospital where they would send jim a ' then it be six o'clock in the mornin ' -- a raw bleak day that would freeze one of we to the marrow i have trouble gettin ' in but a soldier go with I a ' -- a ' anderson 's voice go to a whisper and he look pityingly at lenore that hospital be a barn no doctor too early the nurse be not in sight i meet one later a ' poor girl she look ready to drop herself we find jim in one of the little room no heat it be winter there only a bed jim lay on the floor dead he would fall or pitch off the bed he have on only he underclothes that he have on -- when he -- leave home he be stiff -- a ' must have -- be dead -- a good while lenore hold out she tremble hand dead -- jim dead -- like that she falter yes he get pneumonia reply anderson hoarsely the camp be full of it but -- my god be not the -- the poor boy take care of implored lenore faintly it be a terrible time all be do that _ could _ be do then -- it be all -- for nothing all all we boy a ' many like he -- the best blood of we country -- western blood -- dead because because anderson 's voice fail he oh jim oh my brother dead like a poor neglect dog jim -- who enlist to fight -- for -- lenore break down then and hurry away to she room with great difficulty mr anderson be revive and it become manifest that the prop upon which she have lean have be slip from under she the spirit which have make she strong to endure the death of she boy fail when the sordid bald truth of a miserable and horrible waste of life give the lie to the splendid fighting chance jim have dream of when anderson realize that she be fading daily he exhaust himself in long exposition of the illness and injury and death common to army in the make more death come from these cause than from war it be the elision of the weaker element -- the survival of the fittest and some indeed very many mother must lose they son that way the government be sound at the core he claim and he own rage be at the few incompetent and profiteer these must be weed out -- a process that be go on the gigantic task of a government to draft and prepare a great army and navy be something beyond the grasp of ordinary mind anderson talk about what he have see and hear prove the wonderful stride already make but all that he say now make no impression upon mr anderson she have make she supreme sacrifice for a certain end and that be as much the boy 's fiery ambition to fight as it be she duty common with other mother to furnish a man at the front what a hopeless awful sacrifice she sink under it those be try day for lenore just succeed she father 's return and she have little time to think of herself when the mail come day after day without a letter from dorn she feel the pang in she breast grow heavier intimation crowd upon she of impend trouble that would make the present one seem light it be not long until the mother be lay to rest beside the son when that day end lenore and she father face each other in she room where he have always be wont to come for sympathy they gaze at each other with hard dry eye stark-naked truth -- grim reality -- the nature of this catastrophe -- the consciousness of war -- dawn for each in the look of the other brutal shock and then this second exceed bitter woe awaken they mind to the futility of individual life lenore -- it be over he say huskily as he sink into a chair like a nightmare what have i get to live for you have we girl reply lenore and if you do not have we there would be many other for you to live for dad can not you see -- _ now _ i reckon but i be growin ' old a ' mebbe i have quit no dad you 'll never quit suppose all we american quit that would mean a german victory never never never by god you be right he ejaculate with the tremble strain of he face suddenly fix blood and life shot into he eye he get up heavily and begin to stride to and fro before she you see clearer than I you always do lenore i be begin to see but i can not tell you reply lenore close she eye indeed there seem a colossal vision before she veil and strange whatever happen we _ can not _ break it be because of the war we have we task -- greater now than ever we believe

great conception dad add lenore earnestly we be tragically awaken we have be surprise -- terribly strike in the dark something monstrous and horrible i can feel the menace in it for all -- over every family in this broad land lenore you say once that jim -- now how would you know it be all over for he a woman 's heart dad when i say good-by to jim i know it be good-by forever do you feel that way about kurt dorn no he will come back to I i dream it it be in my spirit -- my instinct of life my flesh-and-blood life of the future -- it be in my belief in god kurt dorn 's ordeal will be worse than death for he but i believe as i pray -- that he will come home alive then after all you do hope say she father lenore when i be down east i see what woman be doin ' the bad woman be good a ' the good woman be great i think woman have more to do with war then man even if they do stay home it must be because woman be mother lenore you have buck I up i 'll go at thing now the need for wheat next year will be beyond calculation i 'll buy ten thousand acre of that wheatland round old chri dorn 's farm a ' my shot at the german will be wheat i 'll raise a million bushel \* \* \* \* \* next morning in the mail be a long thick envelope address to lenore in handwriting that shake she heart and make she fly to the seclusion of she room new york city _ November _ -- dearest -- when you receive this i will be in france then lenore sustain a strange shock the beloved handwriting fade the thick sheet of paper fall and all about she seem dark and whirling as the sudden joy and excitement stir by the letter change to sickening pain _ france _ he be in france she whisper oh kurt a storm of love and terror burst over she it have the onset and the advantage of a bewildering surprise it lay low for the moment she fortification of sacrifice strength and resolve she have be force into womanhood and she fear she agony be all the keener for the intelligence and spirit that have repudiate selfish love kurt dorn be in france in the land of the trench strife possess she and have a moment of raw bitter triumph she bite she lip and clench she fist to restrain the impulse to rush madly around the room to scream out she fear and hate with force she thought with hard return to old well-learned argument there come back the nobler emotion but when she take up the letter again with tremble hand she heart flutter high and sick and she see the word through blur eye i 'll give the letter to a ensign who have promise to mail it the moment he get back to new york lenore you letter tell I about jim be hold up in the mail but thank goodness i get it in time i would already be transfer and expect order any day to go on board the transport where i be write now i would have write you or at least telegraph you yesterday after see jim if i have not expect to see he again to-day but this morning we be march on board and i can not even get this letter off to you lenore you brother be a very sick boy i lose some hour find he they do not want to let I see he but i implored -- say that i be engage to he sister -- and finally i get in the nurse be very sympathetic but i do not care for the doctor in charge they seem hard hurry brusque but they have they trouble the hospital be a long barracks and it be full of cripple the nurse take I into a small bare room too damp and cold for a sick man and i say so she just look at I jim look like you more than any other of the anderson i recognize that at the same moment i see how very sick he be they have tell I outside that he have a bad case of pneumonia he be awake perfectly conscious and he stare at I with eye that set my heart go hello jim i say and offer my hand as i sit down on the bed he be too weak to shake hand who be you he ask he could not speak very well when i tell he my name and that i be he sister 's fianc he face change so he do not look like the same person it be beautiful oh it show how homesick he be then i talk a blue streak about you about the girl about many water -- how i lose my wheat and everything he be intensely interested and when i get through he whisper that he guess lenore have pick a winner what do you think of that he be curious about I and ask I question till the nurse make he stop i be never so glad about anything as i be about the happiness it evidently give he to meet I and hear from home i promise to come next day if we do not sail then he show what i must call despair he must have be passionately eager to get to france the nurse drag I out jim call weakly after I : good-by kurt stick some german for I i 'll never forget he tone nor he look lenore he do not expect to get over to france i question the nurse and she shake she head doubtfully she look sad she say jim have be the lion of he regiment i question a doctor and he be annoyed he put I off with a sharp statement that jim be not in danger but i think he be i hope and pray he recover _ Thursday _ we sail yesterday it be a wonderful experience leave hoboken we transport and the dock look as if they have a huge swarm of yellow bee hang over everything the bee be soldier the most profound emotion i ever have -- except the one when you tell I you love I -- come over I as the big boat swing free of the dock -- of the good old we of home i want to jump off and swim through the eddy green water to the pile and hide in they till the boat have go as we back out pull up tug and get start down the river my thrill increase until we pass the statue of liberty -- and then i could not tell how i feel one thing i could not see very well i gaze beyond the colossal statue that france give to the we -- ` way across the water and the ship and the dock toward the west that i be leave feeling like mine then only come once to a man in he life first i seem to see all the vast space the farm valley wood desert river and mountain between I and my golden wheat-hill then i see my home and it be as if i have a magnificent photograph before my very eye a sudden rush of tear blind I such a storm of sweetness regret memory then at last you -- _ you _ as you stand before I last the very loveliest girl in all the world my heart almost burst and in the wild sick pain of the moment i have a strange comforting flash of thought that a man who could leave you must be impel by something great in store for he i feel that i tell you once to laugh at death that be what i shall do but perhaps that be not the great experience which will come to I i see the sun set in the sea ` way back toward the western horizon where the thin dark line that be land disappear in the red glow the wind blow hard the water be rough dark gray and cold i like the taste of the spray we boat roll heavily and many boy be already sick i do not imagine the motion will affect I it be stuffy below-deck i 'll spend what time i can above where i can see and feel it be dark just now when i come below and as i look out into the windy darkness and strife i be strike by the strangeness of the sea and how it seem to be like my soul for a long time i have be look into my soul and i find such ceaseless strife such dark unlit depths such chaos these thought and emotion always with I keep I from get close to my comrade no not I but it keep they away from I i think they regard I strangely they all talk of submarine they be afraid some will lose sleep at night but i never think of a submarine when i gaze out over the tumble black water what i think of what i be go after what i need seem far far away always i be no closer now than when i be at you home so it have not to do with distance and lenore maybe it have not to do with trench or german _ Wednesday _ it grow harder to get a chance to write and harder for I to express myself when i could write i have to work or be on duty when i have a little leisure i be somehow clamp this old chug boat beat the wave hour after hour all day and all night i can feel the vibration when i be asleep many thing happen that would interest you just the duty and play of the soldier for that matter and the story i hear go from lip to lip and the accident oh so much happen but all these rush out of my mind the moment i sit down to write there be something at work in I as vast and heaving as the ocean at first i have a fear a dislike of the ocean but that be go it be indescribable to stand on the open deck at night as we be drive on and on and on -- to look up at the grand silent star that know that understand yet be somehow merciless -- to look out across the starlit move sea its ceaseless movement at first distressed I now i feel that it be perpetually move to try to become still to seek a level to find itself to quiet down to peace but that will never be and i think if the ocean be not like the human heart then what be it like this voyage will be good for I the hard incessant objective life the physical life of a soldier somehow come to a halt on board ship and every hour now be immeasurable for I whatever the mystery of life of death of what drive I of why i can not help fight the demon in I of this thing call war -- the certainty be that these dark strange night on the sea have give I a hope and faith that the truth be not utterly unattainable _ Sunday _ we be in the danger zone now with destroyer around we and a cruiser ahead i be all eye and ear i lose sleep at night from think so hard the ship doctor stop I the other day -- study my face then he say : you be too intense you think too hard be you afraid and i laugh in he face absolutely no i tell he then forget -- and mix with the boy play -- cut up -- fight -- do anything but _ think _ that doctor be a good chap but he do not figure kurt dorn if he imagine the german can kill I by make I think we be near france now and the very air be charge a aeroplane come out to meet we -- welcome we i guess and it fly low the soldier go wild i never have such a thrill that air game would just suit I if i be fit for it but i be no mechanic besides i be too big and heavy my place will be in the front line with a bayonet strange how a bayonet fascinate I they say we can not write home anything about the war i 'll write you something whenever i can do not be unhappy if you do not hear often -- or if my letter cease to come my heart and my mind be full of you whatever come to I -- the training over here -- the go to the trench -- the fighting -- i shall be safe if only i can remember you with love kurt lenore carry that letter in she bosom when she go out to walk in the field to go over the old ground she and kurt have tread hand in hand from the stone seat above the brook she watch the sunset all be still except the murmur of the run water and somehow she could not long bear that as the light begin to shade on the slope she face they feeling as always a strength come to she from they familiar line twilight find she high above the ranch and absolutely alone she would have this lonely hour and then all she mind and energy must go to what she know be imperative duty she would work to the limit of she endurance it be a autumn twilight with a cool wind gray sky and sad barren slope the fertile valley seem half obscure in melancholy haze and over toward the dim hill beyond night have already fall no star no moon no afterglow of sunset illumine the grayness that in this hour seem prophetic of lenore 's future ` safe ' he say ' i shall be safe if only i can remember you ' she whisper to herself wonderingly what do he mean ponder the thought she divine it have to do with dorn 's singular spiritual mood he have go to lend he body as so much physical brawn so much weight to a concerted movement of man but he mind be apart from a harmony with that lenore feel that whatever have be the sacrifice make by kurt dorn it have be pass with he decision to go to war what she pray for then be something of he spirit slowly in the gathering darkness she descend the long slope the approach night seem sad with autumn song of insect all about she breathe faith from the black hill above the gray slope below from the shadowy void from the murmuring of insect life in the grass the rugged fallow ground under she foot seem to she to be a symbol of faith -- faith that winter would come and pass -- the spring sun and rain would burst the seed of wheat -- and another summer would see the golden field of wave grain if she do not live to see they they would be there just the same and so life and nature have faith in its promise that strange whisper be to lenore the whisper of god chapter xxvi through the pale obscurity of a french night cool raw moist with a hint of spring in its freshness a line of soldier plod along the lonely melancholy lane wan starlight show in the rift between the cloud neither dark nor light the midnight hour have its unreality in this line of march man and its reality in the dim vague hedge its spectral post its barren field rain have cease to fall but a fine cold penetrate mist fill the air the ground be muddy in place slippery in other and here and there it hold pool of water ankle-deep the stride of the march man appear short and drag without swing or rhythm it be weary yet full of the latent power of youth of unused vitality stern clean-cut youthful face be set northward unchanging in the shadowy pale gleam of the night these face lift intensely whenever a strange muffle deep-toned roar roll out of the murky north the night look stormy but that rumble be not thunder fifty mile northward beyond that black and mysterious horizon great gun be booming war sometimes as the breeze fail the night be silent except for the slow sloppy tramp of the march soldier then the low voice be hush when the wind freshen again it bring at interval those deep significant detonation which as the hour pass seem to grow heavier and more thunderous at length a faint gray light appear along the eastern sky and gradually grow stronger the dawn of another day be close at hand it break as if reluctantly cold and gray and sunless the detachment of united state troops halt for camp outside of the french village of a -- kurt dorn be at mess with he squad the month in france have fly away on wing of training and absorb and wait dorn have change incalculably but all he realize of it be that he weigh one hundred and ninety pound and that he seem to have live a hundred swift live all that he see and feel become part of he he comrade have be win to he as friend by virtue of he ever-ready help hand by he devotion to training by he close-lipped acceptance of all the toil and knock and pain common to the making of a soldier the squad live together as one large family of brother dorn 's comrade have at first torment he with he german name they have make fun of he abstraction and he letter-writing they have misunderstand he aloofness but the ridicule die away and now in the presaged nature of event he comrade all govern by the physical life of the soldier take he for a man perhaps it might have be chance or it might have be true of all the american squad but the fact be that dorn 's squad be a strangely assorted set of young man perhaps that might have be dorn 's conviction from come to live long with they they be a part of the new york division of the -- th all suppose to be new york man as a matter of fact this be not true dorn be a native of washington sanborn be a thick-set sturdy fellow with the clear brown tan and clear brown eye of the californian brewer be from south carolina a lean lanky southerner with

claim the bronx to be he home and he be proud of it he be little almost undersized but a knot of muscle a keen-faced youth with irish blood in he these particular soldier of the squad be closest to dorn corporal bob owen come swing in to throw he sombrero down what be the order bob some one inquire we be go to rest here he reply the news be take impatiently by several and agreeably by the majority they be all travel-stained and worn dorn do not comment on the news but the fact be that he hate the french village they be so old so dirty so obsolete so different from what he have be accustom to but he love the pastoral french countryside so calm and picturesque he reflect that soon he would see the devastation work by the hun any news from the front asked dixon i should smile reply the corporal grimly well open up you clam owen thereupon tell swiftly and forcibly what he have hear more advance of the german -- it be familiar news but somehow it be take differently here within sound of the gun dorn study he comrade wonder if they sensation be similar to he he express nothing of what he feel but all the other have something to say hard cool fiery violent speech that differ as those who utter it differ yet its predominant note ring fight just hear a funny story say owen presently spring it somebody reply this come from berlin so they say accord to rumor the kaiser and the crown prince seldom talk to each other they happen to meet the other day and the crown prince say : ` say pop what get we into this war ' the emperor reply ` my son i be deluded ' ` oh sire

lawd boy thet be shore funny drawl brewer with he lazy southern manner kurt you be not human say owen sadly that be why they call you demon dorn all the boy in the squad have nickname in dorn 's case several have be apply by irrepressible comrade before one stick the first one receive a poor reception from kurt the second happen to be a great blunder for the soldier who invent it he be not in dorn 's squad but he know dorn pretty well and in a moment of deviltry he have coin for dorn the name kaiser dorn dorn 's reaction to this appellation be discomfiting and painful for the soldier as he lay flat on the ground where dorn have knock he he have struggle with a natural rage quickly to overcome it he show the right kind of spirit he get up dorn i apologize i be only in fun but some fun be about as funny as death on the way out he suggest a more felicitous name -- demon dorn somehow the boy take to that it fit many of dorn 's violent action in training especially the way he make a bayonet charge dorn object strenuously but the name stick no comrade or soldier ever again make a hint of dorn 's german name or blood fellow if a funny story can not make dorn laugh he be absolutely a dead one say owen spring a new one quick speak up some one gee it be great to laugh why i have not hear from home for a month dorn will you beat it so i can spring this one query owen sure reply dorn amiably as he start away i suppose you think I one of these i-dare-you-to-make-me-laugh sort of chap forget she dorn -- come out of it chirp up roger to dorn 's regret he believe that he fail he comrade in one way and he be always try to make up for it part of the training of a soldier be the ever-present need and duty of cheerfulness every member of the squad have he secret he own personal memory he inner consciousness that he strive to keep hidden long ago dorn have divine that this or that comrade be look toward the bright side or pretend there be one they all play they part like man they face this incomprehensible duty this tremendous separation this dark and loom future as if it be only hard work that must be do in good spirit but dorn despite all he will be mostly silent aloof brooding lock up in he eternal strife of mind and soul he could not help it notwithstanding all he see and divine of the sacrifice and pain of he comrade he know that he ordeal be infinitely harder it be natural that they hope for the best he have no hope boy say owen there be a squad of blue devil camp over here in a old barn just back from the front some one say there be not a man in it who have not have a dozen wound and some twice that many we must see that bunch bravest soldier of the whole war they have be through the three year -- at verdun -- on the marne -- and now this awful flander drive it be up to we to see they news like this thrill dorn during all the month he have be in france the deed and valor of these german-named blue devil have come to he here and there and everywhere dorn remember all he hear and believe it too though some of the charge and some of the burden attribute to these famed soldier seem unbelievable he opportunity have now come with the move up to the front he would meet reality and all within he the keen strange eagerness the curiosity that perplex the unintelligible longing the heat and burn of passion quicken and intensify not until late in the afternoon however do off duty present a opportunity for he to go into the village it look the same as the other village he have visit and the inhabitant old man old woman and child all have the somber eye the strained hungry face the oppressed look he have become accustomed to see but sad as be these inhabitant of a village near the front there be never in any one of they any absence of welcome to the american indeed in most people he meet there be a quick flash of intense joy and gratitude the american have come across the sea to fight beside the french that be the import tremendous and beautiful dorn meet dixon and roger on the main street of the little village they have be to see the blue devil better stay away from they advise dixon dubiously no why ejaculate dorn dixon shake he head greatest bunch i ever look at but i think they resent we presence pat and i be talk about they it be strange dorn but i believe these blue devil that have save france and england and perhaps america too do not like we be here impossible reply dorn go and see for yourself put in roger i believe we all ought to look they over thoughtfully dorn stride on in the direction indicate and presently he arrive at the end of the village where in a old orchard he find a low rambling dilapidated barn before which cluster of soldier in blue lounge around smoking fire as he draw closer he see that most of they seem fix in gloomy abstraction a few be employ at some task of hand and several bent over the pot on fire dorn 's sweeping gaze take in the whole scene and he first quick strange impression be that these soldier resemble ghoul who have live in dark hole of mud kurt mean to make the most of he opportunity to he in he peculiar need this meeting would be of greater significance than all else that have happen to he in france the nearest soldier sit on a flatten pile of straw around which the ground be muddy at first glance kurt take he to be a african so dark be face and eye no one heed kurt 's approach the moment be poignant to kurt he speak french fairly well so that it be emotion rather than lack of fluency which make he utterance somewhat unintelligible the soldier raise he head he face seem a black flash -- he eye piercingly black stare deep full of terrible shadow they do not appear to see in kurt the man but only the trim clean united state army uniform kurt repeat he address this time more clearly the frenchman reply gruffly and bent again over the fade worn coat he be scrape with a knife then kurt notice two thing -- the man 's great hollow spare frame and the tear shirt stain many color one of which be dark red he hand resemble both those of a mason with the horny callous inside and those of a salt-water fisherman with bludgy finger and bark knuckle that never heal dorn have to choose he word slowly because of unfamiliarity with french but he be deliberate too because he want to say the right thing he eagerness make the frenchman glance up again but while dorn talk of the long wait the long march the arrival at this place the satisfaction at near the front he listener give no sign that he hear but he do hear and so do several of he comrade we be come strong he go on he voice thrilling a million of we this year we be untrained we 'll have to split up among english and french troops and learn how from you but we have come -- and we 'll fight then the frenchman put on he coat that show he to be a officer he wear medal the dark glance he then flash over dorn be different from he first it give dorn both a twinge of shame and a thrill of pride it take in dorn 's characteristic teutonic blond feature and likewise a officer 's swift appreciation of a extraordinarily splendid physique you have german blood he say yes but i be american reply dorn simply and he meet that soul-searching black gaze with all he intense and fearless spirit dorn feel that never in he life have he be subject to such a test of he manhood of he truth my name 's huon say the officer and he extend one of the huge deform hand mine 's dorn reply kurt meeting that hand with he own whereupon the frenchman speak rapidly to the comrade nearest he so rapidly that all kurt could make of what he say be that here be a american soldier with a new idea they draw closer and it become manifest that the interesting idea be kurt 's news about the american army it be news here and carefully ponder by these frenchman as slowly one by one they question he they doubt but dorn convinced they they seem to like he talk and he look dorn 's quick faculty grasp the simplicity of these soldier after three terrible year of unprecedented warfare during which they have perform the impossible they do not want a fresh army to come along and steal they glory by administer a final blow to a totter enemy gaze into those strange seared face begin to see behind the iron mask dorn learn the one thing a soldier live fight and die for -- glory kurt dorn be soon make welcome he be make to exhaust he knowledge of french he be study by eye that have gleam in the face of death he hand be wring by hand that have deal death how terribly he feel that and presently when he excitement and emotion have subside to the extent that he could really see what he look at then come the reward of reality with all its incalculable meaning express to he in the gleaming bayonet in the worn accoutrements in the greatcoat like clapboard of mud in the hand that be claw in the foot that hobble in the strange wonderful significance of bodily presence standing there as proof of valor of man 's limitless endurance in the face ah there dorn read the history that make he shudder and lift he beyond himself for there in those still dark face of boy grow old in three year shine the terror of war and the spirit that have resist it dorn in he intensity in the over-emotion of he self-centered passion so terribly drive to prove to himself something vague yet all-powerful illusive yet imperious divine what these blue devil soldier have be through he mind be more than telepathic almost it seem that soul be bare to he these soldier quiet intent make up a grim group of man they seem slow thoughtful plodding wrap and steep in calm but dorn penetrate all this and establish the relation between it and the nameless and dreadful significance of they weapon and medal and uniform and stripe and the magnificent vitality that be now all but spend dorn might have resemble a curious adventure-loving boy to judge from he handling of rifle and the way he slip a strong hand along the gleam bayonet-blade but he be more than the curious youth : he have begin to grasp a strange intangible something for which he have no name something that must be attainable for he something that for a hour or a moment would make he a fighter not to be slight by these superman whatever he youth or he impel spirit of manhood the fact be that he inspire many of these veteran of the bloody year to homeric narrative of the siege of verdun of the retreat toward pari of the victory of the marne and lastly of the kaiser 's battle this last and most awful offensive of the resourceful and frightful foe brunelle tell how he be the last survivor of a squad at verdun who have be order to hold a breach make in a front stone wall along the out post how they have face a bombardment of heavy gun -- a whistle shriek thundering roar pierce by the higher explosion of a burst shell -- smoke and sulphur and gas -- the crumble of wall and downward fling of shrapnel how the life of soldier be as life of gnat hurl by wind and burn by flame death have a manifold and horrible diversity a soldier 's head with ghastly face and conscious eye momentarily poise in the air while the body ride away invisibly with a explode shell he tell of man blow up shoot through and riddled and brained and disemboweled while they comrade grim and unalterable standing in a stream of blood live through the rain of shell the smashing of wall live to fight like madman the detachment follow the bombardment and to kill they every one mathie tell of the great retreat -- how man who have fight for day who be unbeaten and unafraid have obey a order they hate and could not understand and have march day and night day and night eating as they toil on sleep while they march on and on bloody-footed desperate and terrible fill with burn thirst and the agony of ceaseless motion on with drag leg and labor breast and red-hazed eye on and onward unquenchable with the spirit of france sergeant delorme speak of the sudden fierce about-face at the marne of the irresistible onslaught of man whose home have be invade whose child have be murder whose woman have be enslave of a ruthless fighting swift and deadly and lastly of a bayonet charge by he own division run down upon superior number engage they in hand-to-hand conflict malignant and fatal route they over a field of blood and death monsieur dorn do you know the french use of a bayonet ask delorme no reply dorn _ allon _ i will show you he say take up two rifle and hand one to dorn come it be so -- and so -- a trick the boche can not face cold steel ah monsieur you have the supple wrist of a juggler you have the arm of a giant you have the eye of a duelist you will be one grand spitter of german pig dorn feel the blanching of he face the tingling of he nerve the tightening of he muscle a cold and terrible meaning lay hold of he even in the instant when he tremble before this flaming-eyed french veteran who compliment he while he instruct how easily dorn thought could this soldier slip the bright bayonet over he guard and pierce he from breast to back how horrible the proximity of that sinister blade with its glint its turn its edge so potently expressive of its history even as dorn cross bayonet with this inspired frenchman he hear a soldier comrade say that delorme have let daylight through fourteen boche in that memorable victory of the marne you be very big and strong and quick monsieur say the officer huon simply in bayonet-work you will be a killer of boche in they talk and practice and help in they intent to encourage the young american soldier these blue devil one and all deal in frank and inevitable term of death that be they meaning in life it be immeasurably horrible for dorn because it seem a realization of he imagine vision he feel like a child among old savage of a war tribe yet he be fascinate by this close-up suggestion of man to man in battle of german to american of materialist to idealist and beyond all control be the burst surge of he blood the exercise he have go through the trick he have acquire somehow have strange power to liberate he emotion the officer huon speak english and upon he word dorn hung spellbound you american have the fine dash the nerve you will perform wonder but you do not realize what this war be you will perish of sheer curiosity to see or eagerness to fight but these be the least of the horror of this war actual fighting be to I a relief a forgetfulness a excitement and be so with many of my comrade we have survive wound starvation shell-shock poison gas and fire the disease of war the awful toil of the trench and each and every one of we who have serve long bear in he mind the particular horror that haunt he i have know veteran to go mad at the scream of shell i have see good soldier stand upon a trench invite the fire that would end suspense for a man who hope to escape alive this war be indeed the ninth circle of hell my own particular horror be mud water and cold i have live in dark cold mud-hole so long that my mind concern they be not right i know it the moment i come out to rest rest do you know that we can not rest the comfort of this dirty old barn of these fire of this bare ground be so great that we can not rest we can not sleep we can not do anything when i think of the past winter i do not remember injury and agony for myself or the maim and mangled body of my comrade i remember only the horrible cold the endless age of wait the hopeless misery of the dugout foul black rat-hole that we have to crawl into through sticky mud and filthy water mud water and cold with the stench of the dead clog you nostril that to I be war _ les misrables _ you american will never know that thank god for it could not be endure by man who do not belong to this soil after all the filthy water be half blood and the mud be part of the dead of we people huon talk on and on with the eloquence of a frenchman who relieve himself of a burden he tell of trench dig in a swamp live in and fight in and then use for the grave of the dead trench that have to be live in again month afterward the rot dead be everywhere when they be cover the rain would come to wash away the earth expose they again that be the strange refrain of this soldier 's moody lament -- the rain that fall the mud that forever hold he root fast in the track of he despair he tell of night and storm of a weary squad of man lie flat try to dig in under cover of rain and darkness of the hell of cannonade over and around they he tell of hour that blast man 's soul of death that be a blessing of escape that be torture beyond the endurance of human crowning that night of horror pile on horror when he have see a dozen man bury alive in mud lift by a monster shell when he have see a refuge deep underground open and devastate by a like projectile come a cloud-burst that flood the trench and the field drown soldier whose injury and mud-laden garment impede they movement and render escape for the other a infernal labor and a hideous wretchedness unutterable and insupportable round the camp-fire the blue devil stand or lay try to rest but the habit of the trench be upon they dorn gaze at each and every soldier so like in strange resemblance so different in physical characteristic and the sad profound and terrifying knowledge come to he of what they must have in they mind he realize that all he need be to suffer and fight and live through some little part of the war they have endure and then some truth would burst upon he it be there in the restless step in the prone form in the sunken glaring eye what soldier what man what giant three and a half year of unnamable and indescribable fury of action and strife of think not dead nor stolid like ox be these soldier of france they have a simplicity that seem appalling we have give all we have stand in the way bear the brunt save you -- this be fling at dorn not out of they thought but from they presence the fact that they be there be enough he need only to find these bravest of brave warrior real alive throbbing man dorn linger there loath to leave the great lesson of he life hold vague connection in some way with this squad of french private but he could not pierce the veil this meeting come as a climax to four month of momentous meeting with the best and the riffraff of many nation dorn have study talk listen and learn he who have as yet give nothing fight no enemy save no comrade or refugee or child in all this whirlpool of battle million feel a profound sense of he littleness he ignorance he who have imagine himself unfortunate have be blind sick self-centered here be soldier to whom comfort and rest be the sweetest blessing upon the earth and they could not grasp they no more could they grasp they than could the gaping civilian and the distinguished traveler grasp what these grand hulk of veteran soldier have do once a group of civilian halt near the soldier a officer be they escort he try to hurry they on but fail delorme edge away into the gloomy damp barn rather than meet such visitor some of he comrade follow suit ferier the incomparable of the blue devil the wearer of all the french medal and the bearer of twenty-five wound receive in battle -- he sneak away afraid and humble and sullen to hide himself from the curious that action of ferier 's be a revelation to dorn he feel a sting of shame there be two class of people in relation to this war -- those who go to fight and those who stay behind what have delorme or mathie or ferier to do with the world of selfish comfortable well-fed man dorn hear a million voice of france cry out the bitter truth -- that if these war-bowed veteran ever return alive to they home it would be with hope and heart and faith burn out with hand forever lose to they old use with body that the war have rob dorn bid he new-made friend adieu and in the darkening twilight he hurry toward he own camp if i could go back home now honorably and well i would never do it he mutter i could not bear to live know what i know now -- unless i have laugh at this death and risk it -- and deal it he be full of gladness of exultation in contemplation of the wonderful gift the hour have bring he more than any man of history or present he honor these soldier the german fear like a indian dorn respect brawn courage fortitude silence aloofness there be a divinity in those soldier he soliloquize i feel it in they complete ignorance of they greatness yet they have pride jealousy oh the mystery of it all when my day come i 'll last one short and terrible hour i would never make a soldier like one of they no american could they be frenchman whose home have be despoil in the tent of he comrade that night dorn revert from old habit and with a passionate eloquence he tell all he have see and hear and much that he have feel he influence on these young man long establish but subtle and unconscious become in that hour a tangible fact he stir they he feel they thoughtful and sad and yet more unflinching stronger and keener for the inevitable day chapter xxvii the monstrous possibility that have consume kurt dorn for many month at last become a event -- he have arrive on the battle-front in france all afternoon the company of united state troops have march from far back of the line rest as darkness come on at a camp of reserve and then go on artillery fire have be desultory during this march the big gun that have roll they thunder mile and mile be now silent but a immense activity and a horde of soldier back of the line bring strange leaden oppression to kurt dorn 's heart the last slow travel of he squad over dark barren space and through deep narrow wind lane in the ground have be a nightmare end to the long journey france have not yet become clear to he he be a stranger in a strange land in spite of he tremendous interest and excitement all seem abstract matter of he feel the plague of himself make actuality the substance of dream that last day the cumulation of month of training and travel have be one in which he have observe hear talk and feel in a nervous and fevered excitement but now he imagine he could not remember any of it he poignant experience with the blue devil have be a reality he could never forget but now this blackness of subterranean cavern this damp sickening odor of earth this presence of man the strange muffle sound -- all these be unreal how have he come here he mind labor with a burden strangely like that on he chest a different utterly unfamiliar emotion seem rise over he maybe that be because he be very tired and very sleepy sometime that night he must go on duty he ought to sleep it be impossible he could not close he eye a effort to attend to what he be actually do disclose the fact that he be listen with all he strength for what he could not answer then he hear the distant muffle sound and low voice nearer and thud and footfall he comrade be near he he hear they breathing he feel they presence they be strain and intense like he they be lock up in they own prison of emotion always heretofore on night that he lay sleepless dorn have think of the two thing dearest on earth to he -- lenore anderson and the golden wheat-hill of he home this night he call up lenore 's image it hang there in the blackness a dim pale phantom of she sweet face she beautiful eye she sad lip and then it vanish not at all could he call up a vision of he beloved wheat-field so the suspicion that something be wrong with he mind become a certainty it anger he quicken he sensitiveness even while he despair he grind he tooth and clench he fist and swear to realize he presence there and to rise to the occasion as have be he vaunted ambition suddenly he feel something slimy and hairy against he wrist -- then a stinging bite a rat a trench rat that live on flesh he fling he arm violently and beat upon the soft earth the incident of surprise and disgust help dorn at least in one way he mind have be set upon a strange and supreme condition of he be there of a emotion about to overcome he the bite of a rat draw blood make a literal fact of he be a soldier in a dugout at the front wait in the blackness for he call to go on guard this incident prove to dorn he limitation and that he be too terribly concern with he feeling ever to last long as a soldier but he could not help himself he pulse he heart he brain all seem to beat beat beat with a nameless passion be he lose he nerve -- be he afraid he denial do not reassure he he understand that patriotism and passion be emotion and that the reality of a soldier 's life be not dorn force himself to think of reality hope thus to get a grasp upon he vanish courage and memory help he not so many day week month back he have be a different man at bordeaux when he squad first set foot upon french soil that be a splendid reality how he have thrill at the welcome of the french sailor then he think of the strenuous round of army duty of training task of travel in cold box-car of endless march of camp and village of drill and billet never to be forget be that morning now seemingly long ago when a officer have order the battalion to pack we be go to the front he announce magic word what excitement what whoop what bragging and joy among the boy what hurry and bustle and remarkable efficiency that have be a reality of actual experience but the meaning of it the terrible significance have be beyond the mind of any american i be here -- at the front -- now whisper dorn to himself a few rod away be german inconceivable -- no reality at all he go on with he swift account of thing with he mind ever sharpen with that strange mount emotion flooding to the full ready to burst its barrier when he and he comrade have watch they transport train move away -- when they have stand wait for they own train -- have the idea of actual conflict yet dawn upon they dorn have to answer no he remember that he have make few friend among the inhabitant of town and village where he have stay what leisure time he get have be give to a seek out of sailor soldier and man of all race with whom he find himself in remarkable contact the end of the world bring together by one war how could he memory ever hold all that have come to he but it do passion liberate it he see now that he eye be a lens he mind a sponge he heart a gulf out of the hundred of thousand of american troops in france what honor it be to be in the choose battalion to go to the front dorn live only with he squad but he feel the envy of the whole army what luck to be choose from so many -- to go out and see the game through quickly he begin to consider that differently now the luck might be with the soldier leave behind always underneath dorn 's perplexity and ponder under he intelligence and spirit at they best have be a something deeply personal something of the internal of he a selfish instinct it be the nature of man -- self-preservation like a tempest sweep over dorn the most significant ordeal and lesson of he experience in france -- that wonderful reality when he meet the blue devil and they take he in however long he live he life must necessarily be transform from contact with those great man the night march over the unending road through the gloom and the spectral starlight with the dull rumbling of cannon shocking he heart -- that dorn live over finding strangely a minutest detail of observation and a singular veracity of feeling fix in he memory afternoon of that very day at the reserve camp somewhere back there have bring a officer 's address to the soldier a strong and emphatic appeal as well as order -- to obey to do one 's duty to take no chance to be eternally vigilant to believe that every man have advantage on he side even in war if he be not a fool or a daredevil dorn have absorb the speech remember every word but it all seem futile now then have come the impressive inspection of equipment a careful examination of gas-mask rifle knapsack after that the order to march dorn imagine that he have remember little but he have remember all perhaps the sense of strange unreality be only the twist in he mind yet he do not know where he be -- what part of france -- how far north or south on the front line -- in what sector could not that account for the sense of feeling lose nevertheless he be there at the end of all this incomprehensible journey he become possess by a irresistible desire to hurry once more dorn attempt to control the far-flinging of he thought -- to come down to earth the earth be there under he hand soft sticky moldy smell vilely he dig he finger into it until the feel of something like a bone make he jerk they out perhaps he have feel a stone a tiny creep chilly shudder go up he back then he remember he feel he see he little attic room in the old home back among the wheat-hill of the northwest six thousand mile away he would never see that room again what unaccountable vagary of memory have ever recall it to he it fade out of he mind some of he comrade whisper now and then one roll over none snore for none of they sleep dorn feel more aloof from they than ever how isolate each one be lock in he own trouble every one of they like himself have a lonely soul perhaps they be face it he could not conceive of a careless thoughtless emotionless attitude toward this first night in the front-line trench dorn gradually grow more acutely sensitive to the many faint rustling whisper sound in and near the dugout a soldier come stoop into the opaque square of the dugout door he rifle strike the framework give out a metallic clink this fellow expel a sudden heavy breath as if throw off a oppression be that you sanborn this whisper dorn recognize as dixon 's it be full of suppress excitement yes guess it be my turn next how -- how do it go sanborn 's laugh have a odd little quaver why so far as i know i guess it be all right damn queer though i wish we have get here in daytime but maybe that would not help humph pretty quiet out there so bob say but what be he know -- more than we i hear gun up the line and rifle-fire not so far off can you see any -- not a damn thing -- yet everything interrupted sanborn enigmatically dixon call owen low and quickly from the darkness dixon do not reply he sudden hard breathing the brushing of he garment against the door then swift soft step die away attest to the fact of he go dorn try to compose himself to rest if not to sleep he hear sanborn sit down and then apparently stay very still for some time all of a sudden he whisper to himself dorn distinguish the word hell what be ailin ' you pard drawl brewer sanborn growl under he breath and when some one else in the dugout quiz he curiously he burst out : i 'll bet you galoot the state of californium against a dill pickle that when you turn come you 'll be sick in you gizzard we 'll take we medicine come in the soft quiet voice of purcell no more be say the man all pretend to fall asleep each ashamed to let he comrade think he be concern a short dull heavy rumble seem to burst the outer stillness for a moment the dugout be silent as a tomb no one breathe then come a jar of the earth a creaking of shake timber some one gasp involuntarily another whisper : by god the real thing dorn wonder how far away that jarring shell have alight not so far it be the first he have ever hear explode near he roar of cannon explode of shell -- this have be a source of every-day talk among he comrade but the jar the tremble of the earth have a dreadful significance another rumble another jar not so heavy or so near this time and then a few sharply connect report clamp dorn as in a cold vise machine-gun shot many thousand machine-gun shot have he hear but none with the life and the spite and the spang of these do he imagine the difference cold as he feel he begin to sweat and continually as he wipe the palm of he hand they grow wet again a queer sensation of light-headedness and weakness seem to possess he the root of he will-power seem numb nevertheless all the more revolving and all-embracing seem he mind the officer in he speech a few hour back have say the sector to which the battalion have be assign be alive by this he mean that active bombardment machine-gun fire hand-grenade throwing and gas-shelling or attack in force might come any time and certainly must come as soon as the german suspect the presence of a american force opposite they that be the stunning reality to dorn -- the actual existence of the hun a few rod distant but realization of they have not bring he to the verge of panic he would not flinch at confront the whole german army nor do he imagine he put a great price upon he life nor do he have any abnormal dread of pain nor have the well-remembered teaching of the bible troubled he spirit be he go to be a coward because of some incalculable thing in he or force operate against he already he sit there shiver and sweating with the load on he breast grow laborsome with all he sensorial be absolutely at keenest edge rapid footfall halt he heart-beat they come from above outside the dugout from the trench dorn come out call the corporal dorn 's response be instant but he be as blind as if he have no eye and he have to feel he way to climb out the indistinct blur form of the corporal seem half merge in the pale gloom of the trench a cool wind whip at dorn 's hot face surcharge with emotion the nature of which he fear dorn follow the corporal stumbling and slide over the wet board knock bit of earth from the wall feel a sick icy gripe in he bowels some strange light flare up -- die away another rumble distinct heavy and vibrate to he left somewhere the earth receive a shock dorn feel a wave of air that be not wind the corporal lead the way past motionless man peer out over the top of the wall and on to a widen where a abutment of fill bag loom up darkly here the corporal cautiously climb up break in the wall and stoop behind the fortification dorn follow he leg do not feel natural something be lose out of they then he see the little figure of roger beside he dorn 's turn mean roger 's relief how pale against the night appear the face of roger as he peer under he helmet at dorn a low whining pass in the air overhead roger start slightly a thump sound out there interrupt the corporal who have begin to speak he repeat he order to dorn bend a little to peer into he face dorn try to open he lip to say he do not understand but he lip be mute then the corporal lead roger away that moment alone out in the open with the strange windy pall of night -- all-enveloping with the flare like sheet-lightning along the horizon with a rumble here and a roar there with whistle fiend ride the blackness above with a series of pop impel report seemingly close in front -- that drive home to kurt dorn a cruel and present and unescapable reality at that instant like bitter fate shoot up a rocket or a star-flare of calcium light burst to expose all underneath in pitiless radiance with a gasp that be a sob dorn shrink flat against the wall stare into the fading circle feel a creep of paralysis he must be see he expect the sharp bite series of a machine-gun or the bursting of a bomb but nothing happen except that the flare die away it have come from behind he own line control of he muscle have almost return when a heavy boom come from the german side mile away perhaps but close that boom mean a great shell speeding on its hideous mission it would pass over he he listen the wind come from that side it be cold it smell of burn powder it carry sound he be begin to appreciate -- shot rumble spat and thud whistle of vary degree all isolate sound then he catch a strange low moan it rise it be come fast it become a o-o-o-o-o-o nearer and nearer it take on a singing whistle it be pass -- no -- fall a mighty blow be deliver to the earth -- a jar -- a splitting shock to windy darkness a wave of heavy air be fling afar -- and then come the soft heavy thumping of fall earth that shell have explode close to the place where dorn stand it terrify he it reduce he to a palpitating stricken wretch utterly unable to cope with the terror it be not what he have expect what be word anyhow by word alone he have understand this shell thing death be only a word too but to be blow to atom it come every moment to some poor devil it might come to he but that be not fight somewhere off in the blackness a huge iron monster belch this hell out upon defenseless man revolting and inconceivable truth it be dorn 's ordeal that he mentality rob this hour of novelty and of adventure that while he natural physical fear incite panic and nausea and a horrible convulsive internal retch he highly organize exquisitely sensitive mind more like a woman 's in its capacity for emotion must suffer through imagine the infinite agony that he might really escape every shell then must blow he to bit every agony of every soldier must be he but he know what he duty be and as soon as he could move he begin to edge along the short beat once at the end he draw a deep and shudder breath and fight all he involuntary instinct he peer over the top a invisible thing whip close over he head it do not whistle it cut out in front of he be only thick pale gloom with spectral form lead away to the horizon where flare like sheet-lightning of a summer night 's storm run along show smoke and bold ragged outline then he go to the other end to peer over there he eye be keen and through long year of habit at home go about at night without light he could see distinctly where ordinary sight would meet only a blank wall the flat ground immediately before he be bare of live or move object that be he duty as sentinel here -- to make sure of no surprise patrol from the enemy line it help dorn to realize that he could accomplish this duty even though he be in a torment that space before he be empty but it be charge with current wind shadow gloom smoke electricity death spirit -- whatever that current be dorn feel it he be more afraid of that than the occasional bullet which zip across sometimes shot from he own squad ring out up and down the line off somewhat to the north a machine-gun on the ally ' side speak now and then spitefully way back a big gun boom dorn listen to the whine of shell from he own side with a far different sense than that with which he hear shell whine from the enemy how natural and yet how unreasonable shell from the other side come over to destroy he shell from he side go back to save he but both be shoot to kill be he the unknown and shrink novice of a soldier any better than a unknown and shrink soldier far across there in the darkness what be equality but these be german that thing so often say -- so beat into he brain -- do not convince out here in the face of death \* \* \* \* \* four o'clock with the gray light come a gradually increase number of shell most of they strike far back a few to right and leave drop near the front line the dawn break -- such a dawn as he never dream of -- smoky and raw with thunder spread to a circle all around the horizon he be relieve on he way in he pass purcell at the nearest post the elegant new-yorker bear himself with outward calm but in the gray dawn he look haggard and draw older that flash through dorn 's mind a single night have contain year more than year other of the squad have subtly change dixon give he a penetrate look as if he wear a mask under which be a face of betrayal of contrast to that soldier bearing of youth that be go forever chapter xxviii the squad of man to which dorn belong have to be on the lookout continually for a attack that be inevitable the german be feel out the line probably to verify spy news of the united state troops take over a sector they have not however make sure of this fact the gas-shell come over regularly make life for the man a kind of suffocation most of the time and the great shell that blow enormous hole in front and in back of they position never allow a relaxation from strain draw and haggard grow the face that have be so clean-cut and brown and fresh \* \* \* \* \* one evening at mess when the sector appear quiet enough to permit of rest roger be talk to some comrade before the door of the dugout it sure get my goat that little promenade of ours last night over into no man 's land he say we have order to slip out and halt a german patrol that be suppose to be steal over to we line we crawl on we belly look and listen every minute if that be not the limit my heart be in my mouth i could not breathe and for the first moment if i would run into a hun i would have no more strength than a rabbit but all seem clear it be not a bright night -- sort of opaque and gloomy -- shadow everywhere there be not any patrol come but corporal owen think he hear man farther on work with wire we crawl some more and we must have get pretty close to the enemy line -- in fact we have -- when up shot one of those damned calcium flare we all burrow into the ground i be paralyze it get as light as noon -- strange greenish-white flare it magnify flat as i lay i see the german embankment not fifty yard away i make sure we be goner slowly the light burn out then that machine-gun you all hear begin to rattle something queer about the way every shot of a machine-gun bite the air we hear the bullet low down right over we say boy i would almost rather be hit and have it do with we begin to crawl back i want to run we all want to but owen be a nervy guy and he keep whisper another machine-gun cut loose and bullet rain over we like hail they hit somewhere ahead scatter the gravel we have almost reach we line when smith jump up and run he say afterward that he just could not help himself the suspense be awful i know i have be a clerk in a bank get that and there i be under a hail of hun lead without be able to understand why or feel that any time have pass since give up my job to go to war queer how i see my old desk well that be how smith get he i hear the bullet spit he sort of thick and soft ugh owen and i drag he along and finally into the trench he have a bullet through he shoulder and leg guess he 'll live all right boy take this from I nobody can _ tell _ you what a machine-gun be like a rifle now be not so much you get shoot at and you know the man must reload and aim that take time but a machine-gun whew it be a comb -- a fine-toothed comb -- and you be the louse it be after you hear that steady rattle and then you hear bullet everywhere think of a man against a machine-gun it be not a square deal dixon be one of the listener he laugh roger i would like to have be with you next time i 'll volunteer you have action -- a run for you money that be what i enlist for stand still -- do nothing but wait -- that drive I half mad my year of football have make action necessary otherwise i go stale in mind and body last night before you go on that scout trip i have be on duty two hour near midnight the shell have die down all become quiet no flare -- no flash anywhere there be a luminous kind of glow in the sky -- moonlight through thin cloud i have to listen and watch but i could not keep back my thought there i be a soldier face no man 's land across whose dark space be the hun we have come to regard as devil in brutality yet less than man and i think of home no man know what home really be until he stand that lonely midnight guard a shipwrecked sailor appreciate the comfort he once have a desert wanderer lose and starve remember the food he once waste a volunteer soldier face death in the darkness think of he home it be a hell of a feeling and thinking of home i remember my girl i have be go four month -- have be at the front seven day -lrb- or be it seven year -rrb- and last night in the darkness she come to I oh yes she be there she seem reproachful as she be when she coax I not to enlist my girl be not one of the kind who send she lover to war and swear she will die a old maid unless he return mine begged I to stay home or at least wait for the draft but i be not build that way i enlist and last night i feel the bitterness of a soldier 's fate all this beautiful stuff be bunk my girl be a peach she have many admirer two in particular that make I run my best down the stretch one be club-footed he could not fight the other be all yellow he she like best he have she fool the damned slacker i wish i could believe i would get safe back home with a few hun to my credit -- the croix de guerre -- and a officer 's uniform that would be great how i could show up those fellow but i 'll get kill -- as sure as god make little apple i 'll get kill -- and she will marry one of the man who would not fight it be about the middle of a clear morning still cold but the sun be shine gun be speak intermittently those soldier who be off duty have they gas-mask in they hand all be gaze intently upward dorn sit a little apart from they he too look skyward and he be so absorb that he do not hear the occasional rumble of a distant gun he be watch the airman at work -- the most wonderful and famous feature of the war it absolutely enthral dorn as a boy he have love to watch the soar of the golden eagle and once he have see a great wide-winged condor swoop along a mountain-crest how he have envy they the freedom of the height -- the loneliness of the unscalable crag -- the companionship of the cloud here he gaze and marvel at the man-eagle of the air german plane have venture over the line fly high and english plane have sweep up to intercept they one be rise then not far away climb fast like a fish-hawk with prey in its claw its color its framework its propeller and its aviator show distinctly against the sky the buzz high-pitched drone of its motor float down the other aeroplane far above have lose they semblance to mechanical man-driven machine they be now the eagle of the air they be rise circling diving in maneuver that dorn know mean pursuit but he could not understand these movement to he the air-battle look as it must have look to a indian bird of prey in combat dorn recall verse he have learn as a boy write by a poet who sing of future war in the air what he prophesy have come true be there not a sage now who could pierce the veil of the future and sing of such a thing as sacred human life dorn have he doubt poet and dreamer appear not to be the man who could halt materialism strangely then as dorn gaze bitterly up at these fierce flier who fight in the heaven he remember the story of the three wise man and of bethlehem be it only a story where on this sunny spring morning be christ and the love of man for man at that moment one of the forward aeroplane which be drift back over the enemy line lose its singular grace of slow sweeping movement it poise in the air it change shape it pitch as if from wave to wave of wind a faint puff of smoke show tiny speck visible to dorn 's powerful eye seem to detach themselves and fall to be follow by the plane itself in sheer downward descent dorn leap to he foot what a thrilling and terrible sight he comrade stand bareheaded red face uplift open-mouthed and wild with excitement not daring to disobey order and yell at the top of they lung dorn feel strong above the softened wonder and thought of a moment back a tingling pulsate wave of gush blood go over he like he comrade he begin to wave he arm and stamp and bite he tongue swiftly the doomed plane sweep down out of sight go at that instant something which have seem like a bird must have become a broken mass the other plane drift eastward dorn gasp and break the spell on he he be hot and wet with sweat quiver with a frenzy how many thousand soldier of the ally have see that downward flight of the boche dorn pity the destroy airman hate himself and have all the fury of savage joy that have be in he comrade \* \* \* \* \* dorn relieve from guard and firing-post rush back to the dugout he need the dark of that dungeon he crawl in and search out the remotest blackest corner hide from all human eye and especially he own he lay there clammy and wet all over with a icy sickening rend like a wound in the pit of he stomach he shut he eye but that do not shut out what he see _ so help I god _ he whisper to himself six endless month have go to the preparation of a deed that have take one second that transform he he life on earth he spirit in the beyond could never be now what they might have be and he sob through grind tooth as he feel the disintegrate agonizing irremediable force at work on body mind and soul he have blow out the brain of he first german fire of hell in two long line border a barren ghastly hazy strip of land burst forth from the earth from hole where man hide pour thunder of gun and stream of smoke and screech of iron that worthless strip of land bar deadly foe shake as with repeat earthquake huge spout of black and yellow earth lift fountain-like to the dull heavy burst of shell pound and jar whistle and whine long broken rumble and the rattle concatenation of quick shot like metallic cry explode hail-storm of iron in the air a desert over which thousand of puff of smoke shoot up and swell and drift the slide crash far away the sibilant hiss swift overhead boom weeeee -- eeeeooooo from the east boom weeeee -- eeeeooooo from the west at sunset there be no let-up the night be all the more hideous along the horizon flash up the hot sheet of lightning that be not of a summer storm angry lurid red these upflung blaze and flame illumine the murky sky show in the fitful and flickering interval wagon drive toward the front and patrol of soldier run toward some point and great upheaval of earth spread high this heavy cannonading die away in the middle of the night until a hour before dawn when it begin again with redoubled fury and last until daybreak dawn come reluctantly dorn thought he be glad it mean a charge another night of that hellish shrieking and bursting of shell would kill he mind if not he body he stand on guard at a fighting-post corporal owen lay at he foot wound slightly he would not retire as the cannon cease he go to sleep roger stand close on one side dixon on the other the squad have live through that awful night soldier be bring food and drink to they all appear grimly gay dorn be not gay but he know this be the day he would laugh in the tooth of death a slumbrous slow heat burn deep in he like a covered fire fierce and hot at heart await the wind watch there he do not voluntarily move a muscle yet all he body twitch like that of the trained athlete strain to leap into the great race of he life a officer come hurry through the talk hushed man on guard back to the trench never move they eye from the forbid land in front the officer speak look for a charge reserve be close behind he give he order and pass on then a ally gun open up with a boom the shell moan on over dorn see where it burst send smoke and earth aloft that must have be a signal for a bombardment of the enemy all along this sector for big and little gun begin to thunder and crack the spectacle before dorn 's hard keen eye be one that he think wonderful far across no man 's land which slope somewhat at that point in the plain he see movement of troops and gun he eye be telescopic over there the ground appear grassy in place with green ridge rise and patch of brush and straggle tree stand out clearly faint gray-colored squad of soldier pass in sight with helmet flash in the sun gun be be haul forward mount horseman dash here and there vanish and reappear and all through that wide area of color and action shoot up live black spout of earth crown in white smoke that hang in the air after the earth fall back they be beautiful these shell-burst round ball of white smoke magically appear in the air to spread and drift long yellow column or streak rise here and there leap up a fan-shaped dirty cloud savage and sinister sometimes several shell burst close together dash the upflung sheet of earth together and blend they smoke at interval a huge creamy-yellow explosion like a geyser rise aloft to spread and mushroom then to detach itself from the heavier body it have upheave and float away white and graceful on the wind sinister beauty dorn soon lose sight of that there come a gnawing at he vitals the far scene of action could not hold he gaze that dark uneven hummocky break in the earth which be a goodly number of rod distant yet now seem close draw a startling attention dorn feel he eye widen and pop spot and dot shiny illusive bob along that break behind the mound beyond the farther bank a yell as from one lusty throat run along the line of which dorn 's squad hold the center dorn 's sight have a piercing intensity all be hard under he grip -- he rifle the board and bag against which he lean corporal owen rise beside he barehead to call low and fiercely to he man the gray dot and shiny spot leap up magically and appallingly into man german soldier boch hun on a charge they be many but wide apart they charge run low machine-gun rattle rifle-fire and strangle shout blended along the line from the charge hun seem to come a sound that be neither battle-cry nor yell nor chant yet all of they together the gray advance line thin at point opposite the machine-gun but it be come fast dorn curse he hard fumble hand which seem so eager and fierce that they stiffen they burn too from they grip on the hot rifle shot after shot he fire miss he could not hit a field full of hun he drop shell fumble with they at the breech load wildly aim at random pull convulsively he brain be on fire he have no anger no fear only a great and futile eagerness yell and crack fill he ear the gray stolid unalterable hun must be drive back dorn loaded crushed he rifle steady pointed low at a great gray bulk and fire that hun pitch down out of the gray advance line the sight almost overcome dorn dizzy with blur eye he lean over he gun he abdomen and breast heave and he strangle over he gorge almost he faint but violence beside he somehow great heap of dust and gravel fling over he hoarse wild yell in he ear rouse he the boche be on the line he leap up through the dust he see charge gray form thick and heavy they plunge as if actuate by one will bulky blond man ashen of face with eye of blue fire and brutal mouth set grim -- hun up out of the shallow trench spring comrade on each side of dorn no rat to be corner in a hole dorn seem draw by powerful haul chain he do not need to climb four big german appear simultaneously upon the embankment of bag they be shoot one swing aloft a arm and close fist he yell like a demon he be a bomb-thrower on the instant a bullet hit dorn tear at the side of he head sting excruciatingly knock he down flood he face with blood the shock like a weight hold he down but he be not daze a body khaki-clad roll down beside he convulsively flop against he he bound erect he ear fill with a hoarse and click din he heart strangely lift in he breast only one german now stand upon the embankment of bag and he be the threatening bomb-thrower the other be down -- gray form wrestle with brown dixon be lunge at the bomb-thrower and reach he with the bayonet run he through the belly he topple over with a awful cry and fall hard on the other side of the wall of loaded bag the bomb explode in the streaky burst dixon seem to charge in bulk -- to be fling aside like a leaf by a gale little roger have engage a enemy who tower over he they feint swing and crack they gun together then lock bayonet another german stride from behind stab roger in the back he writhe off the bloody bayonet fall toward dorn show a white face that change as he fall with quiver of torture and die eye that dormant inhibit self of dorn suddenly be no more fast as a flash he be upon the murder hun bayonet and rifle-barrel lunge through he and so terrible be the thrust that the german be throw back as if at a blow from a battering-ram dorn whirl the bloody bayonet and it crash to the ground the rifle of the other german dorn see not the visage of the foe -- only the thick-set body and this he rip open in one mighty slash the german 's life spill out horribly dorn leap over the bloody mass owen lay next wide-eyed alive but stricken purcell fight with club rifle back away from several foe brewer be be beat down gray form close in dorn see level small gun flash of red the impact of lead striking he but he hear no shot the roar in he ear be the filling of a gulf out of that gulf pierce he laugh gray form -- gun -- bullet -- bayonet -- death -- he laugh at they he moment have come here he would pay he immense and terrible joy bridge the age between the past and this moment when he leap light and swift like a huge cat upon they they fire and they hit but dorn spring on tigerishly with he loud and nameless laugh bayonet thrust at he be straw these enemy give way appal with sweep and lunge he kill one and split a second 's skull before the first have fall a third he lift and upset and gore like a bull in one single stroke the fourth and last of that group scream he terror and fury run in close to get beyond that sweeping blade he fire as he run dorn trip he heavily and he have scarcely strike the ground when that steel transfix he bulge throat brewer be down but purcell have be reinforce soldier in brown come on the run shooting yell brandish they close in on the german and dorn run into that mle to make one thrust at each gray form he encounter shriller yell along the line -- american yell -- the enemy there have give ground dorn hear he see the gray line waver he see reserve run to aid he squad the german would be beat back there be whirling blackness in he head through which he seem to see the laugh break hoarse and harsh from he throat dust and blood choke he another gray form block he leap way dorn see only low down the gray arm reach with bright unstained blade he own bloody bayonet clash against it lock and feel the helplessness of the arm that wield it a instant of pause -- a heave breathless instinct of impend exhaustion -- a moment when the petrific mace of primitive man stay at the return of the human -- then with bloody foam on he lip dorn spend he madness a supple twist -- the french trick -- and dorn 's powerful lunge with all he ponderous weight drive he bayonet through the enemy 's lung _ ka -- ma -- rod _ come the strange strangling cry a weight sag down on dorn 's rifle he do not pull out the bayonet but as it lower with the burden of the body he eye fix at one height suddenly have bring into they range the face of he foe a boy -- die on he bayonet then come a resurrection of kurt dorn 's soul he look at what must be he last deed as a soldier he mind halt he see only the ghastly face the eye in which he expect to see hate but see only love of life suddenly reborn suddenly surprise at death god save you german i would give my life for yours too late dorn watch the youth 's last clutch of empty finger the last look of consciousness at he conqueror the last quiver the youth die and slide back off the rigid bayonet war of man a heavy thud sound to the left of dorn a burst flash hide the face of he german victim a terrific wind sharp and hard as nail lift dorn into roar blackness chapter xxix many water shine white and green under the bright may sunshine see from the height of slope the wind brook look like silver band across a vast belt of rainy green and purple that border the broad river in the bottom-land a summer haze fill the air and hint of gold on the wave wheat slope presage a early and bountiful harvest it be warm up there on the slope where lenore anderson watch and brood the breeze bring fragrant smell of fresh-cut alfalfa and the rustling song of the wheat the stately house gleam white down on the terraced green knoll horse and cattle graze in the pasture workman move like snail in the brown garden a motor-car creep along the road far below with its trail of rise dust two mile of soft green wheat-slope lay between lenore and she home she have need the loneliness and silence and memory of a place she have not visit for many month winter have pass summer have come with its bird and flower the wheat-field be again wave beautiful luxuriant but life be not as it have be for lenore anderson kurt dorn private mortally wound -- so have read the brief and terrible line in a spokane newspaper publish a associated press despatch of pershing 's casualty-list no more that have be the only news of kurt dorn for a long time a month have drag by of doubt of hope of slow despair up to the time of that fatal announcement lenore have scarcely note the fleeting of the day with all she spirit and energy she have throw herself into the organize of the woman of the valley to work for the interest of the war she have make herself a leader who spare no effort no sacrifice no expense in what she consider she duty conservation of food intensive farm production knit for soldier liberty loan and red cross -- these she have study and master to the end that the woman of the great valley have accomplish work which win national honor it have be excitement joy and a strange fulfilment for she but after the shock cause by the fatal news about dorn she have lose interest though she have work on harder than ever just a night ago she father have gaze at she and then tell she to come to he office she do so and there he say : you be workin ' too hard you have get to quit oh no dad i be only tired to-night she have reply let I go on i have plan so -- no he say bang he desk you 'll run yourself down but father these be war-time could i do less -- could i think of -- you have do wonder you have be the life of this work some one else can carry it on now you would kill yourself a ' this war have cost the anderson enough should we count the cost she ask anderson have swear no we should not but i be not goin ' to lose my girl do you get that hunch i have buy bond by the bushel i have give thousand to you relief society i give up my son jim -- a ' that cost we mother i be raisin ' a million bushel of wheat this year that the government can have a ' i be starvin ' to death because i do not get what i use to eat then this last blow -- dorn -- that fine young wheat-man the best -- aw lenore but dad be -- be not there any -- any hope anderson be silent dad she have plead if he be really dead -- bury -- oh would not i feel it you have overwork yourself now you have get to rest she father have reply huskily but dad i say no i have a heap of pride in what you have do a ' i sure think you be the best anderson of the lot that be all now kiss I a ' go to bed that explain how lenore come to be alone high up ' on the vast wheat-slope watching and feeling with no more work to do the slow climb there have prove to she how much she need rest but work even under strain or pain would have be preferable to endless hour to think to remember to fight despair mortally wound she whisper the tragic phrase when where how have she lover be mortally wound that mean death but no other word have come and no spiritual realization of death abide in she soul it seem impossible for lenore to accept thing as she father and friend do nevertheless equally impossible be it not to be influence by they practical mind because of she nervousness of she overstrain she have lose a good deal of she mental poise and she divine that the only help for that be certainty of dorn 's fate she could bear the shock if only she could know positively and lean she face in she hand with the warm wind blow she hair and bring the rustle of the wheat she pray for divination no answer absolutely no mystic consciousness of death -- of a end to she love here on earth instead of that breathe a strong physical presence of life all about she in the swell wave slope of wheat in the beautiful butterfly in the singing bird low down and the soar eagle high above -- life beating and surge in she heart she vein unquenchable and indomitable it give the lie to she morbidness but it seem only a physical state how could she find any tangible hold on reality she lift she face to the lonely sky and she hand press to she breast where the deep ache throb heavily it be not that i can not give he up she whisper as if impel to speak i _ can _ i _ have _ give he up it be this torture of suspense oh not to _ know _ but if that newspaper have claim he one of the kill i would not believe so lenore trust more to the mystic whisper of she woman 's soul than to all the unproven outward thing still trust as she might the voice of the world din in she ear and between the two she be on the rack loss of jim -- loss of she mother -- what unfilled gulf in she heart she be one who love only few but these deeply to-day when they be go be different from yesterday when they be here -- different because memory recall actual word deed kiss of loved one whose life be end utterly futile be it for lenore to try to think of dorn in that way she see he stalwart form down through the summer haze come with he springy stride through the wheat yet -- the word -- mortally wound they have burn into she think so that when she close she eye she see they darkly red against the blindness of sight pain be a sluggish stream with source high in she breast and it move with she unquickened blood if dorn be really dead what would become of she selfish question for a girl whose lover have die for he country she would work she would be worthy of he she would never pine she would live to remember but ah the difference to she never for she who have so love the open the silken rustle of the wheat and the wave shadow the green-and-gold slope the bird of the air and the beast of the field the

difficult to grasp these feature seem a mask transparent unable to hide a beautiful sad stern and ruthless face beneath which in turn slowly give to she startled gaze sloping line of pain and shades of gloom and the pale set muscle of forced manhood and the faint hectic flush of fever and disorder and derangement a livid angry scar smooth yet scarcely heal run from he left temple back as far as she could see that establish he identity as a wounded soldier bring home from the war otherwise to lenore he face might have be that of a immortal suddenly doom with the curse of humanity die in agony

lenore tear herself away from the window so that she could not hear any more and in the darkness of she room she begin to pace to and fro beginning to undress for bed shake in some kind of a frenzy scarcely know what she be about until sundry knock from furniture and the fall over a chair awaken she to the fact that she be in a tumult what -- _ be _ i -- do she pant in bewilderment reach out in the dark to turn on the light like awaken from a nightmare she see the bright light flash up it change she feeling who be this person whose image stand reflect in the mirror lenore 's recognition of herself almost stun she what have happen she see that she hair fall wildly over she bare shoulder she face shine white with red spot in she cheek she eye seem ball of fire she lip have a passionate savage curl she breast bare and heaving show a throbbing tumultuous heart and as she realize how she look it strike she that she feel a inexplicable passion she feel intense as steel hot as fire quiver with the pulsation of rapid blood a victim to irrepressible thrill that rush over she from the very sole of she foot to the root of she hair something glorious terrible and furious possess she when she understand what it be she turn out the light and fall upon the bed where as the storm slowly subside she think and wonder and sorrow and whisper to herself the tale of dorn 's tragedy have stir to the depths the primitive hidden and unplumbed in the unknown nature of she just now she have look at herself at she two self -- the white-skinned and fair-haired girl that civilization have produce -- and the blaze pant savage woman of the bygone age she could not escape from either the story of demon dorn 's terrible fight have retrograde she for the moment to the female of the species more savage and dangerous than the male no use to lie she have glory in he prowess he be she man go out with club to beat down the brute that would steal she from he alas what be we what be i she whisper do i know myself what could i not have do a moment ago she have that primitive thing in she and though she shudder to realize it she have no regret life be life that dorn have lay low so many enemy be grand to she and righteous since these enemy be as caveman come for prey even now the terrible thrill chase over she demon dorn what a man she have know just what he would do -- and how he spiritual life would go under the woman of she gloried in he fight and the soul of she sicken at its significance no hope for any man or any woman except in god these man these boy like she father and jake like dorn and he comrade -- how simple natural inevitable elemental they be they love a fight they might hate it too but they love it most life of man be all strife and the greatness in they come out in war war search out the best and the worst in man what be wound blood mangled flesh agony and death to man -- to those who go out for liberation of something unproven in themselves life be only a breath the secret must lie in the beyond for man could not act that way for nothing some hidden purpose through the age \* \* \* \* \* anderson have summon a great physician a specialist of world renown lenore of course have not be present when the learn doctor examine kurt dorn but she be in she father 's study when the report be make to lenore this little man seem all intellect all science all electric current he state that dorn have upward of twenty-five wound some of they serious most trivial and all of they combine not necessarily fatal many soldier with worse wound have totally recover dorn 's vitality and strength have be so remarkable that great loss of blood and almost complete lack of nourishment have not bring about the present grave condition he will die and that be best for he say the specialist he case be not extraordinary i see many like it in france during the first year of war when i be there but i will say that he must have be both physically and mentally above the average before he go to fight my examination extend through period of he unconsciousness and aberration once for a little time he come to apparently sane the nurse say he have notice several period of this rationality during the last forty-eight hour but these and the prolonged vitality do not offer any hope a emotion of exceed intensity and duration have produce lesion in the kinetic organ some passion have immeasurably activate he brain destroy brain cell which might not be replace if he happen to live he might be permanently impaired he might be neurasthenic melancholic insane at time or even grow permanently so it be very sad he appear to have be a fine young man but he will die and that really be best for he thus the man of science sum up the biological case of kurt dorn when he have go anderson wear the distressed look of one who must abandon he last hope he do not understand though he be force to believe he swear characteristically at the luck and then at the great specialist i have know indian medicine-man who could give that doctor card a ' spade he explode with gruff finality lenore understand she father perfectly and imagine she understand the celebrated scientist the former be just human and the latter be simply knowledge neither have that which cause she to go out alone into the dark night and look up beyond the slow-rising slope to the star these man particularly the scientist lack something he possess all the wonderful knowledge of body and brain of the metabolism and chemistry of the organ but he know nothing of the source of life lenore accord science its place in progress but she hate its elimination of the soul stronger than ever strength to endure and to trust pervaded she spirit the dark night encompass she the vast lonely heave of wheat-slope the dim sky with its steady star -- these be voice as well as tangible thing of the universe and she be in mysterious harmony with they lift thine eye to the hill from whence cometh thy help \* \* \* \* \* the day follow the specialist 's visit dorn surprise the family doctor the nurse anderson and all except lenore by awaken to a spell of consciousness which seem to lift for the time at least the shadow of death kathleen be the first to burst in upon lenore with the wonderful news lenore could only gasp she intense eagerness and sit tremble hand over she heart while the child babble i listen and i peep in be kathleen 's reiterate statement kurt be awake he speak too but very soft say he know he be at ` many water ' i hear he say ` lenore ' oh i be so happy lenore -- that before he die he 'll know you -- talk to you hush child whisper lenore kurt 's not go to die but they all say so that funny little doctor yesterday -- he make I tire -- but he say so i hear he as dad put he into the car yes kathie i hear he too but i do not believe reply lenore dreamily kurt do not look so -- so sick go on kathleen only -- only i do not know what -- different i guess i be crazy to go in -- to see he lenore will they ever let I they father 's abrupt entrance interrupt the conversation he be pale forceful as when issue be at stake but be undecided kathie go out he say lenore rise to face he my girl -- dorn 's come to -- a ' he be ask for you i be for lettin ' he see you but lowell a ' jarvi say no -- not yet now he might die any minute seem to I he ought to see you it be right a ' if you say so -- yes reply lenore by heaven he shall see you then say anderson breathing hard i be justified even -- even if it he do not finish he significant speech but leave she abruptly presently lenore be summon when she leave she room she be in the throe of uncontrolled agitation and all down the long hallway she fight herself at the half-open door she pause to lean against the wall there she have the will to still she nerve to acquire serenity and she pray for wisdom to make she presence and she word of infinite good to dorn in this crisis \* \* \* \* \* she be not aware of when she move -- how she ever get to dorn 's bedside but seemingly detach from she real self serene with emotion lock she be there look down upon he lenore he say with far-off voice that just reach she gladness shone from he shadowy eye welcome home -- my soldier boy she reply then she bent to kiss he cheek and to lay hers beside it i never -- hope -- to see you -- again he go on oh but i know murmured lenore lift she head he right hand brown bare and rough lay outside the coverlet upon he breast it be weakly reach for she lenore take it in both hers while she gaze steadily down into he eye she seem to see then how he be compare the image he have limn upon he memory with she face change -- you be older -- more beautiful -- yet the same he say it seem -- long ago yes long ago indeed i be older but -- all 's well that end well you be back lenore have not you -- be tell -- i can not live yes but it be untrue she reply and feel that she might have be life itself speak dear something 's go -- from I something vital go -- with the shell that -- take my arm _ no _ she smile down upon he all the conviction of she soul and faith she project into that single word and serene smile -- all that be love and woman in she opposing death a subtle indefinable change come over dorn lenore -- i pay -- for my father he whisper i kill hun i spill the -- blood in I -- i hate but all be wrong -- wrong yes but you could not help that she say piercingly blame can never rest upon you you be only a -- american soldier oh i know you be magnificent but you duty that way be do a higher duty await you he eye question sadly and wonderingly you must be the great sower of wheat sower of wheat he whisper and a light quicken in that question gaze there will be starve million after this war wheat be the staff of life you _ must _ get well listen she hesitate and sink to she knee beside the bed kurt the day you be able to sit up i 'll marry you then i 'll take you home -- to you wheat-hill for a second lenore see he transform with she spirit she faith she love and it be that for which she have pray she have carry he beyond the hopelessness beyond incredulity some guidance have divinely prompt she and when he mute rapture suddenly vanish when he lose consciousness and a pale gloom and shade fall upon he face she have no fear in she own room she unleash the strange bond on she feeling and suffer they recurrent surge and strife until relief and calmness return to she then come a flash uplift of soul a great and beautiful exaltation lenore feel that she have be gifted with incalculable power she have pierce dorn 's fatalistic consciousness with the truth and glory of possible life as oppose to the dark and evil morbidity of war she see for herself the wonderful and terrible stair of sand which woman have be climb all the age and must climb on to the height of solid rock of equality of salvation for the human race she see woman the primitive the female of the species but she see she also as the mother of the species make to save as well as perpetuate learn from the agony of child-birth and child-care the meaning of he who say thou shalt not kill tremendous would be the final resistance of woman to the brutality of man woman be to be the savior of humanity it seem so simple and natural that it could not be otherwise lenore realize with a singular conception of the splendor of its truth that when most woman have find themselves they mission in life as she have find hers then would come a end to violence to greed to hate to war to the black and hideous imperfection of mankind with all she intellect and passion lenore oppose the theory of the scientist and biologist if they prove that strife and fight be necessary to the development of man that without violence and bloodshed and endless contention the race would deteriorate then she would say that it would be better to deteriorate and to die woman all would declare against that and in fact would never believe she would never believe with she heart but if she intellect be force to recognize certain theory then she must find a way to reconcile life to the inscrutable design of nature the theory that continual strife be the very life of plant bird beast and man seem verify by every reaction of the present but if these thing be fix materialistic rule of the existence of animated form upon the earth what then be god what be the drive force in kurt dorn that make war-duty some kind of murder which overthrow he mind what be the love in she heart of all live thing and the nameless sublime faith in she soul if we poor creature _ must _ fight say lenore and she mean this for a prayer let the woman fight eternally against violence and let the man forever fight they destructive instinct \* \* \* \* \* from that hour the condition of kurt dorn change for the better doctor lowell admit that lenore have be the one medicine which might defeat the death that all except she have believe inevitable lenore be permit to see he a few minute every day for which fleeting interval she must endure the endless hour but she discover that only when he be rational and free from pain would they let she go in what dorn 's condition be all the rest of the time she could not guess but she begin to get inkling that it be very bad dad i be go to insist on stay with kurt as -- as long as i want assert lenore when she have make up she mind this worried anderson and he appear at a loss for word i tell kurt i would marry he the very day he could sit up continued lenore by george that account exclaim she father he be be tryin ' to sit up a ' we have have hell with he dad he will get well and all the sooner if i can be with he more he love I i feel i be the only thing that counteract -- the -- the madness in he mind -- the death in he soul anderson make one of he violent gesture i believe you that hit I with a bang it take a woman lenore what be you idea i want to -- to marry he murmur lenore to nurse he -- to take he home to he wheat-fields you shall have you way reply anderson begin to pace the floor it can not do any harm it might save he a ' anyway you 'll be he wife -- if only for by george we 'll do it you never give I a wrong hunch in you life but girl it 'll be hard for you to see he when -- when he have the spell spell echo lenore yes you have be tell that he rave but you do

administrator say the addition in he state be 40 per cent instead of the early estimate of 20 per cent throughout the spring area the plant have a good start and be in excellent condition it may be that the yield will rise to 300000000 bushel make a total of about 900000000 from such a crop 280000000 could be export in normal time and by conservation the surplus can easily be enlarged to 350000000 or even 400000000 in canada also estimate of acreage increase have be too low it be say that the addition in alberta be 20 per cent but recent report make it 40 per cent canada may harvest a

will be a ample supply of wheat for the foe of germany at port which can easily be reach in addition the large surplus stock in australium and argentina will be available when ship can be spare for

that be selfish but i have live a ' i reckon i have no more to ask for lenore could not help be sad in the midst of she increase happiness joy to some bring to other only gloom life be sunshine and storm -- youth and age this morning she find kathleen entertaining dorn this be the second time the child have be permit to see he and the immense novelty have not yet worn off kathleen be a hero-worshiper if she have be devote to dorn before he absence she now manifest symptom of complete idolatry lenore have forbid she to question dorn about anything in regard to the war kathleen never break she promise but it be plain that dorn have read the mute anguished wonder and flame in she eye when they rest upon he empty sleeve and evidently have tell she thing kathleen be white wide-eyed and beautiful then with all a child 's imagination stir i have be tell kathie how i lose my arm explain dorn i hate german i hate war cry kathleen passionately my dear hate they always say dorn when kathleen have go lenore ask dorn if he think it be right to tell the child always to hate german right exclaim dorn with a queer laugh every day now he show sign of stronger personality lenore what i go through have confuse my sense of right and wrong some day perhaps it will all come clear but lenore all my life if i live to be ninety i shall hate german oh kurt it be too soon for you to -- to be less narrow less passionate reply lenore with hesitation i understand the day will come when you 'll not condemn a people because of a form of government -- of military class it will never come assert dorn positively lenore people in we country do not understand they be too far away from reality but i be six month in france i have see the ruin village thousand of refugee -- and i have meet the hun at the front i _ know _ i have see the reality in regard to this war i can only feel you have get to go over there and see for yourself before you realize you _ can _ understand this -- that but for you and you power over I i would be a worn-out emotionally _ burnt _ out man but through you i seem to be reborn still i shall hate german all my life and in the after-life what ever that may be i could give you a thousand reason one ought to suffice you have read of course about the regiment of frenchman call blue devil i meet some of they -- get friendly with they they be great -- beyond word to tell one of they tell I that when he regiment drive the hun out of he own village he have find he mother disembowel he wife violate and murder he sister leave a maimed thing to become the mother of a hun he daughter carry off and he little son cripple for life these be cold fact as long as i live i will never forget the face of that frenchman when he tell I have he cause to hate the hun have i i see all that in the face of those hun who would have kill I if they could lenore cover she face with she hand oh -- horrible be there nothing -- no hope -- only she falter and break down lenore because there be hate do not prove there be nothing left listen the last fight i have be with a boy i do not know it when we meet i be rush head down bayonet low i see only he body he blade that clash with mine to I he weapon feel like a toy in the hand of a child i sweep it aside -- and lunge he scream ' _ kamarad _ ' before the blade reach he too late i run he through then i look a boy of nineteen he never ought to have be force to meet I it be murder i see he die on my bayonet i see he slide off it and stretch out i do not hate _ he _ then i would have give my life for he i hate what he represent that moment be the end of I as a soldier if i have not be in range of the explode shell that down I i would have drop my rifle and have stand strengthless before the next hun so you see though i kill they and though i hate now there be something -- something strange and inexplicable that something be the divine in you it be god oh believe it my husband cry lenore dorn somberly shake he head god i do not find god out there i can not see god 's hand in this infernal war but _ i _ can what call you so resistlessly what make you go you know the debt i think i ought to pay and duty to my country then when the debt be pay the duty fulfil -- when you stand stricken at sight of that poor boy die on you bayonet -- what happen in you soul i do not know but i see the wrong of war the wrong to he -- the wrong to I i thought of no one else certainly not of god if you have stay you bayonet -- if you have spare that boy as you would have do have you see or hear he in time -- what would that have be pity maybe or scorn to slay a weaker foe no no no -- i can not accept that reply lenore passionately can you see beyond the physical i see only that man will fight and that war will come again out there i learn the nature of man if there be divinity in you there be divinity in every man that will oppose war -- end it eventually man be not teach right education and religion will bring peace on earth good-will to man no they will not they never have do so we have educate man and religious man yet war come despite they the truth be that life be a fight civilization be only skin-deep underneath man be still a savage he be a savage still because he want the same he have to have when he live in primitive state war be not necessary to show how every man fight for food clothing shelter to-day it be call competition in business look at you father he have fight and beat man like neuman look at the wheat farmer in my country look at the iww they all fight look at the child they fight even at they game they play be a make-believe battle or escape or funeral or capture it must be then that some kind of strife be implant in the first human and that it be necessary to life survival of the fittest exclaimed lenore in earnest bitterness kurt we have change you be face reality and i be face the infinite you represent the physical and i the spiritual we must grow into harmony with each other we can not ever hope to learn the unattainable truth of life there be something beyond we -- something infinite which i believe be god my soul find it in you the first effect of the war upon you have be trouble sacrifice pain and horror you have come out of it impair physically and with mind still cloud these will pass and therefore i beg of you do not grow fix in absolute acceptance of the fact of evolution and materialism they can not be deny i grant i see that they be reality but also i see beyond they there be some great purpose run through the age in we day the german have rise and in the eye of most of the world they brutal force tend to halt civilization and kill idealism but that be only apparent -- only temporary we shall come out of this dark time better finer wiser the history of the world be a proof of a slow growth and perfection it will never be attain but be not the growth a beautiful and divine thing do it now oppose a hopeless prospect life be inscrutable when i think -- only think without faith -- all seem so futile the poet say we be here as on a darkling plain sweep by confused alarm of struggle and flight where ignorant army clash by night trust I my husband there be something in woman -- the instinct of creation -- the mother -- that feel what can not be express it be the hope of the world the mother burst out dorn i think of that -- in you suppose i have a son and war come in he day suppose he be kill as i kill that poor boy how then could i reconcile that with this this something you feel so beautifully this strange sense of god this faith in a great purpose of the age lenore tremble in the exquisite pain of the faith which she pray be begin to illumine dorn 's dark and tragic soul if we be bless with a son -- and if he must go to war -- to kill and be kill -- you will reconcile that with god because we son shall have be teach what you should have be teach -- what must be teach to all the son of the future what will -- that be query dorn the meaning of life -- the truth of immortality reply lenore we live on -- we improve that be enough for faith how will that prevent war it will prevent it -- in the year to come mother will take good care that child from babyhood shall learn the _ consequence _ of fight -- of war boy will learn that if the meaning of war to they be the wonder of charge and thunder of cannon and medal of distinction to they mother the meaning be loss and agony they will learn the terrible difference between you fury and eagerness to lunge with bayonet and you horror of achievement when the disemboweled victim lie before you the glory of a statue to the great general means countless and nameless grave of forget soldier the joy of the conquer army contrast terribly with the pain and poverty and unquenchable hate of the conquer i see what you mean rejoin dorn such teaching of child would change the man of the future it would mean peace for the generation to come but as for my boy -- it would make he a poor soldier he would not be a fighter he would fall easy victim to the son of the father who have not teach this beautiful meaning of life and terror of war i would want my son to be a man that teaching -- would make he -- all the more a man say lenore begin to feel faint but not in the sense of muscle strength courage endurance i would rather there never be peace than have my son inferior to another man 's my hope for the future be that _ all _ man will come to teach they son the wrong of violence lenore never will that day come reply dorn she see in he the inevitableness of the masculine attitude the difference between man and woman the preponderance of blood and energy over the higher motive she feel a weak little woman array against the whole of mankind but she could not despair unquenchable as the sun be this fire within she but it _ might _ come she insist gently but with inflexible spirit yes it might -- if man change you have change yes i do not know myself if we do have a boy will you let I teach he what i think be right lenore go on softly lenore as if i would not he exclaim i try to see you way but just because i can not i 'll never oppose you teach _ I _ if you can she kiss he and kneel beside he bed grieve to see shadow return to he face yet thrill that the way seem open for she to inspire but she must never again choose to talk of war of materialism of anything calculate to make he look into darkness of he soul to ponder over the impairment of he mind she remember the great specialist speaking of lesion of the organic system of a loss of brain cell she inspiration must be love charm care -- a healing and building process she would give herself in all the unutterableness and immeasurableness of she woman 's heart she would order she life so that it would be a fulfilment of he education of a heritage from he father a passion bear in he a noble work through which surely he could be save -- the cultivation of wheat do you love I she whisper do i nothing could ever change my love for you i be you wife you know the shadow leave he face be you really lenore anderson lenore dorn it be a beautiful name now it do sound sweet but you -- my wife never will i believe you will have to -- very soon why a light warm and glad and marveling shone in he eye indeed lenore feel then a break in the strange aloofness of he -- in he impersonal gentle acceptance of she relation to he to-morrow i be go to take you home to you wheat-hills chapter xxxii lenore tell she conception of the history and the romance of wheat to dorn at this critical time when it be necessary to give a trenchant call to hope and future in the begin man 's struggle be for life and the mainstay of life be food perhaps the original discoverer
