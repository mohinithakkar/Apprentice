the log of a noncombatant by horace green staff correspondent of the new york evening post special correspondent of the boston journal 1915 preface in the follow page the ego be thickly spread they publication be the result of persuasion from many source that before return to the war zone i should put into connected form my personal experience as correspondent during the first year of the war of nation a few of these adventure be mention in news letter from the continent where i limited myself so far as possible to description of army at war and people in time of stress but the greater part of they be merely jot down from time to time for my own benefit in the log of a noncombatant contents i from broadway to ghent ii the second bombardment of termonde iii captive iv a clog dance on the scheldt v the bombardment of antwerp vi the surrender of antwerp vii spy on spy viii the sorrow of the people appendix : atrocity the log of a noncombatant chapter i from broadway to ghent when the war break out in August 1914 i be at work in the city room of the new york evening post one morning during the first week of activity the copy boy hand I a telegram which be sign luther boston and contain the rather cryptic message : -- how about this fight it be some moment before i could recall the time more than two year before when i have last see the writer willard b luther boston lawyer devotee of some and critic of many kind of sport we have be sit on that previous occasion -- a crowd of college fellow include luther and myself -- in a certain room in cambridge massachusett not far from the university in that neighborhood where luther have attend the law school and the rest of we on we respective graduation day have receive valuable piece of parchment with the presidential signature attach the conversation have already run through the question of vote for woman progressive politics and prize-fight and before the card game begin it have settle on the last-named chiefly because of my own vainglorious description of adventure at reno nevada at the time of the jeffries-johnson battle for the heavyweight championship of the world i remember tell with some gusto of my first newspaper interview -- one with bob fitzsimmon then the old man of the ring and gentleman jim corbett who be jeffry ' trainer at reno i have always want to see that performance say luther and would have go in a flash if i could have get any one to make the trip with I but remember this fact : whenever the next big fight be hold i be go with you later in the evening we shake hand on the proposition at the time that luther 's telegram come i be plan to start for the continent as staff correspondent of the new york evening post and special correspondent of the boston journal remember that cambridge agreement i immediately wire : -- yes this fight will do so that be how it come to pass that luther and myself board the campanium together land in liverpool cast about for way and means of get into the scrimmage and for the first month and a half of my four month of wander on the continent be brother conspirator until the duty of partnership call my friend home and leave I without a companion in adventure in london we absorb to some extent a heavy british fog and to a greater extent british public opinion we marvel at the exterior calm of a nation plunge in the greatest of war yet fight so it seem at the time with its top hat on and its smile still undisturbed across the english channel three day later the dutch steam packet princess juliana carry we safely through mine field and between lane of british torpedo boat and torpedo boat destroyer we land on the continent at flush thence we head for the hague holland the neutral gateway of northern europe where we find the american minister dr henry van dyke and he first secretary marshall langhorne shoulder the work of the american legation in its chameleonesque capacity as bank post-office detective bureau bureau of information charity organization and one might even say temporary home for the stranded traveler of every rank and nation antwerp the temporary capital of belgium be at this time invest but not yet besiege by the german army on the south the city be already cut off by several regiment of the ninth and tenth german army corps under general von boehn the river scheldt and the dutch border form a wall on the north and west it be to antwerp therefore that we determine to go after listen to the usual flood of warning against enter the fight zone and drinking we fill of story of atrocity and hate which every refugee bring across the border into holland we take a couple of reef in we baggage and hoist we knapsack set we course for the temporary belgian capital by rail we travel south across the level field and lush green meadow of holland over bridge ready to be dynamite in case of invasion and through training camp of the 450000 dutch soldier then mobilize along the border at a little town call eschen the train stop because the belgian have tear up the track seat on the cross-piece of a joggle two-wheeled ox cart move at the rate of not more than four mile a hour with a dumb specimen for a driver and a volume of baedeker for interpreter and guide we get we first glimpse of the hideous thing call war judge from the look of the country and the burning village we be on the heel of a devastating army for three four and five mile on either side of the road beautiful tree lay flat upon the ground it be not until we see group of belgian soldier tear down they own wall and hedge and apply match and gasolene to those which still stand that we realize that this be a case of self-inflicted destruction farmhouse store church old belgian mansion and windmill be either in flame or smoulder ruin where burning have not be sufficient powder and dynamite have be apply to destroy landmark which for century have be the country 's pride as far as the eye could reach the countryside be flatten to a desert it remind I of the salem fire through which while the pile of debris be still smoking i have be take in the boston journal 's car but instead of a single town here for twenty mile along lay stretch a smouldering waste the devastation be for the defensive purpose of give a unobstructed view to the cannon of antwerp 's outer fortification which on that side cover one sector of the circle sweep by she enormous gun i should hesitate to mention the million of dollar of self-inflicted damage to antwerp 's suburb alone luther and i do not at the time have the military password so that first day be a specimen in the matter of hold-up and arrest from the time that we start across the level plain which approach the city until we get through the double sector of fort we be stop question and search by thirteen different group of soldier there be marry occasion where after one pair of stupid sentry have put we through the grill a second pair watch from a distance of thirty yard or so promptly repeat the entire performance as these fellow speak only flemish dialect we conversation be not particularly fluent frequently there gather around we a crowd of gaping peasant and when the word americaine come out there be oh 's and ah of astonishment or as often when we explanation be not believe sibilant hiss that shape themselves into the menacing word spion we have be lead to believe that sooner or later a wool-witted sentry would shoot first and investigate later but so far they have simply cross bayonet or with they hand up and palm outward have signal we to halt we experience that day as later event prove be not a extraordinary occurrence for war-time especially for those endeavor to gain entrance to a invest city but as we first and maiden adventure it somewhat shake we nerve when the grilling be over we feel about as guilty as any criminal who have be put through the third degree as practice in the old police department day and i have several time to look over my passport and letter of credentials to persuade myself that i be really not a spy eventually we be permit to pass the gate of the gare du nord once inside the city gate we make we way into the place verte and go directly to the hotel st antoine whose proprietor send we name to police headquarters the st antoine be at that time the residence of the diplomatic corps and the belgian minister of state and be fifty yard from the royal palace and across the street from headquarters of the belgian general staff there be no need of describe in detail antwerp at the time of my first visit one or two picture will suffice to give a rough idea of its existence up to the time of the bombardment try to imagine for example go about you business in new york or boston or lo angele -lrb- of course antwerp be smaller than these -rrb- when you country a territory perhaps the size of the new england state be already two third overrun burnt smash and conquer by a hostile nation whose force be now within nineteen mile of the gate of the capital imagine that nation 's warrior in the act of crush you tiny army whose remnant be already exhaust and on the verge of despair then picture a quaint sleepy city with shadowy alley and twist gabled street in which every other store and house be decorate with king albert 's picture or drape in the red black and yellow banner of the country-a city whose atmosphere be charge with fear and suspicion and excitement sometimes a crowd of a thousand or two draw one toward the central station where bedraggled refugee family just arrive from liege termonde aerschot and maline stand on street corner or wagon top and thrill the crowd with tale of atrocity and the story of they flight from they burning home to the south now and then the crowd part before the clang bell of a red cross ambulance rush its load of bleed body to the hospital along the place de meir nurse male or female clung to the ambulance step the first one i see make a vivid impression on I she be a english-looking girl in a new khaki skirt support with one hand what be leave of a blood-dripping head -- the eye and nose be shoot away -- while out of the other hand she eat with apparent relish a thick rye-bread sandwich occasionally she wave remnant of the sandwich at the gaping crowd it strike I as a peculiarly unnecessary exhibition of she callous fitness for the job of nurse during the daytime the ordinary thing of life go on for the good burgher and shopkeeper go about they business as usual and generally speak fight against fear as bravely as the soldier in the trench stand up against the german howitzer it be only after dark -lrb- when martial law permit no light of any kind -rrb- that the city seem to shiver and suck in its breath door be barricade iron shutter come down and behind they the people talk in whisper military auto fresh from the firing line groan and sputter at the doorstep of the st antoine soldier with pocket lantern stamp about the street from sheer nervousness after a day of confinement some citizen in spite of warning grope about the more important avenue at night picture yourself on broadway or tremont street with not a light on the street gleam from a window and walk up and down with one hand on you wallet and the other in the pocket where you colt automatic ought to be such very briefly be the condition of antwerp at the time when we arrive that very evening word come in that the belgian force which have be engage with the enemy for five consecutive day of severe fighting have retire behind the southern rampart of the city during the night the stream of incoming wounded confirm the news of battle in the moonlight and later in the gray dawn i watch the long line of belgian hound pull they rapid-fire gun out toward the trench many time later i be destine to see they they make a picturesque and stimulate sight -- those faithful dog of war -- fetter and harness they tongue hang out as they lay patiently beneath the gun truck await the order to go into action or when the word have be give trot along the dusty road each pair tug to the battle front a lean gray engine of destruction for we purpose the best approach to brussels be by way of ghent luther push on ahead while i be finish a story the follow morning shoulder my knapsack which now contain a extra supply of army ration and carefully stuff my different set of credentials in different pocket -lrb- one for belgian one for german and one for english consumption -rrb- i cross the river scheldt and make a slow and tortuous railway journey to ghent ghent lie thirty mile west of antwerp the trip take seven hour during the course of it i pass north of the belgian line and through the western sector of fort that be to say fort st nichola fort haesdonck and fort tete de flandre it be the same road along which winston churchill 's english marine and the remnant of the belgian force retreat after the fall of antwerp ghent resound with praise of its american vice-consul julius van hee a hair-trigger politician and a live wire if there ever be one van hee with he intimate knowledge of four language and the yankee knack of be on the right spot at the right time twice save blood-shed in the street of ghent and in one instance probably prevent a repetition of the scene at louvain in ghent i again find luther with a fine young rumor in he pocket -- a rumor which turn out to be correct -- that six german spy be to be execute next morning at sunrise the place mention be behind the museum in a public park i suppose we 'll take it in say luther i do not know about that i answer add that although execution might be part of the day 's work for a war correspondent i draw the line at see my first murder before breakfast the tip be correct enough except that it mention the wrong park the follow noon the military governor accord to regulation cause to be post circular announce that the man have be put to death but at all event i be glad to say that at that early date i do not have the experience of watch six blindfold wretch back up against a wall of see the officer drop he arm as a signal and of hear the fatal crack of a dozen musket as the body collapse like a telescope crumple inward with the chin upon the chest and fall forward to the earth chapter ii the second bombardment of termonde September 15th be we day with henry verhagen the tall gray alderman of the town that be once termonde during all the time i be with he verhagen do not speak a bitter word on the contrary he be calm -- particularly calm as he stand beside the mound where the belgian soldier be bury in the center of the ruin town point to the pile of brick where he have live and tell we how in two night he have lose 340000 franc he son he factory and he home it be from he from the burgomaster 's wife and from a priest that we learn the story of the city that have cease to be it be the night before that i have wander into ghent alone without even the excitement of get arrest luther who become restive early the next morning while i be jot note in the log-book go off in search of adventure because of the influence exert by vice - consul van hee a arrangement be very soon make whereby a belgian government car and chauffeur be place at we disposal we have no laissez-passer for the firing line but we be accompany by the united state consul and not govern by any stipulation as to we destination in we belgian car decorate with all the american flag we could find and american consular service paste in huge letter on the windshield and side flap we race along the boulevard de l'lndustrie swing into the southern suburb and once outside the city limit we open up the exhaust and throw down the throttle as van hee shout out the order : -- to termonde termonde be at that time the scene of determine fighting between unit of the ninth german corps and the belgian defender situate as it be twenty-one mile southeast of ghent it mark the southwest corner of a square form by louvain and termonde on the south by ghent and antwerp on the north it control the bridge over the river scheldt and with it a important approach to antwerp the capital at that time of belgium the heavy german siege gun capable of demolish a first-class fort at a range of several mile could not have cross the river so easily at any other point for this reason the german particularly want termonde -- a open bridge to antwerp be always worth the take the town have already at that time be capture and recapture wounded and refugee be swarm into ghent full of battle story and tale of terrible atrocity so it be termonde that we vow we would see we first see verhagen trudge in the same direction as ourselves on the level dusty road two mile southwest of ghent as we approach a cross-road mark by a tavern a couple of direction-post and nondescript stucco building we make out two belgian sentry with they rifle lift overhead and indulge in some acrobatic exercise which we interpret as a signal to halt van hee swap cigarette with they and gossip in they native tongue in return for which they give we some good advice they warn we to pay no attention to sign-post which in order to fool the enemy be either mark with false name or else be point in the wrong direction while we be talk a tall gray alderman come along the road with a greasy package under he arm and at he side a priest -- one of those ubiquitous black-robed figure with a hat like a inverted oatmeal bowl where to ask the vice-consul of ghent a dendermonde -lrb- to termonde -rrb- answer verhagen size we up as stranger and use french instead of the local flemish dialect you know the road yes well say verhagen and so partly because of charity and partly because we could have he as a useful guide we take he into the car as we speed through the level lane of poplar challenge as usual by every belgian regular or garde civique who could boast a uniform the smooth green meadow of flander with they trim hamlet of stucco and tile seem to deny the report of savagery we have hear the night before we have be tell and we have read of german atrocity and we have talk with survivor of louvain there be pillage burning and looting in louvain we have agree but the cruelty to woman and child be the better part myth and at all event there be a semblance of cause for that perhaps there have be more resistance more snipe by citizen than generally know and perhaps the german side have not be fully explain then suddenly termonde lay before we the center of the bridge be go splintered timber sticking on end lay in the mud at the river 's side along with iron beam tear by the charge of dynamite the current be choke with mass of steel and wood we crawl across some temporary beam reconstruct by belgian engineer and enter the ruin with a handful of termonde 's citizen who have come back for the first time to see what be leave of they home i will take you to the center say verhagen that be where my house be a quarter of a mile behind we as the alderman sit upon a rock beside the gravestone lay the thin neck of the upper scheldt less than one hundred yard wide at this point where it curve between the line of char and flatten building we could still see the rush of water tumble and splash through the wreckage of the bridge we have just cross twice it have be dynamite and twice rebuild in part so that at present a single line of slippery beam suspend a few foot above the water and support by some heavy wire be all that remain between ourselves and the retreat road to ghent from the direction of alost come the desultory boom of german gun across the stream behind we the belgian outpost while away the time with cigarette and card shaggy horse doze against the gun truck and the man of artillery some stretch at full length in the sun other sit bolt upright with arm fold sleep soundly on the gun carriage we could hear the stream gurgle we could hear the creak of a lazy windmill and come somewhere from the smoking pile the hideous howl of starve hound of other human sound there be none except the voice of verhagen ten day before termonde have be a thriving town that day it be a heap of smoulder ash america have hear a good deal about tirlemont and louvain but not much of termonde because this be a war of million it do not count in the news -- for it be only a community of twelve thousand inhabitant as pretty and quaint as the province of flander boast the prosperous center of its rope and cordage manufacture with fifteen hundred house barrack two statue a town-hall five church a orphan asylum and a convent now only one of the church stand as well as the building where the officer be quarter the museum of antiquity and perhaps a dozen other across the moat which lead to the gateway of what be formerly the inner fortification be pile of rot horseflesh the bronze statue of de smet the jesuit missionary look calmly on the scene all the rest be blot out there be no sign of hot-tempered impetuous work of a handful of drunken uhlan a fire start in anger and drive by the wind throughout the entire town there be not a breath of wind that the night be calm be show by the fact that here and there single house even house build of board be spare at the commander 's word the convent be burnt and pillaged stone and mortar litter the street in front of the hotel de ville and upon the sidewalk lay the famous bell which come crash to the street below when shell burst in the belfry from cellar to garret nearly every remain house be systematically drench with naphtha and the torch apply and when all be over hundred of gallon be toss into the river scheldt over a small group of house in the poorer section of the city where the prostitute be quarter grim prussian humor or perhaps a sense of value receive have prompt the conqueror to write in great white chalk mark in german script gute leute nicht brennen -lrb- good people do not burn -rrb- for a hour we walk through the silence of ash and stone stumble over timber and debris tangled and twisted wire a fall statue broken bell or the cross-piece of a spire we make we way through pile of bed chair singe mattress and step over the carcass of a horse with its belly bloated and fly feast on its glassy eye we enter a apothecary shop where the clock still tick upon the counter think there could be no reason of war to call for the destruction of the orphan asylum we enter its portal to investigate before we lay burnt bed and litter glass we search what ten day before have be a convent and crawl over heap of log and brick into narrow alley that remind one of naple or pompeius -- alley where the wall stand so close as to hide the light of sun but not the odor of char vat and sewage and smoulder smell thing long dead not far from there the way widen into the light and before we break the ray of sunset stand the cross above a heap of cobblestone they be bury here say verhagen and here too be my house another alderman a friend of verhagen who have be allow to remain in termonde most of the four day that the german stay have the story detail in he little pocket diary on Thursday September 3 he say he be just leave he rope and twine factory when he hear the sound of musketry to the south a small force of belgian outpost be completely surprise by a part of the ninth german army corps under general von boehn they be completely outclass before retreat however they let the enemy have a couple of volley in the return fire they lose six of they man they then retreat into the town and across the bridge nothing happen after dark but the next morning at nine o'clock the cannonading start inside of half a hour accord to the villager the entire german force of the one hundred and sixty-second and one hundred and sixty-third uhlan and the ninetieth regiment of infantry of the ninth army corps be in the town they enter simultaneously by three different road the burgomaster be order immediately to provide ration for the regiment but the burgomaster be away he be give twelve hour to return when he do not return the burning begin accord to the townspeople the soldier do not wish to burn the town say one man but the order be order of war he recount that four uhlan enter he house with a bow and a knock at the door politely help themselves to he cellar drink a toast to he wife put he chair in the street and sit there play he phonograph they say they be sorry but the house must be burnt but before pour on the naphtha and light the flame they free he canary bird verhagen and the priest agree that fright bring on a attack to a woman about to become a mother and that she fall in the rue de l'eglise a german lieutenant see the trouble put she on a stretcher make of window shutter and call the german army doctor she be send to a field hospital and tenderly care for until she and the child could be move such incident in strange relief tell by man who have lose everything lend corroboration if such be necessary to the burden of they story of the relentless destruction of the town itself we little band be the first to enter the ruin of termonde after its abandonment by the ninth german army corps and by a coincidence we be the last to leave that very evening at precisely the time we be crawl across the broken timber that span the scheldt and connected we with belgium-owned belgium the german again pump heavy artillery fire into the town this be later know as the second german bombardment and occupation of termonde because of superior artillery range the attack have the cruel advantage of the man who can strike and still stay out of reach on that evening at six-thirty the teuton send a few warning shell into the debris and then the first column of scout enter simultaneously by the two southern gate it be just at six-thirty that we party start back for ghent as we crawl across on all four the remain beam crack beneath we foot and the belgian engineer call on we to hurry oh tiber father tiber we think as the last of we get across but unlike horatius at the bridge we be on the right side when engineer apply the match to a small charge of dynamite and the beam crash and the remain plank of termonde 's bridge writhe and twist in the rush water twenty-seven mile away when we whirl through the gate of ghent later in the evening we say au revoir to verhagen and the mendicant priest and go to we room at midnight come a rap at the door my gray-haired alderman break into the room burst with the latest news he eye aflame with excitement revanche he exclaim dramatically we enemy have pay for it in blood sure enough after a few preliminary shell -- a sort of here-we-come salvo -- the head of the german column have enter and a party of staff officer for purpose of reconnaissance immediately mount the spire of the only remain church the officer of the ninth german army corps sweep the landscape with they glass but the level plain give nothing to they sight they see only the ash of termonde the river and the straight stretch of sandy road and stucco hamlet beyond they do not notice a valley of covered ground and a quarter-mile stretch of tree and shrubbery where three squad of belgian field artillery be neatly hide here the man take cover at the first sound of cannonade quietly in they retreat the belgian artillery officer have figure the range and elevation of the cathedral tower not over fifteen hundred yard away just as darkness be set in and the figure in the belfry be clearly visible the battery sergeant sharply drop he arm c-r-r-m-p-h cough the field piece as the gunner draw the lever home there be four sharp report four flash of flame and smoke the crescendo moan of ton of fly steel -- and the church tower the bell and the german officer come crash to the ground chapter iii captive up to the day that luther and i go through the belgian trench near alost and get into the hand of the german outpost north of brussels we have not see nearly as much fighting as we wish we have look upon the ear-mark and horrible result of battle have hear gun smell the blood and ether of wound and see the ruin over which have roll the wave of battle we know that ahead of we there have be much fighting in the sempst-alost-vilvorde - tirlemont region the german at that moment if not actually advance toward antwerp be skirmish and make feint in every direction with the ultimate disposition of they force carefully conceal of course we have no official permission to be at the front with either army in fact up to that point we have receive nothing but official threat on the subject of what would happen to we in case we go ahead but as no one do more than threaten we keep on go since we prefer that mode of procedure to sit around in pari or berlin on the chance of one of those personally conduct tour of inspection whose purpose be to show the correspondent everything except actual fight it be we hope during that early part of the war to see as much as possible of the german army realize that if capture we should undoubtedly be send either backward or forward along the german line of communication in conquer belgium once within the german outpost we plead like brer rabbit not to be throw into the german brier patch so of course we land in it after a few day in brussels they ship we eastward to aix-la-chapelle by way of lou-vain tirlemont and liege it be two day after the second bombardment of termonde -- at 7 be to be exact -- that luther and i start from ghent for brussels in a military automobile the property of the belgian government and again loan for the occasion to julius van hee american vice - consul then act consul at ghent we carry with we a united state government mail pouch a packet of mail from dr henry van dyke at the hague address to brand whitlock the american minister at brussels and another packet of mail from henry w diederick unite state consul-general at antwerp mr van hee hope to obtain from the german authority in brussels some smallpox vaccine to take back to ghent where a smallpox epidemic be fear once out of the town limit of ghent we bowl along at top speed with the american color tremble fore and aft and impressive - look sign paste on windshield and side-flap the autumn rain descend heavily upon we drenching everything except the carefully protected mail bag six mile southeast of ghent we run into a regiment of belgian infantry move back from the direction of brussels and farther on a squad of cavalry and some more cavalry outpost then two company of bicycle patrol the man with they head bent over the handlebars mauser sling over they shoulder pedal heavily through the mud and slush of a cold September storm a few mitrailleus know as the minerva type and mount on armored motor-car be train on the ravine through which the road dip a thousand yard ahead of we they have sight the german outpost on the crest of a hill opposite we about three quarter of a mile away in a very poor kind of trench hastily construct in the beet-field and little more than body deep the man lay on they belly in the mud nervously finger they musket and adjust the sight a third company of bicycle scout be order to advance for the purpose of draw fire i doubt if that particular body of man have ever before be under fire never be the fear of death more plainly write on human face all of the man go ahead without flinch or fail but the muscle of they jaw be knot they face be the color of chalk and one or two dismount for a moment subject to the physical effect of fear i have see man tremble before important physical contest : jeffry step into the prize ring at reno nevada ready for the beating of he life and the loss of reputation i have see murderer condemn to death charle becker as i watch he take he death sentence that evening in the criminal court build do not give one the same uncanny feeling as this handful of belgian scout pedal out to meet the german fire i do not intend to say the belgian be not brave man for this be a isolate instance and indeed there be something gruesome about that little company offer for the slaughter simply for the purpose of locate the german battery the man understand the meaning of the order and appreciate the odds against they the mitrailleus point down the road we be head on and the belgian gun-captain tell we they be go to clean thing up as soon as they own scout draw fire and the first teuton helmet appear above the crest naturally we be order back have we continue on this road we should have be between the belgian fire behind and the german fire in front for the german would undoubtedly have mistake we for a scout party in a armored car as it be luther jump to the wheel and insist on see the thing through we go ahead for about half a mile i tell he that if the shrapnel begin to burst too close he would find I tuck safely underneath the car examine the gasoline tank or in the nearest farmhouse cellar and i believe he would have but nothing come close to we on that occasion my real baptism be reserve for another day because van hee suddenly wrench the wheel from luther and turn we machine down a side road it be a case of out of the firing line into the frying-pan for the side road lead we into a trap from which there be no turn back -- the territory patrol by the burly picket of the ninth german army corps form part of the kaiser 's army of occupation in brussels out of earshot and certainly out of sight of that skirmish we be speed at a great rate along a level lonely road flank by beet-field and long line of graceful elm that shake hand overhead when : halt wohin will gehen sie ring suddenly out of the darkness as two figure jump from behind a farmhouse and level they rifle at we i shall always remember that sharp command as the cold gray muzzle follow we like a sportsman cover a bevy of quail we fat belgian chauffeur violinist in time of peace and pose that day as a american -- one of those man who look as if they would bleed water if you prick they with a bayonet -- need no second warning run the german gauntlet be not precisely he hobby down go the emergency brake and the car jolt to a sudden halt a bristle-whiskered german giant under a canvas-covered helmet stick he head through the flap and for more than ten minute he and another sentinel search we knapsack and credentials and inspect the government mail pouch which we carry the sentry be far from satisfied we say little at first realize nevertheless that we have run between the oppose trench and up to the german outpost without actually draw fire that at least be something of a comfort then as if the answer be the price of admission the big one ask we if we have see many british soldier around antwerp and ghent we have previously decide that the answer to such talk be none of you business but the fellow 's bayonet be infernally bright and sharp and he countenance like ice it be not only the equinoctial rain that make we shiver while i be try to limber up my german vocabulary he pass we along to he ober-leutenant in the hut along the roadside the ober - ieutenant be grave he say we must report to army headquarters in brussels and that under no circumstance should we be allow to return within the belgian line in this way begin we eight day ' confinement within the line of the german army of the north under general von boehn just as we have be warn repeatedly so we discover in reality that to cross between two oppose line be no joking matter bad enough particularly in the early day of the war to a correspondent without permission at the front to work up from the rear -lrb- if you have permission -rrb- be at least accord to the rule of the game but to cross between hostile army -- that be the one forbid act the fact that we be with a american consul be not sufficient three day later van hee be allow to return but the remainder of the party that be to say willard luther and myself be give a free trip into german territory and incidentally more than a week 's chance to study the german army from within those next eight day luther and i spend as willing and on the whole decently treat captive within the line of the german army of the north talk freely with cultivate officer and grimy man of the rank and in this way learn much of the german war machine the opinion of the officer and the man at they command it would be interesting to tell how in brussels we dodge from war office to cafe from cafe to consulate from consulate back to war office and later be worry and watch and suspect how we be ship back across the german border on a combination red cross and ammunition train how we be lock for much of the night in a half-mile tunnel of the northern vosge mountain and there in the grope darkness of we box-car prison share the soldier 's biscuit and he bottle so come to know the kaiser 's private as a companion and not as the barbarian he enemy paint he the day after we get inside the german line we go before major heinrich bayer at that time military commandant in brussels in the absence of general von der goltz jostle through the street and jam the courtyard of the war office be a crowd of a thousand person -- mother child whole family beg for relief or permission to leave the city limit german subject try to get pass official and employee of the civil administration take order from the military authority a relay of aide orderly and secretary lead we from courtyard to corridor and from corridor to staff headquarters and into the holy of holy -- the office of the commandant grim stern -- but courteous throughout the interview -- the major pace the floor beside he desk he seem anxious enough to be rid of the crazy american who have wander through the belgian and german line not altogether satisfy with they integrity yet not wish to take a hostile attitude i ask he when he think the war would be over at the moment the german major vice-consul van hee and i be the only person in the room i do not know he say as if think aloud i really do not know america be the only country that have not fire on we yet but all the rest -- then he add thoughtfully perhaps it be better that you go but you can not return to ghent or antwerp you must go back to germany he stop as if he have go too far and then sharply command the orderly to remove we forty-eight hour later mr van hee get he release to luther and myself be give a curious sort of pass beset with limitation which at time cause we royal treatment and as often prove a fatal baggage tag i have always believe a joker lay hidden somewhere in that document it start with a flattering description of we status -lrb- as give by ourselves -rrb- but below it direct we to be take into aix-la-chapelle germany and under no circumstance to be return within the belgian line we have see a great deal too much for that in spite of we protestation of good faith and promise to keep dark what we have see the military authority consider we much safer under german guard we be to be take on the southern route by way of namur to drive home the importance of obey this order we be remind of the regulation print in french and post throughout the city that whosoever pass the city limit or approach the fight line without military permit or on the pretense of have such a permit or whosoever deviate from the route lay down would be shoot ` sur le champ ' that same evening however army order declare that the namur route be close we get a second war office pass send we to aix by way of louvain tirlemont and liege arm with these we go down to a old major bock von w ------ in charge of transportation at schaerbeek on the outskirts of the city i show he the pass and say with a painful attempt at levity major we can not obey both of these so we be go to get shoot either way we go if it be all the same to you i would rather die on you route to my great relief the old fellow lay back he gray head and emit a series of long loud teuton laugh he be the first german i have hear laugh and it do I good i know we be safe on the understanding that the business be strictly confidential and that no other citizen or suspect be to know of it he give we a permit for the military train it have be the intention of the war office to pack we under guard with the herd on one of those government refugee train but to live and sleep with the soldier as we be now to do to see they march to absorb they uninformed and boastful talk to study they gun munitions and equipment be better than we highest hope you have to do a lot of quick transporting i ask before say good-bye to major von w ------ yes be the answer they be at we from all side some of the man we be now transport have be under fire in two country and now they will see service in a third he know that i have come from ghent and from antwerp which the german be about to bombard yet to he credit it should be say that he do not ask for information of belgian activity similarly although the soldier as a rule and one man high in the civil government of brussels ask what be go on in antwerp it be noticeable that german officer recognize the obligation of neutrality of how we leave brussels and of the first part of the eastward trip i be go to quote from the jotting in the log-book which be write up at some length after we leave aix-la-chapelle : -- early on the morning of the 22d i go up to consul watt 's office to get the mail pouch i have promise he to carry luther and i then board a trolley car go northwest past the gare du nord and on to schaerbeek a junction on the outskirts of brussels although the major bayer pass with von w ------ 's counter-signature get we as far as schaerbeek we be challenge by the guard at the railroad station the station be watch with the most astounding precaution of course there be no such thing as a ticket once inside the gate you could jump a troop train ammunition car or blow up the track if you feel like it wherefore they guard the station carefully at the gate have a terrible pow-wow with a officious bavarian who call himself the officer-of-the-day i play all my best german card include count von bemstorff letter at the end of half a hour we pig-headed officer ship we back to brussels we return to von w ------ then in brussels who vise we pass with a note to the effect that although we be civilian exceptional circumstance demand we hurry return to aix by military train when we eventually get into the schaerbeek station we have two hour to wait walk up and down the track or sit on the platform keep a eye on everything that be go on luther say i spend most of my time try not to look like a englishman occasionally when we speak a word of english some officer would shoot we a 42 cm glance and demand we papers we be undoubtedly marked figure because in the first place no civilian be allow along the railway line especially foreigner watch several westbound load go by until about two o'clock when they make up a combination train consist of red cross coach and empty freight truck go back to aix for fresh load of man and ammunition aix be the great distribute center for the line of communication into northern belgium most of the open car be empty bar occasional gun carriage on the way home for repair in the closed freight car lay a few wounded first line man a half a dozen male nurse and some private on furlough speaking of nurse i have not -- so far at least-seen a woman nurse nearer the scene of action than a base hospital ie one of the big hospital in antwerp brussels or ghent luther and i closely follow by the two guard that have trail we from the time we have get inside the station climb into a freight car apparently use as a box stall on the out trip and bare except for a pile of damp straw in one corner interminable journey most of the time we stand on siding wait for the outbound traffic make fair time to louvain -- ie a hour and a half -- and stay there two hour for which i be thankful as it give I a chance to look around interview soldier citizen and a jesuit priest of which more later one hour more to tirlemont then seven hour to liege where we arrive at 2 be be smother for two hour in that tunnel and take six and three quarter hour more from liege to vervier -- a distance of less than fifteen mile it be another five hour to aix saw tremendous troop movement along brussels-louvain-vervier line of communication during the first day thirty-five troop and transport train go past we move towards the western frontier the larger part to strengthen the german attack on antwerp which we have not long left behind we other to discharge they load as near as possible to lille tournaus and mon the average train be twenty car long make about seven hundred carload with two hundred or more in each car give a total of more than 140000 fight man we stop count at the end of the first day after we leave louvain i get out occasionally and stretch my leg along the track but luther not be able to talk german stuck pretty close to he digging have a great time at a little town call neerwinden where we stay about half a hour a crowd of soldier from we train join a group cooking supper in the moonlight at one of the soup kitchen along the track they feed I lukewarm stew and slab of rye bread then go on singing and argue without pay much attention to I one bald-headed stocky private tell the crowd the news that von hindenburg have capture warsaw later a crowd of big brute apparently pretty drunk swagger down and clap I on the back with a ` who be you my friend ' ` amerikaner ' i explain not think it necessary to mention the war correspondent part they set up a cheer clap I on the back and finally lift I to they shoulder for a triumphal ride up and down the railroad tie all the time yell out ` amerikaner hurrah amerikaner ' a few hundred year seem the night we spend lock in that box-car prison a five-day ' equinoctial storm have give way to the coldest day of the autumn : we car raw and dank as a dungeon joggle along endlessly until afternoon give way to evening and evening to chilly night hour after hour we look out upon the roll field and burnt farmhouse along the path where general von emmich 's army have pass as the moon crawl up over the rain-bathed foothill of the ourthe mountain the temperature drop far below the freezing point for age we lay awake brace against the cold the soldier next I who have be through the fight at maubeuge cough throughout the night -- a hollow retch cough tuberculosis the red cross doctor tell I although the fellow have get through he army test all right between two and four in the morning we stick in the middle of a tunnel of the northern vosge mountain two hundred foot perhaps beneath the surface of the ground the slide door on the left side of we car be lock : on the other side jagged wall drip wet to the touch jut so close that a thin man could not have walk between they and the car everywhere pitch blackness the blackness of the tomb the consumptive soldier pull a candle from he kit balance it in the straw and over it warm he hand if that candle have topple over in the straw we would not have have a rat 's chance in the fire it be impossible to get out of we car or to communicate with another except by tap the fellow in the next car must have be considerably frighten for after about a hour they begin yell and pound at the wall all you could hear be a roar sound that carome against the wall of the cavern smoke from the engine drift back to choke we it hit the consumptive worst the poor fellow begin blow and cough then roll feebly on he back and gasp during the worst of the smoke one of the soldier in the next car set up a rollick song and other follow he example we could hear the clank of beer bottle as they finish the echo of the song reverberate loudly then faintly then louder again up and down the length of that interminable vault a draught of air clear the smoke away and it do not bother we again at four in the morning we steam out of the tunnel into the open a little after that i must have doze off for i wake with a start when the consumptive stumble over I there you be he say throw a bundle beside I i think you would need it notice when he light he pipe at dawn that we have no army blanket and be pretty nearly freeze this barbarian have jump out of the car in the liege freight yard have run a quarter of a mile to the nearest army kitchen depot and have steal for we a couple of heap blanket ' full of warm dry straw it be impossible to believe that these man have commit the atrocity report at termonde and roosbeek at maline and louvain at close range it be easy to see that the prevalent conception of the barbarian be the purest kind of rot -- the picture create and foster by the ally press of a vicious and besotted beast with natural brutality accentuate by alcoholic rage with such man as individual it seem to we that neutral observer could have no quarrel to the kaiser 's private who have be fight for a cause they do not thoroughly understand be due we think the greatest respect to the officer too who understand what they be do and be game in the face of odds and most of all to the suffering german people but to the german war machine we reflect be due a terrible punishment -- the lesson it must learn not only for germany 's enlightenment but for the sake of civilization and humanity chapter iv a clog dance on the scheldt when the german major at aix-la-cha-pelle stamp on we passport : -- gesehen gut zum austritt kommandant 2 kompagnie landsturm batl aachen we be free so we think to shake the dust of germany from we foot hoist we rucksack we give up box car in favor of a civilized passenger train northward bind and at noon cross the dutch border at simplefeldt for three hour we talk english consult map take note and ask question where and when we please the holiday cost we dear at the end of that time we be under lock and key in the town of maastricht the province of limburg and the supposedly free and neutral kingdom of the netherland we suspect at the time and in view of what i learn upon a later trip to berlin i be quite certain that the long arm of the german secret service have reach out for we across the border have start from antwerp during its investment but prior to its siege by the german army we be now on the third stage of a round trip which be to land one of we back in the belgian temporary capital in time for the bombardment during the previous two week we have be stop question and sometimes examine no less than one hundred and thirty time thirteen we calculate be we average number of hold-up on we early march day that be to say during those wanderings which lead we by foot train ox cart and automobile past the double sector of antwerp 's fortification through the belgian fighting line to ghent and termonde and thence into the arm of the german picket on the outskirts of brussels and now as the heavy door of the maastricht police headquarters slam in we face and the key rattle in the guardroom lock my companion in crime throw down he hat and coat in rage between we we treat we fellow-prisoner to a quarter of a hour 's tirade on the american citizen 's right to freedom swear that the kingdom of the netherland would repent this outrage and each of we politely assure the other it be all the other fellow 's fault all of which though true have no effect on the sniffle young woman across the way nor the sleeper on the hardwood bench next mine nor the bald-headed big-lipped police sergeant who bent over he desk in the corner impervious to these usual outburst of the newly arrest as he laboriously scrawl in the police blotter the report of the day 's round-up sit down he bellow as i advance toward the pen door and try to open it when he resume he scratch i do my best to explain in a german-french-dutch dialect of my own invention that we wish to see mon le commissaire at once that we have only come to inspect the concentration camp of german and belgian prisoner and that we be leave town that day i particularly emphasize this point we be in fact i assure he in several different way leave that very afternoon -- as soon as the disagreeable mistake of we arrest be rectify he may or may not have understand this : at all event he wear a expression as blank and graven as jack rise upon the witness stand he only answer be a vacant stare at the pit of my stomach follow by a slow scratch-scratching on the police blotter in fact we arrest on that occasion be rather a jack rise affair that be to say it start by we be invite to headquarters suspicious but not certain of we status until we finally land behind the iron door without doubt maastricht authority be wait for we even as we step off the train show that we be doom from the time we leave the border we captor a unctuous pink-cheeked politzeus make he appearance not far from the internment camp where be we go and why to see the prisoner we say it be possible say the spider to the fly zat i can get for you permission if you will come to ze guardhouse ze capitain be there the guardhouse prove a precinct police station and the captain be not there : instead we find a mixed crowd of civilian and militaire who look we over and shake they head next we be take to military headquarters \ n the center of the town for fifteen minute we hunt the evasive captain while i run through my head the various set of credentials stuff in different pocket for be in dutch territory although only a few mile from the belgian frontier on one side and the german frontier on the other i be not quite certain which to produce among my letter i carry one from the german ambassador count von bernstorff to the foreign office in berlin one from professor hugo munsterberg at harvard and a note from the secretary of the belgian legation at the hague unfortunately i do not have with I at the time a very helpful letter from colonel roosevelt end with the statement that the bearer be a american citizen a non-combatant and emphatically not a spy i have promise the colonel to use this my trump card only in case of necessity -- and once on a later occasion i do so with immediate effect on the whole i now decide in favor of a united state passport decorate with my picture and enough vise to resemble the diplomatic history of the continent the captain be not here we go to the commissaire at headquarters say the polite politzeus it be then that we cut loose tell he to bring the commissaire or the burgomaster to we and start to walk off it be a bad move so far he have handle we with a velvet grip but at the first sign of insurrection he show he tooth lock arm with each of we and signal another officer to follow forthwith march we off to police headquarters and we ultimate resting-place the guardroom cell how long we stay there i do not know -- long enough at all event to get a glimpse of the dutch police system and the third degree as practice in the lowland there swing open a great iron door lead to the street and the market-place not so large but fully as busy as washington market the week before thanksgive through it sob and scream they hat go and they hair tear come two woman roughly handle by gendarme and follow by a mob escort they be throw weep and expostulate into a adjoining cell a gendarme come out with trickle of blood on he face he mop he brow and complain of feminine finger-nail close behind he follow a male friend of the imprison woman he plead with the sergeant at the desk while the moan of the woman under pressure to confess they crime come from they cell but jack rise only scratch and scratch monotonously and now and then gaze at the middle of the speaker 's stomach in the mean time we fall back into we habit of talk for publication with a intimacy that would have surprise those gentleman we refer casually to brand whitlock dr van dyke and the biggest dutch and belgian name we could think of we suspect that jack rise and the man at we side understand more english than they pretend at all event it have its effect in half a hour we be take before the commissioner two cigar lay on the edge of the table nearest we i could see at a glance that we be free do you speak english i ask he no he answer in we native tongue only french flemish german and italian -- but not english and with a grin he ask for we passport you be for the american newspaper yes i answer -- one of we be a lawyer who write occasionally i be correspondent for a new york and a boston paper but i will not cable anything from here for this reason i explain no movement of troops or news of military value could leak out ah i see say the commissioner who could not talk english a amateur correspondent and a slow correspondent but correspondent be not at all tolerate in this province it be five o'clock you will board the train leave this province at 516 pm from maastricht to the dutch capital be under usual condition a four-hour run to the north during this trip we pass encampment and fortification of the 400000 well-drilled but poorly equip troops which the kingdom of the netherland in the spirit of no negative neutrality have mobilize along she border whenever we cross a bridge every window in the entire train be fasten down and there be strict order against raise they we discover that under the boulder be carefully conceal large charge of dynamite ready for immediate use in case of invasion -- so that horatius need not be call upon while axe and crowbar be at work the window it appear be lock to prevent throw out of light cigar or match at one o'clock the next morning we train delay by war-time traffic roll into the hague station whence three day later i be to start my lucky trip into antwerp the besiege clog dancing and cognac help to get I from the hague back into antwerp in time for its bombardment and capture by the german force under general von beseler i happen to perform the clog dancing at a critical moment during a trip on a scheldt river barge thus divert the attention of the river sentry from my lack of proper papers while the pedal acrobatics be in progress my temporary friend mon le conducteur reinforce the already genial picket with many glass of the warming fluid willard luther my companion in and out of jail during the first part of the continental wanderings be force to leave for home the day after we get back to the hague he have five day to catch the lusitanium at liverpool three of they he spend on a whirlwind trip try to see action in northern flander but much to he disappointment be call away before the final scrimmage at antwerp if he have succeed in get in i rather fear the massachusett bar would have lose a valuable member he have a insatiable passion to be in the neighborhood of bullet and bomb -- not as i take it that he really want to get hit -- merely that he would like to see how close he could come on October 2d strictest regulation be pass prohibit entry within the fortification of antwerp without permit from the military governor general de guise three week earlier entry have be possible but difficult and the feat be again easier after the german occupation but during the city 's day of trial the military lid be clamp and rivet except for those come direct from england the highest civil recommendation be valueless i have one of these -- a laissez-passer from prince d'eline secretary of the belgian legation at the hague -- issue because of the fact that i be carry a large packet of mail from the american legation at the hague to henry w diederick unite state consul-general at antwerp i have also be entrust with three hundred mark to be deliver to a german prisoner lieutenant ulricus know to have be wound and capture in the fight around termonde and believe to be lie in a hospital ship in the river or in antwerp itself the fact of carry such money be of course against I as indicate german sympathy because a large part of the railroad line between eschen cappelen and antwerp have be tear up because there would be many hold-up and because i could not speak a word of flemish i decide against the overland route hearing however that l braakman & company a grain and freight shipping concern be run down barge from rotterdam i get a belgian friend to call they up on my behalf the result be a flat throw-down : without general de guise 's sanction i might not even cross the gangplank nevertheless i go to rotterdam cross the river basin to the island from which the braakman boat run and there see a director of the company who fortunately could speak both english and flemish he take I to the captain of the river barge a low craft that look a cross between a tugboat and a hudson river scow in less than three minute my case be dispose of verdict : c'est absolument defendu it be time for a little bluff a hour later i return with a new proposition have in the mean time telegraph mr diederick either to meet I at the pier at antwerp or to send a military permit display a copy of this telegram i suggest that i be allow to board if there be any one at antwerp to meet and vouch for I well and good if not they be at liberty to ship I back that be my proposition he may go as far as the border patrol fifteen mile east of antwerp the captain say to my interpreter if the river sentry permit it he may then go as far as the antwerp pier but he can not land we cast off Sunday October 4th at 6 be the little telegraaf iii poke she nose through the blue-gray haze of a chilly October morning while the muddy water of the meuse slap coldly against she bow i stamp the deck a few time wonder if there be a english-speaking soul aboard and lean up against the engine room until the odor of coffee and bacon lure I to the fo ` castle hatch a purple-faced giant with thick lip that meet like the half of a english muffin block the companion-way ` jour growl the face as though it hate to say it then point to the food and cognac this be monsieur le conducteur ship 's cook barkeeper and collector of fare in the center of a dark cabin litter with chart pail and flemish newspaper be a kitchen table now and then a smoking oil lamp flare up to throw a light on the face of my fellow-passenger five of they in addition to the captain and mon le conducteur they be as i discover later mon a albrecht a lead alderman of antwerp and a friend of mon vo the burgomaster a light-haired belgian piano salesman who could speak five language mile blanche ravinet of look beautiful and occupation unknown and two other from the suddenness with which the conversation stop i judge they have be discuss ze american they be welcome to say what they like bar the word spion for hour we chug steadily along catch a fair tide on the lower meuse and slide past the neat little town of dordrecht papendrecht and willemstad through the hollandische diep and the krammer volkerak after that the telegraaf iii worry through the canal and system of lock which virtually cut the neck of tholen from the mainland and when the last of these have be accomplish splash into the great basin of the east scheldt a dutch gunboat cut across we bow signal we to halt a officer board we to study the freight invoice farther upstream a launch come alongside make fast fore and aft while two belgian river sentry in long blue coat and fade drab trousers poke they bearded head above the rail this then be what the captain mean by the border patrol now as luck would have it the day be cold : we be the first boat to come through the lock for some hour and apparently the river sentry have have no breakfast so they dive into the fo ` castle where mon le conducteur produce bread and cognac i at once order mon le conducteur to get a second round of liquid refreshment for we military guest conversation flow the soldier drum on the table to keep they hand warm and in a moment of inspiration i show they how the darky in we country warm they foot clog dance i explain encore shout the piano salesman that be splendid pleaz again oh pleaz echo mile blanche see every one ze grand american foot game the fat-faced conducteur with whom i have suddenly grow in favor repeat the cognac treatment on the sentry before i know it they have I alongside the table one hand steady against a thwart of the sway cabin my head in the smoke of the oil lamp my foot pound and kick as it seem at the very door of antwerp the piano salesman shout rag-time mile blanche drum time on the bench and the river sentry pound time with they rifle butt encore they shout when i sit down with ache leg all at once the launch alongside give a angry toot for the officer want he man back : there be other boat to be examine the sentry glance quickly at we papers not read i be sure a word of mine speedily cast off rope and disappear guiltily and somewhat unsteadily over the larboard rail a hour later the telegraaf iii take the river 's turn swing past fort st philippe until we could see the gray-blue spire of the cathedral of notre dame with its intricate network of stone silhouette against the autumn sunset mr diederick be not at the pier to meet I nor be there a military passport from general de guise stay by I say alderman albrecht as each of the pier sentry salute he he say a whisper word and apparently he word be good for the american foot game artist be allow to pass perhaps alderman albrecht have decide that german spy do not clog-dance though not officially admit to the besiege city i go at once to my old stand the hotel st antoine now convert into british staff headquarters at sundown a mist creep up from the river and through it we hear a roar of welcome and the rumble of heavy artillery charge down the avenue de keyser come a hundred london motor-bus piccadilly sign and all some fill some half-filled with a wet-looking bunch of tommy follow by armored mitrailleus a few 67 naval gun officer ' machine commissary and ammunition carriage -- the first brigade of winston churchill 's army of relief which for five day be destine to make so valiant but so short a fight against the overwhelming german army chapter v the bombardment of antwerp there be something typically british in the way those englishman go about the defense of antwerp in the street and barracks and more especially at the hotel st antoine british staff headquarters where i stay until its door be close i see they at close range during that week of horror once when i be eat with a company of marine near they temporary barracks they give I the password to the trench and although i only get out as far as the inner line of fort on that day it give I a opportunity to observe the work of the man under long-range firing at the st antoine ten or a dozen officer be quarter other clank in and out for hurry conference in the corridor or disappear into the smoking-room whose heavy door with the sign reservee pour la gouvernement anglaise hide winston churchill then first lord of the english admiralty and he portmanteau of war map here be belgium 's last stronghold on the verge of downfall : the outer line of fort have already fall fort wavre st catherine waelham and lierre be already prey to the krupp mortar the german host be swarm across the river nethe six mile to the city 's south and the cower populace in they flight make the street terrible to look upon yet at the st antoine there be no particular flurry -- so far at least as the officer be concern at night they work over they war map in the daytime they go out to the fort they would get up in the morning a hour or two earlier than the average business man have a comfortable breakfast smoke a cigar for half a hour or so and talk thing over then they military automobile come tremble and sputter to the doorstep and in group of fours and fives they go out to the firing line if only two or three of a group return you would naturally have to draw you own conclusion as to the fate of the rest those english gentleman go about they job of life and death with the same detach coolness as if they hunter be be saddle or they be wait for the referee 's whistle in rugby football they attitude be infernally exasperating yet you could not help take off you hat to they sublime nerve and indifference i overheard a typical remark when matter be in this critical state it come from a handsome curly-headed officer noticeable not only for he apparent efficiency but because he do not let the game of war interfere with he attention to the little princess de ligne the latter be nurse she brother who have be shoot through the back of the neck during a raid through german line she be a princess in rank and a queen in look thirty hour before the first shell burst into the place verte -- Monday morning it be -- this fellow rap at my door he have wander into the wrong pew for he word be obviously intend to hurry up a brother officer with whom he be to take the morning ride to the firing line stick he curly sunburnt head around the corner he drawl in inimitable british intonation : - i say old chap do hurry along this be no ordinary occasion you know in the royal belgian palace there happen a few hour before the bombardment a incident reveal the simplicity and kindliness of king albert 's character in connection with it it be necessary to speak of harold fowler a new yorker and columbium college graduate who help to save the public building of antwerp and later enter the ally rank as a fighter when the war break out fowler be private secretary to ambassador page in london in November he get a commission in the royal horse guard know as the blues while the german be press hard on antwerp the german commander as i have mention elsewhere ask that a diagram of the city of antwerp with plan and location of the cathedral the hotel de ville and the more important work be send to he in order that he might find the range and avoid firing on they neutral be to carry the plan through and fowler and hugh gibson secretary to the american minister at brussels -lrb- brand whitlock -rrb- volunteer two day before the bombardment gibson go to the royal palace at antwerp where general de guise and he staff be in conference fowler trail along but not like to enter walk up and down the hallway hand in he pocket admire the portrait half-hidden in the darkness of the foyer a tall figure approach and in french ask who he be fowler reply that he be a american and be wait for gibson i see say the figure then speak in english that you be interested in picture very much answer fowler then would you like to see those in the royal chamber upstairs fowler hesitated feeling like a intruder but the figure insist upon lead he upstairs when they get into the light fowler turn to examine he kind friend to he utter astonishment he see that it be albert king of the belgian by that time we of antwerp be get a very fair imitation of a city besiege water supply have already be cut off for some day there be just enough for cooking purpose bathing and such pleasantry be out of the question -- even for royalty accord to the french maid in my corridor winston churchill manage to get a shave by order tea send to he room and use the hot water for shave lather Monday October 5th the night before the city empty itself of non-combatant be almost a festive occasion at the st antoine the british entry give tremendous confidence to the stricken city and the tired belgian soldier -- a bit of pride before the fall new face turn up friend in the english army meet shake hand and discuss the outlook one be even remind of lighter occasion such as the copley-plaza in boston or the hotel taft in new haven before a annual harvard-yale battle at the head of a long table in the center of the dining-room sit the first lord of the british admiralty look rather thoughtful he baldish head and trinity house uniform stand out in contrast to the service uniform of the younger man around he at the same table be commissary officer sergeant aide-de-camp hugh gibson harold fowler and somewhat farther down the russian minister and my curly-headed officer chat over he coffee with little princess de ligne in the flash of a eye these scene change to scene of terror the news leak out and spread like wildfire that the kaiser 's man have cross the river nethe and have place they big gun within range of the city it be not until forty-eight hour later that the populace see a handful of flemish poster paste in out-of-the-way corner -- poster sign by the civil government -- which thank the populace for retain until the present time they praiseworthy sangfroid and regret that the responsibility of they office necessitate they own removal to a neighborhood more safe queen elizabeth whom danger make a democrat walk right into my hotel if you please and stop casually to say good-bye to the russian minister the crowd outside do not know she be leave for ostend under cover of darkness -- they cheer she loudly just the same she be a spunky sort of queen then come the flight you know the fear of the german have get into they blood when waiter drop they plate and dish and run when shop house hotel close and the people melt away when the french chambermaid besought with frightened eye that monsieur take she away to england and when the hotel proprietor disappear without even ask for he bill there be other sight that do one good to see : such as gray-haired mr richardson venerable figure of a british nurse with six war to she credit and a breastful of decoration from four different government who refuse to leave she hospital even if it be blow to piece so long as there be man to help and wound to heal when the st antoine close i take she to the american consulate to find a house where she could stay that night and the next load of english red cross bus with they household of pain and ether rumble over the pontoon bridge across the scheldt go past fort tete de flandre and disappear in the swampy meadow on the road to ghent i never see she again but i have always hope that mr richardson be among the nurse who go with they when on Wednesday morning i be turn out of my room i make my way past a press throng of foreign face to the queen 's hotel on the water front there i find arthur ruhl and jame h hare who have just come over from england the hotel overlook the river scheldt form a wide crescent on the city 's north and be within fifty yard of one of the longest pontoon bridge construct in modern warfare here be a sight to come again and rend the memory the crowd be endeavor to get away over one of the two avenue of escape still open i estimate that between five in the afternoon and the follow dawn three hundred thousand person must have pass through the city 's gate they be the people of antwerp itself swell by exile from alost aerschot maline termonde and other city to the south and west intermittently for two day and night i watch they from my room in the queen 's from five yard beneath my window ledge come the shuffle shuffle of unending foot the creak and groan of heavy cart wheel the talk and babble of guttural tongue the yelp of hound as the thousand move and weep and surge and jostle along throughout the night and into the uncertain mist of that October morning they be so close i could have jump into they cart or drop a pebble on they head infinitely more impressive than the retreat of the ally army or the victorious entry of the german a little later be the pageant of this pitiful army without gun or leader the twenty-foot entrance to that pontoon bridge seem to I like the mouth of a funnel through which pour the dense misery of a entire nation think of this army 's composition : a great city be empty itself of human life not only a great city but all the people drive to it from the outside all who have congregate in belgium 's last refuge and its strongest fort they bear themselves bravely the greater number plod along silently in the footstep of those who go ahead with no thought of they direction some of they even chat and laugh you see great open wagon carry baby carriage perambulator pot and kettle a old chair huge bundle of household goods and the ubiquitous belgian bicycle strap to the side there be small wagon and more great wagon crowd with twenty thirty forty people : aged brown woman bury like shrink walnut in a mass of shawl girl sit listlessly on pile of straw and child fitfully asleep or very much awake and cry lustily sometimes the man and boy mount they bicycle ride for a dozen yard be stop by the procession and then for want of better occupation ring they bell one saw innumerable yelp dog : big belgian police hound harness to the cart and do they share of work other sniff along the outskirts and plainly advertising for a owner there be noisy cattle too some of which escape long after the city be evacuate i see a cow bellow under a archway of the cathedral of notre dame in this way the city empty itself but so slowly that the very slowness of the movement wear the marcher out each family group be limit to the speed of its oldest member hundred give it up and lay by the road or form little gypsy camp under the tree at night these be light by fire overshadow by the greater fire from the distant burning city and beside they stretch dumb-looking soul watch vaguely those who still have strength to move watch these wretch get so on my nerve that i have to get out and do something with a british intelligence officer formerly of sir john french 's staff i wander down to the southern quarter of the city know as berchem as usual the gun at the outer fort have be boom throughout the evening from the city 's rampart you could not only feel the shudder of the earth but you could see occasional splash of flame from the belgian battery answer in the dim distance to the south by smaller less vivid splash issue from the mouth of the german instrument of culture which throughout the night pound ruthlessly on the unprotected house without the city limit on the way home we stop in at the british field hospital to see a wounded british friend chapter vi the surrender of antwerp as we leave the british field hospital on the rue de leopold a shriek skyrocket whiz by above we and bury its hissing head in the river to the north one or two more fall at a distance of several hundred yard and in the southern part of the city flame from several house shoot up into the quiet windless night the bombardment be on -- the time be 1207 Wednesday midnight for a moment i do not realize that this be the beginning of the end of antwerp i have hear so much gun-fire and see so many bomb drop from aeroplane that i do not fully appreciate the significance of these shell i scribble a few note in my diary unstrapped my money belt and then pick out a empty bed at the queen 's hotel and tumble in i must have sleep for six or seven hour when i arise everything be quiet the hotel be apparently desert i remember be particularly irritated because there be no one in the kitchen who would give I breakfast so i make myself some tea and then stroll into the street it so happen that the german have be pump lead steadily into the city for six hour and that this be the morning lull the german be methodical in everything when they bombard a city they stop for breakfast as i walk down the avenue de keyser i think at first it be Sunday -- or rather a year of sunday all roll into one overnight the city have be transform into a tomb shop be close iron shutter be pull down everywhere trolley car stand in the street as they have be leave my own footstep resound fearfully on the pavement and i walk five block before i see a human be i stop at the american consul 's office on the place de meir only to find the place be lock a frightened face behind the grating tell I that the consul have take he wife to the country -- good place to be in i think thing begin to seem lonely i hear shell fall and see flame in the southern quarter of the city and decide to go in that direction to look up a american correspondent and two photographer who have ask I to bunk with they in the cellar of a little abandoned house at 74 rue de peage turn down a little side street lead toward the boulevard de leopold i be greet by a clap of thunder overhead a shell demolish a house across the street and about thirty yard down the concussion knock over a couple of baby i pick they up put they back in the doorway of the house where they seem to belong say over and over again mechanically there there do not cry there be nothing to be frighten about and then just to show how little i myself be frightened i begin to run i run for all i be worth i run right into the fire the shell be fall fairly thick on the boulevard de leopold every two or three hundred yard a house be partially destroy brick and glass litter the pavement and occasionally every quarter of a mile or so i see a figure skulk along under the eaves of a building crouching and duck in time to the nasty music of the shell but i decide that the middle of the street be the safest part when i have go about a quarter of a mile i get my nerve again i put my hand in my pocket light a cigarette and be just say to myself this be pretty good fun after all when crash crash two or possibly three shell burst in rapid succession tear down house a hundred yard ahead of I then one strike in the street and jagged fragment of angry shrapnel skid along the pavement like a throw stone skip along the surface of the water i be again tremble all over be the game worth the candle i ask myself i have come three thousand mile and overcome every obstacle just to get into this horrible mess if i get disfigure -- no i would much rather be kill -- will it -- crash bang go a monster shell as i turn the corner two door from the corner of a narrow street cover with brick and mortar flutter a united state flag and beneath it the door of 74 rue de peage this place be later speak of as thompson 's fort because donald c thompson a kansa photographer take possession of it after the belgian family flee and plunder the neighborhood for coffee roll and meat with which he stock he little cellar the house next door have already be strike and shatter glass litter the pavement the doorstep of 74 be cover by a couple of mattress and sand-bag beneath this in a dingy sort of coal-bin heap with straw i find crouch the tenant of thompson 's fort next to berchem the southern quarter of the city where the german be approach the rue de peage be the worst spot in antwerp we sit for a time listen to the shell there be here in addition to thompson edwin weigel a chicago photographer edward eyre hunt of collier 's weekly and the dutch vice-consul we hear the distant resounding boom boom boom ed boom boom boom a interval of perhaps a second 's silence then a faint moan a crescendo wail the whirr and rush of a snarl shriek skyrocket overhead and a crash like all the thunder of the universe roll into one when the shell strike follow by the roar of fall brick as a neighbor house come pour into the street wheewheeehihiou uiouw we hear whee wheee wheee uiouw ouww ssh sshshhh bang bang wheewheeehihiouuiouw we hear whee wheee wheee uiouw ouww ssh sshshhh bang bang i try to persuade the other fellow to come up to the queen 's hotel along the scheldt waterfront on the northern side of the city where i be then encamp it be a safer locality because the german have not yet get the range of the northern end of the city weigel and thompson have to look out for they kodak and moving-picture paraphernalia decide to wait a while as do hunt hare who come in later have two big kodak which he want to get back to he room in the queen 's i offer to carry one of they for he we shake hand all around and one or two of we exchange message to be take back in case there be any trouble -- that be to say in case as seem likely at the time some of we should get out alive and some should not hunt give I a letter to he family and later with watch in hand start to walk around the burn city to calculate the number of fall shell per minute i slung hare 's kodak over my shoulder and we start back take separate street it be a dash of three quarter of a mile and nothing fall particularly close to we although the building on all side be in flame near a pile of discard uniform of the garde civique i see what be leave of the figure of a man with he inside ooze out he eye still open stare vacantly upward and all around he the horrible odor of decay horse by this time i be calm and be get quite accustomed to the bursting of shell i suppose i have be through my baptism of fire about half a hour later when we be sit in the queen 's thompson pale as a sheet stagger into the desert lobby closely follow by weigel and hunt and the dutch vice-consul the latter somewhat out of he head just after i leave 74 rue de peage a 32 cm shell burst on the roof tear off the two top floor of the house throw thompson 's bed into the street and set the place on fire at sundown the house be in ash somehow or other the man all get out rescue a portion of they paraphernalia all Thursday afternoon the german taube circle above the city -- mostly along the waterfront below they puff little cloud of smoke where shell from the belgian anti-aircraft gun be explode i fancy the airman be locate the pontoon bridge and signaling to the prussian battery commander six mile away but during Wednesday and Thursday when the crowd of refugee be assemble on the waterfront not a single bomb drop among they a few shell well place would have slaughter they like sheep before and during the bombardment i be quite certain that the german intend to frighten rather than injure non-combatant report to the contrary notwithstanding it be equally true that so far as possible the invader keep to they promise to spare such building as the cathedral the palais de justice the hotel de ville the castle steen and other historic landmark the bombardment last forty hour that night -- Thursday October 8th -- the second and last night which the town hold out all of the american who be leave gather at the queen 's the firing by this time be terrific except for the lurid glare of the burning building which light up the street the city be in total darkness for week martial law have be in effect and there be no light after sundown a unearthly feeling it be to be lock in the darkness of this strange city unable to speak a word of the language not know whether the garrison have evacuate the fort or whether the city have be surrender believe there would be street righting or a insurrection of franc-tireur at time we hear through the darkness the tramp of squad of soldier surely we think there come the german we remember the atrocity at louvain about a hour after darkness settle on we i climb to the roof of the queen 's hotel from which for a few minute i look out upon the most horrible and at the same time the most gorgeous panorama that i ever hope to see the entire southern portion of the city appear a desolate ruin whole street be ablaze and great sheet of fire rise to the height of thirty or forty foot the night like the precede be calm and quiet without a breath of wind on all side rise greedy tongue of flame which seem to thirst for thing beyond they reach slowly and majestically the spark float skyward and every now and then follow the explosion of a shell a new burst of flame light up a section hitherto hide in darkness the window pane of the house still untouched flash the reflection in we eye even more glorious be the scene to the north on the opposite side of the scheldt the oil tank the first object to be set on fire by bomb from the german taube be blaze furiously and vomit huge volume of oil-laden smoke look over on this side of the river too i could see the crackling wooden house of the village of st nicola light with they glow all of northern antwerp and the water-front in the swampy meadow on the farther bank we could see the frightened refugee as they hurry along the still protect road to ghent they pass on we side of the burning village not five hundred yard away every now and then as a fitful flame light the meadow i could see the figure silhouette against the red background they appear to be actually walk through the flame like shadrach meshach and abednego it be all a glorious and fascinating nightmare there be at this time a ominous lull in the moan pound of shrapnel out of the darkness in the direction of west antwerp come a new sound-the low methodical beat of foot the noise become gradually louder and louder until one could hear the rumble of heavy wheel and distinguish the sound of voice above the crowd this be the beginning of the british and belgian retreat which start at about eight o'clock Thursday night and under cover of darkness continue unbroken for eight hour follow the line take by the escape populace this retreat go past we position on the water-front before dawn on Friday morning when the light become strong enough for the advance army to make out the enemy 's position practically the entire belgian army plus ten thousand royal british naval marine have get across the pontoon bridge and be well along the road to ghent during all these hour squad of gendarme with fix bayonet hold back such remain townsfolk as attempt to get near the bridge to these wretch it seem that they last avenue of escape have be cut off there be now at the queen 's arthur ruhl hare and myself in addition to a english intelligence officer and the recruit from fort thompson we talk over we plan for the next day the intelligence officer volunteer to get up with I at sunrise and scour the river for a barge it be my idea in case we could make any kind of arrangement for a get-away to come back and report to the other fellow i remember that arthur ruhl be uncertain as to whether he would come with we or wait for the german entry he be worry about some friend in the british field hospital and he decide not to leave without look they up -- a pretty white thing to do it seem to I i try to sleep but the rumble of artillery wagon and shout of the marcher prevent so i spend most of the night of the british and belgian retreat beneath my window at daybreak the intelligence officer come to my room and we start out along the water-front move in the direction of the dutch border with the rise sun on Friday morning the german taube again sweep over the city when the german see that the whole british and belgian army have get away from they they move up they 42 cm gun and literally give we hell this time they have no mercy on the few remain noncombatant the intelligence officer 's baggage delay we a long time when we get up nearly as far as fort st philippe we separate we see a barge anchor in the river and he have a idea it would leave about seven o'clock and that we might be able to get on it i give he my knapsack contain my gold belt which in the confusion i have not have time to strap on and start to make a dash back to the queen 's because i consider that i ought to let the other fellow know what have happen to we i have fifteen minute to cover the distance i run the shell at that time be fall at a rate i should judge of five a minute opposite the castle steen i have a narrow escape -- just concussion i suppose directly above I come a crash of thunder a few moment later i find myself lie in the street head point north -- daze a bomb crash through the eaves and tear a hole as big as a small cellar in the street directly before the old castle burst with the concussion of a tornado for a few moment i sit on the street feeling weak in the leg and unable to move again i start back to the queen 's two hundred yard east of the bridge some soldier hold I up get back they shout believe that i be make for the pontoon they turn I back and i hesitate a moment a terrible explosion louder than anything i have yet hear rock the city to its foundation for a moment the wall of the house tremble and every window on the waterfront be break the retreat belgian army have blow up that pontoon bridge and with it what then seem the last hope of escape for the few remain survivor for a few moment wreckage writhe in midstream like a great sea creature in agony of death past I rush group of belgian soldier the remainder of a few hundred who have be leave to cover the british and belgian retreat fire the last shot from the fort and spike the gun as the german approach pitiable be the terror of these fellow when they see the bridge go many of they be out of they head through exposure and exhaustion not a few of they weep one sergeant tear off he uniform and fatigue cap and try to exchange they for my citizen 's clothes the worst fire of the entire bombardment be concentrate during these moment the racket be stupendous because gunboat barge lighter tender rowboat be commandeer by the military authority to ferry across soldier and wound there be slim chance for noncombatant above the noise of bomb and shrapnel belgian gunboat add to the confusion by cannonade big boat along the quay this be do in order that the german might not make use of they for the pursuit it speak volume for my military knowledge that for a brief moment i imagine the german have embark upstream and be go to make a river battle of it by this time the american correspondent have leave the queen 's go in different direction for different purpose hunt and thompson i later learn go to the american consulate where they stay during the german entry for a moment i see-saw up and down the river bank remember i have leave my handbag at the queen 's but infinitely more important that my knapsack with money belt and diary be in the keep of a peripatetic acquaintance somewhere along the crowded pier downstream without that gold the thousand of mile to new york seem doubly long when i at last get back to the barge office a dock-hand point to a bench in the corner there to my intense relief lay the knapsack where my kind english intelligence officer have leave it a little later i manage to clamber on a river barge laden nearly to the sinking point with antwerp 's peaceful burgher and they dumb-looking woman and child slowly -- very slowly -- we steam out of the haze of powder and oil-laden smoke through long line of gunboat and a flotilla of drift scow pack to the gunwale like we own and past fort st philippe whose garrison be at that moment heave ton of powder into the river a few mile farther downstream they land we on the northern bank of the scheldt near the little town of liefkenshack here i begin a few mile of walk occasionally vary by ox-cart locomotion i be travel with nothing but a knapsack -lrb- my suitcase have to be abandon -rrb- and therefore move faster than the crowd at one point for the sake of company i join a group and take a turn at shove the family wheel-barrow they pour out thanks in the guttural flemish tongue then load I with bread and bit of mouldy pie when that be not accept they fear for they hospitality they talk and i talk with a result that be hardly worth the effort finally after a conference one of the group disappear into the crowd and return lead a eight-year-old boy I talk american say the boy we two speak together and so we talk for the road be long and weary they advance be so gradual that although i do not leave antwerp until the bombardment be over i catch up with the army of refugee before roosendaal just across the dutch border here holland open out she arm the kindness of the dutch -- as yet personal unorganized endeavor -- be beyond conception church house public hall station be throw open to the multitude you see hundred of dutch soldier join in the procession lift baby and bundle and walk with they for mile at dordrecht when the train come through peasant pass score of baby ' milk-bottle into the car when a jolly-looking dutch girl with a great big gleaming smile that remind I of some one give I milk and chocolate the tear begin to trickle down my cheek i suppose it be the reaction or because i be tired or perhaps because the crowd be cheer and wave at we for the other there be pile of bread dutch cake and best of all some good long drink of water for ten day antwerp 's water supply have be cut off von beseler german siege commander have see to that at bergen op zoom and roosendaal people use the wall of the house for post-office they write they name in chalk letter give direction to relative lose in the scramble after ox cart rowboat and river barge have do they share a dutch-belgian stoom tram joggle we along for a few mile some more walk and a little running before i at last crawl aboard a twenty-car freight and passenger train move slowly toward the east at the first telegraph office across the dutch border i file a cable story to the boston journal and later start a account for the new york evening post i have a idea that i would score a beat or scoop so that the people of the back bay could read of antwerp 's fall over they coffee-cup the next morning my cable account have too much inside information there be in it too many fact concern winston churchill 's visit also information about the number of royal marine engage none of which it be think proper to give out at that time so the english censor refuse to let it through that however do not prevent the dutch cable company from pocket my two hundred guilder by the time i reach rotterdam the word refugee have assume a new and altogether nearer mean i have be in a besiege and capture city i have mix with homeless and starving people i have see house crumble and burn and ghastly human figure with they inside ooze away and the eye stare vacantly as i lay in bed that night i could hear and i still can hear the scruff scruff and shuffle of foot as the compact body of this army -- the army without gun or leader -- drag slowly past my window at the queen 's the tinkle of ox-cart bell the talk and babble of guttural tongue the curse of the team driver the frantic cry of mother who have lose they child in the scramble the cry of young child who do not know what be wrong but realize in they vague childish way that something terrible be happen i could see and i still can see those big belgian hound sniff along the outskirts of the crowd and plainly advertising for a owner i can see other hound with they head throw back wail at the door of they desert and abandon home and i can see the dutch border where holland open out she arm and the dutch peasant give we rye bread and sandwich and good long drink of welcome milk sometimes i can sit with my leg dangle over the stern of that old towboat barge on which i finally make my escape and can visualize the blue-gray spire of the cathedral of notre dame stand it seem to I a quiet sentinel over the ruin of the tortured city and then as the old barge sweep around the river 's bend i can look back upon the last of antwerp 's story write in flaming letter of red against the early morning sky chapter vii spy on spy less than forty-eight hour after the fall of antwerp the wave of helpless humanity whose crest break on the belgian border have roll over the entire length and breadth of holland thousand of belgian refugee wander as far north as the hague where various dutch relief committee and the american legation at the hague do they best to house the homeless and relieve the suffering dr van dyke roll up he sleeve still farther and strain to solve the problem of the unemployed sometimes when a case interested he turn he own pocket inside out eight day after the antwerp bombardment i leave the hague for my second trip into germany just before my start captain sunderland usa at the head of the american relief committee at the hague ask I to help he in take charge of two carload of grain which be to go across the german border and be distribute among the starve belgian at liege england have agree not to interfere with food supply provide the united state see that they do not fall into german hand in belgium the present job require sleep in the freight car and say in one form or another hand off to every spiked helmet that try to interfere captain sunderland could speak no german and as i have already be over the same territory and have have some experience with the military authority he wish I to accompany he i decide however to go into the interior of germany i have already see three army in the field and have watch more or less closely the people of two war nation i be now particularly anxious to study the german point of view and if possible get to the front with the crown prince 's army for such a purpose i consider that i carry good enough credentials in addition to a packet of mail for ambassador gerard my letter from ex-president roosevelt and my united state passport which have be vise by herr von mueller german ambassador at the hague i now carry a special laissez-passer which mr marshall langhorne have be kind enough to secure for I from the same legation i have a letter from count von bernstorff whom i have see the night he arrive in america and a letter from herr von biel secretary of the german embassy at the hague recommend I to the foreign office in berlin professor hugo munsterberg have take the trouble to send I a note to dr r w drechsler head of the american institute in berlin and i have also a letter to the head of the university of berlin it be a five-hour ' run from the hague to bentheim a small country village on the german frontier the train stop a quarter of a mile north of the border dutch official come aboard to examine passport and baggage of every passenger they be good-natured and talkative and do not go minutely into detail as those leave the country be less carefully watch than immigrant I however they mistake for a englishman -lrb- as be usually the case in germany -rrb- and tell I i could not cross the frontier a dutch manufacturer with whom i have strike up a acquaintance explain my identity and the official who look astonished wave I ahead with a doubtful expression as much as to say on you own head be it young man that first night pass without trouble at the border station we line up immigrant fashion and go through a inspection by a number of the businesslike german militariat attach to the zollamt or custom service for ten minute i stand in suspense while a fiery-looking officer with a snap blue eye look through my credentials in silence he write my name in a notebook look through my eye as if he would read my very soul and then without a remark pass I on i file through a narrow gate -- and so into the realm of the kaiser it be now eleven o'clock at night and the berlin express come through bentheim at 745 the next morning we stay at a little inn somewhat resemble the wayside inn at sudbury massachusett here i fall in with a german manufacturer whom i have see several week before as we be bring the good news from ghent to aix i be surprise at this man 's change of opinion regard the conflict on the first occasion he laugh outright at the idea of a extend fight now all through he argument he repeat such phrase as well if germany do not win or suppose the war do last two year etc etc in the morning i have a peculiarly disagreeable experience at lohne some distance from the german frontier where we have again to change train en route to the capital experience have by this time teach I when throw with people on the road to show they my papers and make my identity know as soon as possible i therefore cling pretty closely to my argumentative german acquaintance of bentheim and aix during the melee of change car i be however separate from he and become engage in conversation -lrb- speak in english -rrb- with a dutch chocolate merchant the argument must have be interesting for i do not at first notice a crowd of twenty or thirty traveler and villager gather around we : i do however notice when they begin to push and jostle in a manner obviously intend for insult when i try to retreat the exit be lock the crowd convince that i be a english spy close more compactly and manhandle I off toward a officer on the street behind the platform my hat be knock off and for a brief moment i recall the lynching anger which i have see in the eye of belgian mob as german spy in antwerp be be lead to the police station at the last moment my rescuer come in the shape of the german friend of bentheim who break through the mob and whisper in my ear speak german always speak in german you fool i admit the soft impeachment ich bin ein amerikaner -- ein correspondent i explain to the row of angry face and while my german friend soothe and reassure he testy compatriot i move away glad enough to escape another visit to jail those personally conduct jail tour be not so bad i have find with a handsome gendarme at you side but a howling crowd be altogether another matter i reach the capital that night one of my letter say a few day later : -- the atmosphere be oppressive to the anglo-saxon visitor he look he manner he accent betray he as one of the english-speaking pest and the crowd with its mind so full of english hatred do not readily distinguish the american so drop into a word of english in a cafe : you neighbor glower and draw away you face it out with a nonchalant air but gradually the tension grow especially when as happen to-day at the prisoner ' camp at zossen twenty mile south of berlin a great burly prussian put a menacing eye on you and say without introduction : ` it be very dangerous for a englishman here ' day by day here the hatred grow of england and thing english : judge from the press and the temper of the people one would think that england be the only foe as a nation and as individual they bear no particular malice toward france they even feel sorry for ` misguided ' belgium -- betray by the british they say but england they look upon as the root of all they trouble the despicable retreat enemy they can not touch the enemy they maintain whose clever but selfish diplomacy have force the brunt of the fighting on the other while she sit back to wait for the spoil on my arrival in berlin i deliver the mail packet to ambassador gerard two day later i present my credentials at the auswartige amt or foreign office hope to get permission to go to the western front with the crown prince 's army i be tell to see baron von mumm schwartzenstein who be officially designate by von jagow to handle neutral correspondent and who unofficially i have reason to believe be connect with the secret service he be a pudgy sort of man with a watery skin and decidedly not of military build or bear when after much red tape i be finally admit to a outer office he step out to see I merely take my name and the name of the papers i represent i be tell to come back in the evening when i do so and be admit to he holy of holy he say to I at once : -- i be expect you to come yesterday why do you not this be rather startling but he next remark altogether take away my breath be you satisfied with you treatment by the war office in brussels herr green and why if you have already be wiss ze army in scene of war do you now come to I for permission mind you i have at this time speak scarcely a word and have certainly tell nothing of my age or previous condition of servitude in brussels but the government that never forget know all about my movement he smile at my discomfiture and within the next few minute prove to be such a genial german -lrb- for war-time -rrb- that i soon tell he all about my adventure include the fact that i have go back into antwerp and enter belgian line after escape from german surveillance at aix i happen to speak of the marvelous efficiency and preparedness of the german army in belgium yes that iss quite so remark he excellency with a smile you see we be prepare for everyse -- except he add after a pause -- except ze invasion of ze american newspaperman when he iss out of we sight zen we do not feel secure several week later after i have come out of the kaiser 's realm a representative of the boston journal who have be look for I all over the continent run I down just as i be leave the hague for england the foreign office in berlin tell I where to find you he say they tell I that in berlin you have stay first at the esplanade and then you have move to the kaiserhof they say you have leave the city -lrb- this be when i go out toward poland -rrb- that you have return to berlin and that on such and such a date at 845 you have depart for the hague the military and civil authority look upon the correspondent as a embryo spy and if the correspondent 's sympathy be foreign he be a thousand time worse than the ordinary spy because he could make use of the cable and press to spread he information while wait in berlin for a chance to go to the front i become therefore more and more conscious of surveillance whether it be the fact of be so much alone or due perhaps to a unfortunately english-like appearance i do not know at all event the long arm of the secret service continuously cast a shadow over my shoulder : i even become suspicious of myself for one who have not be through the experience it be difficult to appreciate the strain of such constant unending suspicion on July 171912 i stand beside the body of herman rosenthal the gambler as it lay in the coffin in the parlor of he house in the tenderloin my newspaper have send I to cover the funeral and i manage because of some previous knowledge of the household and by give the impression of a mourner to gain access the murderer have not yet be catch because the public know nothing of lefty louie or gyp the blood or even of the late lieutenant becker it be common gossip that the criminal lurk in the neighborhood and that in order to avoid suspicion they would appear among the chief mourner therefore each eye be turn against its neighbor and each man as he pass you ask the silent question -- do you shoot herman rosenthal during all the month on the continent and particularly in germany i feel myself at rosenthal 's funeral to a greater or less degree other correspondent have similar experience i must mention one or two of they in spite of the fact that they may dim the importance of my own adventure there be swing of chicago german by relationship and sympathy who champion the kaiser 's cause and in he dispatch blow the teuton horn in the middle west of america swing be give exceptional privilege include a typewriter and telephone near the foreign office yet swing himself be constantly shadow and it be a fact that every time he use the telephone -lrb- and he be never permit to speak in english -rrb- a secret service agent cut in on the wire to listen to the conversation a anecdote which i have hear in connection with the same correspondent although i do not vouch for its accuracy show that keep the lid on newspaper man have its humorous side it likewise indicate the initiative and aggressiveness of many american correspondent who as a rule go right ahead in the face of military regulation in some case risk they life and in almost every case refuse to be bluff out even where the threaten penalty be death swing have make he way to the battle front near -- ----- where he be take into custody and bring before von mumm then on a visit to staff headquarters i find one of you countryman wizin ze army line be the way excellency von mumm be report as tell the story and i say to he ` herr swing it iss strongly forbid zat a newspaper man come to ze front it be not permit zat any one come here you must go away ' very goot excellency say swing ze next day i be extr-r-remely sorry to encounter ze same chentleman and i say to he ` go away at once if you be not go in one hour you will be shoot ' very goot excellency answer herr swing auf wiedersehn zat very afternoon to my sur-r-r-prise and gr-r-reat astonishment i see he again he be still in ze army line and i say to he ` now i have you this time you will be shoot at sunrise ' and he look at I and say : -- ` very goot excellency zat make perfectly bully story for my paper ' and i look at he for a minute and i do not know whether to shoot he or to laugh and you know i can not help myself but to laugh and finally there be the case of cyril brown staff correspondent of the new york time in berlin with whom i flounder through the maze of official red tape and military snare that entangled the reporter at the german capital brown be a individual with a sense of humor and a mark twain penchant for ten-pfennig cigar he take he work seriously but unlike most war correspondent not himself after some interesting freight-car adventure of he own planning he reach the grosser hauptquartier a small city on the meuse where at that time the brain of the german fighting machine be located this most vulnerable spot of the entire german empire be paradoxically in france the kaiser the king of saxony the crown prince of germany and field marshal von moltke be here hold council of war it be therefore of utmost importance to conceal the locality neutral correspondent be not allow : the german press even if it know would not dare to breathe its whereabouts when brown by strategy get inside the red-and-white striped pole which mark the entrance to the over war lord 's quarter he be at once arrest and take before major nikolaus head of the kaiser 's bodyguard and chief of the field detective it be late at night and it be determine that brown should go on the first military postzug which leave at 7 be if he be not go by that time there be terrible threat of what would happen to he it so happen that the day be the crown princess 's birthday soldier grenadier and servant of the kaiser 's household celebrate the fact brown evade he intoxicated sentinel and deliberately miss the train the follow morning major nikolaus discover he behind the guardhouse himself feign intoxication major nikolaus be about to throw brown into jail for the duration of the war when the young man answer : -- but major i overslept what loyal german could possibly remain sober on the crown princess 's birthday gott im himmel exclaim the major burst into a laugh vatever can be do mit such a man to-day brown have free run of the foreign office and the war office in berlin and be send to he paper in my humble opinion the best information obtainable in this country on the way in which the german civil and military mind view the crisis with the u s a chapter viii the sorrow of the people i be conscious of a distinct break between the crisp official atmosphere of berlin -- where the war hurt least and the mechanical appearance of success be strong -- and the sentiment of the rank and file of people whose suffering as the war continue become a more and more important factor on the night of my second arrival in the capital i sit in the rear of a motion-picture theater just off the friedrichstrasse it be a long dark hallway such as one may see in any of the cheaper movie on washington street or broadway where the audience sit in silence break by the whirr of the cinematograph and in darkness pierce by the flickering light upon the screen the woman in the seat beside mine be the typical hausfrau of the middle class she be of course dress in mourning : the heavy veil which be throw back reveal the expression so common to the german widow of to-day -- that set defiant look which beg no pity and seem to say : we have lose they once we would endure the same torture again if we have to it be a sad enough story that the reel click off and about as melodramatic as movie usually be but the woman keep herself well in hand since the public display of grief be forbid and they who sorrow must sorrow alone a bavarian boy as i recall it -- the youngest son -- run away from home to join he father 's regiment in poland when he captain call for volunteer for a dangerous mission the boy step forward for hour they trudge over the snow until surround by a cossack patrol the bavarian boy although have a chance to escape go back under fire to succor he wounded comrade just as he be about to drag the comrade into the zone of safety a bullet pierce he lung for two day he suffer torture on the snow the body be find and bring home to he mother now and then the widow next I bite she lip and clench she fist but she give no other sign of emotion another film be throw on the screen humorous i believe suddenly the woman begin to laugh she do not stop laugh it be a long mirthless dry uncanny sort of cackle people stare she laugh still louder a usher come down the aisle and stand there uncertain what to do hysteric have give way to weep : the tear be now stream down the woman 's face she try to control herself but could not and then arise and between choke sob and laughter flee from the darkened room out into the friedrichstrasse i mention this incident -- the sort of thing that must have exist everywhere if one have eye to see it -- merely because it give a glimpse through the veil of public optimism into the well of sorrow hide for the sake of public duty military and official berlin be stage one might almost say it be on show to impress the neutral stranger no less than its own inhabitant with the glorious sense of victory but beneath it lay untold suffering which could be endure only because of such unite loyalty and team play as the world have seldom see this undercurrent of suffering which increase week by week as the write on the wall grow longer be in pitiful contrast to the enthusiasm with which the woman send they man and son away to war more than once i watch troops drill at spandau hof the great barracks and training-grounds a few kilometer west of the city when on the evening of my first visit a half dozen battalion of landwehr just whip into shape entrain for the front the people throw bit of earth upon they and accord to custom stick green twig in the end of every mauser barrel that each man might carry a bit of the vaterland with he on to the enemy 's soil in unspotted field uniform and helmet still without the green-gray canvas service cover they clatter past the review officer each right leg come down with the thump goose-step salute until hall and barracks echo with the staccato tread of thousand of hob-nailed boot the lusty military band blazon out die wacht be rhein and other martial air until the creeper begin to run up and down you back and you feel a lump rise in you throat friend relative widow mother already in black for other son and more than the usual hurrahing crowd have gather under the arch lead to the railway track as the close-locked fours go through the gate the people break the rank and pound each man on the back while all the time the crowd be shout i ask my neighbor what they be call a german friend in the group explain : the people shout ` congratulation ' at that moment a red cross train return with twenty carload of wounded stand on the siding score of bandaged head and limp arm stick out of the window -- these be the slightly wound -- and even the half-dead figure strap to the cot turn feebly toward the march troops most of these also wave and those who be physically able shout the same word -- bravo congratulation bravo that be the way after many month of war that the woman and child send they man away -- no regret no holding back good luck good work you have get a chance to die for germany such a spirit and with it a sincerity of purpose that could only come from the conviction of right be typical of the rank and file of citizen it can not fail to impress the neutral stranger though he have travel far in other country at war and see and live with they citizen and soldier one be force to believe that the militarist act in conformity with the feeling of the whole people and that this hideous war be not merely the result of personal ambition except of course among the soldier the belief be most noticeable among the lower class one find it among the peasant one 's neighbor in the day coach the artisan the shopkeeper you might reason with a professor a doctor or perhaps a official in the foreign office at berlin but it be not safe to try it on a sturdy peasant with three son on the firing line it be like tell a man he mother be no better than she should be from the log among both fighter and those leave at home there be distinctly less of the matinee hero business than in either england or france the high official in the civil government who say that the woman be the best fighter in the german army be not so far from the truth the pluck of the woman be astonishing there be not the slightest display of sorrow or call for sympathy you see they everywhere in the street cafe and shop of berlin not in such great number however as in the lesser province and the smaller town where the drain of man be enormously heavier later : have be twice to the casualty list office or information bureau where the name of the verwundet und gefallen be post -- column after column company after company regiment after regiment of fine black type -- nothing more or less than a printer 's morgue crowd into one dark hallway the cemetery of a nation there be father mother brother and child quietly and unemotionally scan the list it take I back to the terrible week at the white star office after the titanic go down at that time the relative weep -lrb- some of they -rrb- and nearly all harangue the official ask question send telegram beg for news here they look for the name of they dead -- that be all -- and then go out without a question you can not ask question of a government the titanic last a week and this go on -- god know how long have supper with brown later a mother in black and a girl also in black -lrb- the daughter or daughter-in-law i should judge -rrb- come into the heiniger -lrb- -rrb- cafe while i be sit there for three quarter of a hour they listen to the music neither of they i 'll swear speak a word then they pay twenty-five pfennig for they beer and go out -- still silent -- and the ober bow low and very respectfully i ask the waiter who they be and he say the woman have that day hear of the death of c she fourth son something like the bixby woman to whom lincoln write he famous letter and there must be literally thousand of they this people be terribly in earnest -- delude of course with devotion to a false idea but it be the delusion that spell accomplishment the country be earnestly and honestly possess with a idea and the idea be that might be right that be the awful pity of it when will the awaken come later : to-day i have a interview of three quarter of a hour with herr dr r w drechsler head of the american institute attach to the university of berlin to-morrow i hope to see excellency von harnach president of the university of berlin to whom i have a letter dr drechsler be kind agreeable extremely interesting he show I some new york newspaper -- the first real news of the war i have have for week the ` tribune ' and ` time ' have a account of we fellow down in the cellar at antwerp drechsler and i have a interesting argument and before i leave he deluge I with pamphlet and literature for the improvement of my mind and sympathy even so he be unlike the average german as a rule they have attempt to cram they argument down my throat these teuton think they can force you to believe dr drechsler and the proprietor of the kaiserhof and of course the foreign office warn I that it be forbid to go to the prisoner ' camp either at zossen or doeberitz some correspondent have be take on ` personally conduct ' tour but because of misinformation send out the tour be no longer in vogue so i think that i would risk it without permit and wish to take a swing through rural germany i decide to visit the camp at zossen twenty-five kilometer south of the capital when the guard be not look i slip box of cigarette through the barbed-wire fence to irish private and listen to the talk of capture cossack and watch the british tommy kick around a ` soccer ' football squabbling about foul and penalty and as much excite about the score as if they be at home on hampstead heath it be chiefly in my wanderings through rural germany that i be able to rub elbow with the rank and file of citizen and to get that barometer of public feeling which colonel roosevelt i believe have call the barber-shop opinion i think i be justified in say that during the winter there be many evidence too many to be overlook that a grow minority suffer through loss of life and realize the territorial advantage which be now germany 's earnestly long for peace on any reasonable term the sooner peace come they feel the better would be the strategic position of the vaterland some of this minority in addition to the woman be business man or professor or merchant or doctor it be not far from hanover where you change car for cologne and aix - la-chapelle dispatching-center of the troops for the northern line of battle that the frankfort doctor in the seat next mine begin to talk he be a oldish man over sixty dress in mourning and careworn he have be to berlin he say to verify the report of he son 's death and be now head for aix where the body lay after uhlman the fat merchant leave we be alone in the second-class compartment and the doctor get up and shut the door on the noise of landwehr soldier singing in the section of the troop train attach behind the car presently he show I two postal from he boy they be the stereotyped card allot to the man on the field : on one side space for the address on the other side the print word well space for the date -lrb- but no locality -rrb- and the signature the third card be a casualty report sign probably by the company captain with the three print word slightly wound wound and severely wound the first and last be scratch out but after the word wound be write condition low the boy must have hold out -- because the body be send to aix -- until well along the homeward red cross trip during the antwerp bombardment at brussels liege and louvain i have see score of the wound and have myself sleep on those train with they household of blood and pain and ether and they long line of mail car box car and convert tram car fit with they triple row of berth one above another as the old doctor talk i could see the wheel hospital steal into the city in the darkness -- for the troops go off with band and holiday accompaniment but the return be make at dead of night that the public may not know the human cost we must have peace the doctor finish and we must have it soon i do not say this because i have lose a son and i do not say it alone there be thousand who feel it just as much but they be afraid to speak what be in they mind you be a traveler from the great city -lrb- berlin -rrb- and you do not know what war mean all you have hear be the talk of fight and victory and glory and that be all you see if you do not look close you must live in the smaller city must see the village and farm without man and you must come with I and see the home without husband or son for the third time he interrupt himself to ask : -- you be amerikaner -- yes and why do you come to see the war and find out what the german people think then go home and tell you country what i think and say and many other like I it be not easy to forget he tear and final word as he come up on the platform at hanover and look around to see that no one overheard whisper hoarsely : fangen sie ihre propagande a junger mann und gott starke ihre bemuhungen -- start you peace propaganda young man and heaven help the undertake the southern part of this trip be not without its crop of story some humorous and some atrocious it be impossible to verify the statement of the bavarian traveler who boast of the treatment of english prisoner en route to the detention camp on one occasion sixty be capture they say and only five bring home alive the bavarian soldier guard they say with a laugh but they be tire so we have to shoot the rest and the officer answer with a wink what happen to english prisoner need never be report one never need more one 's sense of the probability and there be the good-natured cavalry lieutenant who say the german have find a way to keep they prisoner in training you see he explain we lock twenty of the ` red-trousers ' -lrb- frenchman -rrb- and twenty englishman in the same room at night and shut the window you know a frenchman can not stand air and a kitchener will die without it so we stand outside to watch the fun first a window go up and then it go down and pretty soon there be growl grumble and oath in ten minute a terrible fight ensue in half a hour the frenchman be badly beat -- they always be -- and twenty batter english head come stick out the window for a breath of air and finally there be the landwehr captain 's letter a thing in keep with the tale which come across the polish border westward in belgium and in france the fight be modern and of the day move eastward from berlin and you get the mediaeval note it be not to be find at the english prisoner ' camp at doeberitz where the german stare with infinite contempt and satisfaction at tommy atkin behind he triple row of wire grating but wander among the thousand of capture cossack build they own prison at the camp at zossen hear they mutter nichevo -- this be fate -- i do not care and listen to the story of they captor you feel the atmosphere of century go by one such be call to my attention in the form of a prussian captain 's letter which be i believe publish in berlin here be he letter of the war in poland not long ago receive by relative so much as be not private be give as he write it : -- the inhabitant go out of we way like frightened dog with childish fear when they wish to ask a question they kneel down and kiss the border of we coat as in the day of the serf system we be station here in poland about eight kilometer from the so-called road in a so-called village far from all civilization the village consist of a number of tumble-down cottage with room which we should not consider fit for stable for we horse the rain be stream down unceasingly as if heaven wish to wash away all the sin of the world we horse sink into the mud up to they knee we take up we quarter in this village after fifty-four hour ' march and come just in time to witness the end of a strange and tragic romance when i be about to open the door of a farm it be open from the inside and a subaltern come out with a face beam with satisfaction he report that a little while ago he with a few of he man partly capture and partly shoot down half a company of russian ` we be conceal ' he tell I ` we let they come quite near and then we start firing ' we enter a low-ceilinged room or pen sparsely light by wax candle the first object which catch my attention be a youthful russian soldier almost a child lie on a straw mattress smile as if asleep i approach i put my hand on he forehead ice-cold -- dead some of the man approach to take off the clothing other stand around in a half-circle silently look on suddenly there be a murmur they seem awe-stricken these brave fellow who be not daunt even by overwhelming odds they hesitate and one of they advance a few pace to I report : ` this russian soldier be a girl ' this happen in the year 1914 we find out that the girl be the betrothed of a russian officer and fight side by side with he throughout the campaign until kill by a shot in the breast the officer be take prisoner i bury she myself that same day in order to make clear what happen when i cross the german border for the last time i should explain that i now have with I several trophy which i have obtain with great difficulty and be correspondingly anxious to bring home among they be a german private 's helmet and a original iron cross of the second degree the mark on the temple band of the helmet say 48th regiment 4th army corps company 7 no 571909-1914 -- mean that the owner start service in 1909 and the helmet be issue to he in 1914 it be believe it belong to a soldier who be either wound or kill outside of antwerp the iron cross have on it : 1870 -lrb- when the order be start -rrb- and the letter f -lrb- friedrich -rrb- and the date of its issuance i should add that i do not rob a dead or die soldier of these trophy but i be ask not to show they in either belgium or england nor to state how i come by they and i have keep my promise i have also a fragment of shrapnel casing from a 32 cm shell -- the only bomb which hit the antwerp cathedral during the german attack it be give to I by mr edward eyre hunt who pick it up on the morning of the german entry there be also some belgian bullet clip and a bit of shrapnel pick up near the spot where i be knock down by the concussion of a burst shell on that same morning when i reach bentheim we be put through the usual search by the border patrol and military official of the zollamt i have pin the iron cross to my undershirt but the helmet be a bit bulky for such treatment take it out roar the officer who discover the headgear wrap in a sweater in my rucksack dass ist str-r-reng ver-r-rboten when i explain that i have come by it honestly and want to take it home he burst into a passion the fact that i show a letter from von bernstorff and explain that i be know in the foreign office in berlin make no impression whatsoever the officer say that if the owner be dead the helmet could not even go to he family it be government property and should return therefore to the commissary department at all event it must not leave the empire i miss my train and be keep in bentheim overnight in the morning i again try persuasion but without success as it be now a question of myself or the helmet i decide to get myself home i go back once more and as a final chance put up this proposition to my officer i show my credentials and explain that i be go to the hague would he in the mean time put my name on the helmet and if within forty-eight hour he receive a wire both from the foreign office in berlin and the hague legation would he send the helmet after I he glare at I for a moment yes he say he would at the hague i immediately visit the german legation and tell they of the custom officer 's promise from bitter experience i realize that in war-time out of sight be lose so far as baggage be concerned consequently i have give up all hope of my trophy a week later when i happen to be in dr van dyke 's study i notice a conical-shaped object rest on one of the secretary 's desk there on top of a pile of letter with herr horace green scribble in german script on a piece of paper pin to the green-gray service cover lay my dent battered and long-lost german private 's helmet simply because the fiery custom officer have give he word the german legation at the hague have telegraph to bentheim and also i take it to excellency von mumm at berlin and the custom official have ship the helmet to the dutch capital where the german legation obedient to promise have turn it over to the american legation for delivery to I the whole proceeding seem typical of the overbearing gruffness the systematic attention to detail and at the same time the thoroughgoing honesty of the german character so i tuck the helmet under my arm and say good-bye to dr van dyke and mr langhome who have make my stay at the hague so pleasant i cross the mine-strewn english channel for piccadilly circus two week later i be aboard the red star liner lapland drive one hundred mile out of she course through fear of german war craft yet pound along through a thick fog and hopefully head in the general direction of the good old statue of liberty appendix : atrocity i gain the impression give below and compile many of the instance on the now threadbare subject of atrocity during the time that i be in the war zone the opinion will not meet with favor in this country particularly at present when we seem on the point of break diplomatic relation with germany nevertheless i think these note present a point of view which ought to be know if only for the purpose of show the other side of the shield -- and of check to some extent the nursery tale in regard to personal atrocity which become more fanciful the farther they be tell from the scene of report occurrence after the horrible lusitanium crime and other evidence of german schrecklichkeit for which there can be no justification it be hard for american to reason fairly in question involve teutonic method of warfare i be therefore append the note in spite of a rather careful study of the bryce report on german atrocity in belgium they be of course to be take into consideration merely as the evidence of what one man happen to see or as be often more the case not to see in order that there may be no misunderstanding it be well to define the meaning of the word atrocity i suppose all will agree with I that the term do not include what may be call the necessary horror of war -- such as hunger and poverty result from the destruction of home and loss of livelihood the suffering of refugee drive by necessity from capture town starvation through no fault of the invader the accidental wounding of noncombatant peasant farmer etc for the present purpose the word be intend to include all case of unnecessary unprovoked personal cruelty as well as of course the outraging of woman such act for example as the report gouging-out of the eye of prisoner cut off the wrist of child the alleged stab of old woman cut off the wrist and ear of nurse and the more refined cruelty of which i have hear report be it go without say atrocity let we examine one or two of these near osnabruck germany a american visitor pacing up and down a railroad siding early one morning chew a mouthful of stale sausage meat between thick crust of rye bread hear a particular cruelty story which may be use here as a example it be tell by a army surgeon with whom he be have he peripatetic breakfast on the track alongside stand a so-called red cross train consist of a combination of well-equipped hospital coach with they triple row of berth sling one above the other as in a sleeper attach in the rear be a few coal carriage and freight truck this train be wait for the outbound traffic to pass by you see the outbound traffic consist of fresh troops be rush to the front in one of those quick transcontinental shift which have play so important a part in german strategy but the eastbound train carry only wound and die on they way back home so of course the hospital car must wait as long as necessary since they have no right or standing in the ruthless game call war in the cheerless interior of one of these freight car -lrb- much the same kind of car as that in which we be confine during the trip from brussels to aix -- apparently use as a horse-stall on the previous trip and with no bedding beyond a damp pile of straw in one corner -rrb- the american notice a young german private this particular fellow be not wound he wear no bandage he be the only occupant of the horse-stall and he pace up and down the board mutter mutter continually mutter to himself now and then he snatch up a musket go through the form of fix a bayonet and again and again lunge savagely at the wall of the car the red cross surgeon to whom the american go for information dismiss the matter casually by merely tap he forehead with he index finger just one of those insane case he say later in the day on better acquaintance the surgeon explain the matter in this fashion : -- the fellow be quarter in a village near lille do sentry duty on a house occupy by german officer there be a uprising of citizen from across the way native franc-tireurs fire shot into the house kill one officer and wound a second trace the firing across the street the remain officer enter a bakery-shop where they find several man and a woman all arm they order the man to be shoot the woman have in she hand a revolver with one of the cartridge chamber empty the german lieutenant see that she be about to become a mother he then explain the gravity of she offense tell she that she be practically guilty of murder and take away she weapon but under the circumstance he order she release instead of be shoot he turn he back and walk away about five pace suddenly the woman snatch another revolver from behind the counter and fire point-blank as he fall the officer call out to he orderly ` bayonet the woman ' the sentry do what he be order but you see it have affect the poor fellow 's mind this story along with a few other i have pick out from hundred of atrocity tale which i hear during four month spend in england belgium germany and holland it will serve as a example not only because it have the earmark of truth -- have be tell in a offhand way merely as a explanation of the private 's insanity -- but because it be typical of the kind of incident which in the tell be nine time out of ten twist into atrocious and wholly unrecognizable form under the law of military reprisal be there justification for the death of this woman be the die officer guilty of barbarian conduct and do the private order against he will to perform a act whose memory drive he insane commit a atrocity without answer the question let we consider for a moment how that particular anecdote would be tell by a belgian partisan in my wanderings through termonde liege and louvain i hear tale -- unspeakable and on they face utterly unbelievable -- of which this kind of thing must have be the foundation when the body of this woman be find let we say by french peasant return to they ruin home think how the horrible fact would be seize without whatsoever there be of justification how the british and french papers would describe that mutilate form think of the effect of a two-column word-picture of the wanton sack and ruin of the town the shooting of its helpless citizen and the description of that mangled body sacrify to the hun think how the fact would be clutch by fear-crazed inhabitant would be bandy from mouth to mouth distorted and dress up to suit a partisan press and twist by knave to make a trap for fool one of the first atrocity account which i hear in belgium as well as one of the most persistent have to do with score of child whose wrist have be cut by the kaiser 's troops hundred of they be report to be in belgium and dutch hospital or in the care of relief committee the gossip be so prevalent and in some instance so specific that i have high hope of track down and see with my own eye a instance in each case which i hear abroad my informant 's husband or brother or best friend have see the child but somehow or other it be never arrange that i could see one of they myself this type of cruelty be so widely talk about that in plenty of case the german soldier believe that some of they man have commit these crime one of they tell I that he understand that near tirlemont the wrist of several young child have be cut he say that thirty or forty child and peasant have fire on and kill german troops march through a neighbor village a squad be send to round up the offender all of whom be find armed instead of kill the sniper whose age be between ten and seventeen the surgeon be order to slice the tendon of the wrist so that the noncombatant should be prevent from hold a gun or use a knife soon after my ship the lapland dock in america i hear a case of whose verity owe to the source from which it come i have no doubt the refugee in question accord to my informant be a english nurse and lay with both wrist cut off at a well-known new york hospital on madison avenue she have be in brussels at the time of the german entry and be willing to work for the sake of humanity wheresoever there be sick to care for she have nurse wounded german officer eventually with a handful of english nurse still remain in brussels she have be deport to holland because it be fear that german secret be leak out in letter send by these english nurse this latter part coincide so precisely with the fact which during my stay in brussels i have find to be true that i have no doubt of the whole business on recovery the nurse be to exhibit herself and lecture for red cross fund i be tell this in strict confidence and i be to see and talk to the handless lady on condition that the story should not reach the press i agree but to my bitter disappointment the ----- hospital have never hear of the woman my informant then confess that he informant have make a mistake in the name of the hospital i offer four person ten dollar each to trace the matter to its source the final result be a telephone call from my informant say that a english lawyer now in new york state that to the best of he belief there be some such person in a hospital somewhere in new jersey merely for what they may be worth and not in any sense as conclusive i mention the case which come to my attention during a month spend in that part of belgium where the most savage of the atrocity be report -- a month devote to a diligent search for the truth -- i could run down only two instance where the fact be prove and where take all in all and look at from both side they constitute a atrocity i live in a atmosphere of popular apprehension frequently amount to terror a friend of mine saw child throw up they hand in terror and fall down on they knee before a squad of german uhlan who suddenly dash into a village near vilvorde the incident do not prove that uhlan be in the habit of act atrociously it do prove the popular fear of they near the same town i investigate the case of a peaceful villager report in the current conversation of the story to have have he ear cut off and to have be finish off with a half-dozen bayonet wound this i get at first hand from the man who have see the body i ask he how he know the man have be bayonet by german my informant say that he himself be run from the village where a skirmish be go on between a regiment of the enemy -lrb- german -rrb- and belgian carabineer that he be race for he life through a rain of bullet etc etc and that under fire of sharpshooter he stumble across this body he do not know the man be dead but the case interested he so later he go back -lrb- still under fire of the sharpshooter -rrb- and count the number of hole in the man 's shirt there be six he tell I and he be sure from the shape of the hole that they be the result of bayonet not bullet at one time when drive from ghent toward brussels with julius van hee the act consul-general of the united state at ghent we pass a little hillock of ground upon which be a small square slab of stone top by a pair of stick -- hardly more than stick -- in the shape of a cross there be a yarn float around the neighborhood which have almost crystallize into legend that this be the fresh grave of a child murder by the german because it refuse to salute they say the foot have be cut off and the boy be leave to bleed to death conceivably the story be true we do not stop for we could not carry the investigation to the point of digging up a fresh grave on the evening previous van hee have go over to he office to lock up preparatory to we early start for brussels a woman of louvain stand on the doorstep how on earth she have ever get back to ghent neither van hee nor luther who be in van hee 's office and who tell I the story could make out from she incoherent word she have be tear from she family drive from house and home with a mob of wretched woman and ship into cologne germany she be almost starve several other go mad for lack of water she now believe herself a widow between tear and hysteric she tell how soldier have enter she house how two of they have hold she husband against the wall at the point of a revolver while several other in succession violate she before she husband 's eye these story be not pleasant but in seek the real fact one can not work with kid glove of the hundred i have hear i have mention a few of those which show the kind of thing believe to have occur in the ravage country of all those which i hear the last mention and the one at the head of this chapter -- for which there be justification -- appear to have the greatest probability of truth during the first rush of war the german system of destruction and the doctrine of awfulness as i see it apply to physical object be barbaric relentless and totally unjustified at louvain aerschot and termonde it be at its height on the other hand in the mind of a impartial student of the fact there can not be the slightest doubt that at louvain there be a organize attack on the invader by sniper and franc-tireurs arm with knife gun revolver of every description a half-day spend en route from burn antwerp with a jesuit priest of louvain and the testimony of several villager would have convince I of this have i not already be convince by the story of other survivor the burning of village be one matter the outraging and torturing of woman and child another the truth of the former should not in any way convict a german officer much less private johann schmidt of unprovoked personal cruelty there undoubtedly be though i do not happen to see they numerous case of unprovoked cruelty and other evidence of barbarity that be bind to happen in any war of invasion the fact that i personally do not happen to see they and have find scarcely a non-partisan observer who do be neither here nor there i merely state the fact as one of the many bit of evidence which should be take into consideration i have no case for prussian militarism in so far as apply to inanimate object the german system of destruction in the early part of the war be utterly without excuse or justification the wreck and desolation the hunger and suffering of the larger portion of belgium be utterly beyond the comprehension of those who have not be there certainly word can not convey the impression the suffering particularly during the week follow the fall of antwerp be so awful and on so large a scale that the sens refuse to grasp it it have be say that in the civil war sheridan be command in push up the shenandoah valley to leave the countryside in such condition that a crow could not live on it a sparrow could not have exist in many part of belgium at the same time it be true that because of the torture endure by the belgian people because of the pain and horror of the war of invasion much of it unavoidable the american public because its sentiment be so strongly anti-german have be willing to believe anything of the race against whom run its prejudice truly remarkable be the rapidity with which atrocity story have be create and the relish with which they be swallow by drawing-room gossip those who have see the war do not find it necessary to talk about what do not exist mr arthur ruhl who have see and carefully study all side of the war apply the term nursery tale to the average atrocity story mr irvin cobb john t mccutcheon and other who have be on the ground also take they with a grain of salt curiously enough the closer one get to the actual fight the less bitter be the feeling between participant the greater they respect for one another and the less credulous they belief in the enemy 's barbarity a american who be recently discharge from seven month ' service with the british army tell I that during this time the only knowledge he have of personal atrocity be through the british and french newspaper and there be well-known story of oppose trench so closely situate that the soldier teach each other they respective national air and the chorus of they camp tune to return to another form of alleged outrage we have the ancient argument on the case of rheim a interesting contribution to the testimony have be give by cyril brown now special correspondent of the new york time in berlin brown make he way to the german army line before rheim where among other he interview first lieutenant wengler of the heavy artillery commander of a battery which shell the church spire but know among he comrade as the little friend of the rheim cathedral accord to lieutenant wengler two shot only strike the church spire -lrb- one from a fifteen centimeter howitzer another from a twenty-one centimeter mortar -rrb- and this after french observer have use the tower for five day between September thirteenth and eighteenth so spare be this young barbarian in spite of provocative fire obviously direct from the french cathedral that the friend of the rheim cathedral stick to he as a nickname in america brown 's statement provoke a storm of retort ally correspondent claim that a dozen shot at least crash through the roof set the scaffolding ablaze and that at a time when red cross flag be float from the tower and red cross be paint on the roof shell continue to devastate the beautiful interior etc etc there have be a quantity of discussion back and forth as to the number of shot fire now so far as the question of atrocity be concerned though every one will regret the ruin of this noble work of art i hold that it be not of the slightest importance whether there be fire two shell or seventeen or seventy-seven the important and only question at issue be whether the tower be use for observation purpose or in other word be there military justification for its attempt destruction military man english as well as german to whom i have talk take it as a matter of course that the highest spot in any locality be use for observation as a english officer in antwerp put it if the french do not use the church tower they be d ------ fool by way of guide and for sake of likely comparison i can state what i know do happen in two other city : termonde and antwerp in chapter ii of this book i have tell how we make we way across the broken bridge at termonde on the day of its second bombardment and how that night word come to we of the manner in which the belgian take revenge on the conqueror i tell how staff officer enter with a scout party at the head of a german column mount the only remain spire in the town with a few well-directed shot from they conceal battery west of the river the belgian destroy the tower and kill the officer the belgian take no little pride in they marksmanship on that occasion and boast freely of it in this case the use and therefore the destruction of the observation-post be look upon by the belgian as a natural and necessary instance of the work of war as evidence it be rather valuable because give unconsciously and without motive likewise at antwerp in all probability the fact have never be appreciate that during the bombardment of this city -- the most important from a military point of view in belgium -- the spire of the notre dame cathedral be use as a outlook-station by the belgian defender if not by both belgian and english on the inadvertent testimony of english themselves i know this to be true on the second night of the antwerp bombardment the american who have not leave the city be gather in the almost desert queen 's hotel along the water front some time during the evening i do not remember just when but it be while the british retreat be go on a english lad call lucien arthur jone burst in upon we at no little risk he have dodge through the desert street and fall shell much elate over the view of the enemy he have just get from the cathedral tower i have have bully luck he confide to I after i have do he a noble service -lrb- ie lend he a safety razor -rrb- belgian signal officer take I up to the tower where they can see everything the german be do the follow be take from he account -- a englishman 's account -- print in the london chronicle and copy in the new york time tribune and other papers : -- i now return to the event of Thursday at 1230 o'clock in the afternoon when the bombardment have already last over twelve hour through the courtesy of a belgian officer i be able to ascend to the roof of the cathedral and from that point of vantage i look down upon the scene in the city i could just discern through my glass dimly in the distance the instrument of culture of the attack german force ruthlessly pound at the city and creep nearer to it in the dark at that moment i should say the enemy 's front line be within four mile of antwerp from my elevated position i have a excellent view also of the great oil tank on the opposite side of the scheldt they have be set on fire by four bomb from a german taube and a huge thick volume of black smoke be ascend two hundred foot into the air the oil have be burn furiously for several hour and the whole neighborhood be envelop in a mist of smoke after watch for some considerable time the panorama of destruction that lay unrolled all around I i come down from my post of observation on the cathedral roof and at the very moment i reach the street a 28 - centimeter shell strike a confectioner 's shop between the place verte and the place de meir it be one of these high-explosive shell and the shop a wooden structure immediately burst into flame recapitulation the destruction of town and village and the vengeance against inanimate object show in the german march through belgium be barbaric it be provoke by organize resistance on the part of belgian franc-tireur and by shoot from behind shutter etc and other attack by citizen of the invade country the german though truthful in the statement of the cause inflict punishment out of all proportion to the crime the report of unprovoked personal atrocity it be nevertheless true have be hideously exaggerated wherever one real atrocity have occur it have be multigraph into a hundred case each with clever variation in detail be report as occur to a relative or close friend of the teller for campaign purpose and particularly in england for the sake of stimulate recruit a partisan press have help along the concoction of lie in every war of invasion there be bind to occur a certain amount of plunder and rapine the german system of reprisal be relentless but the german private as a individual be no more barbaric than he brother in the french the british or the belgian trench the end end of project gutenberg 's the log of a noncombatant by horace green
