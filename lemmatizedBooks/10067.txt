vagary hello i say as i take down the receiver of my desk ` phone in answer to the call mr vantine wish to speak to you sir say the office-boy all right and i hear the snap of the connection be that you lester ask philip vantine 's voice yes so you be back again get in yesterday can you come up to the house and lunch with I to-day i 'll be glad to i say and mean it for i like philip vantine i 'll look for you then about one-thirty and that be how it happen that a hour later i be walk over toward washington square just above which on the avenue the old vantine mansion stand it be almost the last survival of the old régime for the tide of business have long since overflow from the neighbouring street into the avenue and sweep its fashionable folk far uptown tall office and loft building have replace the brownstone house only here and there do some old family hold on like a sullen and desperate rear-guard defy the advance enemy philip vantine be one of these he have be bear in the house where he still live and declare that he would die there he have no one but himself to please in the matter since he be unmarried and live alone and he mitigate the increase roar and dust of the neighborhood by long absence abroad it be from one of these that he have just return i may as well complete this pencil-sketch vantine be about fifty year of age the possessor of a comfortable fortune something of a connoisseur in art matter a collector of old furniture a little eccentric -- though now that i have write the word i find that i must qualify it for he only eccentricity be that he persist in spite of many temptation in remain a bachelor marriageable woman have long since cease to consider he mother with mature daughter dismiss he with a significant shake of the head it be from they that he get the reputation of be a eccentric but he reason for remain single in no way concern he lawyer -- a position which we firm have hold for many year and the active work of which have come gradually into my hand it be not very arduous work consist for the most part of the drawing of lease the collect of rent the reinvestment of fund and the adjustment of minor difference with tenant -- all of which be leave to we discretion but occasionally it be necessary to consult we client on some matter of unusual importance or to get he signature to some paper and at such time i always enjoy the talk which follow the completion of the business for vantine be a good talker with a knowledge of man and of the world gain by much travel and by a detach humourous and penetrate habit of mind he come forward to meet I as i give he man my hat and stick and we shake hand heartily i be glad to see he and i think he be glad to see I he be look in excellent health and brown from the voyage over it be plain to see that the trip do you good i say yes he agree i never feel more fit but come along we can talk at table there be a little difficulty i want you to untangle for I i follow he upstairs to he study where a table lay for two have be place near a low window i have lunch serve up here vantine explain as we sit down because this be the only really pleasant room leave in the house if i do not own that plot of ground next door this place would be impossible as it be i can keep the sky-scraper far enough away to get a little sunshine now and then i have have to put in a air filter too and double window in the bedroom to keep out the noise but i dare say i can manage to hang on i can understand how you would hate to move into a new house i say vantine make a grimace i could not endure a new house i be use to this one -- i can find my way about in it i know where thing be i have grow up here you know and as a man get older he value such association more and more besides a new house would mean new fitting new furniture -- he pause and glance about the room every piece of furniture in it be the work of a master i suppose you find some new thing while you be away i say you always do you luck 's proverbial yes -- and it be that i want to talk to you about i bring back six or eight piece i 'll show they to you presently they be all pretty good and one be a thing of beauty it be more than that -- it be a absolutely unique work of art only unfortunately it be not mine it be not yours no and i do not know whose it be if i do i would go buy it that be what i want you to do for I it be a boule cabinet -- the most exquisite i ever see where do it come from i question more and more surprised it come from pari and it be address to I the only explanation i can think of be that my shipper at paris make a mistake send I a cabinet belong to some one else and send mine to the other person you have buy one then yes and it have not turn up but beside this one it be a mere daub my man park get it through the custom yesterday as there be a boule cabinet on my manifest the mistake be not discover until the whole lot be bring up here and uncrate this morning be not they uncrate in the custom no i have be bring thing in for a good many year and the custom people know i be not a thief that be quite a compliment i point out they have be tear thing wide open lately they have have a tip of some sort i suppose come in he add answer a tap at the door the door open and vantine 's man come in a gentleman to see you sir he say and hand vantine a card vantine look at it a little blankly i do not know he he say what do he want he want to see you sir very bad i should say what about well i could not just make out sir but it seem to be important could not make out what do you mean park i think he be a frenchman sir anyway he do not know much english he be not much of a looker sir -- i have see hundred like he sit out in front of the cafés along the boulevard take all afternoon to drink a bock vantine seem strike by a sudden idea and he look at the card again then he tap it meditatively on the table shall i show he out sir ask park at last no say vantine after a instant 's hesitation tell he to wait and he drop the card on the table beside he plate i tell you lester he go on as park withdraw when i go downstairs this morning and see that cabinet i could hardly believe my eye i think i know furniture but i have not any idea such a cabinet exist the most beautiful i have ever see be at the louvre it stand in the salle loui fourteenth to the leave as you enter it belong to loui himself of course i can not be certain without a careful examination but i believe that cabinet beautiful as it be be merely the counterpart of this one he pause and look at I he eye bright with the enthusiasm of the connoisseur i be not sure i understand you jargon i say what do you mean by ` counterpart ' boule furniture he explain be usually of ebony inlay with tortoise-shell and incrust with arabesque in metal of various kind the incrustation have to be very exact and to get it so the artist clamp together two plate of equal size and thickness one of metal the other of tortoise-shell trace he design on the top one and then cut they both out together the result be two combination the original with a tortoise-shell ground and metal application and the counterpart appliqué metal with tortoise-shell arabesque the original be really the one which the artist design and whose effect he study the counterpart be merely a resultant accident with which he be not especially concerned understand yes i think so i say it be a good deal as though michael angelo when he make one of he sketch white on black put a sheet of carbon under he paper and make a copy at the same time black on white precisely and it be the original which have the real artistic value of course the counterpart be often beautiful too but in a much lower degree i can understand that i say and now lester vantine go on he eye shine more and more if my supposition be correct -- if the grand loui be content with the counterpart of this cabinet for the long gallery at versaille who do you suppose own the original i see what he be drive at you mean one of he mistress yes and i think i know which one -- it belong to madame de montespan i stare at he in astonishment as he sit back in he chair smile across at I but i object you can not be sure -- of course i be not sure he agree quickly that be to say i could not prove it but there be some -- ah -- contributory evidence i think you lawyer call it boule and the montespan be in they glory at the same time and i can imagine that flamboyant creature commission the flamboyant artist to build she just such a cabinet really vantine i exclaimed i do not know you be so romantic you quite take my breath away he flush a little at the word and i see how deeply in earnest he be the craze of the collector take he a long way sometimes he say but i believe i know what i be talk about i be go to make a careful examination of the cabinet as soon as i can perhaps i 'll find something -- there ought to be a monogram on it somewhere what i want you to do be to cable my shipper armand et fils rue du temple find out who own this cabinet and buy it for I perhaps the owner will not sell i suggest oh yes he will anything can be buy -- for a price you mean you be go to have this cabinet whatever the cost i mean just that but surely there be a limit no there be not at least you 'll tell I where to begin i say i do not know anything of the value of such thing well say vantine suppose you begin at ten thousand franc we must not seem too eager it be because i be so eager i want you to carry it through for I i can not trust myself and the other end there be not any other end of course strictly speak there be because my money be not unlimited but i do not believe you will have to go over five hundred thousand franc i gasp you mean you be willing to give a hundred thousand dollar for this cabinet vantine nod maybe a little more if the owner will not accept that you must let I know before you break off negotiation i be a little mad about it i fancy -- all collector be a little mad but i want that cabinet and i be go to have it i do not reply i only look at he and he laugh as he catch my glance i can see you share that opinion lester he say you fear for I i do not blame you -- but come and see it he lead the way out of the room and down the stair but when we reach the lower hall he pause perhaps i would better see my visitor first he say you 'll find a new picture or two over there in the music-room -- i 'll be with you in a minute i start on and he turn through a doorway at the leave a instant later i hear a sharp exclamation then he voice call I lester come here he cry i run back along the hall into the room which he have enter he be stand just inside the door look there he say with a queer catch in he voice and point with a tremble hand to a dark object on the floor i move aside to see it better then my heart give a sickening throb for the object on the floor be the body of a man chapter ii the first tragedy it need but a glance to tell I that the man be dead there could be no life in that livid face in those glassy eye do not touch he i say for vantine have start forward it be too late i draw he back and we stand for a moment shake as one always be by sudden and unexpected contact with death who be he i ask at last i do not know answer vantine hoarsely i never see he before then he stride to the bell and ring it violently park he go on sternly as that worthy appear at the door what have be go on in here go on sir repeat park with a look of amazement not only at the word but at the tone in which they be utter i be sure i do not know what -- then he glance fall upon the huddle body and he stop short he eye stare he mouth open well say he master sharply who be he what be he do here why -- why stammer park thickly that be the man who be wait to see you sir you mean he have be kill in this house demand vantine he be certainly alive when he come in sir say park recover something of he self-possession maybe he be just look for a quiet place where he could kill himself he seem kind of excite of course agree vantine with a sigh of relief that be the explanation only i wish he have choose some place else i suppose we shall have to call the police lester yes i say and the coroner suppose you leave it to I we 'll lock up this room and nobody must leave the house until the police arrive very well assent vantine visibly relieved i 'll see to that and he hasten away while i go to the ` phone call up police headquarters and tell briefly what have happen twenty minute later there be a ring at the bell and park open the door and admit four man why hello simmond i say recognize in the first one the detective-sergeant who have assist in clear up the marathon mystery and back of he be coroner goldberger whom i have meet in two previous case while the third countenance look at I with a quizzical smile be that of jim godfrey the _ record 's _ star reporter the fourth man be a policeman in uniform who at a word from simmond take he station at the door yes say godfrey as we shake hand i happen to be talk to simmond when the call come in and i think i might as well come along what be it just a suicide i think and i unlock the door into the room where the dead man lay simmond goldberger and godfrey step inside i follow and close the door nothing have be disturb i say no one have touch the body simmond nod and glance inquiringly about the room but godfrey 's eye i notice be on the face of the dead man goldberger drop to he knee beside the body look into the eye and touch he finger to the left wrist then he stand erect again and look down at the body and as i follow he gaze i note its attitude more accurately than i have do in the first shock of discover it it be lie on its right side half on its stomach with its right arm double under it and its left hand clutch at the floor above its head the knee be draw up as though in a convulsion and the face be horribly contorted with a sort of purple tinge under the skin as though the blood have be suddenly congeal the eye be wide open and they glassy stare add not a little to the apparent terror and suffering of the face it be not a pleasant sight and after a moment i turn my eye away with a shiver of repugnance the coroner glance at simmond not much question as to the cause he say poison of course of course nod simmond but what kind ask godfrey it will take a post-mortem to tell that and goldberger bent for another close look at the distorted face i be free to admit the symptom be not the usual one godfrey shrug he shoulder i should say not he agree and turn away to a inspection of the room what can you tell we about it mr lester goldberger question i tell all i know -- how park have announce a man 's arrival how vantine and i have come downstairs together how vantine have call I and finally how park have identify the body as that of the strange caller have you any theory about it goldberger ask only that the call be merely a pretext -- that what the man be really look for be a place where he could kill himself unobserved how long a time elapse after park announce the man before you and mr vantine come downstairs half a hour perhaps goldberger nod let 's have park in he say i open the door and call to park who be sit on the bottom step of the stair goldberger look he over carefully as he step into the room but there could be no two opinion about park he have be with vantine for eight or ten year and the earmark of the competent and faithful servant be apparent all over he do you know this man goldberger ask with a gesture toward the body no sir say park i never see he till about a hour ago when roger call I downstairs and say there be a man to see mr vantine who be rogers he be the footman sir he answer the door when the man ring well and then what happen i take he card up to mr vantine sir do mr vantine know he no sir he want to know what he want what _ do _ he want i do not know sir he could not speak english hardly at all -- he be french i think goldberger look down at the body again and nod go ahead he say and he be so excited park add that he could not remember what little english he do know what make you think he be excite the way he stutter and the way he eye glint that be what make I think he just come in here to kill hisself quiet like -- i should not be surprise if you find that he would escape from somewhere i have a notion to put he out without bother mr vantine -- i wish now i have -- but i take he card up and mr vantine say for he to wait so i come downstairs again and show the man in here and say mr vantine would see he presently and then roger and I go back to we lunch and we sit there eat till the bell ring and i come in and find mr vantine here do you mean to say that you and roger go away and left this stranger here by himself the servant ' dining-room be right at the end of the hall sir we leave the door open so that we could see right along the hall clear to the front door if he would come out into the hall we would have see he and he do not come out into the hall while you be there no sir do anybody come in oh no sir the front door have a snap-lock it can not be open from the outside without a key so you be perfectly sure that no one either enter or leave the house by the front door while you and roger be sit there nor by the back door either sir to get out the back way you have to pass through the room where we be where be the other servant the cook be in the kitchen sir this be the housemaid 's afternoon out the coroner pause godfrey and simmond have both listen to this interrogation but neither have be idle they have walk softly about the room have look through a door open into another room beyond have examine the fastening of the window and have end by look minutely over the carpet what be the room yonder use for ask godfrey point to the connect door it be a sort of store-room just now sir say park mr vantine be just back from europe and we have be unpack in there some of the thing he buy while abroad i guess that be all say goldberger after a moment send in mr vantine please park go out and vantine come in a moment later he corroborate exactly the story tell by park and myself but he add one detail here be the man 's card he say and hold out a square of pasteboard goldberger take the card glance at it and pass it on to simmond that do not tell we much say the latter and give the card to godfrey i look over he shoulder and see that it contain a single engraved line : m théophile d'aurelle except that he be french as park suggest say godfrey that be evident too from the cut of he clothes yes and from the cut of he hair add goldberger you say you do not know he mr vantine i never before saw he to my knowledge answer vantine the name be wholly unknown to I well say goldberger take possession of the card again and slip it into he pocket suppose we lift he onto that couch by the window and take a look through he clothes the man be slightly build so that simmond and goldberger raise the body between they without difficulty and place it on the couch i see godfrey 's eye search the carpet what i should like to know he say after a moment be this : if this fellow take poison what do he take it out of where 's the paper or bottle or whatever it be maybe it be in he hand suggest simmond and lift the right hand which hang trail over the side of the couch then as he raise it into the light a sharp cry burst from he look here he say and hold the hand so that we all could see it be swollen and darkly discolor see there say simmond something bit he and he point to two deep incision on the back of the hand just above the knuckle from which a few drop of blood have ooze and dry with a little exclamation of surprise and excitement godfrey bent for a instant above the injured hand then he turn and look at we this man do not take poison he say in a low voice he be kill chapter iii the wounded hand he be kill repeat godfrey with conviction and at the word we draw together a little with a shiver of repulsion death be awesome enough at any time suicide add to its horror murder give it the final touch so we all stand silent stare as though fascinate at the hand which simmond hold up to we at those tiny wound encircle by discolor flesh and with a sinister dash of clot blood run away from they then goldberger take a deep breath voice the thought which have spring into my own brain why it look like a snake-bite he say he voice sharp with astonishment and indeed it do those two tiny incision scarcely half a inch apart might well have be make by a serpent 's fang the quick glance which all of we cast about the room be of course as involuntary as the chill which run up we spine yet godfrey and i -- yes and simmond -- have the excuse that once upon a time we have have a encounter with a deadly snake which none of we be likely ever to forget we all smile a little sheepishly as we catch each other 's eye no i do not think it be a snake say godfrey and again bent close above the hand smell it mr goldberger he add the coroner put he nose close to the hand and sniff bitter almond he say which mean prussic acid say godfrey and not snake poison he fall silent a moment he eye on the swollen hand the rest of we stare at it too and i suppose all the other be labor as i be with the effort to find some thread of theory amid this chaos it might of course have be self-inflicted godfrey add quite to himself goldberger sneer a little no doubt he find the incomprehensibility of the problem rather try to he temper a man do not usually commit suicide by stick himself in the hand with a fork he say no agree godfrey blandly but i would point out that we do not know as yet that it _ be _ a case of suicide and i be quite sure that whatever it may be it be not usual goldberger 's sneer deepen do any reporter for the _ record _ ever find a case that _ be _ usual he query it be a shrewd thrust and one that godfrey might well have wince under for the _ record _ theory be that nothing be news unless it be strange and startling and the inevitable result be that the _ record _ reporter endeavor to make everything strange and startling to play up the outré detail at the expense of the rest of the story and even i fear to invent such detail when none exist godfrey himself have be accuse more than once of a too-luxuriant imagination it be perhaps a realisation of this which have persuade he year before to quit the detective force and take service with the _ record _ what might have be a weakness in the first position be a mighty asset in the latter one and he have win a immense success please understand that i set this down in no spirit of criticism i have know godfrey rather intimately ever since the day when we be throw together in solve the holladay case and i admire sincerely he ready wit he quick insight and he unshakable aplomb he use he imagination in a way which often cause I to reflect that the police would be far more efficient if they possess a dash of the same quality and i have notice that they be usually glad of he assistance while he former connection with the force and he careful maintenance of the friendship form at that time give he a entrée to place deny to less-fortunate reporter i have never know he to do a dishonourable thing -- to fight for a cause he think unjust to print a fact give to he in confidence or to make a statement which he know to be untrue moreover a lively sense of humor make he a admirable companion and it be this quality perhaps which enable he to receive goldberger 's thrust with a good-natured smile we have get we living to make you know he say we make it as honestly as we can what do _ you _ think simmond i think say simmond who if he possess a imagination never permit it to be suspect that those little cut on the hand be merely a accident they might have be cause in half a dozen way maybe he hit he hand on something when he fall maybe he jab it on a buckle maybe he have a boil on he hand and lance it with he knife what kill he then godfrey demand poison -- and it be in he stomach we 'll find it there how about the odour godfrey persist he spill some of the poison on he hand as he lift it to he mouth maybe he have those cut on he hand and the poison inflamed they or maybe he be get some kind of blood disease goldberger nod he approval and godfrey smile as he look at he it be easy to find explanation be not it he query it be a blame sight easier to find a natural and simple explanation retort goldberger hotly than it be to find a unnatural and far-fetched one -- such as how one man could kill another by scratch he on the hand i suppose you think this fellow be murder that be what you say a minute ago perhaps i be a little hasty godfrey admit and i suspect that whatever he thought he have make up he mind to keep they to himself i be not go to theorise until i have get something to start with the fact seem to point to suicide but if he swallow prussic acid where 's the bottle he do not swallow that too do he maybe we 'll find it in he clothes suggest simmond thus remind goldberger fall to work look through the dead man 's pocket the clothes be of a cheap material and not very new so that in life he must have present a appearance somewhat shabby there be a purse in the inside coat pocket contain two bill one for ten dollar and one for five and there be two or three dollar in silver and four five-centime piece in a small coin purse which he carry in he trousers ' pocket the larger purse have four or five call card in one of its compartment each bear a different name none of they he on the back of one of they vantine 's address be write in pencil there be no letter no papers no write document of any kind in the pocket the remainder of whose contents consist of such odds and end as any man might carry about with he -- a cheap watch a pen-knife a half-empty packet of french tobacco a sheaf of cigarette paper four or five key on a ring a silk handkerchief and perhaps some other article which i have forget -- but not a thing to assist in establish he identity we 'll have to cable over to pari remark simmond he be french all right -- that silk handkerchief prove it yes -- and he best girl prove it too put in godfrey he best girl for answer godfrey hold up the watch which he have be examine he have open the case and inside it be a photograph -- the photograph of a woman with bold dark eye and full lip and oval face -- a face so typically french that it be not to be mistake a lady 's - maid i should say add godfrey look at it again rather good-looking at one time but past she first youth and so compel perhaps to bestow she affection on a man a little beneath she -- no doubt compel also to contribute to he support in order to retain he a woman with many past and no future -- oh come break in goldberger impatiently keep you second-hand epigram for the _ record _ what we want be fact godfrey flush a little at the word and lay down the watch there be one fact which you have apparently overlook he say quietly but it prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that this fellow do not drift in here by accident he come here of intention and the intention be not to kill himself either how do you know that demand goldberger incredulously godfrey pick up the purse open it and take out one of the card by this he say and hold it up you have already see what be write on the back of it -- mr vantine 's name and the number of this house that prove do not it that this fellow come to new york expressly to see mr vantine perhaps you think mr vantine kill he suggest goldberger sarcastically no say godfrey he do not have time you understand mr vantine he add smile at that gentleman who be listen to all this with perplexed countenance we be simply talk now about possibility you could not possibly have kill this fellow because lester have testify that he be with you constantly from the moment this man enter the house until he body be find with the exception of the few seconds which elapse between the time you enter this room and the time he join you here summon by you cry so you be out of the run thanks say vantine drily i suppose then you think it be park say goldberger it may quite possibly have be park agree godfrey gravely nonsense break in vantine impatiently park be as straight as a string -- he be be with I for eight year of course it be nonsense assent goldberger it be nonsense to say that he be kill by anybody he kill himself we 'll learn the cause when we identify he -- jealousy maybe or maybe just hard luck -- he do not look affluent i 'll cable to paris say simmond if he belong there we 'll soon find out who he be you would better call a ambulance and have he take to the morgue go on goldberger somebody may identify he there there 'll be a crowd to-morrow for of course the papers will be full of this affair -- the _ record _ at least will have a very full account godfrey assure he and i 'll call the inquest for the day after goldberger continue i 'll send my physician down to make a post-mortem right away if there be any poison in this fellow 's stomach we 'll find it godfrey do not speak but i know what be in he mind he be think that if such poison exist the vessel which have contain it have not yet be find the same thought no doubt occur to simmond for after order the policeman in the hall to call the ambulance he return and begin a careful search of the room use he electric torch to illumine every shadowed corner godfrey devoted himself to a similar search but both be without result then godfrey make a minute inspection of the injured hand while goldberger look on with ill-concealed impatience and finally he move toward the door i think i 'll be go he say but i be interested in what you physician will find mr coroner he 'll find poison all right assert goldberger with decision perhaps he will admit godfrey strange thing happen in this world will you be at home to-night lester yes i expect to be i answer you be still at the marathon yes i say suite fourteen perhaps i 'll drop around to see you he say and a moment later we hear the door close behind he as park let he out godfrey 's a good man say goldberger but he be too romantic he look for a mystery in every crime whereas most crime be merely plain downright brutality take this case here be a man kill himself and godfrey want we to believe that death result from a scratch on the hand why there be no poison on earth would kill a man as quick as that -- for he must have drop dead before he could get out of the room to summon help if it be prussic acid he swallow it remember he be not in this room more than fifteen or twenty minute and he be quite dead when mr vantine find he man do not die as easily as all that -- not from a scratch on the hand they do not die easily at all it be astonishing how much it take to kill a man -- how the spirit or whatever you choose to call it cling to life how do you explain the address on the card mr goldberger i ask my theory be that this fellow really have some business with mr vantine probably he want to borrow some money or ask for help and then while he be wait he suddenly give the thing up and kill himself the address have no bearing whatever that i can see on the question of suicide and i 'll say this mr lester if this be not suicide it be the strangest case i ever have anything to do with yes i agree if it be not suicide we come to a blank wall right away that be it and goldberger nod emphatically here be the ambulance he add as the bell ring the bearer enter with the stretcher place the body on it and carry it away goldberger pause to gather up the article he have take from the dead man 's pocket you gentleman will have to give you testimony at the inquest he say so will park and roger it will be day after to-morrow probably at ten o'clock but i 'll notify you of the hour very well i say we 'll be there and goldberger bid we good-bye and leave the house and now i add to vantine i must be get back to the office they 'll be ask the police to look for I next man alive and i glance at my watch it be after four o'clock too late for the office say vantine better come upstairs and have a drink besides i want to talk with you at least i 'll let they know i be still alive i say and i call up the office and allay any anxiety that may have be feel there concern I i must admit that it do not seem acute i feel the need of a bracer after all this excitement vantine remark as he open the cellarette help yourself i dare say you be use to this sort of thing -- find dead man lie around i query with a smile no -- it be not so common as you seem to think tell I lester and he look at I earnestly do you think that poor devil come in here just to get a chance to kill himself quietly no i do not i say then what do he come in for i think goldberger 's theory a pretty good one -- that he have hear of you as a generous fellow and come in here to ask help and while he be wait suddenly give it up -- and kill himself vantine complete i hesitate i be astonish to find at the back of my mind a grow doubt see here lester vantine demand if he do not kill himself what happen to he heaven only know i answer in despair i have be ask myself the same question without find a reasonable answer to it as i say to goldberger it be a blank wall but if anybody can see through it jim godfrey can vantine seem deeply perturb he take a turn or two up and down the room then stop in front of I and look I earnestly in the eye tell I lester he say do you believe that theory of godfrey 's -- that that insignificant wound on the hand cause death it seem absurd do not it but godfrey be a sort of genius at divine such thing then you _ do _ believe it i ask myself the same question before i answer yes i do i say finally vantine walk up and down the room again he eye on the floor he brow contract lester he say at last i have a queer feeling that the business which bring this man here in some way concern the boule cabinet i be tell you about perhaps it belong to he hardly i protest recall he shabby appearance at any rate i remember as i be look at he card that some such thought occur to I it be for that reason i tell park to ask he to wait it be possible of course i admit but that would not explain he excitement and that remind I i add i have not send off that cable any time to-night will do it will be deliver in the morning but you have not see the cabinet yet come down and look at it he lead the way down the stair park meet we in the lower hall there be a delegation of reporter outside sir he say they say they have get to see you vantine make a movement of impatience tell they he say that i positively refuse to see they or to allow my servant to see they let they get they information from the police very well sir say park and turn away grin vantine pass on through the ante-room in which we have find the body of the unfortunate frenchman and into the room beyond five or six piece of furniture evidently just unpacked stand there but ignorant as i be of such thing he do not have to point out to I the boule cabinet it dominate the room much as madame de montespan no doubt dominate the court at versaille i look at it for some moment for it be certainly a beautiful piece of work with a wealth of inlay and incrustation little short of marvellous but i may as well say here that i never really appreciate it the florid style of the fourteenth and fifteenth loui be not at all to my taste and i be too little of a connoisseur to admire a beauty which have no personal appeal for I so i be afraid that vantine find I a little cold certainly there be nothing cold about the way he regard it he eye gleam with a strange fire as he look at it he run he finger over the inlay with a touch almost reverent he pull out for I the little drawer with much the same air that another friend of mine take down he kilmarnock burn from he bookshelf he point out to I the grace of its curve in the same tone that one use to discuss the masterpiece of a great artist and then find no echo to he enthusiasm he suddenly stop you do not seem to care for it he say look at I that be my fault and not the fault of the cabinet i point out i be not educate up to it i be too little of a artist perhaps he be flush as a man might be should another make a disparage remark about he wife and he lead the way from the room at once remember lester he say a little sternly pause with he hand on the front door there be to be no foolishness about secure that cabinet for I do not you let it get away i be in deadly earnest i will not let it get away i promise perhaps it be just as well i be not over-enthusiastic about it let I know as soon as you have any news he say and open the door for I i have intend walk home but as i turn up the avenue i meet sweep down it a flood of girl just release from the workshop of the neighborhood i struggle against it for a few moment then give it up hail a cab and settle back against the cushion with a sigh of relief i be glad to be out of vantine 's house something there oppress I and leave I ill at ease be vantine quite normal i wonder could any man be normal who be willing to pay a hundred thousand dollar for a piece of furniture especially a man who could not afford such extravagance i know the size of vantine 's fortune it be large but a hundred thousand dollar represent more than a year 's income and then i smile to myself of course vantine have be merely jest when he name that limit the cabinet could be buy for a tenth of it at the most and still smile i leave the cab pay the driver and mount to my room chapter iv the thunderbolt it be about eight o'clock that evening that godfrey tap at my door and when i let he in i could tell by the way he eye be shine that he have some news i can not stay long he say i have get to get down to the office and put the finishing touch on that story but nevertheless he take the cigar i proffer he and sink into the chair opposite my own i know godfrey so i wait patiently until the cigar be go nicely then -- well i ask it be like old time be not it lester and he smile across at I how many conference have we have in this room how many of you cigar have i make away with not half enough recently i say you have not be here for month i be sure to drift back sooner or later because you seem to have a knack of get in on the interesting case and i want to say this lester that of all i ever have not one have promise better than this one do if it only keep up -- but one must not expect too much you have be work on it of course i have not be idle and just now i be feel rather pleased with myself the coroner 's physician finish he post-mortem half a hour or so ago well i say again the stomach be absolutely normal it show no trace of poison of any kind he stretch himself lay back in he chair send a smoke-ring circling toward the ceiling and watch it smile absently rather a facer for we friend goldberger he add after a minute what be the matter with goldberger he seem rather peeve with you this afternoon no wonder he be grady 's man and we be after grady grady be not fit to head the detective bureau -- he get the job through he pull with tammany -- he be stupid and i suspect he be crooked the _ record _ say he have get to go so of course he _ will _ go i comment smile he certainly will assent godfrey seriously and that before long but meanwhile it be a little difficult for I because he people do not know which way to jump once he be out everything will be serene again i be not interested in grady so i come back to the case in hand look here godfrey i say if it be not poison what be it but it _ be _ poison insert at the hand he nod goldberger say there be no poison know which could be use that way and which would act so quickly goldberger be right in that agree godfrey but there be a poison unknown that will -- because it do it be not a snake bite oh no snake poison would not kill a man that quickly -- not even a fer-de-lance that fellow practically drop where he be strike then what be it godfrey be sit erect again he be not smile now he face be very stern that be what i be go to find out lester he say that be the problem i have set myself to solve -- and it be a pretty one there be one thing certain -- that fellow be kill by some agency outside himself in some way a drop or two of poison be introduce into he blood by a instrument something like a hypodermic needle and that poison be so powerful that almost instantly it cause paralysis of the heart after all that be not so remarkable as it might seem the blood in the vein of the hand would be carry back to the heart in four or five seconds but you have already say there be no poison so powerful as all that i say we do not know of any i would not be so sure that catherine de medicus do not what have catherine de medicus to do with it nothing -- except that what have be do may always be do again those old story be no doubt exaggerated but it seem fairly certain that the queen of navarre be kill with a pair of poison glove the duc d'anjou with the scent of a poison rise and the prince de porcian with the smoke of a poison lamp this case be not as extraordinary as those no i agree and fall silent shiver a little for there be something horrible and revolting about the poisoner after all go on godfrey at last there be one thing that neither you nor i nor any reasonable man can believe and that be that this frenchman come from heaven know where -- from pari perhaps -- with vantine 's address in he pocket and hunt up the house and make he way into it simply to kill himself there he have some other object and he meet he death while try to accomplish it have you find out who he be no he be not register at any of the hotel the french consul never hear of he he belong to none of the french society he be not know in the french quarter he seem to have drop in from the cloud we have cable we pari office to look he up we may hear from there to-night but even if we discover the identity of théophile d'aurelle it will not help we any why not i demand because it be evident that that be not he name go ahead and tell I godfrey i say as he look at I smile i do not see it why it be plain enough he have five card in he pocket no two alike the sixth select probably at random he have send up to vantine i see it then of course and i feel a good deal as the spanish savant must have feel when columbus stand the egg on end godfrey smile again at my expression the real d'aurelle whoever he may turn out to be may be able to help we he add if he can not we may learn something from the pari police the dead man 's bertillon measurement have be cable over to they even that will not help if he have never be arrest and of course we can not get at motive until we find out something about he but godfrey i say suppose you know who he be and what he want with vantine -- suppose you could make a guess at who kill he and why -- how be it do that be what stump I how be it do ah agree godfrey that be it how be it do i tell you it be a pretty case lester but wait till we hear from pari that remind I i say sit up suddenly i have get to cable to pari myself on some business for mr vantine not connect with this affair oh no he shipper over there send he a piece of furniture that do not belong to he he ask I to straighten the matter out i ring for the hall-boy ask for a cable-blank and send off a message to armand & son tell they of the mistake and ask they to cable the name of the owner of the cabinet now in mr vantine 's possession godfrey sit smoking reflectively while i be thus engage stare straight before he with eye that see nothing but as i sit down again and take up my pipe ready to continue the conversation he give himself a sort of shake put on he hat and get to he foot i must be move along he say there be no use sit here theorise until we have some sort of foundation to build on goldberger be right in one thing i remark he point out after you leave that most crime be not romance but mere brutality perhaps this one -- the ringing of my telephone stop I hello i say take down the receiver be that you mr lester ask a voice yes this be park and i suddenly realize that he voice be unfamiliar because it be hoarse and quiver with emotion could you come down to the house right away sir why yes i say wonderingly if it be important do mr vantine need I we all need you say the voice and break into a dry sob for god 's sake come quick mr lester all right i say without further parley for evidently he have lose he self-control something have happen down at vantine 's i add to godfrey as i hang up the receiver park seem to be scare to death he want I to come down right away and i reach for my hat and coat shall i come too ask godfrey even under the stress of the moment i could not but smile at the question and at the tone in which it be utter perhaps you would better i agree it sound pretty serious we go down together in the elevator and three minute later we have hail a taxi and be speed eastward toward the avenue it have start to drizzle and the asphalt shone like a black mirror dancing with the light along either side the street be almost empty for the theatre-crowd have pass and as we reach the avenue and turn down-town the driver push up he spark and we hurtle along toward fourteenth street at a speed which make I think of the traffic regulation but no policeman interfere and five minute later we draw up before the vantine place park must have be on the front step look for I for he come run down they almost before the car have stop i catch a glimpse of he face under the street light as i thrust a bill into the driver 's hand and it fairly startle I be it you mr lester he gasp good god but i be glad you be here -- i catch he by the arm steady man i say do not let yourself go to piece now -- what have happen he seem to take a sort of desperate grip of himself i 'll show you sir he say and run up the step along the hall to the door of the ante-room where we have find the frenchman 's body in there sir he sob in there and cling to the wall as i open the door and step inside the room be ablaze with light and for a instant my eye be so dazzle that i could distinguish nothing dimly i see godfrey spring forward and drop to he knee then my eye clear and i see on the very spot where d'aurelle have die another body -- or be it the same bring back that the tragedy of the afternoon might in some mysterious way be re-enact i remember bend over and peer into the face -- it be the face of philip vantine a minute must have pass as i stand there daze and shake i be conscious in a way that godfrey be examine he then i hear he voice he be dead he say then there be a instant 's silence lester look here cry godfrey 's voice sharp insistent for god 's sake look here godfrey be kneel there hold something toward I look here he cry again it be the dead man 's hand he be hold the right hand a swollen and discolor hand and on the back of it just above the knuckle be two tiny wound from which a few drop of blood have trickle and as i stare at this ghastly sight scarce able to believe my eye i hear a choke voice behind I say over and over again : it be that woman do it it be that woman do it damn she it be that woman do it chapter v grady take a hand i have no very clear remembrance of what happen after that the shock be so great that i have just strength enough to totter to a chair and drop into it and sit there stare vaguely at that dark splotch on the carpet i tell myself that i be the victim of a dreadful nightmare that all this be the result of over-wrought nerve and that i should wake presently no doubt i have be work too hard i need a vacation -- well i would take it and all the time i know that it be not a nightmare but grim reality that philip vantine be dead -- kill by a woman who have tell I that and then i remember the sob voice two or three person come into the room -- park and the other servant i suppose i hear godfrey 's voice give order and finally someone hold a glass to my lip and command I to drink i do so mechanically cough splutter be conscious of a grateful warmth and drink eagerly again and then i see godfrey standing over I feel better he ask i nod i do not wonder it knock you out he go on i be feel shaky myself i have they call vantine 's physician -- but he can not do anything he be dead then i murmured my eye on that dark and crumpled object which have be philip vantine yes -- just like the other then i remembered and i catch he arm and draw he down to I godfrey i whisper whose voice be it -- or do i dream it -- something about a woman you do not dream it -- it be roger -- he be almost hysterical we 'll get the story as soon as he quiet down someone call he from the door and he turn away leave I stare blankly at nothing so there have be a woman in vantine 's life perhaps that be why he have never marry what ugly skeleton be to be drag from its closet but if a woman kill vantine the same woman also kill d'aurelle where be she hiding-place from what ambush do she strike i glance about the room as a tremor of horror seize I i arise shake from the chair and grope my way toward the door godfrey hear I come swing around and with one glance at my face come to I and catch I by the arm what be it lester he ask i can not stand it here i gasp it be too horrible do not think about it come out here and have another drink he lead I into the hall and a second glass of brandy give I back something of my self-control i be ashamed of my weakness but when i glance at godfrey i see how white he face be better take a drink yourself i say i hear the decanter rattle on the glass i do not know when i have be so shake he say set the glass down empty it be so gruesome -- so unexpected -- and then roger carry on like a madman ah here be the doctor he add as the front door open and park show a man in i know dr hughe of course return he nod and follow he and godfrey into the ante-room but i have not yet sufficiently recover to do more than sit and stare at he as he kneel beside the body and assure himself that life have flee then i hear godfrey tell he all we know while hughe listen with incredulous face but it be absurd you know he protest when godfrey have finish thing like this do not happen here in new york in florence perhaps in the middle age but not here in the twentieth century i can scarcely believe my own sens godfrey agree but i see the frenchman lie here this afternoon and now here 's vantine on the same spot as nearly as i can tell and kill in the same way kill in precisely the same way hughe turn back to the body again and look long and earnestly at the injured hand what sort of instrument make this wound would you say mr godfrey he question at last a sharp instrument with two prong my theory be that the prong be hollow like a hypodermic needle and leave a drop or two of poison at the bottom of the wound you see a vein have be cut yes hughe assent it would scarcely be possible to pierce the hand here without strike a vein one of the prong would be sure to do it that be the reason there be two of they i fancy but you be of course aware that no poison exist which would act so quickly hughe inquire godfrey look at he strangely you yourself mention florence a moment ago he say you mean i suppose that such a poison do at one time exist there something of the sort perhaps agree hughe the word be purely instinctive but i suppose some such thought be run through my head well the poison that exist in florence five century ago exist here to-day there be the proof of it and godfrey point to the body hughe draw a deep breath of wonder and horror but what sort of devilish instrument be it he cry he nerve give way for a instant he voice mount shrilly above all who wield it he stare about the room as though half-expecting to see some mighty and remorseless arm poise ready to strike then he shake himself together i beg pardon he say mop the sweat from he face but i be not use to this sort of thing and i be frightened -- yes i really believe i be frightened and he laugh a little unsteady laugh so be i say godfrey so be lester so be everybody you need not be ashamed of it what frighten I go on hughe evidently study he own symptom be the mystery of it -- there be something supernatural about it -- something i can not understand how do it happen that each of the victim be strike on the right hand why not the left hand why the hand at all godfrey answer with a despairing shrug that be what we have get to find out he say we shall have to call in the police suggest hughe maybe they can solve it godfrey smile a little sceptical smile quickly suppress at least they will have to be give the chance he agree shall i attend to it yes say hughe and you would better do it right away the sooner they get here the better very well assent godfrey and leave the room hughe sit down heavily on the couch near the window and mop he face again with a shake hand death he be accustom to -- but death meet decently in bed and result from some understand cause death in this horrible and mysterious form shake he he could not understand it and he failure to understand appal he he be a physician it be he business to understand and yet here be death in a form as mysterious to he as to the veriest layman it compel he to pause and take stock of himself -- always a disconcerting process to the best of we that be a try half hour hughe sit on the couch breathing heavily stare at the floor perhaps pass he own ignorance in review perhaps wonder if he have always be right in prescribe this or that as for I i be think of my dead friend i remembered philip vantine as i have always know he -- a kindly witty christian gentleman i could see he pleasant eye look at I in friendship as they have look a few hour before i could hear he voice could feel the clasp of he hand that such a man should be kill like this strike down by a mysterious assassin arm with a poison weapon a woman always my mind come back to that a woman poison be a woman 's weapon but who be she how have she escape where have she conceal herself how be she able to strike so surely above all why should she have choose philip vantine of all man for she victim -- philip vantine who have never injure any woman -- and then i pause for i realize that i know nothing of vantine except what he have choose to tell I park would know and then i shrink from the thought must we probe that secret must we compel a man to betray he master my face be burn no we could not do that -- that would be abominable the door open and godfrey come in this time he be not alone simmond and goldberger follow he and they face show that they be as shake and nonplussed as i there be a third man with they whom i do not know but i soon find out that it be freylinghuisen the coroner 's physician they all look at the body and freylinghuisen kneel beside it and examine the injured hand then he sit down by dr hughe and they be soon deep in a low-toned conversation whose subject i could guess i could also guess what simmond and godfrey be talk about in the farther corner but i could not guess why goldberger instead of get to work should be walk up and down pull impatiently at he moustache and glancing at he watch now and then he seem to be wait for some one but not until twenty minute later do i suspect who it be then the door open again to admit a short heavy-set man with florid face stubbly black moustache and little close-set eye preternaturally bright he glance about the room nod to goldberger and then look inquiringly at I this be mr lester commissioner grady say goldberger and i realize that the chief of the detective bureau have come up from headquarters to take personal charge of the case mr lester be mr vantine 's attorney the coroner add in explanation glad to know you mr lester say grady shortly and now i guess we be ready to begin go on the coroner not quite say grady grimly we 'll excuse all reporter first and he look across at godfrey he face darken i feel my own face flushing and start to protest but godfrey silence I with a little gesture it be all right lester he say mr grady be quite within he rights i 'll withdraw -- until he send for I you 'll have a long wait then retort grady with a sarcastic laugh the longer i wait the worse it will be for you mr grady say godfrey quietly open the door and close it behind he grady stare after he for a moment in crimson amazement then master himself with a effort he turn to the coroner all right goldberger he say and sit down to watch the proceedings a very few minute suffice for hughe and freylinghuisen and i to tell all we know of this tragedy and of the one which have precede it grady seem already acquaint with the detail of d'aurelle 's death for he listen without interrupt only nod from time to time you have get a list of the servant here of course simmond he say when we have finish the story yes sir and simmond hand it to he h-m say grady as he glance it over five of 'em know anything about 'em they have all be with mr vantine a long time sir reply simmond so far as i have be able to judge they be all right which one of 'em find vantine 's body park i think i say it be he who call I better have he in say grady and double up the list and slip it into he pocket park come in look decidedly shaky but answer grady 's question clearly and concisely he tell first of the event of the afternoon and then pass on to the evening mr vantine have dinner at home sir he say it be serve i think at seven o'clock he must have finish a little after seven-thirty i do not see he for i be straighten thing around up in he room and put he clothes away but he tell roger -- never mind what he tell roger break in grady just tell we what you know very well sir say park submissively i have a lot of work to do -- we just get back from europe yesterday you know -- and i keep on put thing in they place and straighten around and it must have be half-past eight when i hear roger yell for I i think the house be on fire and i come down in a hurry roger be stand out there in the hall look like he would see a ghost he kind of gasp and point to this room and i look in and see mr vantine lay there -- he voice choke at the word but he manage to go on after a moment then i telephone for mr lester he add and that be all i know very well say grady that be all for the present send roger in roger 's face as he enter the room give I a kind of shock for it be that of a man on the verge of hysteria he be a man of about fifty with iron-grey hair and a smooth-shaven face ordinarily ruddy with health but now he face be livid he cheek line and shrink he eye blood-shot and stare he reel rather than walk into the room one hand clutch at he throat as though he be choke get he a chair say grady and simmond bring one forward and remain standing beside it now my man grady continue you 'll have to brace up what be the matter with you anyhow do not you ever see a dead man before it be not that gasp roger it be not that -- though i never see a murder man before what demand grady sharply do not you see that fellow this afternoon that be different roger moan i do not know he besides i think he would kill himself we all think so and you do not think vantine do i know he do not and roger 's voice rise to a shrill scream it be that woman do it damn she she do it i knowed she be up to some crooked work when i let she in chapter vi the woman in the case it be come now the secret however sordid however ugly be to be unveil i see grady 's face set in hard line i could hear the stir of interest with which the other lean forward grady take a flask from he pocket and open it take a drink of this he say and place it in roger 's hand i could hear the mouth of the flask clatter against he tooth as he put it eagerly to he mouth and take three or four long swallow thank you sir he say more steadily and hand the flask back to its owner a little color creep into he face but i fancy there be a new look in he eye -- for as the horror fade fear take its place grady screw the cap on the flask with great deliberation and return it to he pocket and all the time roger be watch he furtively wipe he mouth mechanically with a tremble hand now roger grady begin i want you to take you time and tell we in detail everything that happen here to-night you say a woman do it well we want to hear all about that woman now go ahead and remember there be no hurry well sir begin roger slowly as though carefully consider he word mr vantine come out from dinner about half-past seven -- maybe a little later than that -- and tell I to light all the light in here and in the next room you see there be gas and electric both sir and i light they all he have go into the music-room on the other side of the hall so i go over there and tell he the light be all light he be look at a new picture he have buy but he leave it right away and come out into the hall ' i do not want to be disturbed roger ' he say and come in here and shut the door after he it be maybe twenty minute after that that the door-bell ring and when i open the door there be a woman standing on the step he stop and swallow once or twice as though he throat be dry and i see that he finger be twitch nervously do you know she question grady roger loosen he collar with a convulsive movement no sir i would never see she before he answer hoarsely describe she roger close he eye as though in a effort of recollection she wear a heavy veil sir so that i could not see she very well but the first thing i notice be she eye -- they be so bright they seem to burn right through I she face look white behind she veil and i could see how red she lip be -- i do not like she look sir from the first how be she dress in a dark gown sir cut so skimpy that i knowed she be french before she speak ah say grady she be french be she yes sir though she could speak some english she ask for mr vantine i tell she mr vantine be busy and then she say something very fast about how she must see he and all the time she keep edge in and in till the first thing i knowed she be inside the door and then she just pull the door out of my hand and shut it i ask you sir be that the way a lady would behave no say grady i dare say not but go ahead -- and take you time roger have regain he self-confidence and he go ahead almost glibly ` see here madam ' say i ` we have have enough trouble here to-day with frenchy and if you do not get out quietly why i 'll have to put you out ' ' i must see mistaire vangtine ' she say very fast ' i must see mistaire vangtine it be most necessaire that i see mistaire vangtine ' ` then i 'll have to put you out ' say i and take hold of she arm and at that she scream and jerk herself away and i grab she again and just then mr vantine open the door there and come out into the hall ` what be all this roger ' he say ` who be this party ' but before i could answer that wild cat have rush over to he and begin to reel off a string of french so fast i wonder how she get she breath and mr vantine look at she kind of surprised at first and then he get more interested and finally he ask she in here and shut the door and that be the last i saw of they you mean you do not let the woman out demand grady yes sir that be just what i mean i think if mr vantine want to talk with she well and good that be he business not mine so i go back to the pantry to help the cook with the silver expect to hear the bell every minute but the bell do not ring and after maybe half a hour i come out into the hall again to see if the woman have go and i walk past the door of this room but do not hear nothing and then i go on to the front door and be surprise to find it be not latch maybe you have not latch it suggest grady it have a snap-lock sir when that woman slam it shut i hear it catch you be sure of that quite sure sir what do you do then i close the door sir and then come back along the hall i feel uneasy some way and i stand outside the door there listen but i could not hear nothing and then i tap but there be not no answer so i tap louder with my heart somehow work right up into my mouth and still there be not no answer so i just open the door and look in -- and the first thing i see be he -- roger stop suddenly and catch at he throat again i 'll be all right in a minute sir he gasp it take I this way sometimes no hurry grady assure he and then when he breath be come easier what do you do then i be so scared i could not scarcely stand sir but i manage to get to the foot of the stair and yell for park and he come run down -- and that be all i remember sir the woman be not here no sir do you look through the room no sir when i find the front door open i knowed she would go out she have not shut the door because she be afraid i would hear she that sound probable agree grady but what make you think she kill vantine well sir answer roger slowly i guess i ought not to have say that but find the door open that way and then come on mr vantine sort of upset I -- i do not know just what i be say you do not think so now then question grady sharply i do not know what to think sir you say you never see the woman before never sir have she ever be here before i do not think so sir the first thing she ask be if this be where mr vantine live grady nod very good roger he say i 'll be offer you a place on the force next would you know this woman if you see she again roger hesitate i would not like to say sure sir he answer at last i might and i might not red lip and a white face and bright eye be not much to go on grady point out can not you give we a closer description i be afraid not sir i just get a general impression like of she face through she veil you say you do not search these room no sir i do not come inside the door why not i be afraid to sir afraid to yes sir i be afraid to be here now do park come in no sir i guess he feel the same way i do then how do you know vantine be dead why do not you try to help he one look be enough to tell I that be not no use say roger and glance with visible horror at the crumpled form on the floor grady look at he keenly for a moment but there seem to be no reason to doubt he story then the detective look about the room there be one thing i do not understand he say and that be why vantine should want all these light what be he do in here i could not be sure sir but i suppose he be look at the furniture he bring over from europe he be a collector you know sir there be five or six piece in the next room without a word grady arise and pass into the room adjoining we after he only roger remain seat where he be i remember glance back over my shoulder and note how he huddle forward in he chair as though crush by a great weight the instant we back be turn but i forget roger in contemplation of the scene before I the inner room be ablaze with light and the furniture stand hap-hazard about it just as i have see it earlier in the day only one thing have be move that be the boule cabinet it have be carry to the center of the room and place in the full glare of the light from the chandelier it stand there blaze with arrogant beauty a thing apart who have help vantine place it there i wonder neither roger nor park have mention do so i turn back to the outer room roger be sit crouch forward in he chair he hand over he eye and i could feel he jerk with nervousness as i touch he on the shoulder oh be it you mr lester he gasp pardon I sir i be not at all myself sir i can see that i say soothingly and no wonder i just want to ask you -- do you help move any of the furniture in the room yonder help move it sir yes -- help change the position of any of it since this afternoon no sir i have not touch any of it sir that be all right then i say and turn back into the inner room vantine have say that he intend examine the cabinet in detail at the first opportunity i remember how he eye have gleam as he look at it how he hand have tremble as he caress the arabesque no doubt he be make that examination when he have hear a woman 's cry and have go out into the hall to see what the matter be then he and the woman have enter the ante-room together he have close the door and then like a lightning-flash a thought leap into my brain -- a reason -- a explanation -- wild improbable absurd but still a explanation i choke back the cry which rise to my lip i grip my hand behind I in a desperate attempt to hold myself in check and fascinate as by a deadly serpent i stand stare at the cabinet for there i feel certain lay the clue to the mystery chapter vii roger get a shock grady simmond and goldberger examine the room minutely for they seem to feel that the secret of the tragedy lay somewhere within its four wall but i watch they only absently for i have lose interest in the procedure i be perfectly sure that they would find nothing in any way bearing upon the mystery i hear grady comment upon the fact that there be no door except the one opening into the ante-room and see they examine the window-catch nobody could raise these window without alarming the house grady say and point to a tiny wire run along the woodwork there be a burglar alarm simmond assent and finally the trio return to the ante-room we would like to look over the rest of the house grady say to roger who be sit erect again look more like himself and the four man go out into the hall together i remain behind with hughe and freylinghuisen they have lift the body to the couch and be make a careful examination of it heavy at heart i sit down near by and watch they that philip vantine should have be kill by enthusiasm for the hobby which have give he so much pleasure seem the very irony of fate yet such i believe to be the case to be sure there be various incident which seem to conflict with such a theory and the theory itself seem wild to the point of absurdity but at least it be a ray of light in what have be utter darkness i turn it over and over in my mind try to fit into it the happening of the day -- i must confess with very poor success freylinghuisen 's voice bring I out of my reverie the two case be precisely alike he be say the symptom be identical and i be certain we shall find paralysis of the heart and spinal cord in this case just as i do in the other both man be kill by the same poison can you make a guess as to the nature of the poison hughe inquire some variant of hydrocyanic acid i fancy -- the odour indicate that but it must be about fifty time as deadly as hydrocyanic acid be they wander away into a discussion of possible variant so technical and be-sprinkled with abstruse word and formula that i could not follow they freylinghuisen of course have all this sort of thing at he finger ' end -- post-mortem be he every-day occupation and no doubt he have be furbish himself up since this last one in preparation for the inquest where he would naturally wish to shine i could see that he enjoy display he knowledge before hughe who although a family practitioner of high standing with a income greater than freylinghuisen 's many time over have no such expert knowledge of toxicology as a coroner 's physician would naturally possess the two detective and the coroner come back while the discussion be still in progress and listen in silence to freylinghuisen 's statement of the case grady 's mahogany face tell absolutely nothing of what be pass in he brain but simmond be plainly bewilder it be evident from he look that nothing have be find to shed any light on the mystery and now that he suicide theory have fall to piece he be completely at sea so i suspect be grady but he be too self-composed to betray it the coroner draw the two physician aside and talk to they for a few moment in a low tone then he turn to grady freylinghuisen think there be no necessity for a post-mortem he say the symptom be in every way identical with those of the other man who be kill here this afternoon there can be no question that both of they die from the same cause he be ready to make he return to that effect very well assent grady the body can be turn over to the relative then there be not any relative i say at least no near one vantine be the last of this branch of the family i happen to know that we firm have be name as he executor in he will so if there be no objection i 'll take charge of thing very well mr lester say grady again and then he look at I do you know the provision of the will he ask i do in the light of those provision do you know of any one who would have a interest in vantine 's death i think i may tell you the provision i say after a moment with the exception of a few legacy to he servant he whole fortune be leave to the metropolitan museum of art you have be he attorney for some time we have be he legal adviser for many year have you ever learn that he have a enemy no i answer instantly so far as i know he have not a enemy on earth he be never marry i believe no be he ever to you knowledge involve with a woman no i say again i be astounded when i hear roger 's story so you can give we no hint as to this woman 's identity i only wish i could i say with fervor thank you mr lester and grady turn to simmond i do not see that there be anything more we can do here he add there be one thing though mr lester i will have to ask you to do that be to keep all the servant here until after the inquest if you think there be any doubt of you ability to do that we can of course put they under arrest -- oh that be not necessary i break in i will be responsible for they appearance at the inquest i 'll have to postpone it a day say goldberger i want freylinghuisen to make some test to-morrow besides we have get to identify d'aurelle and these gentleman seem to have they work cut out for they in find this woman -- grady look at goldberger in a way which indicate that he think he be talk too much and the coroner stop abruptly a moment later all four man leave the house dr hughe linger for a last word the undertaker have better be call at once he say it will not do to delay too long i know what he mean already the face of the dead man be show certain ugly discolouration i can send he around on my way home he add and i thank he for assume this unpleasant duty as the door close behind he i hear a step on the stair and turn to see godfrey calmly descend i come in a few minute ago he explain in answer to my look and have be glance around upstairs nothing there how do we friend grady get along fairly well but if he guess anything he face do not show it he face never show anything because there be nothing to show he have cultivate that sibylline look until people think he be a wonder but he be simply a stupid ignoramus oh come godfrey i protest you be prejudice he go right to the point do you know roger 's story about the woman certainly roger tell it to I before grady arrive well i comment you do not lose any time i never do he assent blandly and now i be go to prove to you that grady be merely a stupid ignoramus he have hear all the evidence but do he know who that woman be of course not i say and then i look at he do you mean that you do then i be a ignoramus too my dear lester protest godfrey you be not a detective -- that be not you business but it _ be _ grady 's at least it be suppose to be and the safety of this city as a place of residence depend more or less upon the truth of that assumption on the strength of it he have be make deputy police commissioner in charge of the detective bureau then you mean that you _ do _ know who she be i be pretty sure i do -- that be what i come back to prove where 's roger i 'll ring for he i say and do so and presently he appear do you ring sir he ask he be still miserably nervous but much more self-controlled than he have be earlier in the evening yes i say mr godfrey wish to speak to you it seem to I that roger turn visibly paler there be certainly fear in the glance he turn upon my companion but godfrey smile reassuringly we would better give he he instruction about the reporter first thing have not we lester he inquire which reporter i query all the other of course they will be storm this house roger before long you will meet they at the door you will refuse to admit one of they you will tell they that there be nothing to be learn here and that they must go to the police tell they that commissioner grady himself be in charge of the case and will no doubt be glad to talk to they be that right lester yes ulyss i agree smile and now continue godfrey watch roger keenly i have a photograph here that i want you to look at do you ever see that person before and he hand a print to roger the latter hesitate a instant and then take the print with a tremble hand stark fear be in he eye again then slowly he raise the print to the light glance at it catch he lester godfrey cry and spring forward for roger clutch wildly at he collar spin half around and fall with a crash godfrey 's arm break the fall somewhat but as for I i be too daze to move get some water quick godfrey command sharply as park come run up roger have be take ill and then as park speed down the hall again i see godfrey loosen the collar of the unconscious man and begin to chafe he temple fiercely i hope it be not apoplexy he mutter i ought not to have shock he like that at the word i remembered and stoop pick up the photograph which have flutter from roger 's nerveless finger and then i too utter a smother exclamation as i gazed at the dark eye the full lip the oval face -- the face which d'aurelle have carry in he watch chapter viii precaution but it be not apoplexy it be park who reassure we when he come hurry back a minute later with a glass of water in one hand and a small phial in the other he have these spell he say it be a kind of vertigo give he a whiff of this he uncork the phial and hand it to godfrey and i catch the penetrate fume of ammonia a moment later roger gasp convulsively he 'll be all right pretty soon remark park with ready optimism though i never see he quite so bad we can not leave he lie here on the floor say godfrey there be a couch-seat in the music-room park suggest and the three of we bear the still unconscious man to it then godfrey and i sit down and wait while he gasp he way back to life though he can not really tell we much godfrey observe in fact i doubt if he 'll be willing to tell anything but he face when he look at the picture tell we all we need to know thus remind i take the photograph out of the pocket into which i have slip it and look at it again where do you get it i ask the police photographer make some copy this be one of they but what make you suspect that the two woman be the same i do not just know answer godfrey reflectively they be both french -- and roger speak of the red lip somehow it seem probable mr grady will find some thing he do not know in to-morrow 's _ record _ but then he usually do this time i be go to rub it in hello he add we friend be come around i look at roger and see that he eye be open they be stare at we as though wonder who we be godfrey pass a arm under he head and hold the glass of water to he lip take a swallow of this he say and roger obey mechanically still stare at he over the rim of the glass how do you feel pretty weak roger answer almost in a whisper do i have a fit something like that say godfrey cheerfully but do not worry you 'll soon be all right again what send I off ask roger and stare up at he then he face turn purple and i think he be go off again but after a moment 's heavy breathing he lay quiet i remember now he say let I see that picture again i pass it to he he hand be tremble so he could hardly take it but i see he be struggle desperately to control himself and he manage to hold the picture up before he eye and look at it with apparent unconcern do you know she godfrey ask to my infinite amazement roger shake he head never see she before he mutter when i first look at she i think i know she but it be not the same woman do you mean to say godfrey demand sternly that that be not the woman who call on mr vantine to-night again roger shake he head oh no he protest it be not the same woman at all this one be younger godfrey make no reply but he sit down and look at roger and roger lay and gaze at the picture and gradually he face soften as though at some tender memory come roger i urge at last you would better tell we all you know if this be the woman do not hesitate to say so i have tell you all i know mr lester say roger but he do not meet my eye and i be feel pretty bad i think i would better be get to bed yes that be best agree godfrey promptly park will help you and he hold out he hand for the photograph roger relinquish it with evident reluctance he open he lip as though to ask a question then close they again and get slowly to he foot park aid he good-night gentleman he say weakly and shuffle away lean heavily on park 's shoulder well say i look at godfrey what do you think of that he be lie of course we have get to find out why he be lie and bring it home to he but it be get late -- i must get down to the office one word lester -- be sure roger do not give you the slip i 'll have he look after i promise but i fancy he 'll be afraid to run away besides it be possible he be tell the truth i do not believe any woman have anything to do with either death godfrey turn as he be start away and stop to look at I who do then he ask nobody you mean they both suicide in that abnormal way no it be not suicide -- they be kill -- but not by a human being -- at least not directly i feel that i be flounder hopelessly and stop i can not tell you now godfrey i plead i have not have time to think it out you have get enough for one day yes he smile i have get enough for one day and now good-bye perhaps i 'll look in on you about midnight on my way home if i get through by then i sigh godfrey 's energy become a little wear sometimes i be already longing for bed and there remain so much to be do but he after a day which i know have be a hard one and with a many-column story still to write be apparently as fresh and eager as ever all right i agree if you see a light come up if there be not any light i 'll be in bed and i 'll kill you if you wake I condition accept he laugh as i open the door for he park join I as i turn back into the house i get roger to bed sir he say he 'll be all right in the morning but he be a queer duck how long have you know he park he be be with mr vantine about five year i do not know much about he he be a silent kind of fellow keep to hisself a good deal and sort of brooding over thing but he do he work all right except once in a while when he keel over like he do to-night park i say suddenly i be go to ask you a question you know that mr vantine be a friend of mine and i think a great deal of he now what with this story roger tell and one or two other thing there be talk of a woman be there any foundation for talk of that kind no sir say park emphatically i have be mr vantine 's valet for eight year and more and in all that time he have never be mix up with a woman in any shape or form i always fancy he would love a lady who die -- i do not know what make I think so but anyhow since i have know he he never look at a woman -- not in that way thank you park i say with a sigh of relief i have be through so much to-day that i feel i could not endure that and now -- beg pardon sir say a voice at my elbow we have everything ready sir i turn with a start to see a little clean-shaven man standing there rub he hand softly together and gaze blandly up at I the undertaker 's assistant sir explain park see my look of astonishment he come while you and mr godfrey be in the music-room dr hughe send he yes sir add the little man and we have the corpse ready for the coffin very nice it look too though it be a hard job be it poison kill he sir yes i answer with a feeling of nausea it be poison very powerful poison too i should say sir we do not get here none too soon where shall we put the body sir why not leave it where it be i ask impatiently very good sir say the man and presently he and he assistant take themselves off to my intense relief and now park i begin there be something i want to say to you let we go somewhere and sit down suppose we go up to the study sir you be look regularly do up if you 'll permit I to say so sir shall i get you something a brandy-and-soda i assent and bring one for yourself very good sir and a few minute later we be sit opposite each other in the room where vantine have offer I similar refreshment not many hour before i look at park as he sit there and turn over in my mind what i have to say to he i like the man and i feel he could be trust at any rate i have to take the risk now park i begin again set down my glass what i have to say to you be very serious and i want you to keep it to yourself : i know that you be devote to mr vantine -- i may as well tell you that he have remember you in he will -- and i be sure you be willing to do anything in you power to help solve the mystery of he death that i be sir park agree warmly i be very fond of he sir nobody will miss he more than i will i realize that the tragedy mean far more to park than it do even to I for he have lose not only a friend but a means of livelihood and i look at he with heighten sympathy i know how you feel i say and i be count on you to help I i have a sort of idea how he death come about only the vaguest possible idea i add hastily as he eye widen with interest altogether too vague to be put into word but i can say this much -- the mystery whatever it be be in the ante-room where the body be find or in the room next to it where the furniture be now i be go to lock up those room and i want you to see that nobody enter they without you knowledge not very likely that anybody will want to enter they sir and park laugh a grim little laugh i be not so sure of that i dissent speak very seriously in fact i be of the opinion that there _ be _ somebody who want to enter those room very badly i do not know who he be and i do not know what he be after but i be go to make it you business to keep he out and to capture he if you catch he try to get in trust I for that sir say park promptly what be it you want I to do i want you to put a cot in the hallway outside the door of the ante-room and sleep there to-night to-morrow i will decide what further precaution be necessary very good sir say park i 'll get the cot up at once there be one thing more i go on i have give the coroner my personal assurance that none of the servant will leave the house until after the inquest i suppose i can rely on they oh yes sir i 'll see they understand how important it be roger especially i add look at he i understand sir say park quietly very well and now let we go down and lock up those room they be still ablaze with light but both of we falter a little i think on the threshold of the ante-room for in the middle of the floor stand a stretcher and on it be a object cover with a sheet its outline horribly suggestive but i take myself in hand and enter park follow I and close the door the ante-room have two window and the room beyond which be a corner one have three all of they be lock but a pane of glass seem to I a absurdly fragile barrier against any one who really wish to enter be not there some wooden shutter for these window i ask yes sir they be take down yesterday and put in the basement shall i get they i think you would better i say will you need any help no sir they be not heavy if you 'll wait here you can snap the bolt into place when i lift they up from the outside very well i agree and park hurry away i enter the inner room and stop before the boule cabinet there be a certain air of arrogance about it as it stand there in that blaze of light its inlay aglow with a thousand subtle reflection a flaunting air the air of a courtesan conscious of she beauty and pleased to attract attention -- just the air with which madame de montespan must have saunter down the mirror gallery at versaille ablaze with jewel she skirt rustling she figure sway suggestively something threatening too something sinister and deadly -- there be a rattle at the window and i see park lift one of the shutter into place i throw up the sash and press the heavy bolt carefully into they socket then close the sash and lock it the two other window be secure in they turn and with a last look about the room i turn out the light the ante-room window be soon shutter in the same way and with a sigh of relief i tell myself that no entrance to the house could be have from that direction with park outside the only door the room ought to be safe from invasion then before extinguish the light i approach that silent figure on the stretcher lift the sheet and look for the last time upon the face of my dead friend it be no longer stare and terrible but calm and peaceful as in sleep -- almost smile with wet eye and contract throat i cover the face again turn out the light and leave the room park meet I in the hall carry a cot which he place close across the doorway there he say nobody will get into that room without my know it no i agree and then a sudden thought occur to I park i say be it true that there be a burglar-alarm on all the window yes sir it ring a bell in mr vantine 's bedroom and another in mine and send in a call to the police be it work yes sir mr vantine himself test it this evening just before dinner then why do not it work when i open those window just now i demand park laugh because i throw off the switch sir he explain when i come out to get the shutter the switch be in a little iron box on the wall just back of the stair sir it be one of my duty to turn it on every night before i go to bed i breathe a sigh of relief be it on again now it certainly be sir after what you tell I i would not be likely to forget it you would better have a weapon handy too i suggest i have a revolver sir that be good and do not hesitate to use it i be go home -- i be dead tired shall i call a cab sir no the walk will do I good i 'll see you to-morrow park help I into my coat and open the door for I glance back after a moment i see that he be stand on the step gaze after I i could understand he reluctance to go back into that death-haunted house and i find myself breathe deeply with the relief of get out of it chapter ix guess at the riddle the walk uptown do I good the rain have cease and the air feel clean and fresh as though it have be wash i take deep breath of it and the feeling of fatigue and depression which have weigh upon I gradually vanish i be in no hurry -- go out of my way a little indeed to walk out into madison square and look back at the towering mass of the flatiron building creamy and delicate as carve ivory under the ray of the moon -- and it be long past midnight when i finally turn in at the marathon higgin the janitor be just close the outer door and he join I in the elevator a moment later there be a gentleman wait to see you sir he say as the car start upward mr godfrey sir he come in about ten minute ago he say you be expect he so i let he into you room that be right i say and reflect again upon godfrey 's exhaustless energy i find he loll in a easy chair and he look up with a smile at my entrance higgin say you have not come in yet he explain so i think i would wait a few minute on the off chance that you might not be too tired to talk if you be say so and i 'll be move along i be not too tired i say hang up my coat i feel a good deal better than i do a hour ago i see that you be about all in how do you keep it up godfrey i ask sit down opposite he you do not seem tired at all i _ be _ tire though he say a little but i have get a fool brain that will not let my body go to sleep so long as there be work to be do then as soon as everything be finish the brain let go and the body sleep like a log now i know i could not go to sleep properly to-night until i have hear the very interesting theory you be go to confide to I besides i have a thing or two to tell you go ahead i say we have a cable from we pari office just before i leave it seem that m théophile d'aurelle play the fiddle in the orchestra of the café de paris he play as usual to-night so that it be manifestly impossible that he should also be lie in the new york morgue moreover none of he friend so far as he know be in america no doubt he may be able to identify the photograph of the dead man and we have already start one on the way but we can not hear from it for six or eight day but my guess be right -- the fellow 's name be not d'aurelle you say you have a photograph yes i have some take of the body this afternoon here be one of they keep it you may have a use for it i take the card and as i gazed at the face depict upon it i realize that the distorted countenance i have see in the afternoon have give I no idea of the man 's appearance now the eye be close and the feature compose and peaceful but even death fail to give they any dignity it be a weak and dissipate face the face of a hanger-on of cafés as park have say -- of a loiterer along the boulevard of a man without ambition and capable of any depth of meanness and deceit at least that be how i read it he be evidently low-class say godfrey watch I one of those parasite without work and without income so common in pari shop-girl and lady ' maid have a weakness for they i think you be right i agree but at the same time if he be of that type i do not see what business he could have have with philip vantine neither do i but there be a lot of other thing i do not see either we be all in the dark lester have you think of that absolutely in the dark yes i have think of it i say slowly no doubt we can establish this fellow 's identity in time -- sooner than we think perhaps for most of the morning papers will run he picture and if he be know here in new york at all it will be recognize by some one when we find out who he be we can probably guess at the nature of he business with vantine we can find out who the woman be who call to see vantine to-night -- that be just a case of grill roger then we can run she down and get she secret out of she we can find why roger be try to shield she all that be comparatively simple but when we have do it all when we have all these fact in hand i be afraid we shall find that they be utterly unimportant unimportant i echo but surely -- unimportant because we do not want to know these thing what we want to know be how philip vantine and this unknown frenchman be kill and that be just the one thing which i be convinced neither the man nor the woman nor roger nor anybody else we have come across in this case can tell we there be a personality behind all this that we have not even suspect yet and which i be free to confess i do not know how to get at it puzzle I it rather frighten I it be like a threatening shadow which one can not get hold of there be a moment 's silence then i decide the time have come for I to speak godfrey i say what i be about to tell you be tell in confidence and must be hold in confidence until i give you permission to use it do you agree go on he say he eye on my face well i believe i know how these two man be kill listen and i tell he in detail the story of the boule cabinet i repeat vantine 's theory of its first ownership i name the price which he be ready to pay for it i describe the difference between a original and a counterpart and dwelt upon vantine 's assertion that this be a original of unique and unquestionable artistry long before i have finish godfrey be out of he chair and pacing up and down the room he face flush he eye glowing beautiful he murmur from time to time immense what a case it will make lester he cry stop before my chair and beam down upon I as i finish the story unique too that be the beauty of it as unique as this adorable boule cabinet then you see it too i question a little disappointed that my theory should seem so evident see it and he drop into he chair again a man would be blind not to see it but all the same lester i give you credit for put the fact together so many of we -- grady for instance -- be not able to do that or to see which fact be essential and which be negligible now the fact that vantine have accidentally come into possession of a boule cabinet would probably seem negligible to grady whereas it be the one big essential fact in this whole case and it be you who see it you see it too i point out as soon as i mention it yes but you mention it in a way which make its importance manifest i could not help see it and i believe that we have both arrive at practically the same conclusion here they be and he check they off on he finger the cabinet contain a secret drawer this be inevitable if it really belong to madame de montespan any cabinet make for she would be certain to have a secret drawer -- she would require it just as she would require lace on she underwear or jewelled button on she glove that drawer since it be perhaps to contain such priceless document as the love letter of a king -- even more so if the love letter be from another man -- must be adequately guard and therefore a mechanism be devise to stab the person attempt to open it and to inject into the wound a poison so powerful as to cause instant death be i right so far wonderfully right i nod i have not put it so clearly even to myself go ahead we come to the conclusion then continue godfrey that the business of this unknown frenchman with vantine in some way concern this cabinet vantine himself think so i break in he tell I afterwards that it be because he think so he consent to see he good that would seem to indicate that we be on the right track the frenchman 's business then have something to do with this cabinet and with this secret drawer leave to himself he discover the cabinet in the room adjoining the ante-room attempt to open the drawer and be kill yes i agree and now how about vantine vantine 's death be not so simply explain presumably the unknown woman also call on business relate to the cabinet she also want to open the secret drawer in order to secure its contents -- that seem fairly certain from she connection with the first caller you still think it be she photograph he carry in he watch i be sure of it but how do it happen that it be vantine who be kill do the woman warn by the fate of the man deliberately set vantine to open the drawer in order that she might run no risk or be she also ignorant of the mechanism above all do she succeed in get away with the contents of the drawer what _ be _ the contents of the drawer i demand ah if we only know perhaps the woman have nothing to do with it vantine himself tell I that he be go to make a careful examination of the cabinet no doubt that be exactly what he be do when the woman 's arrival interrupt he he might have let she out of the house himself and then return to the cabinet stumble upon the secret drawer after she have go yes that be quite possible too at any rate you agree with I that both man be kill in some such way as i have describe absolutely i think there can be no doubt of it there be objection -- and rather weighty one the theory explain the two death it explain the similarity of the wound it explain how both should be on the right hand just above the knuckle it explain why both body be find in the same place since both man start to summon help but in the first place if the frenchman get the drawer open who close it perhaps it close itself when he let go of it and close again after vantine open it yes it would take a very clever mechanism to do that but at least it be possible oh yes it be possible and we must remember that the poisoner of those day be very ingenious that be the heydey of la voisin and the marquise de brinvillier of elixus and heaven know how many other expert who have follow catherine de medicus to france so that be all quite possible but there be one thing that be not possible and that be that a poison which if it be administer as we think it be must be a liquid could remain in that cabinet fresh and ready for use for more than three hundred year it would have dry up century ago nor would the mechanism stay in order so long it must be both complicated and delicate therefore it would have to be oil and overhaul from time to time if it be work by a spring -- and i do not see how else it can be work -- the spring would have to be renew and wind up well i ask as he pause well it be evident that the drawer contain something more recent than the love letter of loui fourteenth it must have be put in work order quite recently but by whom and for what purpose that be the mystery we have to solve -- and it be a mighty pretty one and here 's another objection he add that frenchman know about the secret drawer because accord to we theory he open it and get kill why do not he also know about the poison that be a objection truly and the more i thought of it the more serious it seem it may be say godfrey at last that d'aurelle be go it alone -- that he have break with the gang -- the gang of course there be a gang this thing have take careful planning and concerted effort and the leader of the gang be a genius i wonder if you understand how great a genius think : he know the secret of the drawer of madame de montespan 's cabinet but above all he know the secret of the poison -- the poison of the medicus do you know what that mean lester what _ do _ it mean i ask for godfrey be get ahead of I it mean he be a great criminal -- a really great criminal -- one of the elect from whom crime have no secret observe he alone know the secret of the poison one of he man break away from he and pay for he mutiny with he life he be the brain the other be merely the instrument then you do not believe it be by accident that cabinet be send to vantine by accident not for a instant it be part of a plot -- and a splendid plot can you explain that to I too i query a little ironically for i confess it seem to I that godfrey be permit he imagination to run away with he he smile good-naturedly at my tone of course this be all mere romance he admit i be the first to acknowledge that i be merely follow out we theory to what seem its logical conclusion but perhaps we be on the wrong track altogether perhaps d'aurelle or whatever he name be just blunder in like a moth into a candle-flame as for the plot -- well i can only guess at it but suppose you and i have pull off some big robbery -- he stop suddenly and he face go white and then red what be it godfrey i cry for he look frighten I he lay back in he chair he hand press over he eye i could see how they be tremble -- how he whole body be tremble wait he say hoarsely wait then he sit upright he face tense with anxiety lester he cry he voice shrill with fear the cabinet -- it be not guard yes it be i say at least i thought of that and i tell he of the precaution i have take to keep it safe he hear I out with a sigh of relief that be better he say park would not stand much show i be afraid if worst come to worst but i think the cabinet be safe -- for to-night and before another night lester we will have a look for ourselves a look yes for the secret drawer i stare at he fascinate shrink and we shall find it he add d'aurelle and vantine find it i muttered thickly well and they be both dead it will not kill we we will go about it armored lester that poison fang may strike -- do not i cry and cower back into my chair i -- i can not do it godfrey god know i be no coward -- but not that you shall watch I do it he say that would be even worse but i 'll be ready lester there will be no danger come man why it be the chance of a lifetime -- to rifle the secret drawer of madame de montespan yes he add he eye glowing and to match ourselves against the greatest criminal of modern time he shrill laugh tell how excited he be and do you know what we shall find in that drawer lester but no -- it be only a guess -- the wildest sort of a guess -- but if it be right -- if it be right he spring from he chair bite he lip he whole frame quiver but he be calmer in a moment anyway you will help I lester you will come there be a wizardry in he manner not to be resist besides -- to rifle the secret drawer of madame de montespan to match oneself against the greatest criminal of modern time what a adventure yes i answer with a quick intaking of the breath i 'll come he clap I on the shoulder he face beam i know you would to-morrow night then -- i 'll call for you here at seven o'clock we 'll have dinner together -- and then hey for the great secret agreed agree i say he catch up coat and hat and start for the door there be thing to do he say that armor to prepare -- the plan of campaign to consider you know good-night then till -- this evening the door close behind he and he footstep die away down the hall i look at my watch -- it be nearly two o'clock dizzily i go to bed but my sleep be break by a fearful dream -- a dream of a serpent with blaze eye and drip fang poise to strike chapter x preparation my first thought when i awake next morning be for park for godfrey 's manner have impressed I with the feeling that park be in much more serious danger than either he or i suspect it be with a lively sense of relief therefore that i hear park 's voice answer my call on the ` phone this be mr lester i say be everything all right everything serene sir he answer it would take a mighty smooth burglar to get in here now sir how be that i ask reporter be camp all around the house sir they seem to think somebody else will be kill here to-day he laugh as he speak the word but i be far from think the idea a amusing one i hope not i say quickly and do not let any of the reporter in nor talk to they tell they they must go to the police for they information if they get too annoying let I know and i 'll have a officer send around very good sir and park yes sir do not let anybody in the house -- no matter what he want -- unless mr grady or mr simmond or mr goldberger accompany he do not let anybody in you do not know if there be any trouble call I up i want you to be careful about this i understand sir how be roger i ask much better sir he want to get up but i tell he he might as well stay in bed and i would look after thing i think that be the best place for he sir it be i agree keep he there as long as you can i 'll come in during the day if possible in any event mr godfrey and i will be there this evening call I at the office if you need I for anything very good sir say park again and i hang up i glance through godfrey 's account of the affair while i eat my breakfast and note with amusement the sly dig take at commissioner grady under the photograph of the unknown woman be the legend : mr vantine 's mysterious caller -lrb- grady please notice -rrb- and it be intimate that when grady want any real information about a especially puzzling case he have to go to the _ record _ to get it this however be merely by the way for the story of the double tragedy fully illustrate be fling across many column and be plainly consider the great news feature of the day i glance at two or three other papers on my way down-town all of they feature the tragedy with a riot of picture -- picture of d'aurelle and vantine of grady -lrb- very large -rrb- of simmond of goldberger of freylinghuisen of the vantine house diagram of the ante-room show the position in which the body be find anatomical chart show the exact nature of the wound picture of the note poisoner of history with a highly-coloured list of they achievement -- but when it come to the story of the tragedy itself they account be far less detailed and intimate than that in the _ record _ they be indeed for the most part mere farrago of theory guess blood-curdling suggestion and mysterious hint of important information confide to the reporter but withhold from the public until the criminal have be run to earth that this would soon be accomplish not a single paper doubt for have not grady the mighty grady take personal charge of the case -lrb- here follow a glowing history of grady 's career -rrb- it be evident enough that all these reporter have be compel to go to grady for they information and i could fancy they damn he between they tooth as they pen these panegyric i could also fancy they city editor damn as they compare these incoherent imagining with the admirable and closely-written story in the _ record _ and i suspect that it be the realisation of the _ record 's _ triumph which have cause the descent of the phalanx of reporter upon the vantine place i go over the whole affair with mr royce as soon as he reach the office and spend the rest of the day arrange the papers relate to vantine 's affair and get they ready to probate park call I up once or twice for instruction as to various detail and vantine 's nearest relative a third or fourth cousin wire from somewhere in the west that he be start for new york at once and then toward the middle of the afternoon come the cablegram from pari which i have almost forget to expect : royce & lester new york regret mistake in shipment exceedingly we representative will call to explain armand et fils so there be a end of the romance godfrey have weave and which i have be almost ready to believe -- the romance of design of a carefully lay plot and all that it have be merely accident after all and i smile a little sarcastically at myself for my credulity no doubt my own romance of a secret drawer and a poison mechanism would prove equally fabulous in my over-wrought state of the night before it have seem reasonable enough but here in the cold light of day it seem preposterous how grady and goldberger would have laugh at it i put the whole thing impatiently away from I and turn to other work but i find i could not conquer a certain deep-seated nervousness so at last i lock my desk tell the boy i would not be back and take a cab for a long drive through the park the fresh air the smell of the tree the sight of the child play along the path do I good and i be able to greet godfrey with a smile when he call for I at seven o'clock i have engage a table at a little place around the corner he say it be manage by a friend of mine and i think you 'll like it i do indeed the dinner be so good that it demand undivided attention and not until the coffee be on the table and the cigar light do we speak of the business which have bring we together anything new i ask as we push back we chair no nothing of any importance the man at the morgue have not be identify in the first place the pari police have never take he bertillon measurement then he be not a criminal he have never be arrest godfrey qualify more peculiar be the fact that he have not be recognize here two million people probably see he photograph in the papers this morning some of they think they know he and go around to the morgue to see he body but nothing come of it the police have no report of any such man miss that _ be _ peculiar be not it i comment it be very peculiar it mean one of two thing -- either the fellow 's friend be keep dark purposely or he do not have any friend here in new york at least but even then one would think that whoever rent he a room would wonder what have become of he and would make some inquiry perhaps he have not rent a room i suggest perhaps he have just reach new york and go direct to vantine 's godfrey 's face light up from the steamer of course i ought to have guess as much from the cut of he hair he have not be out of france more than ten day or so excuse I a moment he hurry away and five minute pass before he come back i ` phone the office to send some man around to the boat which come in yesterday if he be a passenger some one of the steward will recognize he photograph there be three boat he might have come on -- the _ adriatic _ and _ cecelie _ from cherbourg and _ la touraine _ from havre there be nothing else that i know of he add thoughtfully except that freylinghuisen think he have discover the nature of the poison he say it be some very powerful variant of prussic acid yes i say i hear he say something of the sort last night i have a talk with he this afternoon about it and he be quite learn godfrey go on this be a great chance for he to get before the public and he be make the most of it i gather from what he say that ordinary prussic acid which be deadly enough heaven know contain only two per cent of the poison while the strongest solution yet obtain contain only four per cent freylinghuisen say that whoever concoct this particular poison have evidently discover a new way of do it -- or rediscover a old way -- so that it be at least fifty per cent effective in other word if you can get a fraction of a drop of it in a man 's blood you kill he by paralysis quicker than if you put a bullet through he heart nothing can save a man then i question nothing on earth oh i do not say that if somebody have a axe handy and chop you arm off at the shoulder a instant after you be strike on the hand you might not have a chance to live but it would take mighty quick work and even then it would be nip and tuck freylinghuisen think it be a new discovery i do not i think some one have dig up one of the old medicus formula maybe it be place in the secret drawer so that there would never be any lack of ammunition for the mechanism godfrey i say be you still bent on fool with that thing more than ever i be go to find that secret drawer and if the fang strike -- well i be ready for they see here what i have make today he draw from he pocket something that look like a steel gauntlet such as one see on suit of old armor he slip it over he right hand you see it cover the back of the hand completely he say half way down the first joint of the finger it be make of the toughest steel and would turn a bullet and do you see how it be depress in the middle lester yes i say i be wonder why you have it make in that shape i want to get a sample of that poison my theory be that when the fang strike the hand the shock drive out a drop or two of the poison i do not want those drop to get away i want they to roll into this depression and i shall very carefully bottle they think what they be lester -- the poison of the medicus i sit for a moment look at he half in amusement half in sorrow it seem a pity that he theory must come tumble down it be so picturesque and he be so interested and enthusiastic over it and it would make such a good story he catch my glance and put the gauntlet back into he pocket well what be it he ask quietly for answer i get out the cablegram and pass it across to he he read it with brow contract that seem to put a puncture in we little romance do not it i ask at last he nod thoughtfully yes it do and he read the message again word by word armand 's man have not call yet no i do not get the message till about three o'clock i suppose he 'll be around to-morrow you will have to turn the cabinet over to he of course why yes it belong to he at least it do not belong to vantine he slip the message into its envelope and hand it back to I i could see that he be perplexed and upset well in spite of this he say finally i be still interested in that cabinet lester and i wish you would keep possession of it as long as you can at least i would not give it up until he deliver to you the other cabinet which vantine really buy oh i 'll make he do that i agree quickly that will no doubt take a few day -- longer than that if vantine 's cabinet be in paris godfrey raise a finger to the waiter ask for the check and pay it and now let we go down and have a look at this one he say as we intend do you will think I foolish lester but even that cablegram have not shake my belief in the existence of that secret drawer and all the rest i ask yes he answer slowly and all the rest he say nothing more until we stop before the vantine house but i could see from he puckered brow how desperately he be try to untangle this quirk in the mystery the siege seem to have be lift i remark as we alight the siege park telephone I that you esteemed contemporary have the place surround i tell he to hold the fort poor boy he comment smile to think that all they know be what grady be able to tell they then he stop before the house and make a careful survey of it which room be the cabinet in he ask the ante-room be there at the leave where those two shutter window be the cabinet be in the corner room -- there be one window on this side and two on the other wait till i take a look at they he say and vault the low railing he walk quickly along the front of the house and around the corner he be go only a minute they be all right he say in a tone of relief of course they be all right you do not suppose -- if that cabinet contain what i think it do lester -- yes he add a little savagely as he see my look and what i still think it do -- it would not be safe in the strongest vault of the national city bank and he motion for I to ring the bell i do so in silence park answer it almost instantly and i could tell from the way he face change how glad he be to see I well park i say as we step inside everything be all right i hope yes sir he answer but -- but it get on the nerve a little sir i hear a movement behind I as i give park my coat and turn to see roger sit on the cot hello i say so you be able to be up be you yes sir he answer without look at I i think i would come down and keep park company park smile a little sheepishly i ask he to mr lester he say i get so lonesome and jumpy here by myself that i just have to have somebody to talk to especially after the burglar-alarm ring the burglar-alarm repeat godfrey quickly what do you mean we have get a burglar-alarm on the window sir it be usually turn off in the day-time but i think i would better leave it on to-day and it ring about the middle of the afternoon i think at first that one of the other servant have raise a window but none of they have something go wrong with it i guess do you take a look at the window i ask yes sir a policeman come to see what be the matter and we go around and examine the window but they be all lock it make I feel kind of scary for a while do the alarm work now no sir the policeman say there must be a short circuit somewhere and that he would notify the people who put it in but nobody have come around yet to fix it we would better take a look at the window ourselves say godfrey you stay here park we can find they all right and i do not want you to leave that door unguarded for a single instant we go from window to window and godfrey examine each of they with a minuteness that astonish I for i have no idea what he expect to find but we complete the circuit of the ground floor without he apparently discover anything out of the way let 's take a look at the basement he say and lead the way downstair with a readiness which tell I that he have be over the house before in the kitchen we come upon the cook and housemaid sit close together and talk in frightened whisper they watch we apprehensively and i stop to reassure they while godfrey proceed with he search then i hear he call I i find he in a kind of lumber-room standing before its single small window he electric torch in he hand look there he say he voice quiver with excitement and throw a circle of light on the jamb of the window at the spot where the upper and lower sash meet what be it i ask after a moment i do not see anything wrong you do not you do not see that this house be to be enter to-night then what do this mean with he finger-nail he turn up the end of a small insulate wire and then i see that the wire have be cut chapter xi the burning eye for a instant i do not grasp the full significance of that sever wire then i understand yes say godfrey drily that romance of mine be look up again somebody be prepare for a quiet invasion of the house to-night -- somebody of course interested in that cabinet he be not lose any time i venture he know he have not any to lose when you put those wooden shutter up you warn he that you suspect he game he know if the alarm be on it would ring when he cut the wire but he also know that the chance be a hundred to one against the cut be discover or the alarm put in work order before to-morrow why can not we ambush he i suggest we might try but it will be a mighty risky undertaking lester one risky undertaking be enough for to-night i say with a sigh for my belief in the existence of the secret drawer and the poison and all the rest of it have come back with a rush i feel almost apologetic toward godfrey for ever doubt he we would better wait and see if we survive the first one before we arrange for any more all right godfrey laugh but i 'll fix this break he get out he pen-knife loosen two or three of the staple which hold the wire in place draw it out scrape back the insulation and twist the end tightly together there he add that be do if the invader tamper with the window again he will set off the alarm but i do not believe he 'll touch it i fancy he already know he little game be discover how would he know it i demand incredulously if he be keep a eye on this window as he naturally would do he have see my light perhaps he be watch we now i glance at the dark square of the window with a little shiver this business be get on my nerve again but godfrey turn away with a shrug of the shoulder now for the cabinet he say and lead the way back upstairs roger be still sit dejectedly on the cot and look at he more closely i could see that he be white and shake he trouble whatever its nature plainly lay heavy on he mind have you anything to tell we this evening roger i ask kindly but he only shake he head i have tell you everything i know sir he answer in a low voice i be not go to worry you roger i go on but i want you to think it over you can rely upon I to help you if i can he look up quickly but catch himself and turn he eye away thank you sir be all he say and now i add briskly i 'll have to ask you to get up move the cot away from the door park park obey I with astonished face you be not go in there sir he protest as i turn the knob yes we be i say and open the door be -- be no sir break in park understand the undertaker bring the coffin and put he in it and move he over to the drawing-room this afternoon sir i be glad of that i want all the light light park just as they be last night park reach inside the door and switch on the electric then he go away come back in a moment with a taper and proceed to light the gas-light a moment later the light in the inner room be also blaze there you be sir say park and retreat to the door will you need I not now but wait in the hall outside we may need you i have a notion to tell he to have a axe handy but i see godfrey smile very good sir say park evidently relieved and go out and close the door i lead the way into the inner room well there it be i say and nod toward the boule cabinet standing in the full glare of the light every inlay and incrustation glittering like the eye of a basilisk it be not too late to give it up godfrey oh yes it be he say coolly remove he coat it be too late the moment you tell I that story why lester if i give it up i should never sleep again and if you do not you may never wake again i point out he laugh lightly what a dismal prophet you be draw up a chair and watch I he pull back he shirt-sleeve and place he electric torch on the floor beside the cabinet then he pause with fold arm to contemplate this masterpiece of m boule it _ be _ a beauty he say at last and then draw out the little drawer one after another look they over and place they carefully on a chair now he add let we see if there be any space that be not account for he take from he pocket a folding rule of ivory open it and begin a series of measurement so search and intricate that half a hour pass without a word be speak then he pull up another chair and sit down beside I i seem to be pretty much up against it he say no doubt just as the designer of the cabinet would wish I to be the whole bottom of the desk be inclose and those three little drawer take up only a small part of the space then the back of the cabinet seem to be double -- at least there be a space of three inch i can not account for so there be room for a dozen secret drawer if the montespan require so many and now to find the combination he adjust the steel gauntlet carefully to he right hand and sit down on the floor before the cabinet i 'll begin at the bottom he say if there be any spot i miss tell I of it he run he finger up and down the graceful leg carefully feel every inequality of the elaborate bronze ornamentation particularly do he finger linger on every boss and point strive to push it in or move it up or down but they be all immovable then he examine the bottom of the table minutely use he torch to illumine every crevice but again without result another half hour pass so and when at last he come out from under the table he face be drip with sweat it be try work he say sit down again and mop he face but be not it a beauty lester the more i look at it the more wonderful it seem i tell philip vantine i be not up to it and i be not i say nor i but i can appreciate it to the extent of my capacity it be the loui fourteenth ideal of beauty -- splendor carry to the nth degree look at the arabesque along the front -- can you imagine anything more graceful and the engraving -- nothing cut-and-dried about that it be do by a burin in the hand of a master -- perhaps by boule himself i do not wonder vantine be rather mad about it but we have not find that drawer yet and he draw he chair close to the cabinet i would point out one thing to you godfrey i say : if you go on poke about with the finger of both hand as you have be do you be just as apt to get strike on the left hand as on the right that be true he agree stop I if i forget there be three little drawer in the front of the table and these godfrey have remove he insert he hand into the space from which he have take they and examine it carefully then inch by inch he run he finger over the boss and arabesque with which the side and top of the table be incrust it seem to I that if the secret drawer be anywhere it must be somewhere in this part of the cabinet and i watch he with breathless interest once i think he have find the drawer for a piece of inlay at the side of the table seem to give a little under the pressure of he finger but no hidden spring be touch no drawer spring open no poison fang descend well say godfrey sit back in he chair at last and wipe he face again there be so much do if there be any secret drawer in the lower part of the cabinet it be mighty cleverly conceal now we 'll try the upper part the upper part of the cabinet consist of a series of drawer rise one above the other and terminate by a triangular pediment its tympanum ornament with some beautiful little bronze the drawer themselves be conceal by two door open in the center and cover with a most intricate design of arabesqued incrustation if there be a secret drawer here say godfrey it be somewhere in the back where there seem to be a hollow space but to discover the combination he run he finger over the inlay and then strike by a sudden thought test each of the little figure along the tympanum but they be all set solidly in place there be one thing sure he say the combination whatever it be be of such a nature that it could not be discover accidentally -- by a person lean on the cabinet for instance it be not a question of merely touch a spring it be probably a question of release a series of lever which must be work in a certain order or the drawer will not open i be afraid we be up against it i can not pretend i be sorry i say with a sigh of relief as far as i be concerned i be perfectly willing that the drawer should go undiscovered well i be not retort godfrey curtly and he sit regard the cabinet with puckered brow then he rise and begin tap at the back i do not know what it be -- for i be conscious of no noise -- but some mysterious attraction draw my eye to the window at the farther side of the room near the top of the wooden shutter which park and i have put in place be a small semi-circular opening to allow the passage of a little light perhaps and peer through this opening be two eye -- two burn eye they be fix upon godfrey with such feverish intentness that they do not see my glance and i lower my head instantly godfrey i say in a shake voice do not look up do not move you head but there be some one peer through the hole in the shutter opposite we godfrey do not answer for quite a minute but keep calmly on with he examination of the cabinet do he see you look at he he ask at last no he be look at you with he eye almost start out of he head i never see such eye do you see anything of he face no the hole be too small i fancy i see the finger of one hand which he have thrust through to steady himself how high be the hole near the top of the window godfrey come back to he chair a moment later sit down in it and pass he handkerchief slowly over he face then he lean forward apparently to examine the leg of the cabinet i see he he say or rather i see he eye rather fierce be not they they be a tiger 's eye i say with conviction well there be no use go ahead with this while he be out there even if we find the drawer we have both be dead a instant later you mean he would kill we he would shoot we instantly imagine what a sensation that would make lester park hear two pistol shot rush in and find we lie here dead grady would have a convulsion -- and we should both be famous for a few day i 'll seek fame in some other way i say drily what be you go to do about it we have get to try to capture he and if we do -- well we shall have the fame all right but it be a good deal like try to pick up a scorpion -- we be pretty sure to get hurt if that fellow out there be who i think he be he be about the most dangerous man on earth he go on tap the surface of the cabinet as for I i would have give anything for another look at those gleaming eye they seem to be burn into I hot flash be shoot up and down my back why can not i go out as though i be go after something i suggest then park and i could charge around the corner and get he you would not get he he would get you you would not have a chance on earth if there be a window upstairs over that one you might drop something out on he or borrow park 's pistol and shoot he -- that would be pretty cowardly would not it i suggest mildly my dear lester godfrey protest when you attack a poisonous snake you do not do it with bare hand do you i could not help it -- i glance again at the window he be go i cry godfrey be at the window in two step look at that he say and then tell I he be not a genius i follow the direction of he point finger and see that just opposite the opening in the shutter a little hole have be cut in the window-pane that fellow foresee everything say godfrey with enthusiasm he probably cut that hole as soon as it be dark he must have guess we be go to examine the cabinet to-night -- and he want not only to see but to hear he hear everything we say lester let 's go after he i cry and without wait for a answer i spring across the ante-room and snatch open the door which lead into the hall park and roger be sit on the couch just outside and i never see two man more thoroughly frighten for god 's sake mr lester gasp roger and stop he hand at he throat be it mr godfrey cry park there be a man outside get you pistol park yes sir and he take it from he pocket i snatch it from he open the front door leap the railing and steal along the house to the corner then take my courage in both hand i charge around it there be no one in sight but from somewhere near at hand come a burst of mock laughter chapter xii godfrey be frightened i be still stare about I that mock laughter in my ear when godfrey join I he get away of course he say coolly yes and i hear he laugh i cry godfrey look at I quickly come lester he say soothingly do not let you nerve run away with you it be not my nerve i protest a little hotly i hear it quite plainly he can not be far away too far for we to catch he godfrey retort and torch in hand proceed to examine the window-sill and the ground beneath it there be where he stand he add and the mark on the sill be evident enough of course he have he line of retreat block out and he flash he torch back and forth across the grass but the turf be so close that no trace of footstep be visible we go slowly back to the house and godfrey sit down again to a contemplation of the cabinet it be too much for I he say at last the only way i can find that drawer i be afraid be with a axe but i do not want to smash the thing to piece -- i should say not it would be like smash the venus de milo hardly so bad as that but we will not smash it yet awhile i be go to look up the subject of secret drawer -- perhaps i 'll stumble upon something that will help I and then of course i say disconsolately it be quite possible that there be not any such drawer at all but godfrey shake he head decidedly i do not agree with you there lester i 'll wager that fellow who be look in at we could find it in a minute he seem mighty frightened lest you should he have reason to be godfrey rejoin grimly i 'll have another try at it to-morrow one thing we have get to take care of and that be that we friend of the burning eye do not get a chance at it first those shutter be pretty strong i point out and park be no fool yes agree godfrey the shutter be pretty strong -- they might keep he out for ten minute -- scarcely longer than that as for park he would not last ten seconds you do not seem to understand the extraordinary character of this fellow during you period of exaltation last night i remind he you refer to he as the greatest criminal of modern time well smile godfrey perhaps that _ be _ a little exaggerated suppose we say one of the greatest -- great enough surely to walk all around we if we be not on guard i think i would better drop a word to simmond and get he to send down a couple of man to watch the house with they outside and park on the inside it ought to be fairly safe i should think so i say one would imagine you be get ready to repel a army who be this fellow anyway godfrey you seem to be half afraid of he i be wholly afraid of he if he be who i think he be -- but it be a mere guess as yet lester wait a day or two i 'll call up simmond he go to the ` phone while i sit down again and look at the cabinet in a kind of stupefaction what be the intrigue of which it seem to be the center who be this man that godfrey should consider he so formidable why should he have choose philip vantine for a victim godfrey come back while i be still grope blindly amid this maze of mystery it be all right he say simmond be send two of he best man to watch the house he stand for a moment gaze down at the cabinet i be come back to-morrow to have another try at it he add i have leave the gauntlet there on the chair so if you feel like have a try yourself lester heaven forbid i protest but perhaps i would better tell park to let you in i hope i will not find you a corpse here godfrey so do i but i do not believe you will yes tell park to let I in whenever i come around and now about roger what about he i rather think i might want to grill he to-night but perhaps i would better wait till i get a little more to go on he pause for a moment 's thought yes i 'll wait he say finally i do not want to run any risk of fail we go out into the hall together and i tell park to admit godfrey whenever he wish to enter roger be still sit on the cot look so crushed and sorrowful that i could not help pity he i begin to think that if he be leave to himself a day or two longer he would tell all we wish to know without any grilling i confide this idea to godfrey as we go down the front step perhaps you be right he agree i do not believe the fellow be really crooked something have happen to he -- something in connection with that woman -- and he have never get over it well we shall have to find out what it be hello here be simmond 's man he add as two policeman stop before the house be this mr godfrey one of they ask yes say godfrey mr simmond tell we to report to you sir if you be here what we want you to do say godfrey be to watch the house -- watch it from all side -- patrol clear around it and see that no one approach it very well sir and the man touch they helmet and one of they go around to the back of the house while the other remain in front perhaps if they conceal themselves i suggest the fellow might venture back and be nab but godfrey shake he head i do not want he to venture back he say i want to scare he off i want he to see we be thoroughly on guard he hail a pass cab and pause with one foot on the step i have already tell you lester he add over he shoulder that i be afraid of he perhaps you think i be joke but i be not i be never more serious in my life the _ record _ office he add to the cabby and jingle away leave I stare after he as i turn homeward i could not but ponder over this remarkable and mysterious be with whom godfrey be so impressed never before have i know he to hesitate to match himself with any adversary but now it seem to I he shun the contest or at least fear it -- fear that he might be outwit and outplay how great a compliment that be to the mysterious unknown only i could guess and then i shiver a little as i recall that mock and ironic laughter and i quicken my step with a glance over my shoulder for if godfrey be afraid how much more reason have i to be it be with a sense of relief of which i be a little ashamed that i reach my apartment at the marathon and lock the door just before i turn in for the night i hear from godfrey again for my telephone ring and it be he voice that answer i just want to tell you lester he say that you guess be right the mysterious frenchman come over on _ la touraine _ landing at noon yesterday he come in the steerage and the steward know nothing about he what time be it he get to vantine 's about two i should say so he probably go directly there from the boat as you think that account for nobody know he the steamship company be hold a bag belong to he i 'll get they to open it to-morrow and perhaps we shall find out who he be but godfrey i break in how about this other fellow -- the man with the burning eye he be get on my nerve do not let he do that lester he laugh we be in no danger so long as we be not around that cabinet that be the storm center i can not tell you more than that good-night and he hang up without wait for I to answer chapter xiii a distinguished caller it be shortly after i reach the office next morning that the office-boy come in and hand I a card with a awed and reverent air so at variance with he usual demeanor that i glance at the square of pasteboard in some astonishment then i confess a awed and reverent feeling creep over I also for the card bear the name of sereno hornblower that name be quite unknown outside the legal profession of the three great city of the east new york boston and philadelphium for sereno hornblower have never hold a public office have never make a public speech have never respond to a toast have never serve on a public committee have never so far as i know conduct a case in court or address a jury -- have never in a word figure in the newspaper in any way and yet he income would make that of any other lawyer in the country look like thirty cent for sereno hornblower be the confidential attorney of most of we best family he have hold that position for year and it be say that no case place unreservedly in he hand ever result in a public scandal he accept client with great care he have steadfastly refuse the business of pittsburgh millionaire remunerative as it be certain to be but he seem to take a sort of personal pride in keep intact the reputation of the old family even when they scion embark in the most outrageous escapade if you be descend from the pilgrim or the patroon mr hornblower will ask no further recommendation he reputation for tact and delicacy be tremendous and yet those who have find themselves oppose to he have never be long in realize that there be a most redoubtable mail fist under the velvet glove altogether a remarkable man whose memoirs would make absorb reading could he be persuade to write they -- which be quite beyond the bound of possibility i have never meet he either professionally or personally and it be with some eagerness that i tell the office-boy to show he in at once sereno hornblower do not look the part he reputation lead one to expect a sort of cross between uriah heep and sherlock holme but there be nothing secretive or insinuate about he appearance he be a bluff and hearty man of middle age rather heavy-set fresh-faced and clean-shaven and with very bright blue eye -- evidently a man with a good digestion and a comfortable conscience have i meet he on broadway i should have take he for a ripe and finish comedian there be about he a air which somehow remind I of joseph jefferson -- perhaps it be he bright blue eye it may have be this very appearance of bluff sincerity and honest downrightness which account for he success we shake hand and he sit down and plunge at once without a instant 's hesitation into the business which have bring he look back at it understand as i do now the delicate nature of that business i admire more and more that bluff readiness though the more i think of it the more i be convince that he have think out definitely beforehand precisely what he be go to say the man who can carry through a carefully premeditated scene with a air of complete unpremeditation have a immense advantage mr lester he begin i understand that you be the administrator of the estate of the late philip vantine we firm be i correct but you personally have be attend to he business yes he be a collector of old furniture i believe yes and on he last trip to europe from which he return only a few day ago he purchase of armand & son of paris a boule cabinet i could not repress a start of astonishment be you act for armand & son i query not at all i be act for a lady whom for the present we will call madame x the thought flash through my mind that madame x and the mysterious frenchwoman might be one and the same person then i put aside the idea as absurd sereno hornblower would never accept such a client mr vantine do buy such a cabinet i say and it be in you possession there be at he residence a boule cabinet which be ship he from pari but only a few hour before he death mr vantine assure I that it be not the one he have purchase you mean that a mistake have be make in the shipment that be what we suppose and a cablegram from armand & son have since confirm it mr hornblower ponder this for a moment where be the cabinet which mr vantine do buy he ask at last i have no idea perhaps it be still in pari but i be expect a representative of the armand to call very soon to straighten thing out again my companion fall silent and sit rub he chin absently it be very strange he say finally if the cabinet be still at paris one would think it would have be discover before my client make inquiry about it there be a good many thing which be strange about this whole matter i supplement would you have any objection to my client see this cabinet mr lester it be my turn to hesitate mr hornblower i say finally i will be frank with you there be a certain mystery surround this cabinet which we have not be able to solve i suppose you have read of the mysterious death of mr vantine and of a unknown frenchman both in the same room at the vantine house and both apparently from the same cause he nod do you mean that this cabinet be connect with they in any way he ask quickly we believe so though as yet we have be able to prove absolutely nothing but we be guard the cabinet very closely i should not object to you client see it but i could not permit she to touch it -- not at least without know why she wish to do so you will remember that you have tell I nothing of why she be interested in it i be quite ready to tell you the story mr lester he say it be only fair that i should do so after you have hear it if you agree we will take madame x to see the cabinet very well i assent he settle back in he chair and he face become more grave my client he begin be a member of a prominent american family -- a most prominent family three year ago she marry a french nobleman you can perhaps guess she name but i should prefer that neither of we utter it i nod my agreement this nobleman have be both prodigal and unfaithful he have scatter my client 's fortune with both hand he have flaunt he mistress in she face he have even try to compel she to receive one of they i be free to confess that i consider she a fool not to have leave he long ago at last she trustee interfere for she father have be wise enough to place a portion of she fortune in trust they pay she husband 's debt place he on a allowance and notify he creditor that he debt would not be pay again i have by this time of course guess the name of he client since these detail have long be a matter of public notoriety and i need hardly say listen to the story with a heighten interest the allowance be a princely one mr hornblower continue but it do not suffice monsieur x no allowance would suffice he -- the more money he have the more way he would find of spend it so he have become a thief he have take to sell the object of art with which he residence be fill and which be really the property of my client since they be purchase with she money about two week ago my client return to pari from a stay at she château in normandy to find that he have almost denude the town house tapestry picture sculpture -- everything have be sell among other thing which he have take be a boule cabinet which have be use by my client as she private writing-desk the cabinet be a most valuable one but it be not its monetary value which make my client so anxious to recover it he pause a instant and clear he throat and i realize that he be come to the really delicate part of the story monsieur x have have the decency he go on more slowly to as he think retain he wife 's private papers he have cause the contents of the various drawer to be dump out upon a chair but there be one drawer of which he know nothing -- a secret drawer know only to my client that drawer contain a packet of letter which my client be most anxious to regain of they nature i will say nothing -- indeed i know very little about they for after all that be none of my business but she have give I to understand that they recovery be essential to she peace of mind i nod again there be really no need that he should say more only i reflect a faithless husband have no reason to complain if he wife repay he in the same coin my client go to work at once to regain the cabinet continue mr hornblower plainly relieve that the thinnest ice have be cross she find that it have be sell to armand & son hastening to they office she learn that it have be resell by they to mr vantine and send forward to he here so she come over on the first boat ostensibly to visit she family but really to ask mr vantine 's permission to open the drawer and take out the letter he death interfere with this and in despair she come to I i need hardly add that no member of she family know anything about this matter and it be especially important that she husband should never even suspect it on she behalf i apply to you as mr vantine 's executor to restore these letter to they owner i sit for a moment turn this extraordinary story over in my mind and try to make it fit in with the occurrence of the past two day but it would not fit -- at least it would not fit with my theory as to the cause of those occurrence for surely madame x would scarcely guard the secret of that drawer with poison do any one besides you client know of the existence of these letter i ask at last i think not answer mr hornblower smile drily they be not of a nature which my client would care to communicate to any one in fact mr lester as you have doubtless suspect they be compromise letter we must get they back at any cost as a matter of fact i point out there be always at least two people who know of the existence of every letter -- the person who write it and the person who receive it i have think of that but the person who write these letter be dead dead i repeat he be kill in a duel some month ago explain mr hornblower gravely by monsieur x i ask quickly by monsieur x say mr hornblower and sit regard I he lip purse as a indication perhaps that he would say no more but there be no necessity that he should i know enough of french law and of french habit of think to realize that if those letter ever come into possession of monsieur x the game would be entirely in he hand he wife would be absolutely at he mercy and the thought flash through my mind that perhaps in some way he have learn of the existence of the letter and be try desperately to get they that thought be enough to swing the balance in he wife 's favor i be sure i say that mr vantine would instantly have consent to you client open the drawer and take out the letter and as he executor i also consent for whoever may own the cabinet the letter be the property of madame x all this provide of course that this should prove to be the right cabinet but i must warn you mr hornblower that i believe two man have already be kill try to open that drawer and i tell he while he sit there stare in profound amazement of my theory in regard to the death of philip vantine and of the unknown frenchman i be incline to think i conclude that vantine blunder upon the drawer while examine the cabinet but there be no doubt that the other man know of the drawer and also presumably of its contents well exclaim my companion i have listen to many astonishing story in my life but never one to equal this and you know nothing of this frenchman nothing except that he come from havre on _ la touraine _ last Thursday and drive from the dock direct to vantine 's house my client also come on _ la touraine _ -- but that no doubt be a mere coincidence that may be i agree but it be scarcely a coincidence that both he and you client be after the contents of that drawer you mean i mean that the mysterious frenchman may very possibly have be a emissary of monsieur x madame may have betray the secret to he in a unguarded moment mr hornblower rise abruptly he be evidently much disturbed you may be right he agree i will communicate with my client at once i take it that she have you permission to see the cabinet and if it prove to be the right one that she may open the drawer and remove the letter if she care to take the risk i assent very well i will call you as soon as i have see she he say in any event i thank you for you courtesy and he leave the office he must have drive straight to she family residence on the avenue or perhaps she be await he at he office at any rate he call I up inside the half hour my client would like to see the cabinet at once he say she be in a very nervous condition especially since she learn that some one else have try to open the drawer when will it be convenient for you to go with we i can go at once i say then we will drive around for you we should be there in fifteen or twenty minute very well i say i 'll be ready i shall of course want to take a witness with I that be quite proper assent mr hornblower we can have no objection to that in twenty minute then i get the _ record _ office as soon as i could but godfrey be not there he do not come on usually some one say until the middle of the afternoon i ring he room but there be no reply finally i call up the vantine house park i say i be bring up some people to look at that cabinet it might be just as well to get that cot out of the way and have all the light go the light be already go sir he say already go what do you mean mr godfrey have be here for quite a while sir fool with that cabinet thing he have and then i reflect that i ought to have guess he whereabouts tell he park that i be bring some people up to see the cabinet and that i should like he to stay there and be a witness of the proceedings very well sir assent park everything quiet oh yes sir there be two policeman outside all night and roger and I inside mr hornblower 's carriage be below sir announce the office-boy open the door all right i say we be come right up park good-bye and i hang up and slip into my coat then as i take down my hat a sudden thought strike I if the unknown frenchman be indeed a emissary of monsieur x madame might be acquaint with he it be a long shot but worth try i step to my desk take out the photograph which godfrey have give I and slip it into my pocket then i hurry out to the elevator chapter xiv the veil lady there be three person in the carriage mr hornblower sit with he back to the horse and two woman be on the opposite seat both be dress in black and heavily veil but there be about they the indefinable distinction of mistress and maid it would be difficult to tell precisely in what the distinction consist but it be there mr hornblower glance behind I as i enter you speak of a witness he say he be at the vantine house i explain and sit down beside he this be mr lester he say and the veil lady opposite he whom i have know at once to be the mistress incline she head a little those be the only word speak the carriage roll out to broadway and then turn northward make such progress as be possible along that crowded thoroughfare i glance from time to time at the woman opposite and be strike by the contrast in they behavior one sit quite still she hand in she lap she head bent admirably self-contained the other be restless and uneasy unable to control a nervous twitch of the finger i wonder why the maid should seem more upset than she mistress and decide finally that she uneasiness be merely lack of breed but the contrast interested I at tenth street the carriage turn westward again skirt washington square turn into the avenue and stop before the vantine house mr hornblower assist the woman to alight and i lead the way up the step but as we reach the top and come upon the funeral wreath on the door the veil lady stop with a little exclamation i do not know she say quickly perhaps after all we would better wait i do not realize there be no relative to be hurt madame i interrupt as for the dead man what can it matter to he and i ring the bell park open the door and nod to he i lead the way along the hall and into the ante-room godfrey be await we there and i see the flame of interest which leap into he eye as mr hornblower and the two veil woman enter this be my witness i say to the former mr godfrey -- mr hornblower godfrey bow and hornblower regard he with a good-humoured smile if i be not sure of mr godfrey 's discretion he say i should object but i have test it before this and know that it can be rely upon there be only one person to whom i yield precedence in the matter of discretion rejoin godfrey smile back at he and that be mr hornblower he be in a class quite by himself thank you say the lawyer and bow gravely during this interchange of compliment the woman i have decide be the maid have sit down as though she leg be unable to sustain she and be nervously clasp and unclasp she hand even she mistress show sign of impatience the cabinet be in here i say and lead the way into the inner room the two man and the veil lady at my heel it stand in the middle of the floor just as it have stand since the night of the tragedy and all the light be go as i enter i notice godfrey 's gauntlet lie on a chair be it the right one madame i ask she gaze at it a moment she hand press against she breast yes she answer with a gasp that be almost a sob i confess i be astonished i have never think it could be the right one even now i do not see how it could possibly be the right one you be sure i query incredulously do you think i could be mistake in such a matter sir i assure you that this cabinet at one time belong to I you permit I she add and take a step toward it one moment madame i interpose i must warn you that in touch that cabinet you be run a great risk a great risk she echo look at I a very great risk as i have point out to mr hornblower i have reason to believe that two man meet death while try to open that secret drawer i believe mr hornblower do tell I something of the sort she murmur but of course that be all a mistake then the drawer be not guard by poison i question by poison she repeat blankly and carry she handkerchief to she lip i do not understand i know that my theory be collapse utterly hopelessly i dare not look at godfrey be there not connect with the drawer i ask a mechanism which as the drawer be open plunge two poison fang into the hand which open it no mr lester she answer astonishment in she voice i assure you there be no such mechanism i clutch at a last straw and a sorry one it be the mechanism may have be place there since the cabinet pass from you possession i suggest that be perhaps possible she agree though i see that she be unconvinced at any rate madame i say i would ask that in open the drawer you wear this gauntlet and i pick up godfrey 's gauntlet from the chair on which it lay it be needless that you should take any risk however slight permit I and i slip the gauntlet over she right hand as i do so i glance at godfrey he be stare at the veil lady with such a look of stupefaction that i nearly choke with delight it have not often be my luck to see jim godfrey mystified but he be certainly mystify now the veil lady regard the steel glove with a little laugh i be now free to open the drawer she ask yes madame she move toward the cabinet godfrey and i close behind she at last the secret which have defy we be to be reveal and with its revelation would come the end of the picturesque and romantic theory we have be build up so laboriously instinctively i glance toward the shutter window but the semi-circle of light be unobscured the veil lady bent above the table and dispose the finger of she right hand to fit the metal inlay midway of the left side it be a little awkward she say i have always be accustom to use the left hand you will notice that i be press on three point but to open the drawer one must press these point in a certain order -- first this one then this one and then this one there be a sharp click and at the side of the table a piece of the metal inlay fall forward that be the handle say the veil lady and without a instant 's hesitation while my heart stand still she grasp it and draw out a shallow drawer ah and casting aside the ridiculous gauntlet she catch up the packet of papers which lay within then with a effort she control herself slip off the ribbon which hold the packet together and spread out before my eye ten or twelve envelope you will see that they be only letter mr lester she say in a low voice and i assure you that they belong to I i believe you madame i say and with a sigh of relief that be almost a sob she rebind the packet and slip it into the bosom of she gown there be one thing i add which madame can perhaps do for I i shall be most happy she breathe as i have tell mr hornblower i continue two man die in this room the day before yesterday or rather it be in the room beyond that they die but we believe it be here they receive the wound which cause death it seem that we be wrong in this undoubtedly she agree there have never be any such weird mechanism as you describe connect with that drawer mr lester at least not since i have have it there be a legend you know that the cabinet be make for madame de montespan she be talk more freely now evidently a great load have be lift from she -- perhaps i do not guess how great mr vantine suspect as much i say he be a connoisseur of furniture and there be something about this cabinet which tell he it have belong to the montespan he be examine it at the time he die what the other man be do we do not know but if we could identify he it might help we you have not identify he we know nothing whatever about he except that he be presumably a frenchman and that he arrive on _ la touraine _ two day ago that be the boat upon which i come over it have occur to I madame that you may have see he -- that he may even be know to you what be he name the card he send in to mr vantine bear the name of théophile d'aurelle she shake she head i have never before hear that name mr lester we believe it to have be a assumed name i say but perhaps you will recognize this photograph and i draw it from my pocket and hand it to she she take it look at it and again shake she head then she look at it again turn aside and raise she veil in order to see it better there seem to be something familiar about the face she say at last as though i might have see the man somewhere on the boat perhaps i suggest but i know very well it be not on the boat since the man have cross in the steerage no it be not on the boat i do not leave my stateroom on the boat but i be quite sure that i have see he -- and yet i can not say where perhaps i say in a low voice he may have be one of the friend of you husband i see she hand tremble under the blow but it have to be strike and she be brave the same thought occur to I mr lester she answer but i know very few of my husband 's friend certainly not this one and yet perhaps my maid can help we photograph in hand she step through the doorway into the outer room the maid be sit on the chair where we have leave she she hand clench tightly together in she lap as though it be only by some violent effort she could maintain she self-control julie say the veil lady in rapid french i have here the photograph of a man who be kill in this room most mysteriously a few day ago these gentleman wish to identify he the face seem to I somehow familiar but i can not place it look at it julie put forth a shake hand take the photograph and glance at it then with a long sigh slide limply to the floor before either godfrey or i could catch she as she fall she veil catch on the chair-back be tear away and look down at she a great emotion burst within I for i recognize the mysterious woman whose photograph d'aurelle have carry in he watch-case chapter xv the secret of the unknown frenchman for a moment i stand spell-bound stare down at that jaded and passion-stained countenance then godfrey spring forward and lift the unconscious woman to the couch bring some water he say and as he turn and look at I i see that he face be glowing with excitement i rush to the door and snatch it open roger be stand in the hall outside and i send he hurry for the water and turn back into the room godfrey be chafe the girl 's hand and the veil lady be bend over she fumbling at the hook of she bodice evidently she could not see they for with a sudden movement she put back she veil my heart warm to she at that act of sacrifice and after a single glance at she i turn away my eye i see godfrey 's start of recognition as he look down at she then he too look aside here be the water sir say roger and hand I glass and pitcher the next instant he eye fall upon the woman on the couch he stand stare he face turn slowly purple then clutch at he throat he half-turn and fall just as i have see he do once before hornblower who be stare at the unconscious woman and mop he face feverishly spin around at the crash well i 'll be damned he say in a hoarse voice as he see roger extend on the floor at he foot what be the matter with this house anyway so great be the tension on my nerve that i could scarcely restrain a shout of laughter i turn it into a shout for park but he face when he appear on the threshold be too much for I and i sink into a chair laugh hysterically for god 's sake park begin it be all right godfrey break in sharply roger have have another fit get the ammonia park stagger away and mr hornblower sit down weakly i do not see the joke he growl glare at I he face crimson get a grip of yourself lester say godfrey savagely seize the pitcher from my hand and hurry with it to madame i _ do _ get a grip of myself and when park come back a moment later with the ammonia be able to hold up roger 's head while park apply the phial to he nostril give I a whiff of it too park i say unsteadily and in a instant my eye be streaming but i have escape hysteria straighten roger out and let he lie there i gasp and sit dizzily down upon the floor but i dare not look at hornblower i feel that another glance at he dazed countenance would send I off again madame meanwhile have dash some water into the face of the unconscious julie -- much to the detriment of she complexion -- watch she a moment then stand erect and lower she veil she will soon be all right again she say and truly enough at the end of a few seconds the girl open she eye and look dazedly about she then a violent tremble seize she what be it julie ask she mistress take she hand you know this man a hoarse sob be the only answer you must tell I go on madame quietly but firmly perhaps a crime have be commit you must tell I everything you may rely upon the discretion of these gentleman you know this man the girl nod and close she eye but the hot tear brim from they and run down over she cheek in paris the girl nod again he be you lover a third nod and a fresh flood of tear i remember now say madame suddenly i see he with she once what be he do in this house she go on more sternly tell we madame will never forgive I sob the girl and i begin to think that she be more concerned for herself than for she lover the same thought occur to she mistress too no doubt for she voice harden try I she say understand well you must tell -- if not here then before a officer of the police oh no no scream julie sit suddenly erect never that i could not bear that madame would not be so cruel then tell we now say the veil lady inexorably very well madame cry the girl dab at she eye with she handkerchief and speaking in a mixture of french and english which i shall not attempt to transcribe i will tell i will tell everything after all i be not to blame it be that creature i do not love he -- but i fear he he possess a power over I he could make I do anything he even beat I and still i go back to he what be he name ask the veil lady george drouet -- he live in the rue de la huchette just off the rue saint jacque -- on the top floor under the gutter he be bad -- bad -- he live off woman i meet he six month ago he know how to fascinate one i think he love I then he begin to borrow money from I until he have take all that i have save then my ring -- every one she hold up she hand to show they bareness then she stop and glance at she mistress continue say the latter tell what you have to tell i know that madame also she stop again i walk over to the window and stand stare at the wooden shutter strangely move well why not she demand fiercely and i feel that she be address my turn back why not shall a woman not be love shall a woman endure what madame endure that will do julie break in the veil lady she voice cold as ice tell you story i know of the secret drawer i have see madame open it i know what it contain but i be faithful to madame i love she i be glad that she have find some one madame will remember she despair she horror when she enter she room to find the cabinet go take away sell by that i too be in despair -- i desire with my whole soul to help madame that night i have a rendezvous with he and she nod toward the photograph which lay upon the floor i tell he she mistress stand as though turn to stone i could guess she anguish and humiliation he question I -- he learn everything -- the drawer how it be open -- all but i do not suspect what be in he mind -- not for a instant do i suspect but on the boat i see he and then i know well he have get what he deserve she shiver and press she hand against she eye i think that be all madame she add hoarsely it be all of that story say godfrey in a crisp voice but there be another another echo the veil lady look at he ask she madame for what purpose she call at this house night before last and see philip vantine in this room i do not shriek the girl she face ablaze it be a lie she do not need to tell go on godfrey inexorably any fool could guess she come for the letter she have resolve herself to blackmail you madame it be a lie shriek the girl again i come hope to save she -- to a storm of angry sob choke she i could see how the veil lady be tremble i place a chair for she and she sink into it with a murmur of thanks besides we have a witness to she visit add godfrey shall i call the police madame no no and the girl sit upright again she face ghastly i will tell i will tell all give I but a moment she sit there struggle for self-control she streak and grotesque countenance contorted with emotion then i see she eye widen and glance around i see that roger have drag himself to a sit posture and be stare at she he face livid the sight of he seem to madden she it be you she shriek and shake she clenched fist at he it be you who tell coward coward but godfrey he face very grim lay a heavy hand upon she arm be still he cry he tell we nothing he try to shield you -- though why he should wish to do so roger break in with a hollow and ghastly laugh it be natural enough sir he say hoarsely she be my wife chapter xvi philip vantine 's caller it be a sordid story that roger gasp out to we and as it concern this tale only incidentally i shall pass over it as briefly as may be eight or ten year before the fair julie -- at least she be fairer then than now -- have come to new york to enter the employ of a family whose mistress have decide that life without a french maid be unendurable roger have meet she have be fascinate by she black eye and red lip have in the end propose honorable marriage -- quite unnecessarily no doubt -- have be accept and for some month have lead a eventful existence as the husband of the siren then one morning he awaken to find she go he have of course entrust he savings to she -- that have be one condition of the marriage -- and the savings be go also julie it seem have be overcome with longing for the pari asphalt no doubt too she have find herself ennui by the lack of romance in married life with roger and she have fly back to france roger have think of follow but appal at the difficulty of find she in paris not know what he should do if he do find she he have finally give it up and have settle gloomily down to live upon he memory some sort of affection for she have keep alive within he and when he open the door of vantine 's house and find she standing on the step he be as wax in she hand julie have listen to all this indifferently even disdainfully without deny anything nor seek to excuse herself perhaps the idea that she need excuse do not occur to she and when the story be finish she be quite herself again even a little proud i think of hold the center of the stage in the rôle of siren it be almost a rejuvenescence and there be gratitude in the gaze she turn on roger this be all true i suppose ask the veil lady all quite true madame answer julie with a shrug i be younger then and the love of excitement be too strong for I i be older now and have more sense -- besides i be no longer seek after as i be and so say madame with irony you be now no doubt willing to return to you husband i have be consider it madame reply julie with astounding simplicity ever since i see he here the other evening and learn that he still care for I one must have a harbor in one 's old age i glance at roger and be astonish to see that he be regard the woman with affectionate admiration evidently the harbor be wait should julie choose to anchor there i have hesitate she add only because of madame where would madame get another maid such as i no one but i can arrange she hair -- no one but i can prepare she bath we will discuss it say the veil lady when we be alone and now perhaps you will be so good as to tell we of you previous visit here very well madame and julie settle into a more comfortable posture it be one day on the boat as i be look down at the passenger of the third class that i perceive george -- m drouet -- stroll about i be _ bouleversée _ -- what you call upset with amazement and then he look up and we eye meet and he come beneath I and command that i meet he that evening it be then that i learn he plan it be to secure those letter for himself and to dispose of they to whom ask godfrey to the person that would pay the greatest price for they most certainly answer julie surprise that it should have be think necessary to ask such a question they be to be offer first to madame at ten thousand franc each should she refuse they be then to be offer to m le duc -- he would surely desire to possess they the veil lady shiver a little and she hand instinctively seek she bosom to assure herself that the precious packet be safe that night continue julie in my cabin i toss and toss try to discover a way to prevent this for i have see long since that m drouet no longer care for I -- i know that it be upon some other woman that money would be spend i decide that at the first moment i would hasten to this house i would explain the matter to m vantine i would persuade he to restore to I the letter with which i would fly to madame i know also that i could rely upon she gratitude add the girl after all one must provide for oneself she pause and glance around the room smile at the interest in we face you have at least one virtue -- that of frankness say the veil lady continue it be not until evening that i find a opportunity to leave madame julie go on i hasten here i ring the bell but i confess i should have fail i should not have secure a entrance if it have not be that it be my husband who open the door to I even after i be inside the door he refuse to permit I to see he master but as we be debate together m vantine himself come into the hall and i run to he and beg that he hear I it be then that he invite I to enter this room she pause again and a little shiver of expectancy run through I at last we be to learn how philip vantine have meet he death i sit down continue julie i tell he the story from the very begin he listen with much interest but when i propose that he should restore to I the letter he hesitate he walk up and down the room try to decide then he take I through that door into the room beyond the cabinet be stand in the center of the floor and all the light be blaze ` be that the cabinet ' he ask I and when i say that most assuredly it be he seem surprised ` it be a easy thing to prove ' i say and i go to the cabinet and press on the three spring as i have see madame do the little handle at the side fall out but suddenly he stop I ` yes it be the cabinet ' he say ' i see that and no doubt the drawer contain the letter as you say but those letter do not belong to you they belong to you mistress i can not permit that you take they away for after all i do not know you you may intend to make some bad use of they ' i protest that such a suspicion be most unjust that my character be of the best that i be devote to my mistress and desire to protect she he listen but he be not convince in the end he bring I back into this room i could have cry with rage ` return to you mistress ' he say ` and inform she that i shall be most happy to return the letter to she but it must be in she own hand that i place they the letter be here whenever it please she to claim they i see that it be of no use to argue further he be of adamant so i leave the house he himself open the door for I and that be all that i know madame there be a moment 's silence then i hear godfrey draw a deep breath i could see that like myself he be convince that the girl be tell the truth of course he suggest gently as soon as you reach home you related to you mistress what have occur julie grow a little crimson no monsieur she say i tell she nothing i should have think you would have wish to prove you devotion go on godfrey in he sweetest tone i fear that without the letter she would misunderstand my motive say julie sullenly and then of course without the letter there would be no reward godfrey supplement julie do not reply but she look very uncomfortable the veil lady rise have you any further question to ask she she say no madame say godfrey the story be complete julie resume she veil shooting at godfrey a glance anything but friendly the veil lady turn to I and hold out she hand i thank you mr lester for you kindness she say come julie and she move toward the door which roger hasten to open mr hornblower nod and pass out after they and godfrey and i be leave alone together we both sit down and for a moment neither of we speak well say godfrey at last well what a story it would make and i can not use it it be a bitter reflection lester it would certainly shake the pillar of society i agree i be rather shake myself so be i i be all at sea for a while -- i be dumb with astonishment when i hear you and the veil lady talk about the secret drawer -- i could see you laugh at I i do not know the whole story yet how do she happen to come to you i tell he of hornblower 's visit of the story he tell I and of the arrangement we have make godfrey nod thoughtfully when i have finish the story be straight of course he say hornblower would not be engage in anything tricky besides i recognize the lady i suppose you do too yes i have see picture of she and i admire she for put back she veil so do i she have change since the day of she wedding lester -- she be a smooth-faced girl then three year of life with she duke have leave they mark on she he fall silent stare thoughtfully at the carpet then he shake himself and the maid 's story be most interesting he add nevertheless there be still a number of thing which be not quite clear to I there be one thing i do not understand myself i say i have not any idea this be the right cabinet i do not see how it could be that be it exactly how do it happen when the veil lady go to armand & son in pari that she be direct to philip vantine accord to he own story he do not purchase this cabinet he have never see it before it be presumably ship he by mistake armand & son cable you that it be a mistake and yet they cite vantine as the purchaser there be something twisted somewhere lester just where i 'll try to find out which remind I that armand 's representative have not be around yet no doubt he can straighten the matter out it will not do any harm to hear he story anyway godfrey agree now let 's have a look at that drawer it be stand open as we have leave it and godfrey push it back into place call my attention to the cunning way in which its outline be conceal by the inlay about it then he work the spring the handle fall into place and he draw the drawer out again as far as it would come and examine it carefully the fellow who devise that be a genius he say admiringly push it back into place i wonder what its contents have be from the day of madame de montespan down to the present love letter mostly i suppose since they be the thing which need concealment most do not you wish this drawer could tell its secret lester there be one i wish it would tell if it know it i say i wish it would tell who kill philip vantine i suppose you will agree with I that we pretty theory have get a knock-out blow this time it look that way do not it there be no poison mechanism about that drawer -- that be sure i add no and never have be godfrey agree and that leave we all at sea do not it it leave the whole affair more mysterious than ever i can not understand it and i sit down in my bewilderment and rub my head i really feel for a instant as though i have go mentally blind there be one thing sure i add the killing whatever its cause be do out there in the ante-room not in here what make you think that we believe that drouet come here to get vantine 's permission to open this drawer and get the letter no doubt represent himself as the agent of they owner i think it be a pretty good guess say godfrey pensively we theory be that after be show into the ante-room he discover the cabinet try to open the drawer and be kill in the attempt but it be evident enough now that there be nothing about that drawer to hurt any one yes that be evident i think godfrey agree if he have open the drawer then he would have take the letter since there be nothing to prevent he since they be not take it follow do not it that he be kill before he have a chance at the drawer perhaps he never see the cabinet he must have be kill out there in the ante-room a few minute after park leave and how about vantine godfrey ask i do not know i say helplessly he do not want the letter -- if he open the drawer at all it be merely out of curiosity to see how it work only of course the same agency that kill drouet kill he yes -- and now that i think of it it be certain he do not open the drawer either how do you know it be certain if he have open the drawer i point out and be kill in the act of open it it would have be find open i have think that perhaps it close of itself but you see that it do not you have to push it shut and then snap the handle up into place that be true godfrey assent and it sound pretty conclusive if it be true of vantine it be also true of drouet the inference be then that neither of they open the drawer well what follow i do not know i say helplessly nothing seem to follow there be a alternative godfrey suggest what be it i demand the hand that kill drouet and vantine may also have close the drawer say godfrey and look at I and leave the letter in it i question surely not he glance at the shutter window and i understand to whom he think that hand belong besides i protest how would he get in how would he get away what be he after if he leave the letter behind then i rise wearily i must be get back to the office i say this be Saturday and we close at two be you come no he answer if you do not mind i 'll sit here a while longer and think thing over lester perhaps i 'll blunder on to the truth yet chapter xvii enter m armand i get back to the office to find that m félix armand of armand et fils have call and find I out have leave he card with the pencil memorandum that he would call again Monday morning there be another caller who have await my return -- a tall angular man with a long moustache who introduce himself as simon w morgan of osage city iowa poor philip vantine 's nearest living relative sir he add i come as soon as possible it be very good of you i say the funeral will be at ten o'clock to-morrow morning from the house you have a telegram from I yes i answer he hitch about in he chair uneasily for a moment i know what he want to say but see no reason to help he he leave a will i suppose he ask at last oh yes we have arrange to probate it Monday you can examine it then if you wish have you examine it i be familiar with its provision it be draw here in the office he be pull furiously at he moustache cousin philip be a very wealthy man i understand he manage to say comparatively wealthy he have security worth about a million and a quarter besides a number of piece of real property -- and of course the house he live in he own a very valuable collection of art object -- picture furniture tapestry and such thing but what they be worth will probably never be know why not he ask because he leave they all to the metropolitan museum of art outside of a few legacy to old servant he leave he whole fortune to the same institution i put it rather brutally no doubt but i be anxious to end the interview mr morgan 's face grow very red he do he ejaculate ha -- well i have hear he be rather crazy he be as sane as any man i ever know i retort drily and then i remember the doubt which have assail I that last day when vantine be finger the boule cabinet but i keep those doubt to myself ha -- we 'll have to see about that say my visitor threateningly by all means mr morgan i assent heartily if you have any doubt about it you should certainly look into it and now if you will pardon I i have many thing to do and we close early to-day he get to he foot and go slowly out and that be the last i ever saw of he i suppose he consult a attorney learn the hopeless nature of he case and take the first train back to osage city he do not even wait for the funeral few people indeed put themselves out for it there be a sprinkling of old family friend representative of the museum and of various charity in which vantine have be interest a few friend of he own and that be all he have drop out of the world with scarcely a ripple of all who have know he i dare say park feel he departure most for vantine have be in a sense a solitary man not many man nod oftener during a walk up the avenue and yet not many dine oftener alone for there be about he a certain self-detachment which discourage intimacy he be a man like many another with acquaintance in every country on the globe and friend in none all this i think over a little sadly as i sit at home that night and not without some self-questioning as to my own place in the world most of we i think be a little saddened when we realize we unimportance most of we no doubt would be a little shocked could we return a day or two after we death and see how merrily the world wag on i would be miss i know scarcely more than vantine it be not a pleasant thought for it seem to argue some deficiency in myself then too the mystery of vantine 's death have a depressing effect upon I so long as there seem some theory to build on so long as there be a ray of light ahead i have hope that the tragedy would be explain and expiate but now my theory have crumble to piece i be leave in utter darkness from which there seem no way out never before in the face of any mystery have i feel so blind and helpless and the feeling take such a grip upon I that it keep I awake for a long time after i get to bed it seem in some mysterious way that i be contend with a power greater than myself a power threatening and awful which could crush I with a turn of the wrist vantine 's will be probate next morning he have direct that he collection of art object be remove to the museum and that the house and such portion of its contents as the museum do not care for be sell for the museum 's benefit i have already notify sir caspar purdon clarke of the term of the will and the museum 's attorney be present when it be read he state that he have be request to ask I to remain in charge of thing for a week or two until arrangement for the removal could be make it would also be necessary to make a inventory of vantine 's collection and the assistant director of the museum be to get this under way at once i acquiesce in all these arrangement but i be feel decidedly blue when i start back to the office vantine 's collection have always seem to I somehow a part of himself more especially a part of the house in which it have be assemble it would lose much of its beauty and significance ticket and arrange stiffly along the wall of the museum and the thought come to I that it would be a splendid thing for new york if this old house and its contents could be keep intact as a object lesson to the nervous and hurry younger generation of the easier and more finished manner of life of the older one something after the fashion that the beautiful old plantin-moretus mansion at antwerp be a rebuke to those present-day publisher who reckon literature a commodity along with soap and cheese that of course it would be impossible to do the last barrier to the commercial invasion of the avenue would be remove that heroic rear-guard of the old order of thing would be destroy in a year or two a monster of steel and stone would rise on the spot where three generation of vantine have live they life and the collection so unified and coherent to which the last vantine have devote he life would be merge and lose in the vast collection of the museum it be a sad end gentleman to see you sir say the office-boy as i sit down at my desk and a moment later m félix armand be show in to I i have only to close my eye to call again before I that striking personality for felix armand be one of the most extraordinary man i ever have the pleasure of meeting ruddy-faced bright-eyed with dark full beard and wave hair almost jet black -- hair that crinkle about he ear in a way that i can describe by no other word than fascinating -- he give the impression of tremendous strength and virility there be about he too a air of culture not to be mistake the air of a man who have travel much see much and mixed with many people high and low the air of a man at home anywhere in any society it be impossible for I by mere word to convey any adequate idea of he vivid personality but i confess that from the first moment i be both impressed and charm by he and i be still impressed more perhaps than at first now that i know the whole story -- but you shall hear i speak english very badly sir he say as he sit down if you speak french not half so well as you speak english i laugh i can tell that from you first sentence in that event i will do the best that i can he say smile and you must pardon my blunder first mr lester on behalf of armand et fils i must ask you pardon for this mistake so inexcusable it _ be _ a mistake then i ask one most embarrassing to we we can not find for it a explanation believe I mr lester it be not we habit to make mistake we have a reputation of which we be very proud but the cabinet which be purchase by mr vantine remain in we warehouse and this other one be box and ship to he we be investigate most rigidly then mr vantine 's cabinet be still in paris no mr lester the error be discover some day ago and the cabinet belong to mr vantine be ship to I here it should arrive next Wednesday on _ la provence _ i shall myself receive it and deliver it to mr vantine mr vantine be dead i say you do not know he sit stare at I for a moment as though unable to comprehend do i understand that you say mr vantine be dead he stammer i tell he briefly as much as i know of the tragedy while he sit regard I with a air of stupefaction it be curious you see nothing of it in the papers i add they be full of it i have be visit friend at quebec he explain it be there that the message from we house find I command I to hasten here i start at once and reach this city Saturday i drive here directly from the station but be so unfortunate as to miss you i be sorry to have cause you so much trouble i say but my dear mr lester he protest it be for we to take trouble a blunder of this sort we feel as a disgrace my father who be of the old school be most upset concern it but this death of mr vantine -- it be a great blow to I i have meet he many time he be a real connoisseur -- we have lose one of we most value patron you say that he be find dead in a room at he house yes and death result from a small wound on the hand into which some very powerful poison have be inject that be most curious in what manner be such a wound make that we do not know i have a theory yes he question he eye gleam with interest a few hour previously another man have be find in the same room kill in the same way another man a stranger who have call to see mr vantine my theory be that both this stranger and mr vantine have be kill while try to open a secret drawer in the boule cabinet do you know anything of the history of that cabinet monsieur armand we believe it to have be make for madame de montespan by monsieur boule himself he answer it be the original of one now in the louvre which be know to have belong to the grand loui that be mr vantine 's belief i say why he should have arrive at that conclusion i do not know -- mr vantine be a connoisseur say m armand quietly there be certain indication which no connoisseur could mistake it be he guess at the history of the cabinet i explain which give I the basis for my theory a cabinet belong to madame de montespan would of course have a secret drawer and since it be make in the day of de brinvilliers and la voisin what more natural than that it should be guard by a poison mechanism what more natural indeed breathe my companion and i fancy that he look at I with a new interest in he eye it be good reasoning mr lester it seem to explain a situation for which no other explanation have be find i say and it have also the merit of picturesqueness it be unique he agree eagerly he eye burn like two coal of fire so intense be he interest i have be from boyhood he add notice my glance a lover of tale of mystery they have for I a fascination i can not explain there be in my blood something that respond to they i feel sometimes that i would have make a great detective -- or a great criminal instead of which i be merely a dealer in curio you can understand how i be fascinate by a story so outré as this perhaps you can assist we i suggest for that theory of mine have be completely disprove disprove in what way he demand the secret drawer have be find _ comment _ he cry he voice sharp with surprise find the secret drawer have be find yes and there be no poison mechanism guard it he breathe deeply for a instant then he pull himself together with a little laugh really he say i must not indulge myself in this way it be a kind of intoxication but you say that the drawer be find and that there be no poison be the drawer empty no there be a packet of letter in it delicious love letter of a certainty _ billet-doux _ from the great loui to the montespan perhaps no unfortunately they be of a much more recent date they have be restore to they owner i hope that you agree with I that that be the right thing to do he sit for a moment regard I narrowly and i have a uneasy feeling that since he undoubtedly know of whom the cabinet have be purchase he be reconstruct the story more completely than i would have wish he to do since the letter have be return he say at last a little drily it be useless to discuss the matter but no doubt i should approve if all the circumstance be know to I especially if it be to assist a lady it be i say and i see from he face that he understand then you do well he say have no other explanation be find for the death of mr vantine and of this stranger i think not the coroner will hold he inquest to-morrow he have defer it in the hope that some new evidence would be discover and none have be discover i have hear of none you do not even know who this stranger be oh yes we have discover that he be a worthless fellow name drouet a frenchman yes live in a attic in the rue de la huchette at pari m armand have be gaze at I intently but now he look relax and i fancy that he draw a deep breath as a man might do when relieve of a burden at the back of my brain a vague and shadowy suspicion begin to form -- a suspicion that perhaps m armand know more of this affair than he have as yet acknowledge you do not by any chance know he i ask carelessly no i think not but there be one thing i do not understand mr lester and you will pardon I if i be indiscreet but i do not understand what this drouet as you call he be do in the house of mr vantine he be try to get possession of the letter i say oh so it be that and my companion nod and in try to get those letter he be kill yes but what none of we understand m armand be how he be kill who or what kill he how be that poison administer can you suggest a explanation he sit for a moment stare thoughtfully out of the window it be a nice problem he say a most interesting one i will think it over mr lester perhaps i may be able to make a suggestion i do not know but in any event i shall see you again Wednesday if it be agreeable to you we can meet at the house of mr vantine and exchange the cabinet at what time i do not know with exactness there may be some delay in get the cabinet from the ship perhaps it would be better if i call for you very well i assent permit I to express again my apology that such a mistake should have be make by we really we be most careful but even we sometimes suffer from careless servant it desolate I to think that i can not offer these apology to mr vantine in person till Wednesday then mr lester till Wednesday i echo and watch he erect and perfectly-garbed figure until it vanish through the doorway a fascinating man i tell myself as i turn back to my desk and one whom i should like to know more intimately a man with a hobby for the mystery of crime with which i could fully sympathise and i smile as i thought of the burning interest with which he have listen to the story of the double tragedy how naïvely he have confess he thought that he would have make a great detective -- or a great criminal and here he be only a dealer in curio well i have have the same thought more than once -- and here be i merely a not-too-successful lawyer decidedly m armand and myself have much in common chapter xviii i part with the boule cabinet the coroner 's inquest be hold next day and my surmise prove to be correct the police have discover practically no new evidence none certainly which shed any light on the way in which drouet and philip vantine have meet death each of the witness tell he story much as i have tell it here and it be evident that the jury be bewilder by the seemingly inextricable tangle of circumstance to my relief drouet 's identity be establish without any help from I the bag which he have leave on the pier have be open at the request of the police and a card-case find with he address on it why he have send in to vantine a card not he own and what he business with vantine have be be detail concern which the police could offer no theory and which i do not feel call upon to explain since neither in any way make clearer the mystery of he death a amusing incident of the inquest be the attempt make by goldberger to heckle godfrey evidently at grady 's suggestion on the morning after the tragedy goldberger begin sweetly you print in the _ record _ a photograph which you claim to be that of the woman who have call upon mr vantine the night before and who be presumably the last person to see he alive where do you get that photograph it be a copy of one which drouet carry in he watch-case answer godfrey since then pursue goldberger you have make no further reference to that feature of the case i presume you find out that you be mistake on the contrary i prove that i be correct goldberger 's face redden and he look be not pleasant ` prove ' be rather a strong word be not it he ask it be the right word what be the woman 's connection with the man drouet she have be he mistress you say that very confidently say goldberger he lip curl after all it be merely a guess be not it i have reason to say it confidently retort godfrey quietly since the woman confess as much in my presence again goldberger reddened i suppose she also confess that it be really she who call upon mr vantine he sneer she not only confess that say godfrey still more quietly but she tell in detail what occur during that visit the confession be make to yourself alone of course query goldberger in a tone deliberately insulting godfrey flush a little at the word but manage to retain he self-control not at all he say it be make in the presence of mr lester and of another distinguish lawyer whose name i be not at liberty to reveal goldberger swallow hard as though he have receive a slap in the face i dare say he feel as though he have this woman be in new york he ask i believe so what be she name and address i be not at liberty to answer goldberger glare at he you _ will _ answer he thunder or i 'll commit you for contempt godfrey be quite himself again very well he say smile i have not the slightest objection but i would think it over if i be you mr lester will assure you that the woman be in no way connect with the death either of drouet or of mr vantine goldberger do think it over he realize the danger of try to punish a paper so powerful as the _ record _ and he finally decide to accept godfrey 's statement as a mitigation of he refusal to answer that be only one of the detail which commissioner grady have miss godfrey add pleasantly that will do goldberger break in and godfrey leave the stand i be recall to confirm he story i also of course refuse to give the woman 's name explain to goldberger that i have learn it professionally that i be certain she have be guilty of no crime and that to reveal it would seriously embarrass a entirely innocent woman with that statement the coroner be compel to appear satisfied grady do not go on the stand he be not even at the inquest in fact since the first day he have not appear publicly in connection with the case at all and i have surmise that he do not care to be identify with a mystery which there seem to be no prospect of solve and from which no glory be to be win the case have be place in simmond 's hand and it be he who testify on behalf of the police admit candidly that they be all at sea he have make a careful examination of the vantine house he say particularly of the room in which the body have be find and have discover absolutely nothing in the shape of a clue to the solution of the mystery there be something diabolical about it something almost supernatural he have not abandon hope and be still work on the case but he be incline to think that if the mystery be ever solve it would be only by some lucky accident or through the confession of the guilty man goldberger be annoy that be evident enough from the nervous way in which he gnaw he moustache but he have no theory any more than the police there be not a scintilla of evidence to fasten the crime upon any one and the end of the hearing be that the jury bring in a verdict that philip vantine and george drouet have die from the effect of a poison administer by a person or person unknown godfrey join I at the door as i be leave and we go down the step together i be glad to hear simmond confess that the police be up a tree he say of course grady be try to sneak out of it and blame some one else for the failure -- but i 'll see that he do not succeed i 'll see anyway that simmond get a square deal -- he be a old friend of mine you know yes i say i know but we be all up a tree be not we for the present laugh godfrey we do occupy that undignified position but you do not expect to stay there forever do you lester since my theory about the boule cabinet explode i say i have give up hope by the way i be go to turn the cabinet over to its owner to-morrow to its owner he repeat he eye narrow yes i think he would be around for it though i hardly think he would come so soon who do it happen to be lester why i say a little impatiently you know as well as i do that it belong to armand & son you have see they representative then he query a little flush of excitement which i could not understand spread over he face he come to see I yesterday i would like you to meet he godfrey he be félix armand the ` son ' of the firm and one of the most finished gentleman i ever meet i would like to meet he say godfrey smile queerly perhaps i shall some day i hope so anyway but how do he explain the blunder lester in some way they ship the wrong cabinet to vantine the right one will get here on _ la provence _ to-morrow and i tell he in detail the story which felix armand have tell I he be quite upset over it i add he apology be almost abject godfrey listen intently to all this and he nod with satisfaction when i have finish it be all most interesting he comment do m armand happen to mention where he be stay no but he will not be hard to find if you want to see he he be at one of the big hotel of course -- probably the plaza or the st regi he be too great a swell for any minor hostelry what time do you expect he to-morrow sometime in the afternoon he be to call for I as soon as he get vantine 's cabinet off the boat godfrey i add i feel yesterday when i be talk with he that perhaps he know more about this affair than he would admit i could see that he guess in a instant who the owner of the letter be and what they contain do you think i ought to hold on to the cabinet a while longer i could invent some pretext for delay easily enough why no let he have he cabinet say godfrey with a alacrity that surprise I if you theory about it have be explode what be the use of hang on to it i do not see any use in do so i admit but i think perhaps you might want more time to examine it i have examine it all i be go to godfrey answer and i tell myself that this be the first time i have ever know he to admit himself defeat i have a sort of feeling i explain that when we let go of the cabinet we give up the only clue we have to this whole affair it be like a confession of defeat oh no it be not godfrey object if there be nothing more to be learn from the cabinet there be no reason to retain it i should certainly let m armand have it perhaps i 'll see you to-morrow he add and we part at the corner but i do not see he on the morrow i be rather expect a call from he during the morning and when none come i be certain i should find he await I when i arrive at the vantine house in company with m armand but he be not there and when i ask for he park tell I that he have not see he since the day before i confess that godfrey 's indifference to the fate of the cabinet surprise I greatly besides i be hope that he would wish to meet the fascinating frenchman more fascinating if possible than he have be on Monday and i soon find myself completely under he spell there have be less delay than he have anticipate in get the cabinet off the boat and through the custom and it be not yet three o'clock when we reach the vantine house i have not see mr godfrey park repeat but there be other here as it fair break my heart to see he motion toward the door of the music-room and step to it i see that the inventory be already in progress the man in charge of it nod to I but i do not go in for the sight be anything but a pleasant one the cabinet be in the room across the hall i say to m armand and lead the way through the ante-room into the room beyond park switch on the light for we and my companion glance with surprise at the heavy shutter cover the window we put those up for a protection i explain we have a idea that some one would try to enter in fact one evening we _ do _ find a wire connect with the burglar-alarm cut and later on saw some one peer in through the hole in that shutter yonder you do m armand query quickly would you recognize the man if you be to meet he again oh no you see the hole be quite small there be nothing visible except a pair of eye yet i might know they again for i never before saw such eye -- so bright so burn it be the night that godfrey and i be try to find the secret drawer and those eye gleam like fire as they watch we m armand be gaze at the cabinet apparently only half listen ah yes the secret drawer he say will you show I how it be operate mr lester i be most curious about it i place my hand upon the table and press the three point which the veil lady have show we the first time i get the order wrong but at the second trial the little handle fall forward with a click and i pull the drawer open there it be i say you see how cleverly it be construct and how well it be conceal no one would suspect its existence he examine it with much interest push it back into place and then open it himself very clever indeed he agree i have never see another so well conceal and the idea of open it only by a certain combination be most happy and original most secret drawer be secret only in name a slight search reveal they but this one he push it shut again and examine the inlay around it my friend and i go over the cabinet very carefully and could not find it i say you friend -- i think you mention he name yes -- he name be godfrey a man of the law like yourself oh no a newspaper man but he have be a member of the detective force before that he be extraordinarily keen and if anybody could have find that drawer he could but that combination be too much for he m armand snap the drawer back into place with a little crash i be glad at any rate that it _ be _ discover he say i will not conceal from you mr lester that it add not a little to the value of the cabinet what be its value i ask mr vantine want I to buy it for he and name a most extravagant figure as the limit he be willing to pay really m armand answer after a instant 's hesitation i would not care to name a figure mr lester without further consultation with my father the cabinet be quite unique -- the most beautiful perhaps that m boule ever produce do you discover madame de montespan 's monogram no mr vantine say he be sure it exist but godfrey and i do not look for it m armand open the door which conceal the central drawer _ voilà _ he say and trace with he finger the arabesque just under the pediment see how cunningly it have be blended with the other figure and here be the emblem of the giver he point to a tiny golden sun with radiate ray on the base of the pediment just above the monogram _ le rous soleil _ _ le rous soleil _ i repeat of course we be stupid not to have discern it that tell the whole story do not it what be it park i add as that worthy appear at the door there be a van outside sir he say and a couple of man be unload a piece of furniture be it all right sir yes i answer have they bring it in here and ask the man in charge of the inventory to step over here a minute mr vantine leave he collection of art object to the metropolitan museum i explain to m armand and i should like the representative of the museum to be present when the exchange be make certainly he assent that be very just park be back in a moment pilot two man who carry between they a object swathe in burlap and the metropolitan man follow they in i be mr lester i say to he mr vantine 's executor and this be m félix armand of armand & son of pari we be correct a error which be make just before mr vantine die that cabinet yonder be ship he by mistake in place of one which he have buy m armand have cause the right one to be send over and will take away the one which belong to he i have already speak to the museum 's attorney about the matter but i wish you to be present when the exchange be make i have no doubt it be all right sir the museum man hasten to assure I you of course have personal knowledge of all this certainly mr vantine himself tell I the story very well sir but he eye dwell lovingly upon the boule cabinet that be a very handsome piece he add i be sorry the museum be not to get it perhaps you can buy it from m armand i suggest but the curator laugh and shake he head no he say we could not afford it but sir caspar might persuade mr morgan to buy it for we -- i 'll mention it to he the two man meanwhile under m armand 's direction have be strip the wrapping from the other cabinet and it finally stand reveal it too be a beautiful piece of furniture but even my untrained eye could see how greatly it fall below the other we shall be very pleased to have mr morgan see it say m armand with a smile i will not conceal from you that we have already think of he -- as what dealer do not when he acquire something rare and beautiful i shall endeavor to secure a appointment with he meanwhile meanwhile the cabinet be yours i say he make a little deprecating gesture and then proceed to have the cabinet very carefully wrap in the burlap which have be around the other one i watch it disappear under the rough cover with something like regret for already my eye be be open to its beauty besides i tell myself again with it would disappear the last hope of solve the mystery of philip vantine 's death however my reason might protest some instinct tell I that in some way the boule cabinet be connect with that tragedy but at last the packing be do and m armand turn to I and hold out he hand i shall hope to see you again mr lester he say with a cordiality which flatter I and to renew we very pleasant acquaintance whenever you be in pari i trust you will not fail to honor I by let I know i shall count it a very great privilege to display for you some of the beauty of we city not know to every one thank you i say i shall certainly remember that invitation and meanwhile since you be here in new york you be most kind he break in and i be myself hope that we might at least dine together but i be compel to proceed to boston this evening and from there i shall go on to quebec whether i shall get back to new york i do not know -- it will depend somewhat upon mr morgan 's attitude we would scarcely entrust a business so delicate to we dealer if i do get back i shall let you know please do i urge it will be a very great pleasure to I besides i be still hope that some solution of this mystery may occur to you he shake he head with a little smile i fear it be too difficult for a novice like myself he say it be impenetrable to I if a solution be discover i trust you will inform I it be certain to be most interesting i will i promise and we shake hand again then he sign to the two man to take up the cabinet and himself lay a protect hand upon it as it be carry through the door and down the step to the van which be back up to the curb it be lift carefully inside the two man clamber in beside it the driver speak to the horse and the van roll slowly away up the avenue m armand watch it for a moment then mount into the cab which be wait wave a last farewell to I and follow after the van we watch it until it turn westward at the first cross-street mr godfrey 's occupation will be go say park with a little laugh he have fairly live with that cabinet for the past three or four day he be here last night for quite a while last night i echo surprised i be sure he would be here to-day i add reflect that godfrey might have decide to have a final look at the cabinet he half-promise to be here but i suppose something more important detain he the next instant i be jump down the step two at a time for a cab in which two man be sit come down the avenue and roll slowly around the corner in the direction take by the van and just as it disappear one of its occupant turn toward I and wave he hand -- and i recognize jim godfrey chapter xix la mort that my leg without conscious effort of my own should carry I up the avenue and around the corner after the cab in which i have see godfrey be a foregone conclusion and yet it be with a certain vexation of spirit that i find myself race along for i realize that godfrey have not be entirely frank with I certainly he have drop no hint of he intention to follow armand but i tell myself that might very well have be because he deem such a hint unnecessary i might have guess in spite of he seeming unconcern that he would not allow the cabinet to pass from he sight if he have be willing for I to turn it over to armand it be only because he expect development of some sort to follow that transfer and it suddenly dawn upon I that even i do not know the cabinet 's destination it have not occur to I to inquire where m armand propose to take it and he have volunteer no information so after a moment i take up the chase more contentedly tell myself that godfrey would not have wave to I if he have not want I along and i reach the corner in time to see the van turn northward into sixth avenue as soon as it and the cab which follow it be out of sight i sprint along the sidewalk at top speed and on arrive at the corner have the satisfaction of see they only a little way ahead here the congestion of traffic be such that the van could proceed but slowly and i have no difficulty in keep pace with it without the necessity of make myself conspicuous by run indeed i rather hang back bury myself in the crowd on the sidewalk for fear that armand might chance to glance around and see I in pursuit i see that godfrey and simmond have the same fear for the cab in which they be draw up at the curb and wait there until the van have get some distance ahead at sixteenth street it turn westward again and then northward into seventh avenue what could armand be do in this part of the town i ask myself do he propose to leave that priceless cabinet in this dingy quarter and then i pause abruptly and slip into a area-way for the van have stop some distance ahead and be back up to the curb look out discreetly i see the cab contain armand stop also and that gentleman alight and pay the driver the other cab rattle on at a good pace and disappear up the avenue then the two porter lift out the cabinet and with armand show they the way carry it into the building before which the van have stop they be go perhaps five minute from which i argue that they be carry it upstairs then they reappear with armand accompany they he tip they and go out also to tip the driver of the van then the porter climb aboard and it rattle away out of sight armand stand for a moment on the step look up and down the avenue then disappear indoors a instant later i see godfrey and another man whom i recognize as simmond come out of a shop across the street and dash over to the house into which the cabinet have be take they be stand on the door-step when i join they it be a dingy building entirely typical of the dingy neighborhood the ground floor be occupy by a laundry which the sign on the front window declare to be french and the room which the window light extend the whole width of the building except for a door which open presumably on the stairway lead to the upper story godfrey 's face be flame with excitement as he turn the knob of this door gently -- gently the door be lock he stoop and apply a eye to the key-hole the key be in the lock he whisper simmond take from he pocket a pair of slender pliers and pass they over godfrey look up and down the street see that for the moment there be no one near insert the pliers in the key-hole grasp the end of the key and turn it slowly now he say softly open the door and slip inside i follow and simmond come after I like a shadow close the door carefully behind he then we all stop and my heart at least be in my mouth for from somewhere overhead come the sound of a man 's voice talk excitedly even in the semi-darkness i could see the look of astonishment and alarm on godfrey 's face as he stand for a moment motionless listen to that voice i also stand with ear a-strain but i could make nothing of what it be say then suddenly i realize that it be speak in french and yet it be not armand 's voice -- of that i be certain front we be a narrow stair mount steeply to the story overhead and after that moment 's amaze hesitation godfrey sit down on the bottom step and remove he shoe motion we to do the same simmond obey phlegmatically but my hand be tremble so with excitement that i be in mortal terror lest i drop one of my shoe but i manage to get they both off without mishap and to set they softly on the floor at the stair-foot when at last i look up with a sigh of relief godfrey and simmond be steal slowly up the stair revolver in hand i follow they but i confess my knee be knock together for there be something weird and chill in that voice go on and on it sound like the voice of a madman there be something about it at once ferocious and triumphant godfrey pause a instant at the stairhead listen intently then he move cautiously forward toward a open door from which the voice seem to come motion we at the same time to stay where we be and as i knelt bath in perspiration i catch one word repeat over and over : _ revanche -- revanche -- revanche _ then the voice fall to a sort of low growl as of a dog which worry its prey and i catch a sound as of rip cloth godfrey on hand and knee be peer into the room then he draw back and motion we forward i shall never forget the sight which meet my eye as i peeped cautiously around the corner of the door the room into which i be look be light only by the ray which filter between the slat of a closed shutter in the middle of the floor stand the boule cabinet and before it with he back to the door stand a man rip savagely away the strip of burlap in which it have be wrap talk to himself the while in a sort of savage sing-song and pause from moment to moment to glance at a huddle bundle lie on the floor against the opposite wall for a time i could not make out what this bundle be then strain my eye i see that it be the body of a man wrap round and round in some web-like fabric and as i stare at he i catch the glitter of he eye as he watch the man work at the cabinet -- a glitter not to be mistake -- the same glitter which have so frightened I once before godfrey draw I back with a firm hand and take my place as for I i retreat to the stair and sit there feverishly mop my face and try to understand who be this man what be he do there against the wall what be the meaning of this ferocious scene then my heart leap into my throat for godfrey with a sharp cry of _ halte-là _ spring to he foot and dash into the room simmond at he heel i suppose two seconds elapse before i reach the threshold and i stop there stare clutch at the wall to steady myself that scene be so photograph upon my brain that i have only to close my eye to see it again in every detail there be the cabinet with its wrapping tear away but the figure on the floor have disappear and before a open doorway into another room stand a man a giant of a man he hand above he head he face work with fear and rage while godfrey he lip curl into a mock smile press a pistol against he breast then as i stand there stare it seem to I that there be a sort of flicker in the air above the man 's head and he scream shrilly _ la mort _ he shriek _ la mort _ for one dreadful instant longer he stand there motionless he hand still hold aloft he eye stare horribly then with a strangle cry he pitch forward heavily at godfrey 's foot chapter xx the escape i have a confused remembrance of godfrey stoop for a instant above the body stare at it and then with a sharp cry hurl himself through that open doorway a door slam somewhere there be a sound of run foot and before either simmond or myself understand what be happen godfrey be back in the room cross it at a bind and dash to the door open into the hall just as it be slam in he face i see he tear desperately at the knob then retreat two step and hurl himself against it but it hold firm and from the hall outside come a burst of mock laughter that fairly freeze my blood come here you fool cry godfrey between clenched tooth do not you see he be get away simmond be quicker than i and together they throw themselves at the door it crack ominously but still hold again they try and this time it split from top to bottom godfrey kick the piece to either side and slip between they simmond after he then in a sort of trance i stagger to it and after a moment 's aimless fumbling be out in the hall again i reach the stairhead in time to see godfrey try the front door and then turn along the lower hall lead to the back of the house a instant later a chorus of frenzied woman 's shriek make my hair stand on end how i get down the stair i do not know but i too turn back along the lower hall expect any instant to come upon i know not what horror i reach a open door pass through it and find myself in the laundry in the midst of a group of excited and indignant woman who greet my appearance with a fresh series of scream unable to go farther i sit limply down upon a box and look at they i dare say the figure i make be ridiculous enough for the scream give place to subdue giggle but i be far from thinking of my appearance or of care what impression i produce and i be still sit there when godfrey come back breathe heavily chagrin and anger in he eye the employe of the laundry conscious that something extraordinary be occur crowd about he but he elbow he way through they to the desk where the manager sit a crime have be commit upstairs he say this gentleman with I be mr simmond of the detective bureau and at the word simmond show he shield we shall have to notify headquarters godfrey go on and i would advise that you keep you girl at they work i do not suppose you want to be mix up in it sure not agree the manager promptly and while simmond go to the ` phone and call up police headquarters the manager dismount from he throne go down among the girl and have they back at they work in short order godfrey come over to I and lay he hand on my shoulder why lester he say you look as though you be at you last gasp i be i say i be go to have nervous prostration if this thing keep up you be not look particularly happy yourself i be not happy i have let that fellow kill a man right under my nose -- literally under my nose -- and then get away kill a man i repeat do you mean go upstairs and look at the right hand of the man lie there say godfrey curtly and you 'll see what i mean i sit stare at he unable to believe that i have hear aright unable to believe that godfrey have really utter those word the right hand of the man lie there that could mean only one thing simmond join we with a twisted smile on he lip and i see that even he be considerably shake i get grady he say and tell he what have happen he say he be too busy to come up and that i be to take charge of thing godfrey laugh a little mocking laugh grady foresee he waterloo he say well it be not far distant but i be glad for you sake simmond -- you be go to get some glory out of this thing yet i hope so and simmond 's eye gleam a instant the ambulance will be around at once he add we would better get we shoe on and go back upstairs and see if anything can be do for that fellow there can not anything be do for he say godfrey wearily but we would better have a look at he i guess and he lead the way out into the hall not until simmond speak do i remember that i be shoeless now i sit down beside godfrey get fumblingly into my shoe again and then follow he and simmond slowly up the stair i think i know what be pass in godfrey 's mind : he be blame himself for this latest tragedy he be tell himself that he should have foresee and prevent it he always blame himself in that way when thing go wrong -- and then to have the murderer slip through he very finger i could guess what a mighty shock that have be to he self-confidence the latest victim be lie where he have fall just inside the doorway lead into the inner room simmond step to the window throw open the shutter and let a flood of afternoon sunshine into the room then he kneel beside the body and hold up the limp right hand for we to see just above the knuckle be two tiny incision with a drop or two of blood ooze away from they and the flesh about they swollen and discolor i know what it be the instant he yell ' _ la mort _ ' say godfrey quietly and _ he _ know what it be the instant he feel the stroke it be evident enough that he have see it use before or hear of it and know that it mean instant death i sit down stare at the dead man and try to collect my sens so this fiendish criminal who slew with poison have be lurk in vantine 's house and have strike down first drouet and then the master of the house himself but why -- why it be incredible astounding my brain reel at the thought and yet it must be true i look again at the third victim and see a man roughly dress with bushy black hair and tangled beard a very giant of a man whose physical strength must have be enormous -- and yet it have avail he nothing against that tiny pin-prick on the hand and then a sudden thought bring I bolt upright but armand i cry where be armand godfrey look at I with a half-pitying smile what lester he say do not you understand even yet it be you fascinating m armand who do that and he point to the dead man i feel as though i have be strike a heavy blow upon the head black circle whirl before my eye go over to the window say godfrey peremptorily and get some fresh air mechanically i obeyed and stand cling to the window-sill gaze down at the busy street where the tide of humanity be flow up and down all unconscious of the tragedy which have be enact so close at hand and at last the calmness of all these people the sight of the world go quietly on as usual restore I a portion of my self-control but even yet i do not understand be it armand i ask turn back into the room who lay there in the corner certainly it be godfrey answer who else could it be godfrey i cry remember suddenly do you see he eye as he lay there watch the man at the cabinet yes i see they they be the same eye the same eye and the laugh -- do you hear that laugh certainly i hear it i hear it once before i say and you think it be a case of nerve i fall silent a moment shiver a little at the remembrance but why do armand lie there so quietly i ask at last be he injure godfrey make a little gesture toward the corner go see for yourself he say something lay along the wall on the spot where i have see that figure and as i bent over it i see that it be a large net finely mesh but very strong that be drop over armand 's head as he come up the stair say godfrey or fling over he as he come into the room then the dead man yonder jump upon he and truss he up with those rope push the net aside i saw upon the floor a little pile of sever cord yes i agree he would be able to do that have you notice he size godfrey he be almost a giant he could not have do it if armand have not be willing that he should retort godfrey curtly you see he have no difficulty in get away and he hold up the net and point to the great rent in it he cut he way out while he be lie there -- i ought to have know -- i ought to have know he be not bind -- that he be only wait -- but it be all so sudden he throw the net down upon the floor with a gesture of disgust and despair then he stop in front of the boule cabinet and look down at it musingly and after a moment he face brighten the burlap wrapping have be almost wholly tear away and the cabinet stand more insolently beautiful than ever it seem to I under the ray of the sun which sparkle and glitter and shimmer as they fall upon it but we 'll get he simmond say godfrey and he lip break into a smile in fact we have get he now we have only to wait and he 'll walk into we arm simmond i want you to lock this cabinet up in the strongest cell around at you station and carry the key yourself lock it up stammer simmond stare at he yes say godfrey lock it up that be we one salvation he face be glowing he be quite himself again alert confident of victory you be in charge of this case be not you well lock it up and give you reason to nobody that 'll be easy laugh simmond i have not get any reason oh yes you have and godfrey bent upon he a gaze that be positively hypnotic you will do it because i want you to and because i tell you that sooner or later if you keep this cabinet safe where no one can get at it the man we want will walk into we hand and i 'll tell you more than that simmond if we do get he i 'll have the biggest story i ever have and you will be world-famous france will make you a chevalier of the legion of honor simmond mark my word do not you think the ribbon would look well in you button-hole simmond be stare at the speaker as though he think he have suddenly go mad indeed the think flash through my own brain that the disappointment the chagrin of failure have be too much for godfrey he burst into laughter as he see we face no i be not mad he say more soberly and i be not joking i be speak in deadly earnest simmond when i say that this fellow be the biggest catch we could make he be the greatest criminal of modern time -- i repeat it lester this time without qualification and now perhaps you 'll agree with I and with armand so finish so self-poised so distinguished in my mind and the body of he latest victim before my eye i nod gloomily but who be he i ask do you know who he be godfrey there be the ambulance break in simmond as a knock come at the street door and he hurry down to open it come on lester and godfrey hook he arm through mine there be nothing more we can do here we 'll go down the back way i have have enough excitement for the time be -- have not you i certainly have i agree and he lead the way back along the hall to another stair down it and so out through the laundry but godfrey who be this man i repeat why do he kill that poor fellow up there why do he kill drouet and vantine how do he get into the vantine house what be it all about ah he say look at I with a smile that be the important question -- what be it all about but we can not discuss it here in the street besides i want to think it over lester and i want you to think it over if i can i 'll drop in to-night to see you and we can thresh it out will that suit you yes i say and for heaven 's sake do not fail to come chapter xxi godfrey weave a romance i have begin to fear that godfrey be go to disappoint I so late it be before he welcome knock come at my door that night i hasten to let he in and i could tell by the sigh of relief with which he sink into a chair that he be thoroughly weary it do I good to come in here occasionally and have a talk with you lester he say accept the cigar i offer he i find it restful after a hard day and he smile across at I good-humouredly how you keep it up i do not see i say this one case have nearly give I nervous prostration well i do not often strike one as strenuous as this and he settle back comfortably as a matter of fact i have not have one for a long time that even touch it there be nothing really mysterious about most crime this one be certainly mysterious enough i remark what make it mysterious godfrey explain be the apparent lack of motive as soon as one learn the motive for a crime one learn also who commit it but where the motive can not be discover it be mighty hard to make any progress it be not only lack of motive which make it mysterious i comment it be everything about it i can not understand either why it be do or how it be do when i get to think about it i feel as though i be wander around and around in a maze from which i can never escape oh yes you 'll escape lester say godfrey quietly and that before very long if you have a explanation godfrey i protest for heaven 's sake tell I do not keep I in the maze a instant longer than be necessary i have be think about it till my brain feel like a snarl of tangled thread do you mean to say you know what it be all about ` know ' be perhaps a little strong there be not much in this world that we really know suppose we say that i strongly suspect he pause a moment he eye on the ceiling you know you have accuse I of romance sometimes lester -- the other evening for instance yet that romance have come true i take it all back i say meekly there be another thing these talk do continue godfrey go off rather at a tangent and that be to clarify my idea you do not know how it help I to state my case to you and to try to answer you objection you be a lawyer make you unusually quick to see objection and a lawyer be always harder to convince of a thing than the ordinary man you be accustom to weigh evidence and so i never allow myself to be convince of a theory until i have convince you not always even then he add with a smile well i be glad i be of some use i say if it be only as a sort of file for you to sharpen you wit on so please go ahead and romance some more tell I first how you and simmond come to be follow armand simply because i have find out he be not armand felix armand be in pari at this moment you be too credulous lester why i never have any doubt of he be armand i stammer he know about my cablegram -- he know about the firm 's answer of course he do because you cable be never receive by the armand but by a confederate in this fellow 's employ and it be that confederate who answer it we friend the unknown foresaw of course that a cable would be send the armand as soon as the mistake be discover and he take he precaution accordingly then you still believe that the cabinet be send to vantine by design and not by accident absolutely it be send by the armand in good faith because they believe that it have be purchase by vantine -- all of which have be arrange very carefully by the great unknown tell I how you know all this godfrey i say why it be easy enough when you tell I yesterday of armand i know or think i know that it be a plant of some kind but in order to be sure i cabled we man at pari to investigate we man go at once to armand _ père _ and he learn a number of very interesting thing one be that the son félix armand be in paris another be that no member of the firm know anything about you cable or the answer to it a third be that have the cable be receive it would not have be understand because the armand ' book show that this cabinet be buy by philip vantine for the sum of fifteen thousand franc not this one i protest yes this one and it be cheap at the price of course the armand know nothing about the montespan story -- they be simply sell at a profit but i do not understand i stammer vantine tell I himself that he do not buy that cabinet nor do he but somebody buy it in he name and direct that it be send forward to he and pay fifteen thousand franc for it certainly -- and pay fifteen thousand franc to the armand rather a expensive present i say feebly for my brain be begin to whirl again oh it be not intend as a present the purchaser plan to reclaim it -- but vantine 's death throw he out if it have not be for that -- for a accident which no one could foresee -- everything would have go along smoothly and no one would ever have be the wiser but what be he object be he try to evade the duty oh nothing so small as that besides he would have have to refund the duty to vantine do he refund it to you no i say i do not think there be any to refund vantine really pay the duty only on the cabinet he purchase since that be the one show on he manifest the other fellow must have pay the duty on the cabinet he bring in so i do not see that there be anything come to vantine 's estate there be probably something due the government for the cabinet vantine bring in be of course much more valuable than he manifest show no doubt of that and the other cabinet be the one which vantine really purchase it be of course send forward to this other fellow 's address here in new york he plan be evident enough -- to call upon vantine as the representative of the armand or perhaps as the owner of the montespan cabinet and make the exchange vantine 's death spoil that and he have to make the exchange through you even then he would have be able to pull it off but for the fact that vantine 's death and that of drouet have call we attention to the cabinet we follow he and the incident of this afternoon ensue and he accomplish all this by means of a confederate in the employ of the armand no doubt of it the clerk who make the suppose sale to vantine and get a commission on it resign suddenly two day ago -- just as soon as he have intercept you cable and answer it the pari police be look for he but i doubt if they 'll find he i pause to think this over and then a sudden impatience seize I that be all clear enough i say the cabinet might have be exchange just as you say they be -- no doubt you be right -- but all that do not lead we anywhere why be they exchange what be there about that boule cabinet which make this unknown willing to do murder for it do he think those letter be still in it he know they be not in it now -- you tell he before that he know nothing about the letter if he have know of they he would have have they out before the cabinet be ship what be it then i demand and above all godfrey why should this fellow hide himself in vantine 's house and kill two man do they surprise he while he be work over the cabinet i see no reason to believe that he be ever inside the vantine house say godfrey quietly that be until you take he there yourself this afternoon but look here godfrey i protest that be nonsense he must have be in the house or he could not have kill vantine and drouet who say he kill they if he do not kill they who do godfrey take two or three contemplative puff while i sit there stare at he well godfrey answer at last now i be go to romance a little we will return to you fascinating friend armand as we may as well call he for the present he be a extraordinary man no doubt of it i agree i can only repeat what i have say before -- in my opinion he be the greatest criminal of modern time if he be a criminal at all he be undoubtedly a great one i concede but it be hard for I to believe that he be a criminal he be the most culture man i ever meet of course he be that be why he be so dangerous a ignorant criminal be never dangerous -- it be the ignorant criminal who fill the prison but look out for the educate accomplished one it take brain to be a great criminal lester and brain of a high order but why should a man with brain be a criminal i query if he can earn a honest living why should he be dishonest in the first place most criminal be criminal from choice not from necessity and with a culture man the incentive be usually the excitement of it have you ever think what a exciting game it be lester to defy society to break the law to know that the odds against you be a thousand to one and yet to come out triumphant and then i suppose every great criminal be a little insane no doubt of it i agree just as every absolutely honest man be a little insane go on godfrey quickly just as every great reformer and enthusiast be a little insane the sane man be the average one who be fairly honest and yet tell white lie on occasion who succumb to temptation now and then who temporise and compromise and try to lead a comfortable and quiet life i repeat lester that this fellow be a great criminal and that he find life infinitely more engrossing than either you or i i hope i shall meet he some time -- not in a little skirmish like this but in a out-and-out battle of course i would be route horse foot and dragoon -- but it certainly would be interesting and he look at I he eye glowing it certainly would i agree go ahead with you romance here it be this m armand be a great criminal and have of course various follower upon whom he must rely for the performance of certain detail since he can be in but one place at a time abject and absolute obedience be necessary to he success and he compel obedience in the only way in which it can be compel among criminal -- by fear for disobedience there be but one punishment -- death and the manner of the death be so certain and so mysterious as to be almost supernatural for deserter and traitor be find to have die inevitably and invariably from the effect of a insignificant wound on the right hand just above the knuckle i be listen intently now as you may well believe for i begin to see whither the romance be tend it be by this secret godfrey continue that armand preserve he absolute supremacy but occasionally the temptation be too great and one of he man desert armand send this cabinet to america he know that in this case the temptation be very great indeed he fear treachery and he arrange in the cabinet a mechanism which will inflict death upon the traitor in precisely the same way in which he himself inflict it -- by means of a poison stab in the right hand imagine the effect upon he gang he be nowhere near when the act of treachery be perform and yet the traitor die instantly and surely why it be a tremendous idea and it be carry out with absolute genius but i question what act of treachery be it that armand fear the opening of the secret drawer then you still believe in the poison mechanism i certainly do the tragedy of this afternoon prove the truth of the theory i do not see it i say helplessly why lester protest godfrey it be as plain as day who be that bearded giant who be kill the traitor of course we will find that he be a member of armand 's gang he follow armand to america lay in wait for he catch he in the net and bind he hand and foot do you suppose for a instant that armand be ignorant of he presence in that house do you suppose he would have be able to take armand prisoner if armand have not be willing that he should i do not see how armand could help himself after that fellow get he hand on he you do not and yet you see yourself that he be not really bind -- that he have cut himself loose that be true i say thoughtfully let we reconstruct the story godfrey go on rapidly the traitor discover the secret of the cabinet he follow armand to new york shadow he to the house on seventh avenue wait for he there and seize and bind he he be half mad with triumph -- he chant a crazy sing-song about revenge revenge revenge and in order that the triumph may be complete he do not kill he prisoner at once he roll he into a corner and proceed to rip away the burlap he triumph will be to open the secret drawer before armand 's eye and armand lie there in the corner he eye gleam because it be really the moment of _ he _ triumph which be at hand the moment of he triumph i repeat what do you mean by that godfrey i mean that the instant the traitor open the drawer he would be stab by the poison mechanism it be for that that armand wait i lay back in my chair with a gasp of amazement and admiration i have be blind not to see it armand have merely to lie still and permit the traitor to walk into the trap prepare for he no wonder he eye have glow as he lay there watch that frenzied figure at the cabinet it be not until the last moment godfrey go on when the traitor be bend above the cabinet feeling for the spring that i realize what be about to happen there be no time for hesitation -- i spring into the room armand vanish in a instant and the giant also try to escape but i catch he at the door i have no idea of he danger i have no thought that armand would dare linger and yet he do now that it be too late i understand he _ have _ to kill that man there be no two way about it whatever the risk he have to kill he but why i ask why to seal he lip if we have capture he do you suppose armand 's secret would have be safe for a instant so he have to kill he -- he have to kill he with the poison barb -- and he _ do _ kill he and get away into the bargain never in my life have i feel so like a fool as when that door be slam in my face perhaps he have that prepared too i suggest timidly ready to believe anything of this extraordinary man perhaps he know that we be there all the time of course he do assent godfrey grimly why else would there be a snap-lock on the outside of the door and to think i do not see it to think that i be fool enough to suppose that i could follow he about the street of new york without he know it he know from the first that he might be follow and prepare for it but it be incredible i protest feebly it be incredible nothing be incredible in connection with that man but the risk -- think of the risk he run what do he care for risk he despise they -- and rightly he get away do not he yes i say he get away there be no question of that i guess well that be the story of this afternoon 's tragedy as i understand it proceed godfrey more calmly and now i be go to leave you i want you to think it over if it do not hold together show I where it do not but it _ will _ hold together -- it _ have _ to -- because it be true but how about armand i protest be not you go to try to capture he be you go to let he get away he will not get away and godfrey 's eye be gleam again we do not have to search for he for we have get we trap lester and it be bait with a bait he can not resist -- the boule cabinet but he know it be a trap of course he know it and you really think he will walk into it i ask incredulously i know he will one of these day he will try to get that cabinet out of the steel cell at the twenty-third street station in which we have it lock i shake my head he be no such fool i say no man be such a fool as that he 'll give it up and go quietly back to paris not if he be the man i think he be say godfrey he hand on the door he will never give up just wait lester we shall know in a day or two which of we be a true prophet the only thing i be afraid of he add he face clouding be that he 'll get away with the cabinet in spite of we and he go away down the hall leave I stare after he chapter xxii crochard l'invincible it seem for once that godfrey be destine to be wrong for the day pass and nothing happen -- nothing that be in so far as the cabinet be concern there be a inquest of course over the victim of the latest tragedy and once again i be force to give my evidence before a coroner 's jury i must confess that this time it make I appear considerable of a fool and the papers poke sly fun at the attorney who have walk blindly into a trap which now that it be spring seem so apparent the bertillon measurement of the victim have be cable to pari and he have be instantly identify as a fellow name morel well-known to the police as a daring and desperate criminal in fact m lepine consider the matter so important that he cable next day that he be send inspector pigot to new york to investigate the affair further and to confer with we bureau as to the best method to be take to apprehend the murderer inspector pigot it be add would sail at once for havre on _ la savoie _ meanwhile grady 's man with simmond at they head strain every nerve to discover the whereabouts of the fugitive a net be throw over the entire city but while a number of fish be capture the one which the police particularly wish for be not among they not a single trace of the fugitive be discover he have vanish absolutely and after a day or two grady assert confidently that he have leave new york for grady have come back into the case again goad by the papers particularly by the _ record _ to effort which he must have consider superhuman the remarkable nature of the mystery its picturesque and unique feature the fact that three man have be kill within a few day in precisely the same manner and the absence of any reasonable hypothesis to explain these death -- all this serve to rivet public attention every amateur detective in the country have a theory to exploit -- and far-fetched enough most of they be grady do a lot of talk in those day explain in detail the remarkable measure he be take to capture the criminal but the fact remain that three man have be kill and that no one have be punish that a series of crime have be commit and that the criminal be still at large and seem likely to remain so and naturally enough the papers have exhaust every other phase of the case be soon echo public sentiment that something be wrong somewhere and that the detective bureau need a overhaul beginning at the top the boule cabinet remain lock up in a cell at the twenty-third street station and simmond keep the key in he pocket i know now that he be as much in the dark concern the cabinet as the general public be and the general public be very much in the dark indeed for the cabinet have not figure in the account of the first two tragedy at all and only incidentally in the report of the latest one as far as it be concern the affair seem clear enough to most of the reporter as a attempt to smuggle into the country a art object of great value such case be too common to attract especial attention but simmond have come to see that grady be totter on he throne he realize perhaps that he own head be not safe and he have make up he mind to pin he faith to godfrey as the only one at all likely to lead he out of the maze and godfrey lay the greatest stress upon the necessity of keep the cabinet under lock and key so under lock and key it be keep as for grady i do not believe that even at the last he realize the important part the cabinet have play in the drama but while the boule cabinet fail to focus the attention of the public and while most of the reporter promptly forget all about it i be amuse at the pain which godfrey take to inform the fugitive as to its whereabouts and as to how it be guard over and over again while the other papers wonder at he imbecility he tell how it have be place in the strongest cell at the twenty-third street station a cell whose bar be make of chrome-nickle steel which no saw could bite into a cell whose lock be work not only by a key but by a combination know to one man only a cell isolate from the other standing alone in the middle of the third corridor in full view of the officer on guard so that no one could approach it day or night without be instantly discover a cell whose door be connect with a automatic alarm over the sergeant 's desk in the front room a cell in short from which no man could possibly escape and which no man could possibly enter unobserved of the boule cabinet itself godfrey say little save he story for the dénouement which he seem so sure would come but the detail which i have give above be dwell upon in the _ record _ until happen to meet godfrey on the street one day i protest that he would only succeed in frightening the fugitive away altogether even if he still have any design on the cabinet which i very much doubt but godfrey only laugh there be not the slightest danger of frightening he away he say this fellow be not that kind if i be right in size he up he be the sort of dare-devil whom a insuperable difficulty only attract the harder the job the more he be draw to it that be the reason i be make this one just as hard as i can but a man would be a fool to attempt to get to that cabinet i protest it be simply impossible it look impossible i be free to admit he agree but just the same i wake every morning cold with fear and run to the ` phone to make sure the cabinet 's safe if i could think of any further safeguard i would certainly employ they i look at godfrey searchingly for it seem to I that he must be jest he smile as he catch my glance i be never more in earnest in my life lester he say you do not appreciate this fellow as i do he be a genius nothing be impossible to he he disdain easy job when he think a job be too easy he make it harder just as a sport chance he have be know to warn people that they keep they jewel too carelessly and then after they have put they in a safer place he would go and take they that seem rather foolish do not it i query not from he point of view he do not steal because he need money but because he need excitement you know who he be then i demand i think i do -- i hope i do but i be not go to tell even you till i be sure i 'll say this -- if he be who i think he be it would be a delight to match one 's brain with he we have not get any one like he over here -- which be a pity i be incline to doubt this for i have no romantic admiration for gentleman burglar even in fiction however picturesque and chivalric a thief be after all a thief perhaps it be my training as a lawyer or perhaps i be simply narrow but crime however brilliantly carry out seem to I a sordid and unlovely thing i know quite well that there be many people who look at these thing from a different angle godfrey be one of they i point out to he now that if he intuition be correct he would soon have a chance to match he wit with those of the great unknown yes he agree and i be scared to death -- i have be ever since i begin to suspect he identity i feel like a tyro go up against a master in a game of chess -- mate in six move i should not consider you exactly a tyro i say drily it be long odds that the great unknown will godfrey retorted and bid I good-bye except for that chance meeting i see nothing of he and in this i be disappoint for there be many thing about the whole affair which i do not understand in fact when i sit down of a evening and light my pipe and begin to think it over i find that i understand nothing at all godfrey 's theory hold together perfectly so far as i could see but it lead nowhere how have drouet and vantine be kill why have they be kill what be the secret of the cabinet in a word what be all this mystery about not one of these question could i answer and the solution i guess at seem so absurd that i dismiss they in disgust in the end i find that the affair be interfere with my work and i banish it from my mind turn my face resolutely away from it whenever it try to break into my thought but though i could shut it out of my waking hour successfully enough i could not control my sleep one and my dream become more and more horrible always there be the serpent with drip fang sometimes with armand 's head sometimes with a face unknown to I but hideous beyond description its slimy body glitter with inlay and arabesque its scaly leg be curve like those of the boule cabinet sometimes the golden sun glitter on its forehead like a great eye over and over again i see this monster slay its three victim and always when that be do it raise its head and glare at I as though select I for the fourth but i shall not try to describe those dream even yet i can not recall they without a shudder it be while i be sit moodily in my room one night debate whether or not to go to bed weary to exhaustion and yet reluctant to resign myself to a sleep from which i know i should wake shriek that a knock come at the door -- a knock i recognize and i arise joyfully to admit godfrey i could see by the way he eye be shine that he have something unusual to tell I and then as he look at I he face change what be the matter lester he demand you be look fag out work too hard it be not that i say i can not sleep this thing have upset my nerve godfrey i dream about it -- have regular nightmare he sit down opposite I concern and anxiety in he face that will not do he protest you must go away somewhere -- take a rest and a good long one a rest would not do I any good as long as this mystery be unsolved i say it be only by work that i can keep my mind off of it well he smile just to oblige you we will solve it first then do you mean you know i know who the great unknown be and i be go to tell you presently day after to-morrow -- Wednesday -- i 'll know all the rest the whole story will be in Thursday morning 's paper suppose you arrange to start Thursday afternoon i could only stare at he he smile as he meet my gaze you be look better already he say as though you be take a little more interest in life and he help himself to a cigar godfrey i protest i wish you would pick out somebody else to practice on you come up here and explode a bomb just to see how high i 'll jump it be amusing to you no doubt and perhaps a little instructive but my nerve will not stand it my dear lester he break in that be not a bomb that be a simple statement of fact be you serious perfectly so but how do you know before i answer any question i want to ask you one do you by any chance mention I to the gentleman know to you as m félix armand yes i answer after a moment 's thought i believe i do i be tell he about we try to find the secret drawer -- i mention you name -- and he ask who you be i tell he you be a genius at solve mystery godfrey nod that he say explain the one thing i do not understand now go ahead with you question you say a while ago that you would know all about this affair day after to-morrow yes how do you know you will because i have receive a letter which set the date and he take from he pocket a sheet of paper and hand it over to I read it the letter be write in pencil in a delicate and somewhat feminine hand on a sheet of plain unruled paper with a astonishment which increase with every word i read this extraordinary epistle : -- _ my dear mr godfrey : _ i have be highly flatter by you interest in the affaire of the cabinet boule and admire most deeply you penetration in arrive at a conclusion so nearly correct regard it i must thank you also for you kindness in keep I inform of the measure which have be take to guard the cabinet and which seem to I very complete and well think out i have myself visit the station and inspect the cell and i find that in every detail you be correct it be because i so esteem you as a adversary that i tell you in confidence that it be my intention to regain possession of my property on Wednesday next and that have do so i shall beg you to accept a small souvenir of the occasion i be my dear sir most cordially yours jacque crochard l'invincible i look up to find godfrey regard I with a quizzical smile of course it be a joke i say then i look at he again surely godfrey you do not believe this be genuine perhaps we can prove it he say quietly that be one reason i come up do not armand leave a note for you the day he fail to see you yes on he card i have it here and with tremble finger i get out my pocket-book and draw the card from the compartment in which i have carefully preserve it one glance at it be enough the pencil line on the back be unquestionably write by the same hand which write the letter and now you know he name godfrey add tap the signature with he finger i have be certain from the first that it be he i gaze at the signature without answer i have of course read in the papers many time of the gargantuan exploit of crochard -- the invincible as he love to call himself and with good reason but he achievement at least as the papers describe they seem too fantastic to be true i have suspect more than once that he be merely a figment of the parisian space-writer a sort of reserve for the dull season or else that he be a kind of scape-goat saddle by the french police with every crime which prove too much for they now however it seem that crochard really exist i hold he letter in my hand i have even talk with he -- and as i remember the fascination the finish the distinguished culture of m félix armand i understand something of the reason of he extraordinary reputation there can be no two opinion about he say godfrey reach out he hand for the letter and sink back in he chair to contemplate it crochard be one of the greatest criminal who ever live full of imagination and resource and with a sense of humor most acute i have follow he career for year -- it be this fact that give I my first clue he kill a man once before just as he kill this last one the man have betray he to the police he be never betray again what a fiend he must be i say with a shudder but godfrey shake he head quickly do not get that idea of he he protest earnestly up to the time of he arrival in new york he have never kill any man except that traitor he he have a certain right to kill -- accord to thief ' ethic anyway he own life have be in peril score of time but he have never kill a man to save himself put that down to he credit but drouet and vantine i object a accident for which he be in no way responsible say godfrey promptly you mean he do not kill they most certainly not this last man he do kill be a traitor like the first crochard i think reason like this to kill a adversary be too easy it be too brutal it lack finesse besides it remove the adversary and without adversary crochard 's life would be of no interest to he after he have kill he last adversary he would have to kill himself i can not understand a man like that i say well look at this say godfrey and tap the letter again he honor I by consider I a adversary do he seek to remove I on the contrary he give I a handicap he take off he queen in order that it may be a little more difficult to mate I but surely godfrey i protest you do not take that letter seriously if he write it at all he write it merely to throw you off the track if he say Wednesday he really intend to try for the cabinet to-morrow i do not think so i tell you he would think I only a tyro and beside he that be all i be do you know where he write that letter lester right in the _ record _ office that be a sheet of we copy paper he sit down there right under my nose write that letter drop it into my box and walk out and all that sometime this evening when the office be crowd but it be absurd for he to write a letter like that if he really mean it you have only to warn the police you 'll notice he say it be in confidence and you be go to keep it so certainly i be i consider that he have pay I a high compliment i have show it to no one but you -- also in confidence it be not the sort of confidence the law recognize i point out to keep a confidence like that be practically to abet a felony and yet you will keep it say godfrey cheerfully you see i be go to do everything i can to prevent that felony and we will see if crochard be really invincible i 'll keep it i agree because i think the letter be just a blind and by the way i add i have a letter from armand & son confirm the fact that they book show that the boule cabinet be buy by philip vantine under the circumstance i shall have to claim it and hand it over to the metropolitan i hope you will not disturb it until after Wednesday say godfrey quickly i will not have any interest in it after that you really think crochard will try for it Wednesday i really do i shrug my shoulder what be the use of argue with a man like that till after Wednesday then i agree and godfrey have verify he letter and secure from I the two promise he be after bid I good-night chapter xxiii we meet m pigot i be just get ready to leave the office the next afternoon when godfrey call I up how be you feel to-day lester he ask not as fit as i might i say have you arrange to start on that vacation Thursday i do not think that be a good joke godfrey it be not a joke at all i want you to arrange it but meanwhile how would you like a whiff of salt air this evening first rate how will i get it the _ savoie _ will get to quarantine about six o'clock i be go down on we boat to meet she i want to have a talk with inspector pigot -- the french detective will you come along will i i say where shall i meet you at the foot of liberty street at five o'clock i 'll be there i promise and i be the boat be cast loose as soon as we get aboard back out into the busy river she whistle shriek shrilly then swing about and head down stream it be a fast boat -- the _ record _ which pride itself on outdistance its contemporary in other direction would of course try to do so in this -- and when she get fairly into she stride with she engine throb rhythmically the shore on either hand slip past we rapidly the new york sky-line as see from the river be one of the wonder of the world and i stand look at it until we swing out into the bay there be two other man on board -- the regular ship reporter i suppose -- and godfrey have go into the cabin with they to talk over some detail of the evening 's work so i go forward to the bow where i would get the full benefit of the salt breeze with the taste of it on my lip the statue of liberty be just ahead and already the great search-light in she torch be wink across the water craft innumerable cross and re-cross they light reflect in the wave and far ahead a little to the left i could see the white glow against the sky which mark the position of coney island godfrey join I presently and we stand for some time look at this scene in silence it be a great sight be not it he say at last hello look at that boat he add as a yacht come down the bay draw abreast of we and then slowly forge ahead she can go some can not she this boat of ours be no slouch you know but just look how that one walk away from we i wonder who she be what boat be that captain he call to the man on the bridge do not know sir answer the captain after a look through he glass private yacht -- can not make out she name -- there be a flag or something hanging over the stern she be fly the french flag there come the other press boat behind we sir he add and there be the _ savoie _ just slow down at quarantine far ahead we could see the great hull of the liner dark against the horizon and crown with row upon row of glowing light one do not appreciate how big those boat be until one see they from the water i remark be not she immense and yet she be not a especially big boat either say godfrey to swing in under the really big one -- like the _ olympic _ -- be a experience to remember the _ savoie _ have by this time slow down until she be just hold she own against the tide and one of she lower port swing open a moment later a boat puff up beside she make fast and three or four man clamber aboard and disappear through the port there go the doctor say godfrey and there be that french boat go alongside the tug from quarantine drop astern and the french yacht take she place after a short colloquy one man from she be help aboard the _ savoie _ then it be we turn and after what seem to I a tremendous swishing and swirl at imminent risk of collision we swing up to the open port a line be fling out and make fast and a moment later godfrey and i and the other two man be aboard the liner my companion exchange greeting with the officer in charge of the open port and then we hurry forward along a narrow corridor smell of rubber and heated metal then up stair after stair until at last we come to the main companionway here the two man leave we to seek certain distinguished passenger i suppose whose view upon the question of the day be -lrb- presumably -rrb- anxiously await by a expectant public godfrey stop in front of the purser 's office and pass he card through the little window to the man inside the cage i should like to see m pigot of the paris _ service du sûreté _ he say perhaps you will be so kind as to have a steward take my card to he that be unnecessary sir reply the purser courteously that be m pigot yonder -- the gentleman with the white hair with he back to we you will have to wait for a moment however the gentleman speaking with he be from the french consulate and have but this moment come aboard i could not see inspector pigot 's face but i could see that he hold himself very erect in a manner bespeak military training the messenger from the legation be a youngish man with wax moustache and wear a eyeglass he be greet m pigot at the moment and after a word or two produce from a inside pocket a official-looking envelope tie with red tape and secure with a immense red seal m pigot look at it a instant while he companion add a sentence in he ear then with a nod of assent the detective turn down one of the passage-way the other man at he heel official business no doubt comment the purser who have also be watch this little scene m pigot be one of the best of we officer and you will find it a pleasure to talk with he he will no doubt soon be disengage yes but meanwhile my esteemed contemporary will arrive say godfrey with a grimace they be on my heel -- here they be now in fact for the next twenty minute reporter from the other papers keep arrive till there be quite a crowd before the purser 's office and from nearly every paper a special man have be detail to interview m pigot evidently all the papers be alive to the importance of the subject there be some good-natured chaffing and then one of the steward be bribe to carry the card of the assemble multitude to m pigot 's stateroom with the request for a audience the steward go away laughing and come back presently to say that m pigot would be please to see we in a few minute but when five minute more pass and he do not appear impatience break out anew the lord of the press be not accustom to be keep wait i move we storm he castle suggest the _ world _ man and just then m pigot himself step out into the companionway in a instant he be surround my good friend of the press he say speak slowly but with only the faintest accent and he smile around at the face bent upon he you will pardon I for keep you in wait but i have some matter of the first importance to attend to and also my bag to pack steward he add you will find my bag outside my door please bring it here so that i may be ready to go ashore at once the steward hurry away and m pigot turn back to we now gentleman he go on what be it that i can do for you it be to godfrey that the position of spokesman naturally fall we wish first to welcome you to america m pigot he say and to hope that you will have a pleasant and interesting stay in we country you be most kind respond the frenchman with a charming smile i be sure that i shall find it most interesting -- especially you wonderful city of which i have hear many marvellous thing and in the next place continue godfrey we hope that with you assistance we police may be able to solve the mystery surround the death of the three man recently kill here and to arrest the murderer of themselves they seem to be able to do nothing m pigot spread out he hand with a little deprecating gesture i also hope we may be successful he say but if you police have not be my poor help will be of little account i have a profound admiration for you police the result which they accomplish be wonderful when one consider the difficulty under which they labor he speak with a accent so sincere that i be almost convinced he mean every word of it but godfrey only smile it be a proverb he say that the french police be the best in the world you no doubt have a theory in regard to the death of these man i fear it be impossible sir say m pigot regretfully to answer that question at present or to discuss this case with you i have my report first to make to the chief of you detective bureau to-morrow i shall be most happy to tell you all that i can but for to-night my lip be close sad as it make I to seem discourteous i could hear behind I the little indrawn breath of disappointment at the failure of the direct attack m pigot 's position be of course absolutely correct but nevertheless godfrey prepare to attack it on the flank you be go ashore to-night he inquire i be expect a representative of you bureau to meet I here m pigot explain i be hope to return with he to the city i have no time to lose in addition the more quickly we get to work the more likely we shall be to succeed ah perhaps that be he he add as a voice be hear inquire loudly for moosseer piggott i recognize that voice and so do godfrey and i see the cloud of disappointment which fall upon he face a instant later grady with simmond in he wake elbow he way through the group moosseer piggott he cry and envelop the frenchman 's slender hand in he great paw and give it a squeeze which be no doubt painful glad to see you sir welcome to we city as we say over here in america i certainly hope you can speak english for i do not know a word of you lingo i be commissioner grady in charge of the detective bureau and this be simmond one of my man m pigot 's perfect suavity be not even ruffle i be most pleased to meet you sir and you monsieur simmòn he say yes -- i speak english -- though as you see with some difficulty these reporter bother you life out i see and grady glance about the group scowl as he eye meet godfrey 's now you boy might as well fade away you will not get anything out of either of we to-night -- eh moosseer piggott i have but just tell they that my first report must be make to you sir assent pigot then let 's go somewhere and have a drink suggest grady i be hope say m pigot gently that we might go ashore at once i have my papers ready for you all right agreed grady and after i have look over you papers i 'll show you broadway and i 'll bet you agree with I that it beat anything in gay paree we boat 's wait and we can start right away this you bag yes bring it along simmond and grady start for the stair but the attentive steward get ahead of simmond m pigot turn to we with a little smile till to-morrow gentleman he say i shall be at the hotel astor and shall be glad to see you -- shall we say at eleven o'clock i be truly sorry that i can tell you nothing to-night he shake hand with the purser wave he hand to we and join grady who be watch these amenity with evident impatience together they disappear down the stair a contrast in manners be it not gentleman ask godfrey look about he do not you blush for america the man laugh for they know he be after grady and yet it be evident enough that they agree with he come on lester he add we might as well be get back i can send the boat down again after the other boy and he turn down the stair chapter xxiv the secret of the cabinet godfrey bid I good-bye at the dock and hasten away to the office to write he story which i could guess would be concern with the manners of american especially with grady 's as for I that whiff of salt air have put a unaccustomed edge to my appetite and i take a cab to murray 's decide to spend the remainder of the evening there over a good dinner except in a certain mood murray 's do not appeal to I the pseudo-grecian temple in the corner with water cascade down its step the make-believe cloud which float across the ceiling the table of glass light from beneath -- all this ordinarily seem trivial and banal but occasionally in a esoteric mood i like murray 's and can even find something picturesque and romantic in bright gown and gleam shoulder and handsome face see amid these bizarre surroundings and then of course there be always the cooking which leave nothing to be desire i be in the right mood to-night for the enjoyment of the place and i amble through the dinner in a fashion so leisurely and trifle so long over coffee and cigarette that it be far past ten o'clock when i come out again into forty-second street after a instant 's hesitation i decide to walk home and turn back toward broadway already fill with the after-theatre crowd often as i have see it broadway at night be still a fascinating place to I with its blaze sign its change crowd its clanging street traffic its bright shop-window grady be right in say that gay paree have nothing like it nor have any other city that i know it be indeed unique and thoroughly american and i walk along it that night in the most leisurely fashion savor it to the full pause now and then for a glance at a shop-window and stop at the hoffman house -- now denude alas of its bouguereau -- to replenish my supply of cigarette reach madison square at last i walk out under the tree as i almost always do to have a look at the flatiron building white against the sky then i glance up at the metropolitan tower higher but far less romantic in appearance and saw by the big illuminated clock that it be nearly half-past eleven i cross back over broadway at last and turn down twenty-third street in the direction of the marathon when just at the corner i come face to face with three man as they swing around the corner in the same direction and with a little start i recognize grady and simmond with m pigot between they evidently grady have feel it incumbent upon himself to make good he promise in the most liberal manner and to display the wonder of the great white way from end to end -- the ceremony no doubt involve the introduction of the stranger to a number of typical american drink -- and the result of all this be that grady 's leg wobble perceptibly as a matter of racial comparison i glance at m pigot 's but they seem in every way normal hello lester say simmond in a voice which show that he have not wholly escape the influence of the evening 's celebration and even grady condescend to nod from which i infer that he be feel very unusually happy hello simmond i answer and as i turn westward with they he drop back and fall into step beside I piggott be certainly a wonder he say a regular sport -- want to see everything and taste everything he say paris be not in the same class with this town where be you go now i ask we be go round to the station piggott say he be get a sensation up he sleeve for we -- it be get something to do with that cabinet with the cabinet yes -- that shiny thing godfrey get I to lock up in a cell simmond i say seriously do godfrey know about this no say simmond look a little uncomfortable i tell grady we ought to ` phone he to come up but the chief get mad and tell I to mind my own business godfrey 's be after he you know for a long time suppose i ` phone he i suggest there would be no objection to that would there _ i _ will not object say simmond and i do not know who else will since nobody else will know about it all right and drag out the preliminary as long as you can to give he a chance to get up here simmond nodded i 'll do what i can he agree but i do not see what good it will do the chief will not let he in even if he do come up we 'll have to leave that to godfrey but he ought to be tell he be responsible for the cabinet be where it be i know he be and piggott say it be a mighty wise thing to put it there though i be bless if i know why hurry godfrey along as much as you can good-night and he follow he companion into the station there be a drugstore at the corner with a public telephone station and two minute later i be ask to be connect with the city-room at the _ record _ office no say a supercilious voice mr godfrey be not there he have leave some time before no the speaker do not know where he be go nor when he would be back look here i say this be important i want to talk to the city editor -- and be quick about it there be a instant 's astonished silence what name ask the voice lester of royce and lester -- and you might tell you city editor that godfrey be a close friend of mine the city editor seem to understand for i be switch on to he a moment later but he be scarcely more satisfactory we send godfrey up into westchester to see a man he say on a tip that look pretty good he start just as soon as he get he pigot story write and he ought to be back almost any time be there a message i can give he yes -- tell he pigot be at the twenty-third street station and that he would better come up as soon as he can very good i 'll give he the message the moment he come in thank you i say but the disappointment be a bitter one in the street again i pause hesitatingly at the curb my eye on the red light of the police station what be about to happen there what be the sensation m pigot have up he sleeve have i any excuse for be present and then remember grady 's nod and he wobbly leg -- remember too that at the worst he could only put I out -- i turn toward the light push open the door and enter there be no one in sight except the sergeant at the desk my name be lester i say you have a cabinet here belong to the estate of the late philip vantine we have get a cabinet all right but i do not know who it belong to it belong to mr vantine 's estate well what about it he ask look at I to see if i be drunk you have not come in here at midnight to tell I that i hope no but i would like to see the cabinet a minute you can not see it to-night come around to-morrow besides i do not know you here be my card either mr simmond or mr grady would know I and to-morrow will not do the sergeant take the card look at it and look at I wait a minute he say at last and disappear through a door at the farther side of the room he be go three or four minute and the station-clock strike twelve as i stand there i count the sonorous deliberate stroke and then in the silence that follow my hand begin to tremble with the suspense suppose grady should refuse to see I but at last the sergeant come back come along he say open the gate in the railing and motion I through straight on through that door he add and sit down again at he desk with a desperate effort at careless unconcern i open the door and pass through then involuntarily i stop for there in the middle of the floor be the boule cabinet with m pigot standing beside it and grady and simmond sit opposite flung carelessly back in they chair and puff at black cigar they all look at I as i enter pigot with a evident contraction of the brow which show how strongly he urbanity be strain simmond with a affectation of surprise and grady with a bland and somewhat vacant smile my heart rise when i see that smile well mr lester he say so you want to see this cabinet yes i answer it really belong to the vantine estate you know i be go to put in a claim for it -- that be if you be not willing to surrender it without contest do you just happen to think of this in the middle of the night he inquire quizzically no i say boldly but i see you and mr simmond and this gentleman -- with a bow to m pigot -- turn in here a moment ago and it occur to I that the cabinet might have something to do with you visit of course we do not want the cabinet injure it be very valuable do not worry say grady easily we be not go to injure it and i think we 'll be ready to surrender it to you at any time after to-night moosseer piggott here want to do a few trick with it first i suppose you have a certain right to be present -- so if you like sleight-of-hand sit down i hastily seek a chair my heart singing within I then i attempt to assume a mask of indifference for m pigot be obviously annoy at my presence and i fear for a moment that he gallic suavity would be strain to break but grady if he notice he guest 's annoyance pay no heed to it and i begin to suspect that the frenchman 's courtesy and good-breeding have end by rub grady the wrong way they be in such painful contrast to he own hob-nailed manners whatever the cause there be a certain malice in the smile he turn upon the frenchman and now moosseer piggott he say settle back in he chair a little farther we be ready for the show what i have to tell you sir begin m pigot in a voice as hard as steel and cold as ice have understand well to be tell in confidence it must remain between ourselves until the criminal be secure grady 's smile harden a little perhaps he do not like the imperative at any rate he ignore the hint understand mr lester he ask look at I and i nodded i saw pigot 's eye flame and he face flush with anger for grady 's tone be almost insulting for a instant i think that he would refuse to proceed but he control himself stand there face I in the full light it be possible for I to examine he much more closely than have be possible on board the boat and i look at he with interest he be typically french -- smooth-shaven with a face seam with little wrinkle and very white eye shadow by enormously bushy lash and close-cropped hair as white as he face but what attract I most be the mouth -- a mouth at once delicate and humourous a little large and with the lip full enough to betoken vigor yet not too full for fineness he be about sixty year of age i guess and there be about he the air of a man who have pass through a hundred remarkable experience without once lose he aplomb certainly he be not go to lose it now the story which i have to relate he begin in he careful english clipping he word a little now and then have to do with the theft of the famous michaelovitch diamond you may perhaps remember the case i remember it certainly for the robbery have be conceive and carry out with such brilliancy and daring that its detail have at once arrest my attention -- to say nothing of the fact that the diamond which form the celebrated collection belong to the grand duke michael of russium -- sojourn in pari because unappreciated in he native land and also because of the supreme attraction of the french capital to one of he temperament -- be value at something like eight million franc that theft continue m pigot be accomplish in a manner at once so bold and so unique that we be certain it could be the work of but a single man -- a rascal name crochard who call himself also ` the invincible ' -- a rascal who have give we very great trouble but whom we have never be able to convict in this case we have against he no direct evidence we subject he to a interrogation and find that he have take care to provide a perfect alibi so we be compel to release he we know that it would be quite useless to arrest he unless we should find some of the steal jewel in he possession he appear as usual upon the boulevard at the cafés everywhere he laugh in we face for we it be not pleasant but we law be strict for we to accuse a man to arrest he and then to be compel to own ourselves mistaken be a very serious matter but we do what we could we keep crochard under constant surveillance we search he room and those of he mistress not once but many time on one occasion when he pass the barrier at vincenne we agent fall upon he and search he under pretence of rob he he be understand well not for a instant deceive he know thoroughly what we be do for what we be search he know also that nowhere in europe would he dare to attempt to sell a single one of those jewel we suspect that he would attempt to bring they to this country and we warn you department of custom for we know that here he could sell all but the very largest not only almost without danger but at a price far greater than he could obtain for they in europe we close every avenue to he as we think -- and then all at once he disappear for two week we hear nothing -- then come the story of this man drouet kill by a stab on the hand at once we recognize the work of crochard for he alone of live man possess the secret of the poison of the medicus it be a fearful secret which in he whole life he have use but once -- and that upon a man who have betray he m pigot pause and pass he hand across he forehead we be at a loss to understand crochard 's connection with drouet m pigot continue drouet while a mere hanger-on of the cafés of the boulevard be not a criminal then come the death of that creature morel in a effort to gain possession of this cabinet and we begin to understand we make inquiry concern the cabinet we learn its history and the secret of its construction and we arrive at a certain conclusion it be to ascertain if that conclusion be correct that i come to america what be the conclusion query grady who have listen to all this with a manifest impatience in strong contrast to my own absorb interest for i have already guess what the conclusion be and my pulse be bound with excitement we theory reply m pigot without the slightest acceleration of speech be that the michaelovitch diamond be conceal in this cabinet everything point to it -- and we shall soon see as he speak he draw from he pocket a steel gauntlet marvellously like the one godfrey have use and slip it over he right hand when one attempt to fathom the secret of _ l'invincible _ he say with a smile one must go armored already three man have pay with they life the penalty of they rashness three man repeat grady wonderingly three and pigot check they off upon he finger first the man who give he name as d'aurelle but who be really a blackmailer name drouet second m vantine the connoisseur and third the creature morel of these the only one that really matter be m vantine he death be most unfortunate and i be sure that crochard regret it exceedingly he might also regret my death but at any rate i have no wish to be the fourth not i and he adjust the gauntlet carefully one moment monsieur i say bursting in unable to remain longer silent this be all so wonderful -- so thrilling -- will you not tell we more for what be these three man search for the jewel monsieur be as familiar with the fact as i he answer in a sarcastic tone he know that drouet be kill while search for a packet of letter which would have compromise most seriously a great lady he know that m vantine be kill while endeavor to open the drawer after its secret have be reveal to he by the maid of that same great lady who be hope to get a reward for they morel meet death directly at the hand of crochard because he be a traitor and deserve it more and more fascinate i stare at he what secret be safe i ask myself from this astonishing man or be he merely piece together the whole story from such fragment as he know but even yet i stammer i do not understand we have open the secret drawer of the cabinet -- there be no poison how could it have kill drouet and mr vantine very simply say m pigot coldly death come to drouet and m vantine because the maid of madame la duchesse mistake she left hand for she right the drawer which contain the letter be at the left of the cabinet -- see and he press the series of spring catch the little handle and pull the drawer open you will notice that the letter be go for the drawer be open by madame la duchesse herself in the presence of m lestaire who very gallantly permit she to resume possession of they the drawer which drouet and m vantine open and here he voice become a little strident under the stress of great emotion be on the right side of the cabinet exactly opposite the other and open by a similar combination but there be one great difference about the first drawer there be nothing to harm any one the other be guard by the deadliest poison the world have ever know observe I gentleman impel by a excitement so intense as to be almost painful i have rise from my chair and draw near to he as he speak he bent above the desk and press three finger along the right edge there be a sharp click and a section of the inlay fall outward form a handle just as i have see it do on the other side of the desk m pigot hesitate a instant -- any man would have hesitate before that awful risk -- then catch the handle firmly with he armored hand he draw it quickly out there be a sharp clash as of steel on steel and the drawer stand open chapter xxv the michaelovitch diamond m pigot cool and imperturbable hold out to we with a little smile a hand which show not a quiver of emotion -- he gauntleted hand and i see that on the back of it be two tiny depression at the bottom of each depression lay a drop of bright red liquid -- blood-red i tell myself as i stare at it fascinate and what nerve of steel this man possess a sudden warmth of admiration for he glow within I that liquid gentleman he say in he smooth voice be the most powerful poison ever distil by man those two tiny drop would kill a score of people and kill they instantly its odour betray its origin -- and indeed the air be heavy with the scent of bitter almond -- but the poison ordinarily derive from that source be as nothing compare with this this poison be say to have be discover by rémy the remarkable man who bring about the death of the duc d'anjou its distillation be suppose to be one of the lose art but the secret be rediscover by this man crochard no secret indeed be safe from he criminal history criminal memoirs -- the mystery and achievement of the great confederacy of crime which have exist for many century and whose existence few person even suspect -- all this be to he a open book it be this which render he so formidable no man can stand against he even the secret of this drawer be know to he and he avail himself of it when need arise m pigot pause he head bent in thought and i seem to be gaze with he down long avenue of crime extend far into the past -- dismal avenue like those of père lachaise where tomb elbow each other where at every step one come face to face with a mystery a secret or a tragedy only here the mystery be all solve the secret all uncover the tragedy all understand but only to the elect to criminal really great be these avenue open to all other they be forbid alone of live man perhaps crochard be free to wander there unchallenged some such vision as this i say pass before my eye and i have a feeling that m pigot share in it but after a instant he turn back to the cabinet now m simmón he say briskly in a altered voice if you will have the kindness to hold the drawer for a moment in this position i will draw the serpent 's fang there be not the slightest danger he add see that simmond very naturally hesitate thus assure simmond grasp the handle of the drawer and hold it open while the frenchman take from he pocket a tiny flask of crystal a little farther he say and as simmond with evident effort draw the drawer out to its full length a tiny two-tined prong push itself forward from underneath the cabinet there be the fang say m pigot he hold the mouth of the flask under first one and then the other pass he other hand carefully behind and above they the poison be hold in place by what we in french call _ attraction capillaire _ -- i do not know the english but i drive it out by introduce the air behind it -- ah you see he stand erect and hold the flask up to the light it be half full of the red liquid enough to decimate france he say screw the stopper carefully into place and put the flask in he pocket release the drawer if you please monsieur he add to simmond it spring back into place on the instant the arabesque handle snap up with a little click you will observe its ingenuity say m pigot it be really most clever for whenever the hand strike by the poison fang loosen its hold on the drawer the drawer spring shut as you see and everything be as before -- except that one man more have taste death now i open it the fang fall again they strike the gauntlet but for that they would pierce the hand but death no longer follow by turn this button i lock the spring and the drawer remain open the man who devise this mechanism be so proud of it that he describe it in a secret memoir for the entertainment of the grand loui there be a copy of that memoir among the archive of the bibliothèque nationale the original be own by crochard it be he who connect that memoir with this cabinet who rediscover the mechanism rewind the spring and renew the poison no doubt the stroke with the poison fang which he use to punish traitor be the result of read that memoir this croshar -- or whatever he name be -- seem to be a ` strordinary feller observe grady relight he cigar he be agree m pigot quietly a most extraordinary man but even he be not infallible for since the memoir make no mention of the other secret drawer -- the one in which madame la duchesse conceal she love letter -- crochard know nothing of it it be that fact which defeat he combination -- a pure accident which he could not foresee and now gentleman it shall be my pleasure to display before you some very beautiful brilliant not until that instant have i thought of what the drawer contain i have be too fascinate by the poison fang and by the story tell so quietly but so effectively by the french detective but now i perceive that the drawer be fill with little roll of cotton which have be press into it quite tightly m pigot remove the first of these unrolled it and spread it out upon the desk and instantly we catch the glitter of diamond -- diamond so large so brilliant so faultlessly white that i draw a deep breath of admiration even m pigot evidently as he pride himself upon he imperturbability could not look upon those gem wholly unmoved a slow color creep into he cheek as he gaze down at they and he pick up one or two of the larger one to admire they more closely then he unfold roll after roll stop from time to time for a look at the larger brilliant these be from the famous necklace which the grand duke inherit from he grandmother he say call we attention to a little pile of marvellous gem in one of the last packet crochard of course remove they from they setting -- that be inevitable he could melt down the setting and sell the gold but not one of these brilliant would be marketable in europe for many year each of they be a marked gem here in america you police regulation be not so complete but i fancy that even here he would have have difficulty in marketing this one and he unfold the last packet and hold up to the light a rose-diamond which seem to I as large as a walnut and a-glow with lovely color perhaps you have stop to admire the mazarin diamond in the _ galérie d'apollon _ at the louvre say m pigot there be always a crowd about that case and a special attendant be install there to guard it for it contain some article of great value but the mazarin be not one of they for it be not a diamond at all it be paste -- a paste facsimile of which this be the original oh it be all quite honest he add as grady snort derisively some year ago the director of the louvre need a fund for the purchase of new painting need also to clean and restore the old one they decide that it be folly to keep three million of franc imprison in a single gem when they michael angelo and da vinci and murillo be encrust with dirt and fading daily so they seek a purchaser for the mazarin they find one in the empress of russium who have a craze for precious stone and who at she death leave this remarkable collection to she favorite son who have inherit she passion a paste replica of the mazarin be place in the louvre for the crowd to admire and every one soon forget that it be not really the diamond for myself i think the director act most wisely and now he add with a gesture toward the glitter heap what shall we do with all this there be only one thing to do say grady awake suddenly as from a trance and that be to get they in a safe-deposit box as quick as possible there be no police-safe i would trust with 'em why they would tempt the angel gabriel and he draw a deep breath can we find a box of safe-deposit at this hour of the night ask m pigot glance at he watch it be almost one o'clock and a half that be easy in new york say grady we 'll take 'em over to the day and night bank on fifth avenue it never close wait till i get something to put 'em in he go out and come back presently with a small valise this will do he say stow 'em away and i 'll call up the bank and arrange for the box simmond and pigot roll up the packet carefully and place they in the valise while i sit watch they in a kind of daze and i understand the temptation which would assail a man in the presence of so much beauty it be not the value of the jewel which shake and dazzle I -- i scarcely think of that it be they seductive brilliance it be the thought that if i possess they i might take they out at any hour of the day or night and run my finger through they and watch they shimmer and quiver in the light the grand duke michael must have be considerably upset remark simmond who throughout all this scene have lose no whit of he serenity of demeanor he have be like a madman say m pigot smile a little at simmond 's unemotional tone these jewel be a passion with he he worship they he never have part with they even for a day where he go they have go in he most desperate need of money -- and he have have such need many time -- he have never sell one of he brilliant on the contrary whenever he have money or credit and the opportunity come to purchase a stone of unusual beauty he can not resist even though he debt go unpaid since the loss of these stone he have rave he have curse he have beat he servant -- one of they have die in consequence we be all a little mad on some one subject i have hear it say well the grand duke michael be very mad on the subject of diamond why do not he offer a reward for they return query simmond oh he do say m pigot he offer immediately he whole fortune for they return but he fortune be not large enough to tempt crochard for the grand duke really have nothing but the income from he family estate and you may well believe that he spend all of it it will be a great joy to he that we have find they the thought flash through my mind that doubtless m pigot be in the way of receive a handsome present there they be say simmond and close the bag with a snap as grady come in again i have arrange for the box say grady and one of we wagon be at the door i think we would better not trust a taxi -- might turn over or run into something and we can not afford to take any chance -- not this trip simmond you go along with moosseer piggott and put a extra man on the seat with the driver maybe that croshar might try to hold you up the same thought be in my own mind for crochard must have learn of m pigot 's arrival and i could scarcely imagine that he would sit quietly by and permit the jewel to be take away from he -- to say nothing of he chagrin over he unfulfilled boast to godfrey so i be relieve that grady be wise enough to take no risk you would better get a receipt grady go on and arrange that the valise be to be deliver only when you and moosseer piggott appear together that will be satisfactory moosseer he add turn to the frenchman entirely so sir very well then i 'll see you in the morning i congratulate you on the find it be certainly great work i thank you sir reply m pigot gravely au revoir monsieur and with a bow to I he follow simmond into the outer room grady sit down and get out a fresh cigar well mr lester he say as he strike a match what do you think of these frenchman anyway they be marvellous i say even yet i can not understand how he know so much maybe he be just guess at some of it grady suggest i thought of that but i do not believe anybody could guess so accurately for instance how do he know about those letter fact be break in grady that be the first i would hear of 'em what _ be _ that story i tell he the story briefly carefully suppress everything which would give he a clue to the identity of the veil lady there be certain detail i add which i suppose be know to no one except myself and two other person -- and yet m pigot know they then again how do he know so certainly just how the mechanism work how do he know which roll of cotton contain that mazarin diamond you will remember he tell we what be in that roll before he open it grady smile good-naturedly and a little patronisingly that be the last roll be not it he demand since that big diamond have not show up in any of the other he know it have to be in that roll it be just one of the little play for effect they frenchy be so fond of perhaps you be right i agree but it seem to I that he handle that mechanism as though he be familiar with it of course he may have prepare himself by study the drawing which no doubt accompany the secret memoir he may even have have a work model make grady nod tolerantly they fellers go to a lot of trouble over little thing like that he say they like to slam they card down on the table with a big hurrah even when the card be not worth a damn he certainly hold trump this time anyway i comment and he play he hand superbly he be a extraordinary man and a great actor grady supplement they feller always behave like they be on the stage right in the spot-light it make I a little tired sometimes hello who be that the front door have be fling open there be a instant 's colloquy with the desk-sergeant then a rapid step cross the outer room and godfrey burst in upon we he cast a rapid glance at the boule cabinet at the secret drawer stand open empty and then he eye rest upon grady so he get away with it do he he inquire who in hell do you think you be shout grady he face purple come in here like this get out or i 'll have you throw out oh i 'll go retorted godfrey coolly i have see all i care to see only i 'll tell you one thing grady -- you have sign you own death-warrant to-night what do you mean by that grady demand in a lower tone i mean that you will not last a hour after the story of this night 's work get out grady 's color slowly fade as he meet the burning and contemptuous gaze godfrey turn upon he as for I a awful fear have grip my heart do you mean to say it be not piggott stammer grady at last godfrey laugh scornfully no you blither idiot he say it be not pigot it be crochard himself and he stalk out slam the door behind he chapter xxvi the fate of m pigot whatever may have be grady 's defect of insight and imagination he be energetic enough when thoroughly arouse almost before the echo of that slam door have die away he be beside the sergeant 's desk get out the reserve he order and have the other wagon around ` phone headquarters to rush every man available up to the day and night bank and say it be from I he stand chew he cigar savagely as the sergeant hasten to obey in a moment the reserve come tumble out struggle into they coat there be a clatter of hoof in the street as the wagon dash up the reserve pile into it permit I to crowd in beside they grady jump to the seat beside the driver and we be off at a gallop we gong wake the echo of the silent street i clung to the hand-rail as the wagon sway back and forth or bound into the air as it strike the car-track and stare out into the night struggle to understand could godfrey be right but of course he be right some intuition tell I that and yet how have crochard manage to substitute himself for the french detective where be pigot be he lie somewhere in a crumpled heap with a tiny wound upon he hand but that could not be -- grady and simmond have be with he all the evening and could that aged frenchman with the white fine wrinkled skin be also the bronze and virile personage whom i have know as félix armand my reason reel before the seeming impossibility of it -- and yet somehow i know that godfrey be right the wagon come to a stop so suddenly that i be throw violently against the man next to I and the reserve leap out sweep I before they we be in front of the day and night bank and at a word from grady the man spread into a close cordon before the building another police wagon stand at the curb with the driver still on the seat but as grady start toward it a figure appear at the door of the bank and shout to we -- shout in inarticulate word which i could not understand but grady seem to understand they and go up the step two at a time with a agility surprising in so large a man and which i be hard put to it to match a little group stand at one side of the vestibule look down at some one extend on a cushion seat and a instant later i see that it be simmond lie on he back he eye open and stare apparently at the ceiling but at the second glance i see that the eye be sightless grady elbow he way savagely through the group where 's kelly he demand at the word a white-faced man in uniform arise from a chair into which he have plainly drop exhaust oh there you be and grady glower at he ferociously now tell I what happen -- and tell it quick why sir stammer kelly there be not anything happen only when we stop out there at the curb and i get down and open the door there be not nobody in the wagon but mr simmond i speak to he and he do not answer -- and then i touch he and he kind of fell over -- and then i rush in here and ` phone the station but they say you would already start for the bank and then we go out and bring he in here -- and that be all i know sir you do not hear anything -- no sound of a struggle not a sound sir not a single sound and you have not any idea where the other man get out no sir mr simmond have a little valise with he -- do you notice it yes sir and i look for it in the wagon but it be not there grady turn away with a curse as four or five man run in from the street -- the man from headquarters i tell myself i could hear he talk to they in sharp low tone and then they depart as suddenly as they have come the reserve also hurry away and i conclude that grady be try to throw a net about the territory in which the fugitive be probably conceal but my interest in that maneuver be overshadow for the time be by my anxiety for simmond i pick up he right hand and look at it then i draw a deep breath of relief for it be uninjured have anyone send for a doctor i ask yes sir one of the bank attach answer we telephone for one at once -- here he be now he add as a little black-bearded man enter carry the inevitably-identifying medicine case the newcomer glance at the body wave we back fall on one knee strip away the clothing from the breast and apply he ear to the heart then he look into the stare eye draw down the lid watch they snap up again and then hastily open he case let 's have some water he say then he be not dead i question as one of the clerk spring to obey dead no but he be have a taste or whiff of something that have stop the heart action with a queer creepy feeling over my scalp i remember the little flask half-full of blood-red liquid which crochard carry in he pocket but he have not mean murder this time i remember that godfrey have say he never kill a adversary the doctor work briskly away and at the end of a few minute simmond 's eye suddenly close he draw a long breath and sit erect then he eye open and he sit sway unsteadily and stare amazedly about he best lie down again say the doctor soothingly you be a little wobbly yet you know where be i gasp simmond then he eye encounter mine lester he say where be he -- piggott not he stop short look once around at the gleaming marble of the bank fumble for something at he side and fall senseless on the seat i have no recollection of how i get back to the marathon i suppose i must have walk but my first distinct remembrance be of find myself sit in my favorite chair pipe in hand the pipe be light so i suppose i must have light it mechanically and i find that i have also mechanically change into my lounging-coat i glance at my watch and see that it be nearly four o'clock the top of my head be burn as though with fever and i go into the bathroom and turn the cold water on it the shock do I a world of good and by the time i have finish a vigorous toweling i feel immensely better so i return to my chair and sit down to review the event of the evening but i find that somehow my brain refuse to work and black circle begin to whirl before my eye again i tell godfrey i could not stand any more of this i muttered and stumble into my bedroom undress with difficulty and turn out the light then as i lay there stare up into the darkness a stinging thought bring I upright godfrey -- where be godfrey be he on the track of crochard be he daring a contest with he perhaps even at this moment scarcely know what i do i groped my way to the telephone and ask for godfrey 's number -- hope against hope absurdly -- and at last to my intense surprise and relief i hear he voice -- not a very amiable voice hello he say godfrey i begin it be lester he get away of course he get away you do not call I out of bed to tell I that i hope then you know about it i know he would get away when the wagon get to the bank there be nobody inside but simmond simmond go along you know be he hurt he be unconscious but he come around all right that be good -- but crochard would not hurt he he get away with the jewel of course of course i assent surprised that godfrey should take it so coolly when you rush out that way i add i think maybe you be go after he with he twenty minute in the lead i be no such fool he get away from I the other day with a start of about half a second i try to get you i explain as soon as simmond tell I they be go to look at the cabinet i ` phone the office the city editor say he have send you out into westchester godfrey laugh shortly it be a wild-goose chase he say cook up by we friend crochard but even then i would have get back if we have not puncture a tire when we be five mile from anywhere i know what be up -- but there i be oh he be make fool of we all lester i tell you he would then you do not get my message yes -- they give it to I when i ` phone in that the westchester business be a fake i rush for the station though i know i would be too late but godfrey i say i can not understand even yet how he do it grady and simmond leave the boat with pigot and be with he all evening show he the sight how do crochard get into it what do he do with pigot where _ be _ pigot he be on the _ savoie _ i rush a wireless down to she as soon as i leave the station they make a search and find pigot bind and gag under the berth in he stateroom i could only gasp and to think i do not suspect add godfrey bitterly we stand there and see that yacht with the french flag walk away from we we see she put a man aboard the _ savoie _ we see that man talk to pigot yes i say breathlessly yes well that man be crochard he get pigot into he stateroom -- give he a whiff of the same stuff he use on simmond no doubt put he out of the way under the berth get into he clothes make up he face _ put _ on a wig -- and all that while we be kick we heel outside wait for he but it be a tremendous risk i say there be so many people on board who know pigot -- it would have to be a perfect disguise crochard would not stop for that but it be not much of a risk none of we have see pigot closely all we have see of he be the back of he head and the passenger be all on deck watch the quarantine man and yet of course the disguise be a perfect one crochard be a artist in that line and he be no doubt thoroughly familiar with pigot 's appearance he deceive the purser -- but the purser would not suspect anything so it be really crochard but _ we _ ought to have suspect we ought to have suspect everything question everything i ought to have look up that visitor and find out what become of he instead of which crochard put pigot 's papers in he pocket set he bag outside the stateroom door and then come out calmly to meet he dear friend of the press and i stand there talk to he like a little schoolboy -- no wonder he think i be a fool but nobody would have suspect i gasp why that man be - be a genius say godfrey a absolute and unquestioned genius but i know that all the time and i ought to have be on guard you remember he say he would come to-day yes and you do not believe it i can not believe it yet there be one consolation -- it will break grady but godfrey i say if you could have see those diamond -- those beautiful diamond -- and to think he should be able to get away with they from right under we nose it be pretty bad be not it but there be no use cry over spilt milk lester he add in another tone i want you to be in you office at noon to-morrow -- or rather to-day all right i promise i 'll be there do not fail I there be one act of the comedy still to be play i 'll be there i say again but i be afraid the last act will be a anti-climax look here godfrey now go to bed he break in you be talk like a somnambulist get some sleep have you arrange for that vacation godfrey i say tell I i will not tell you anything only i have get one more bomb to explode lester and it be a big one it will make you jump i could hear he chuckle to himself good-night he say and hang up chapter xxvii the last act of the drama i overslept next morning so outrageously that it be not until i have get a seat in a subway express that i have time to open my paper my first glance be for the big head that would tell of the diamond robbery and then i realize that no morning paper would have a word of it for the robbery be only a few hour old -- and yet it seem to I a age have pass since that moment when godfrey have rush in upon grady and I so the city move on as yet blissfully unconscious of the sensation which would be spring with the first afternoon edition and over which reporter and artist and photographer be even now no doubt labor i promise myself a happy half hour in read godfrey 's story it be then that i remember the appointment for twelve o'clock the last act of the drama be yet to be stage godfrey have say and he have also speak of a bomb -- a big one i wonder what it could be one thing be certain : if godfrey have prepare it its explosion would be startling enough there be a number of thing at the office demand my attention and i be so late in get there and the morning pass so rapidly that when the office-boy come in and announce that mr grady and mr simmond be outside and wish to see I i do not for a moment connect they visit with godfrey then i look at my watch see that it be five minute to twelve and realize that the actor be assemble show they in i say and they enter together a minute later grady be evidently much perturb he usually florid face be draw and haggard he cheek hang in ugly line there be dark pouch under he eye and the eye themselves be blood-shot i guess that he have not be to bed that he have spend the night search for crochard -- and it be easy enough to see that the search have be unsuccessful simmond too be look rather shaky and no doubt still feel the after-effect of that whiff of poison i be glad to see you be better simmond i say shake hand with he that be a close call it certainly be simmond agree sink into a chair if i have get a little more of it i would never have wake up do you remember anything about it not a thing one minute we be sit there talk together as nice as you please -- and the next thing i know be when i wake up in the bank where 's that man godfrey break in grady he say he would be here at noon i say and glance at my watch it be noon now be you to meet he here grady glance at I suspiciously do not you know nothing about it he ask i only know that godfrey ask I to be here at noon to-day what be up blame if i know say grady sulkily i get word from he that i would better be here and i think maybe he might know something i be so dizzy over last night 's business that i be run around in circle this morning but i will not wait for he he can not make I do that come along simmond wait a minute i break in as the outer door open perhaps that be godfrey now and so it prove he come in accompany by a man whom i know to be arthur shearrow chief counsel for the _ record _ godfrey nod all around i think you know mr shearrow he say place on my desk a small leather bag he be carry this be mr lester mr shearrow he add and we shake hand the object of this conference lester he conclude be to straighten out certain matter connect with the michaelovitch diamond -- and incidentally to give the _ record _ the biggest scoop it have have for month i be not here to fix up no scoop for the _ record _ break in grady that paper never do treat I right it have treat you as well as you deserve retorted godfrey i be go to talk plainly to you grady you goose be cook you can not hold on for a hour after last night 's get-away become public we 'll see about that growl grady but the fight have evidently be take out of he i understand you would not let simmond telephone for I last night query godfrey that be right -- it be not none of you business perhaps not and yet if i have be there the cleverest thief in paris if not in the world would be safe behind those chrome-nickle steel bar at the twenty-third street station instead of at liberty to go ahead and rob somebody else you be mighty cocksure retorted grady it be easy to be wise after it be all over well i be not go to argue with you say godfrey i admit it be a good disguise and a clever idea -- but just the same you ought to have see through it that be you business grady mop he face oh of course he sneer i ought to have see through it i ought to have suspect even when i find you tryin ' to interview he even when i get he off the boat myself even when i go through he papers and find they all right -- yes even to the photograph on he passport that be plain enough now be not it if people only have as good foresight as they have hindsight how easy it would be look here grady say godfrey more kindly i have not anything against you personally and i admit that it be foolish of I to stand there talk to crochard and never suspect who he be but that be all beside the mark you be at the head of the detective bureau and you be the man who be responsible for all this you be energetic enough and all that but you be not fit for you job -- it be too big for you and you know it take my advice and go to the ` phone there and send in you resignation grady stare at he as though unable to believe he ear ` phone in my resignation he echo what kind of a fool do you think i be i see you be a bigger one than i think you be you pull can not help you any longer grady be it to tell I that you get I over here no say godfrey all this be just incidental -- you begin the discussion yourself do not you i get you here to meet the outer door open again and godfrey look toward it smile moosseer piggott announce the office-boy and then i almost bounce from my seat for i would have swear that the man who stand on the threshold be the man who have open the secret drawer he come forward look from face to face then he eye meet godfrey 's and he smile behold that i be here monsieur he say and i start anew at the voice for it be the voice of crochard i hope that i have not keep you wait not at all m pigot godfrey assure he and place a chair for he i could see grady and simmond grip the arm of they chair and stare at the newcomer they mouth open and i know the thought that be flash through they brain be this pigot or be the man who have open the cabinet pigot or be neither pigot be it possible that this could be a different man than the one who have open the cabinet i confess that some such thought flash through my own mind -- a suspicion that godfrey in some way be play with we godfrey look about at we smile as he see we expression i go down the bay this morning and meet the _ savoie _ he say i related to m pigot last night 's occurrence and beg he to be present at this meeting he be good enough to agree i assure you he add see grady 's look that this _ be _ m pigot of the paris _ service du sûreté _ and not crochard oh yes say m pigot with a deprecate shrug i be myself -- and greatly humiliate that i should have fall so readily into the trap which crochard set for I but he be a very clever man it be certainly a marvellous disguise i say it be more than that -- it be a impersonation crochard have have occasion to study I explain m pigot drily and he be a artist in whatever he do but some day i shall get he -- every pitcher to the well go once too often there be no hope of find he here in new york i be afraid not say godfrey do not be too sure of that break in grady ponderously i be not do yet -- not by no manner of means pardon I for not introduce you m pigot say godfrey this gentleman be mr grady who have be the head of we detective bureau this be mr simmond a member of he staff this be mr lester a attorney and friend of mine and this be mr shearrow my personal counsel mr grady mr simmond and mr lester be present last night he add blandly when crochard open the secret drawer grady redden visibly and even i feel my face grow hot m pigot look at we with a smile of amusement it must have be a most interesting experience he say to have see crochard at work i have never have that privilege but i regret that he should have make good he escape more especially since he take the michaelovitch diamond with he i add before we go into that say godfrey with a little smile there be one or two question i should like to ask you m pigot in order to clear up some minor detail which be as yet a little obscure be it true that the theft of the michaelovitch diamond be plan by crochard undoubtedly no other thief in france would be capable of it be it also true that no direct evidence could be find against he that also be true monsieur he have arrange the affair so cleverly that we be wholly unable to convict he unless we should find he with the steal brilliant in he possession and you be not able to do that no we could discover no trace of the brilliant though we search for they everywhere but you do not know of the boule cabinet and of the secret drawer no of that we know nothing i must examine that famous cabinet it be worth examine and it have a interesting history but you do know of course that crochard would seek a market for the diamond here in america we know that he would try to do so and we do everything in we power to prevent it we especially rely upon you custom department to search most thoroughly the belongings of every person with whom they be not personally acquaint the custom people do they part say godfrey with a chuckle they have quite upset the country but the diamond get in in spite of they for of course a cabinet import by a man so well know and so above suspicion as mr vantine be pass without question yes agree m pigot a little bitterly it be a most clever plan and now no doubt crochard can sell the brilliant at he leisure not if you have get a good description of they protest grady i 'll make it a point to warn every dealer in the country i 'll keep my whole force on the job i 'll get chief wilkie to lend I some of he man oh there be no use take all that trouble break in godfrey negligently crochard will not try to sell they will not try to sell they echo grady what be the reason he will not because he have not get they answer godfrey smile with a evidently deep enjoyment of grady 's dazed countenance oh come off say that worthy disgustedly if he have not get 'em i would like to know who have i have say godfrey and clear my desk with a sweep of he arm spread out you handkerchief lester and as i dazedly obey he pick up the little leather bag open it and pour out its contents in a sparkling flood there he add turn to grady be the michaelovitch diamond chapter xxviii crochard write a epilogue for a instant we gaze at the glittering heap with dazzle eye then grady with a inarticulate cry spring to he foot and pick up a handful of the diamond as though to convince himself of they reality but i do not understand he gasp have you get croshar too no such luck say godfrey do you mean to say he would give these up without a fight the same thought be in my own mind if godfrey have run down crochard and get the diamond without a life-and-death struggle that engaging rascal must be much less formidable than i have suppose my dear grady say godfrey i have not see crochard since the minute you take he off the boat i would have have he if you have let simmond call I that be what i have plan but he be too clever for we i know that he would come to-day you know that he would come to-day repeat grady blankly how do you know that -- or be it merely hot air i know that he would come say godfrey curtly because he write and tell I so m pigot laugh a dry little laugh that be a favorite device of he he say and he always keep he word the trouble be continue godfrey that i do not look for he so early in the day and so he be able to send I on a wild-goose chase after a sensation that do not exist there be where i be a fool but i discover the secret drawer ten day ago -- while the cabinet be still at vantine 's -- the evening after the veil lady get she letter it be easy enough i be surprised you do not think of it lester think of what i ask of the key to the mystery the drawer contain the letter be on the left side of the desk i see at once that there must be another drawer open in the same way on the right side i do not see it i say i do not see it yet think a minute why be drouet kill because he open the wrong drawer he press the combination at the right side of the desk instead of that at the left side the fair julie must have think the drawer be on the right side instead of the leave it be a mistake very easy to make since she mistress doubtless have she back turn when julie see she open the drawer the suspicion that it be julie 's mistake become certainty when she show the combination to vantine and he be kill too besides the veil lady herself make a remark which reveal the whole story i do not notice it i say resignedly what be it that she be accustom to open the drawer with she left hand instead of with she right after that there could be no further doubt so i discover the drawer very simply it have to be there yes i say and then then i remove the jewel take they down to a dealer in paste gem and duplicated they as closely as i could i have a hard time get a good copy of this big rose-diamond he pick it from the heap and hold it up between he finger it be a beauty be not it he ask m pigot smile a dry smile it be the mazarin he say and be worth three million franc there be a copy of it at the louvre so that be true be it i ask crochard tell we the story it be unquestionably true say m pigot it be not a secret -- it be merely something which every one have forget well continue godfrey after i get the duplicate i roll they up in the cotton packet and place they back in the drawer be careful to put the mazarin at the bottom where i have find it it be lucky you think of that i say or crochard would have suspect something godfrey look at I with a smile my dear lester he say he know that the game be up the instant he open the first packet do you suppose he would be deceive not by the best reproduction ever make and then i remember the slow flush which have creep into crochard 's cheek as he open that first packet i do not expect to deceive he godfrey explain i just want to give he a little surprise and to think i be not there to see it but if he know they be imitation i protest why should he go to all that trouble to steal they that be what puzzle I last night say godfrey and for that matter it puzzle I yet maybe he be get the real stone after all suggest grady who have be listen to all this with incredulous countenance the story sound fishy to I maybe these be the imitation m pigot come forward and pick up the mazarin and look at it this one at least be real he say after a moment and i have no doubt the other be he add turn they over with he finger grady still incredulous pick up one of the brilliant go to the window and draw it down the pane it leave a deep scratch behind it yes he admit reluctantly i guess they be diamond all right and he sit down again and now gentleman continue godfrey who have watch grady 's byplay with a tolerant smile i be ready to turn these diamond over to you i should like you to count they and give I a receipt for they and then of course you will write the story sneer grady and give yourself all the credit well ask godfrey look at he do you think you deserve any and grady could only crimson and keep silent as for the story it be already write it will be on the street in ten minute -- and it will create a sensation please count the diamond you will find two hundred and ten of they that be the exact number steal from the grand duke remark m pigot and fall to count the number be two hundred and ten mr shearrow have the receipt godfrey add and shearrow take a paper from he pocket unfold it and read the contents it prove to be not only a receipt but a full statement of the fact of the case without omit the detail of the robbery and the credit due the _ record _ for the recovery of the diamond grady 's face grow redder and redder as the reading proceed i will not sign no such testimonial as that he bluster not on you life i will not you will sign it will you not m pigot ask godfrey certainly say the frenchman it be a recognition of you service very well deserve and he step forward and sign it with a flourish now simmond say godfrey no you do not break in grady stay where you be simmond i forbid you to sign that remember i be you superior officer no he be not simmond say godfrey quietly he have not be a officer at all for a hour and more grady spring to he foot he eye blaze and stride toward godfrey what do you mean by that he shout i mean say godfrey look he squarely in the eye that mr shearrow and myself have a talk with the mayor this morning and lay before he certain evidence in we possession -- this latest case among other -- and that you resignation be accept at noon to-day my resignation snort grady i never write one tell the public that if you want to retort godfrey coldly that be you affair you ought to have ` phone it in when i tell you to now simmond grady stand glare about he a instant like a enraged bull and i half expect he to hurl himself on godfrey instead he crush he hat upon he head stride to the door jerk it open and bang it behind he now simmond godfrey repeat as the echo die away and simmond come forward and sign i witness the signature and godfrey with more eagerness than he have show in the whole affair catch up the paper and spring with it to the door get that down to the office as quick as you can he say to a man outside i 'll ` phone instruction that he add close the door and turn back to we be my reward for all this -- or rather the _ record 's _ reward and now gentleman mr shearrow have he car below and i think we would better drive around to some safe-deposit box with this plunder it be perhaps ten day afterwards that godfrey drop in to see I one evening i be just back from a week on cape cod which have do I a world of good and i need hardly say be glad to see he you be look normal again he say survey I as he sit down i be worry about you for a while i never feel better i tell you that all i need be to have that mystery solve and it be solve on schedule time be not it he smile though not quite in the way i have anticipate do you know lester he add i be go to claim that cabinet on what grounds i demand because the man who own it give it to I and he get a paper out of he pocket-book and hand it across to I i open it and recognize the delicate and feminine writing which i have see once before _ my dear sir _ -lrb- the letter run -rrb- : i find that i make the mistake of underestimate you and i present you my sincere apology i trust that at some future time it may be my privilege to be again engage with you -- the result be certain to be most interesting but at present i find that i must return to europe by _ la bretagne _ since after the trouble i have take it be impossible that i should consent to part with the brilliant of he highness the grand duke as a slight souvenir of my high regard i trust you will be willing to accept the cabinet boule which i be certain that good m lester will surrender to you if you will show to he this letter the cabinet be not only interesting in itself but will be doubly so to you because of the part it have play in we little comedy and i should like to know that it adorn a corner of you home till we meet again dear sir believe I you sincere admirer crochard l'invincible he be a good sport be not he ask godfrey as i silently hand the letter back to he what do you say about the cabinet i suppose there be no doubt that crochard buy it i say so that it be mine now yes but i be go to solicit a bribe go ahead and solicit it i want a souvenir too i say i would like awfully well to have that letter -- besides i add it will be a kind of receipt you know if anybody ever question my give you the cabinet godfrey laugh and throw the letter across the table to I it be yours he say and i 'll send for the cabinet to-morrow i suppose it be still at the station yes i have not have time to put in a claim for it but godfrey i add when do _ la bretagne _ sail a week ago to-day she be due at havre in the morning do you warn they warn they of what that crochard be after the diamond they go back on _ la bretagne _ i suppose yes -- and pigot go with they so why should i warn any one surely they know that crochard will get those diamond if he can it have become a sort of point of honor with he i imagine it be up to they to take care of they that ought not to be difficult i say the strong-room of a liner be about the safest place on earth yes godfrey agree and blow a meditative ring toward the ceiling and presently he go away without say anything more but the more i thought of it the more the inflection he have give that word seem a interrogation rather than a affirmation and when i open my paper next morning i more than half expect to be greet with a black headline announce the looting of the strong-room of _ la bretagne _ but there be no such headline and with a sigh half of relief and half of disappointment i turn to the other news but two week later a black headline _ do _ catch my eye : michaelovitch jewel false french detective take back paste imitation from america fraud discover when the grand duke michael send they to a jeweller to be reset i have no need to read the article which follow for i saw in a flash what have occur i see too why crochard have retain the paste jewel -- he have a use for they how or where the substitution have be make i could only guess but one thing be certain : the two week which have elapse before the theft be discover have give he ample opportunity to dispose of he plunder i feel sorry for the grand duke sorrier still for that admirable m pigot but after all one could not but admire the cleverness of the man who have despoil they who i wonder have buy the mazarin surely there be a diamond most difficult to sell it could of course be cut up -- but that would be sacrilege that question be answer before long in a unexpected way -- a way which fill many column in the papers which delight the comedy-loving french and which give crochard a unique advertisement one morning in the personal column of _ le matin _ appear a notice of which this be the english : to m the director of the museum of the louvre : it have be my good fortune to come into possession of the rose-diamond know as the mazarin it be my wish to restore it to you collection in order that it may no longer be necessary to delude the public with a imitation of color glass it will give I great pleasure to present this brilliant to you with my compliment provide he highness the grand duke michael who precede I in possession of the diamond will join I in the gift should he refuse it will be my melancholy duty to cleave the diamond into a number of smaller stone as it be too large for my use but i hope that he will not refuse crochard l'invincible what could the grand duke do to have refuse would have make he the butt of the boulevard besides he be after all lose nothing which he have not already lose so with a better grace than one might have expect he consent to join in the restoration two day later the director of the louvre discover a packet upon he desk he open it and find within the mazarin when you visit the louvre you will see it in the place of honor in the glass case in the center of the gallery of apollo with a attendant on guard beside it but already the circumstance of its restoration be fading from the public memory and crochard i do not know each morning i read first the news from paris search for l'invincible in some new incarnation i have he letter frame and hang above my desk and every day i read it over one sentence especially be forever run in my head : i trust that at some future time it may be my privilege to be again engage with you -- the result be certain to be most interesting and i trust that it may be my privilege also to be present at that engagement end of the project gutenberg ebook of the mystery of the boule
