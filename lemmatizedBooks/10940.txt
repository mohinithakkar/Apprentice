that work be to introduce the reader to a branch of learn to which access have hitherto appear only permit to the scientific that attempt which be a bold one succeed too well not to induce we to push we research further in fact art alone can not acquaint we entirely with a epoch the art consider in they generality be the true expression of society they tell we its taste its idea and its character we thus speak in the preface to we first work and we find nothing to modify in this opinion art must be the faithful expression of a society since it represent it by its work as it have create they -- undeniable witness of its spirit and manners for future generation but it must be acknowledge that art be only the consequence of the idea which it express it be the fruit of civilisation not its origin to understand the middle age and the renaissance it be necessary to go back to the source of its art and to know the life of we father these be two inseparable thing which entwine one another and become complete one by the other the manners and custom of the middle age : -- this subject be of the greatest interest not only to the man of science but to the man of the world also in it too we retrace not only one single period but two period quite distinct one from the other in the first the public and private custom offer a curious mixture of barbarism and civilisation we find barbarian roman and christian custom and character in presence of each other mix up in the same society and very often in the same individual everywhere the most adverse and opposite tendency display themselves what a ardent struggle during that long period and how full too of emotion be its picture society tend to reconstitute itself in every aspect she want to create so to say from every side property authority justice & c & c in a word everything which can establish the basis of public life and this new order of thing must be establish by means of the element supply at once by the barbarian roman and christian world -- a prodigious creation the working of which occupy the whole of the middle age hardly do modern society civilised by christianity reach the fullness of its power than it divide itself to follow different path ancient art and literature resuscitate because custom _ insensibly _ take that direction under that influence everything be modify both in private and public life the history of the human race do not present a subject more vast or more interesting it be a subject we have choose to succeed we first book and which will be follow by a similar study on the various aspect of religious and military life this work devote to the vivid and faithful description of the manners and custom of the middle age and renaissance answer fully to the requirement of contemporary time we be in fact no longer content with the chronological narration and simple nomenclature which formerly be consider sufficient for education we no longer imagine that the history of we institution have less interest than that of we war nor that the annals of the humbler class be irrelevant to those of the privileged order we go further still what be above all seek for in historical work nowadays be the physiognomy the inmost character of past generation how do we father live be a daily question what institution have they what be they political rights can you not place before we they pastime they hunting party they meal and all sort of scene sad or gay which compose they home life we should like to follow they in public and private occupation and to know they manner of live

and establish itself energetically under pépin and charlemagne to degenerate under loui le débonnaire and charle le chauve after have dare a second time to find the empire of the caesar it quickly see its sovereignty replace by feudal rights and all its rights usurp by the noble and have to struggle for many century to recover its rights one by one feudalism evidently of germanic origin will also attract we attention and we shall draw a rapid outline of this legislation which barbarian at the onset become by degree subject to the rule of moral progress we shall ascertain that military service

society be in ambuscade and wage civil war -- individual against individual -- without peace or mercy such be the reign of feudalism it be unnecessary to point out how this system of perpetual petty warfare tend to reduce the power of centralisation and how royalty itself be weaken towards the end of the second dynasty when the descendant of hugh capet wish to restore they power by give it a larger basis they be oblige to attack one after the other all these stronghold and practically to re-annex each fief city and province hold by these petty monarch in order to force they owner to

time resemble the command of a general of a army he have at first no other minister than the officer to whom he give full power to act in the province and who decide arbitrarily in the name of and represent the king on all question of administration one minister alone approach the king and that be the chancellor who verify seal and dispatch all royal decree and order as early however as the seventh century a few officer of state appear who be specially attach to the king 's person or household a count of the palace who examine and direct the suit bring before the throne a mayor of the

happen to be inhabit it be only under the capetian that the royal council take a permanent footing or even assemble at state period in ordinary time that be to say when he be not engage in war the

the king receive through special officer appoint for the purpose tribute either in money or in kind which be most variable but often very heavy and draw almost exclusively from he personal and private property in case of emergency only he appeal to he vassal for pecuniary aid a great number of the grandee who live far from the court either in state office or on they own fief have establishment similar to that of the king numerous and considerable privilege elevate they above other free man the office and fief have become hereditary the order of nobility follow as a consequence and it then become highly necessary for family to keep they genealogical history not only to gratify they pride but also to give they the necessary title for the feudal advantage they derive by birth -lrb- fig 15 -rrb- without this right of inheritance society which be still unsettle in the middle age would soon have be dissolve this great principle sacred in the eye both of great and small maintained feudalism and in so do it maintain itself amidst all the chaos and confusion of repeat revolution and social disturbance we have already state and we can not sufficiently insist upon this important point that from the day on which the adventurous habit of the chief of germanic origin give place to the desire for territorial possession the part play by the land increase insensibly towards define the position of the person hold it domain become small kingdom over which the lord assume the most absolute and arbitrary rights a rule be soon establish that the nobility be inherent to the soil and consequently that the land ought to transmit to its possessor the rights of nobility this privilege be so much accept that the long tenure of a fief end by ennoble the commoner subsequently by a sort of compensation which naturally follow land on which rent have hitherto be pay become free and noble on pass to the possession of a noble at last however the contrary rule prevail which cause the land not to change quality in change owner : the noble could still possess the labourer 's land without lose he nobility but the labourer could be proprietor of a fief without thereby become a noble to the _ comite _ who accord to tacitus attach themselves to the fortune of the germanic chief succeed the merovingian _ leude _ whose assembly form the king 's council these _ leude _ be person of great

king 's tribunal the chief of german band at first recompense they companion in arm by give they fief of part of the territory which they have conquer but later on everything be equally give to be hold in fief namely dignity office rights and income or title it be important to remark -lrb- and it be in this alone that feudalism show its social bearing -rrb- that if the vassal owe obedience and devotion to he lord the lord in exchange owe protection to the vassal the rank of free man do not necessarily require the possession of land but the position of free man who do not hold fief be extremely delicate and often painful for they be by natural right dependent upon those on whose domain they reside in fact the greater part of these noble without land become by choice the king 's man and remain attach to he service if this fail they they take land on lease so as to support themselves and they family and to avoid fall into absolute servitude in the event of a change of proprietor they change with the land into new hand nevertheless it be not uncommon for they to be so reduce as to sell they freedom but in such case they reserve the right should better time come of re-purchase they liberty by pay one-fifth more than the sum for which they have sell it we thus see that in olden time as also later freedom be more or less the natural consequence of the possession of wealth or power on the part of individual or family who consider themselves free in the midst of general dependence during the tenth century indeed if not impossible it be at least difficult to find a single inhabitant of the kingdom of france who be not the man of some one and who be either tie by rule of a liberal order or else be under the most servile obligation the property of the free man be originally the _ aleu _ which be under the jurisdiction of the royal magistrate the _ aleu _ gradually lose the greater part of its franchise and become liable to the common charge due on land which be not freehold in ancient time all land property of a certain extent be compose of two distinct part : one occupy by the owner constitute the domain or manor the other divide between person who be more or less dependent form what be call _ tenure _ these _ tenure _ be again divide accord to the position of those who occupy they : if they be possess by free man who take the name of vassal they

of civic body and the spring up of the middle class -lrb- fig 20 -rrb- make the acquisition of liberty more easy and more general nevertheless this liberty be rather theoretical than practical for if

impose upon it -lrb- illustration : fig 20 -- bourgeois at the end of thirteenth century -- fac-simile of miniature in manuscript no 6820 in the national library of pari -rrb- fortunately for the progress of liberty the civic body as if they have be providentially warn of the future in store for they never hesitate to accept from they lord civil or ecclesiastical condition onerous though they be which enable they to exist in the interior of the city to which they belong they form a sort of small state almost independent for private affair subject to the absolute power of the king and more or less tie by they custom or agreement with the local noble they hold public assembly and elect magistrate whose power embrace both the administration of civil and criminal justice police finance and the militia they generally have fix and write law protect by rampart each possess a town-hall -lrb- _ hôtel de ville _ -rrb- a seal a treasury and a watch-tower and it could arm a certain number of man either for its own defense or for the service of the noble or sovereign under whom it hold its rights in no case could a community such as this exist without the sanction of the king who place it under the safeguard of the crown at first the king blind by a covetous policy only seem to see in the issue of these charter a excellent pretext for extort money if they consent to recognize they and even to help they against they lord it be on account of the enormous sacrifice make by the town later on however they affect on the contrary the greatest generosity towards the vassal who wish to incorporate themselves when they have understand that these institution might become powerful auxiliary against the great titulary feudalist but from the reign of loui xi when the power of the noble be much diminish and no longer inspire any terror to royalty the king turn against they former ally the middle class and deprive they successively of all the prerogative which could prejudice the rights of the crown the middle class it be true acquire considerable influence afterwards by participation in the general and provincial council after have victoriously struggle against the clergy and

of _ free town _ or _ new town _ where they offer to all wish to establish themselves land house and a more or less extended share of privilege rights and liberty these congregation or family soon become borough and the inhabitant though agriculturist take the name of bourgeois -lrb- illustration : fig 21 -- costume of a vilain or peasant fifteenth century from a miniature of la danse macabre

under the title of bourgeois of the king _ -lrb- bourgeois du roy _ -rrb- keep they liberty by virtue of letter of protection give they by the king although they be establish on land of noble whose inhabitant be deprive of liberty further when a _ vilain _ -- that be to say the serf of a noble -- buy a lease of land in a royal borough it be a established custom that after have live there a year and a day without be reclaim by he lord and master he become a bourgeois of the king and a free man in consequence of this the serf and vilain -lrb- fig 21 -rrb- emigrate from all part in order to profit by these advantage to such a degree that the land of the noble become desert by all the serf of different degree and be in danger of remain uncultivated the nobility in the interest of they property and to arrest this increase emigration devoted themselves to improve the condition of person place under they dependence and attempt to create on they domain _ borough _ analogous to those of royalty but however liberal these amelioration might appear to be it be difficult for the noble not only to concede privilege equal to those emanate from the throne but also to ensure equal protection to those they thus enfranchise in spite of this however the result be that a double current of enfranchisement be establish which result in the daily diminution of the miserable order of serf and which whilst it emancipate the lower order have the immediate result of give increase weight and power to royalty both in its own domain and in those of the nobility and they vassal these social revolution do not of course operate suddenly nor do they at once abolish former institution for we still find that after the establishment of community and corporation several order of servitude

accord to many other custom of france the child as a general rule succeed to the lower rank of he parent there be two order of serf : one rigorously hold in the absolute dependence of he lord to such a degree that the latter could appropriate during he life or after death if he choose all he possess he could imprison he ill-treat he as he think proper without have to answer to any one but god the other though hold equally in bondage be more liberally treat for unless he be guilty of some evil-doing the lord could ask of he nothing during he life but the fee rent or fine which he owe on account of he servitude if one of the latter class of serf marry a free woman everything which he possess become the property of he lord the same be the case when he die for he could not transmit any of he

do not cease to suffer the inconvenience of he position on whatever land he go to establish himself the mortmain be generally subject to the greater share of feudal obligation formerly impose on serf these be particularly to work for a certain time for they lord without receive any wages or else to pay he the _ tax _ when it be due on certain definite occasion as for example when he marry when he give a dower to he daughter when he be take prisoner of war when he go to the holy land & c & c what particularly characterize the condition of mortmain be that the lord have the right to take all they goods when they die without issue or when the child hold a separate household and that they could not dispose of anything they possess either by will or gift beyond a certain sum the noble who franchise mortmain impose on they in almost all case very heavy condition consist of fee labor and fine of all sort in fact a mortmain person to be free not only require to be franchise by he own lord but also by all the noble on whom he be dependent as well as by the sovereign if a noble franchise without the consent of he superior he incur a fine as it be consider a dismemberment or depreciation of the fief as early as the end of the fourteenth century the rigorous law of mortmain begin to fall into disuse in the province though if the name begin to disappear the condition itself continue to exist the free man whether they belong to the middle class or to the peasantry be nevertheless still subject to pay fine or obligation to they lord of such a nature that they must be consider to have

to the duke and count in case arise in they domain have no appeal save to the king himself and this be even often contest by the noble as for instance in the unhappy case of enguerrand de coucy enguerrand have order three young flemish nobleman who be scholar at the abbey of st nichola des bois to be seize and hang because not know that they be on the domain of the lord of coucy they have kill a few rabbit with arrow st loui call the case before he enguerrand answer to the call but only to dispute the king 's right and to claim the judgment of he peer the king without take any notice of the remonstrance order enguerrand to be lock up in the big tower of the louvre and be nearly apply the law of _ retaliation _ to he case eventually he grant he letter of pardon after condemn he to

with they wander habit require it at any moment be that of _ safe convoy _ or _ guidance _ this right be so powerful that it even apply itself to the lower order and its violation be consider the most

to the apennine the hand of the barbarian have weigh much less heavily than on the rest of europe in those favored province where roman organization have outlive roman patronage it seem as if ancient

the contrary in the province between the seine and the rhine and even between the seine and the loire the system of franchise take footing and become recognize in some place the revolution be effect

certain rights they rebel about 1070 and force the count and he noble vassal to grant they the freedom which they have swear to obtain though william of normandy very soon restore the rebel city to order and dissolve the presumptuous community however the example soon bear fruit cambraus rise in its turn and proclaim the commune and although its bishop aid by treason and by the count of hainault

could not fail to influence the mind of the rustic and the lower class and they only want the opportunity which the idea of the commune at once give they of imitate they superior they too take oath and possess they body and soul in common they seize by force of strategy the rampart of they town they elect mayor alderman and juror who be charge to watch over the interest of they association they swear to spare neither they goods they labor nor they blood in order to free themselves and not content with defend themselves behind barricade or chain which close the street they boldly take the

commune on the property of they neighbor do not so much care to see they form on they own estate unless the exceptional position and importance of any town require a wise exercise of tolerance thus

concede to they by the noble for the most part with a political end these be the free town or new town which we have already name however it come about it be certain that although during the tenth century feudal power be almost supreme in europe as early as the twelfth century the municipal system have gain great weight and be constantly progress until the policy of the kingdom become develop on a more and more extended basis so that it be then necessary for it to give up its primitive nature and to participate in the great movement of consolidisation and national unity in this way the

contradiction the fall of the commune declare itself in inverse ratio to the progress of the _ tier etat _ by degree as the government become more settle from the great fief be absorb by the crown and as parliament and other court of appeal which emanate from the middle class extend they high judiciary and military authority so the central power organize under monarchical form must necessarily have

european court notwithstanding the great external and civil war yet it afford at the same time a sad example of laxity of moral which have a most baneful influence on public habit so much so that vice and corruption descend from class to class and contaminate all order of society if we wish to make investigation into the private life of the lower order in those time we should not succeed as we have be able to do with that of the upper class for we have scarcely any datum to throw light upon they sad and obscure history bourgeois and peasant be as we have already show long include together with the miserable class of serf a herd of human being without individuality without significance who from they birth to they death whether isolate or collectively be the property of they master what must

agricultural population take its social position many generation later as we have already see the great movement for the creation of commune and bourgeoisie only date from the unsettled period range from the eleventh to the thirteenth century and simultaneously we see the bourgeois appear already rich and luxurious parading on all occasion they personal opulence they private life could only be a imitation of that in the châteaux by degree as wealth strengthen and improve they condition and render they independent we find they try to procure luxury equal or analogous to those enjoy by the upper class and which appear to they the height of material happiness in all time the small have imitate the great it be in vain that the great obstinately threaten by the exercise of they prerogative to try and crush this tendency to equality which alarm they by issue pecuniary edict summary law coercive regulation and penal ordinance by the force of circumstance the arbitrary restriction which the nobility lay upon the lower class gradually disappear and the power of wealth display itself in spite of all they effort to suppress it in fact occasion be not want in which the bourgeois class be

of the municipal power hold by they family bedeck themselves regardless of expense with costly fur and rich stuff notwithstanding that they be forbid by law to do so then come a outcry on the part of the noble and we read as follow in a edict of philippe le bel who incline less to the bourgeoisie than to the noble and who do not spare the former in matter of taxation : -- no bourgeois shall have a chariot nor wear gold precious stone or crown of gold or silver bourgeois not be either prelate nor dignitary of state shall not have taper of wax a bourgeois possess two thousand pound -lrb- tournoi -rrb- or more may order for himself a dress of twelve sous six denier and for he wife one worth sixteen sous at the most the sou which be but nominal money may be reckon as represent twenty franc and the denier one franc but allowance must be make for the enormous difference in the value of silver which would make twenty franc in the thirteenth century represent upward of two hundred franc of present currency -lrb- illustration : fig 59 -- the new-born child from a miniature in the histoire de la belle hélaine -lrb- manuscript of the fifteenth century national library of pari -rrb- -rrb- but these regulation as to the mode of living be so little or so carelessly observe that all the successor of philippe le bel think it necessary to re-enact they and indeed charle vii one century

of the habitable globe there be none so changeable outrageous and excessive in they manner of dress as the french nation and there be no possibility of discover by they dress the state or calling of person be they prince noble bourgeois or work man because all be allow to dress as they think proper whether in gold or silver silk or wool without any regard to they call at the end of the thirteenth century a rich merchant of valencienne go to the court of the king of france wear a cloak of fur cover with gold and pearl see that no one offer he a cushion he proudly sit on he cloak on leave he do not attempt to take up the cloak and on a servant call he attention to the fact he remark it be not the custom in my country for people to carry away they cushion with they respect a journey make by philippe le bel and he wife jeanne de navarre to the town of bruge and ghent the historian jean mayer relate that jeanne on see the costly array of the bourgeois of those two rich city exclaim i think i be the only queen here but i see more than six hundred in spite of the law the parisian bourgeoisie soon rival the flemish in the brilliancy of they dress thus in the second half of the fourteenth century the famous christine de pisan relate that have go to visit the wife of a merchant during she confinement it be not without some amazement that she see the sumptuous furniture of the apartment in which this woman lay in bed -lrb- fig 59 -rrb- the wall be hang with precious tapestry of cyprus on which the initial and motto of the lady be embroider the sheet be of fine linen of rheim and have cost more than three hundred pound the quilt be a new invention of silk and silver tissue the carpet be like gold the lady wear a elegant dress of crimson silk and rest she head and arm on pillow ornament with button of oriental pearl it should be remark that this lady be not the wife of a large merchant such as those of venice and genoa but of a simple retail dealer who be not above sell article for four sous such be the case we need not be surprise that christine should have consider the anecdote worthy of be immortalise in a book it must not however be assume that the sole aim of the bourgeoisie be that of make a haughty and pompous display this be refute by the testimony of the ménagier de paris a curious anonymous work the author of which must have be a educate and enlighten bourgeois the ménagier which be first publish by the baron jérôme pichon be a collection of counsel address by a husband to he young wife as to she conduct in society in the world and in the management of she household the first part be devote to develop the mind of the young housewife and the second relate to the arrangement necessary for the welfare of she house it must be remember that the comparatively trifling duty relate to the comfort of private life which devolve on the wife be not so numerous in those day as they be now but on the other hand they require a amount of practical knowledge on the part of the housewife which she can nowadays dispense with under this head the ménagier be full of information after have speak of the prayer which a christian woman should say morning and evening the author discuss the great question of dress which have ever be of supreme importance in the eye of the female sex : know dear sister -lrb- the friendly name he give he young wife -rrb- that in the choice of you apparel you must always consider the rank of you parent and mine as also the state of my fortune be respectably dress without devote too much study to it without too much plunging into new fashion before leave you room see that the collar of you gown be well adjust and be not put on crooked -lrb- illustration : fig 60 -- sculptured comb in ivory of the sixteenth century -lrb- sauvageot collection -rrb- -rrb- then he dilate on the character of woman which be too often wilful and unmanageable on this point for he be not less profuse in example than the chevalier de latour-landry he relate a amusing anecdote worthy of be repeat and remember i have hear the bailiff of tournay relate that he have find himself several time at table with man long marry and that he have wager with they the price of a dinner under the following condition : the company be to visit the abode of each of the husband successively and any one who have a wife obedient enough immediately without contradict or make any remark to consent to count up to four would win the bet but on the other hand those whose wife show temper laugh or refuse to obey would lose under these condition the company gaily adjourn to the abode of robin whose wife call marie have a high opinion of herself the husband say before all ` marie repeat after I what i shall say ' ` willingly sire ' ` marie say one two three ' but by this time marie be out of patience and say ` and seven and twelve and fourteen why you be make a fool of I ' so that husband lose he wager the company next go to the house of maître jean whose wife agnescat well know how to play the lady jean say ` repeat after I one ' ` and two ' answer agnescat disdainfully so he lose he wager tassin then try and say to dame tassin ` count one ' ` go upstairs ' she answer ` if you want to teach count i be not a child ' another say ` go away with you you must have lose you sens ' or similar word which make the husband lose they wager those on the contrary who have well-behaved wife gain they wager and go away joyful this amusing quotation suffice to show that the author of the ménagier de paris wish to adopt a jocose style with a view to enliven the seriousness of the subject he be advocate the part of he work in which he discuss the administration of the house be not less worthy of attention one of the most curious chapter of the work be that in which he point out the manner in which the young bourgeoise be to behave towards person in she service rich people in those day in whatever station of life be oblige to keep a numerous retinue of servant it be curious to find that so far back as the period to which we allude there be in paris a kind of servant ' registry office where situation be find for servant-maid from the country the bourgeois give up the entire management of the servant to he wife but on account of she extreme youth the author of the work in question recommend he wife only to engage servant who shall have be choose by dame agne the nun whom he have place with she as a kind of governess or companion before engage they he say know whence they come in what house they have be if they have acquaintance in town and if they be steady discover what they be capable of do and ascertain that they be not greedy or inclined to drink if they come from another country try to find out why they leave it for generally it be not without some serious reason that a woman decide upon a change of abode when you have engage a maid do not permit she to take the slightest liberty with you nor allow she to speak disrespectfully to you if on the contrary she be quiet in she demeanor honest modest and show herself amenable to reproof treat she as if she be you daughter superintend the work to be do and choose among you servant those qualify for each special department if you order a thing to be do immediately do not be satisfy with the follow answer : ` it shall be do presently or to-morrow early ' otherwise be sure that you will have to repeat you order -lrb- illustration : fig 61 -- dress of maidservant in the thirteenth century -- miniature in a manuscript of the national library of pari -rrb- to these severe instruction upon the management of servant the bourgeois add a few word respect they morality he recommend that they be not permit to use coarse or indecent language or to insult one another -lrb- fig 61 -rrb- although he be of opinion that necessary time should be give to servant at they meal he do not approve of they remain drinking and talk too long at table : concern which practice he quote a proverb in use at that time : quand varlet presche à table et cheval paist en gué il est temps qu'on l'en oste : assez y a esté which mean that when a servant talk at table and a horse feed near a watering-place it be time he should be remove he have be there long enough -lrb- illustration : fig 62 -- hôtel des ursins paris build during the fourteenth century restore in the sixteenth and now destroy -- state of the north front at the end of the last century -rrb- the manner in which the author conclude he instruction prove he kindness of heart as well as he benevolence : if one of you servant fall sick it be you duty set everything else aside to see to he be cure it be thus that a bourgeois of the fifteenth century express himself and as it be clear that he could only have be inspire to dictate he theoretical teaching by the practical experience which he must have gain for the most part among the middle class to which he belong we must conclude that in those day the bourgeoisie possess considerable knowledge of moral dignity and social propriety it must be add that by the side of the merchant and work bourgeoisie -- who above all owe they greatness to the high function of the municipality -- the parliamentary bourgeoisie have raise itself to power and that from the fourteenth century it play a considerable part in the state hold at several royal court at different period and at last almost hereditarily the highest magisterial position the very character of these great office of president or of parliamentary counsel barrister & c prove that the holder must have have no small amount of intellectual culture in this way a refined taste be create among this class which the protection of king prince and lord have alone hitherto encourage we find for example the groslier at lyon the de thous and seguier in pari regardless of they bourgeois origin become judicious and zealous patron of poet scholar and artist a description of pari publish in the middle of the fifteenth century describe amongst the most splendid residence of the capital the hotel of juvénal des ursins -lrb- fig 62 -rrb- of bureau de dampmartin of guillaume seguin of mille baillet of martin double and particularly that of jacque duchié situate in the rue des prouvaire in which be collect at great cost collection of all kind of arm musical instrument rare bird tapestry and work of art in each church in pari and there be upward of a hundred the principal chapel be found by celebrated family of the ancient bourgeoisie who have leave money for one or more mass to be say daily for the repose of the soûls of they deceased member in the burial-grounds and principally in that of the innocent the monument of these family of parisian bourgeoisie be of the most expensive character and be inscribe with epitaph in which the living vainly try to immortalise the deed of the deceased every one have hear of the celebrated tomb of nichola flamel and pernelle he wife -lrb- fig 63 -rrb- the cross of bureau the epitaph of yolande bailly who die in 1514 at the age of eighty-eight and who see or might have see two hundred and ninety-five child descend from she in fact the religious institution of pari afford much curious and interesting information relative to the history of the bourgeoisie for instance jean alai who levy a tax of one denier on each basket of fish bring to market and thereby amass a enormous fortune leave the whole of it at he death for the purpose of erect a chapel call st agne which soon after become the church of st eustace he further direct that by way of expiation he body should be throw into the sewer which drain the offal from the market and cover with a large stone this sewer up to the end of the last century be still call pont alai -lrb- illustration : fig 63 -- nicholas flamel and pernelle he wife from a painting execute at the end of the fifteenth century under the vault of the cemetery of the innocent in pari -rrb- very often when citizen make gift during they lifetime to church or parish the donor reserve to themselves certain privilege which be calculate to cause the motive which have actuate they to be open to criticism thus in 1304 the daughter of nicholas arrode formerly provost of the merchant present to the church of st jacques-la-boucherie the house and grounds which they inhabit but one of they reserve the right of have a key of the church that she might go in whenever she please guillaume haussecuel in 1405 buy a similar right for the sum of eighteen _ sol parisis _ per annum -lrb- equal to twenty-five franc -rrb- and alain and he wife whose house be close to two chapel of the church undertake not to build so as in any way to shut out the light from one of the chapel on condition that they might open a small window into the chapel and so be enable to hear the service without leave they room -lrb- illustration : fig 64 -- country life

so grasp after power that it venture at a period which do not concern we here to aspire to every sort of distinction and to secure a important social standing what have be the exception during the sixteenth century become the rule two century later we will now take a glance at the agricultural population -lrb- fig 64 -rrb- who as we have already state be only emancipate from serfdom at the end of the eighteenth century but whatever might have be formerly the civil condition of the rural population everything lead we to suppose that there be no special change in they private and domestic means of existence from a comparatively remote period down to almost the present time a small poem of the thirteenth century entitle de l'oustillement au vilain give a clear though rough sketch of the domestic state of the peasantry strange as it may seem it must be acknowledge that with a few exception result from the progress of time it would not be difficult even at the present day to find the exact type maintain in the country district farthest away from the capital and large town at all event they be faithfully represent at the time of the revolution of 1789 -lrb- illustration : fig 65 --

consider a authentic and most interesting document that the _ manse _ or dwelling of the villain comprise three distinct building the first for the corn the second for the hay and straw the third for the man and he family in this rustic abode a fire of vine branch and faggot sparkle in a large chimney furnish with a iron pot-hanger a tripod a shovel large fire-iron a cauldron and a meat-hook next

knead trough a table a bench a cheese cupboard a jug and a few basket make up the rest of the furniture the villain also possess other utensil such as a ladder a mortar a hand-mill -- for every one

the side of they parent -lrb- fig 65 -rrb- if then we find so much resemblance between the abode of the villain of the thirteenth century and those of the inhabitant of the poorest commune of france in the present day we may fairly infer that there must be a great deal which be analogous between the inhabitant themselves of the two period for in the châteaux as well as in the town we find the material condition of the dwelling modify itself conjointly with that of the moral condition of the inhabitant -lrb- illustration : fig 67 -- the egotistical and envious villain -- from a miniature in

industry be unable to obtain from any particular soil or from any particular climate commerce undertake to bring from the country which produce it this cause rabelai to say that the stomach be the father and master of industry we will rapidly glance over the alimentary matter which we forefather obtain from the animal and vegetable kingdom and then trace the progress of culinary art and examine the rule of feast and such matter as belong to the epicurean custom of the middle age aliment bread -- the gaul who principally inhabit deep and thick forest feed on herb and fruit and particularly on acorn it be even possible that the veneration in which they hold the oak have no other origin this primitive food continue in use at least in time of famine up to the eighth century and we find in the regulation of st chrodegand that if in consequence of a bad year the acorn or beech-nut become scarce it be the bishop 's duty to provide something to make up for it eight century later when rené du

loaf serve as plate for cut up the other food upon and when they thus become saturated with the sauce and gravy they be eat as cake the use of the _ tourteaux _ -lrb- small crusty loaf -rrb- which be

small loaf to serve as _ tranchoir _ at table the ménagier de paris mention _ des pain de tranchouer _ half a foot in diameter and four finger deep and froissart the historian also speak of _ tailloir _ it would be difficult to point out the exact period at which leaven bread be adopt in europe but we can assert that in the middle age it be anything but general yeast which accord to pliny be already know to the gaul be reserve for pastry and it be only at the end of the sixteenth century that the baker of paris use it for bread at first the trade of miller and baker be carry on by the

amongst the best know variety we will only mention the _ corbeil bread _ the _ dog bread _ the _ bread of two color _ which last be compose of alternate layer of wheat and rye and be use by person of small means there be also the _ gonesse bread _ which have maintain its reputation to this day the table loave which in the province be serve at the table of the rich be of such a convenient size that one of they would suffice for a man of ordinary appetite even after the crust be cut off which it be consider polite to offer to the lady who soak it in they soup for the servant a inferior bread be baked call common bread in many county they sprinkle the bread before put it into the oven with powdered linseed a custom which still exist they usually add salt to the flour excepting in certain locality especially in pari where on account of its price they only mix it with the expensive quality the wheat which be long most esteem for bake purpose be those of brie champagne and bassigny while those of the dauphiné be hold of little value because they be say to contain so many tare and worthless grain that the bread make from they produce headache and other ailment a ancient chronicle of the time of charlemagne make mention of a bread twice baked or biscuit this bread be very hard and easier to keep than any other description it be also use as now for provision ship or town threaten

be besides use as a kind of punishment and monk who have commit any serious offence against discipline be condemn to live on it for a certain period rye bread be hold of very little value although in certain province such as lyonnai forez and auvergne it be very generally use among the country people and contribute say bruyérin champier in he treatise de re cibarium to preserve beauty and freshness amongst woman at a later period the doctor of pari frequently order the use of bread make half of wheat and half of rye as a means of preserve the health black wheat or buck wheat which be introduce into europe by the moor and saracen when they conquer spain quickly spread to the northern province especially to flander where by its easy culture and almost certain yield it avert much suffering from the inhabitant who be continually be threaten with famine it be only later that maize or turkey wheat be cultivate in the south and that rice come into use but these two kind of grain both equally useless for bread be employ the one for fattening poultry and the other for make cake which however be little appreciate -lrb- illustration : fig 78 -- cultivation of grain in use amongst the peasant and the manufacture of barley and oat bread -- fac-simile of a woodcut in a edition of virgil publish at lyon in 1517 -rrb- vegetable and plant use in cooking -- from the most ancient historical document we find that at the very earliest period of the french monarchy fresh and dry vegetable be the ordinary food of the population pliny and columellum attribute a gallic origin to certain root and among they onion and parsnip which the roman cultivate in they garden for use at they table it be evident however that vegetable be never consider as be capable of form solid nutriment since they be almost exclusively use by monastic community when under vow of extreme abstinence a statute of charlemagne in which the useful plant which the emperor desire should be cultivate in he domain be detailed show we that at that period the greater part of we cooking vegetable be in use for we find mention in it fennel garlic parsley shallot onion watercress endive lettuce beetroot cabbage leek carrot artichoke besides long-beans broad-bean pea or italian vetch and lentil in the thirteenth century the plant fit for cooking go under the general appellation of _ aigrun _ and amongst they at a later date be rank orange lemon and other acid fruit st loui add to this category even fruit with hard rind such as walnut filbert and chestnut and when the guild of the fruiterer of pari receive its statute in 1608 they be still call vendor of fruit and _ aigrun _ the vegetable and cooking-plant notice in the ménagier de paris which date from the fourteenth century and in the treatise de obsonii of platina -lrb- the name adopt by the italian bartholomew sacchus -rrb- which date from the fifteenth century do not lead we to suppose that alimentary horticulture have make much progress since the time of charlemagne moreover we be astonish to find the thistle place amongst choice dish though it can not be the common thistle that be mean but probably this somewhat general appellation refer to the vegetable-marrow which be still find on the table of the higher class or perhaps the artichoke which we know to be only a kind of thistle develop by cultivation and which at that period have be recently import about the same date melon begin to appear but the management of this vegetable fruit be not much know it be so imperfectly cultivate in the northern province that in the middle of the sixteenth century bruyérin champier speak of the languedocian as alone know how to produce excellent _ sucrin _ -- thus call say both charle estienne and liébault in the maison rustique because gardener water they with honey or sweeten water the water-melon have never be cultivate but in the south cabbage the alimentary reputation of which date from the remotest time be already of several kind most of which have descend to we amongst they may be mention the apple-headed the roman the white the common white head the easter cabbage & c but the one hold in the highest estimation be the famous cabbage of senli whose leave say a ancient author when open exhale a smell more agreeable than musk or amber this species no doubt fall into disuse when the plan of employ aromatic herb in cooking which be so much in repute by we ancestor be abandon -lrb- illustration : fig 79 -- coat-of-arm of the grain-measurer of ghent on they ceremonial banner

might be find herb of the coldest and most insipid kind such as mallow some kind of moss & c cucumber though rather in request be suppose to be a unwholesome vegetable because it be say that the inhabitant of forez who eat much of it be subject to periodical fever which might really have be cause by noxious emanation from the pond with which that country abound lentil now consider so

on the other hand small fresh bean especially those sell at landit fair be use in the most delicate repast pea pass as a royal dish in the sixteenth century when the custom be to eat they with salt pork turnip be also most esteem by the parisian this vegetable be to they say charle estienne what large radish be to the limousin the best be suppose to come from maisons vaugirard and aubervillier lastly there be four kind of lettuce grow in france accord to liébault in 1574 : the small the common the curl and the roman : the seed of the last-named be send to france by françois rabelai when he be in rome with cardinal du bellay in 1537 and the salad make from it consequently receive the name of roman salad which it have ever since retain in fact we ancestor much appreciate salad for there be not a banquet without at least three or four different kind fruit -- western europe be originally very poor in fruit and it only improve by foreign importation mostly from asia by the roman the apricot come from armenia the pistachio-nut and plum from syrium the peach and nut from persium the cherry from cerasus the lemon from media the filbert from the hellespont and chestnut from castana a town of magnesia we be also indebted to asia for almond the pomegranate accord to some come from africa to other from cyprus the quince from cydon in crete the olive fig pear and apple from greece the statute of charlemagne show we that almost all these fruit be rear in he garden and that some of they be of several kind or variety a considerable period however elapse before the finest and more luscious production of the garden become as it be almost force on nature by artificial means thus in the sixteenth century we find rabelais charle estienne and la framboisière physician to henry iv praise the corbeil peach which be only a inferior and almost wild sort and describe it as have _ dry _ and _ solid _ flesh not adhering to the stone the culture of this fruit which be not larger than a damask plum have then accord to champier only just be introduce into france it must be remark here that jacque coythier physician to loui xi in order to curry favor with he master who be very fond of new fruit take as he crest a apricot-tree from which he be jokingly call abri-coythier -lrb- illustration : fig 80 -- cultivation of fruit from a miniature of the propriétaire de chose -lrb-

that the best plum be the _ royale _ the _ perdrigon _ and the _ dama _ of tour olivier de serre mention eighteen kind -- amongst which however we do not find the celebrated reine claude -lrb- greengage -rrb- which owe its name to the daughter of loui xii first wife of franci i of pear the most esteem in the thirteenth century be the _ hastiveau _ which be a early sort and no doubt the golden pear now call st jean the _ caillou _ or _ chaillou _ a hard pear which come from cailloux in burgundy and _ l'angoisse _ -lrb- agony -rrb- so call on account of its bitterness -- which however totally disappear in cooking in the sixteenth century the palm be give to the _ cuisse dame _ or _ madame _ the _ bon chrétien _ bring it be say by st françois de paule to loui xi the _ bergamote _

not only do it form the basis of the farmer ' dry preserve of orlean call _ cotignac _ a sort of marmalade but it be also use for seasoning meat the portugal quince be the most esteemed and the cotignac of orlean have such a reputation that box of this fruit be always give to king queen and prince on enter the town of france it be the first offering make to joan of arc on she bringing reinforcement into orlean during the english siege several sort of cherry be know but these do not prevent the small wild or wood cherry from be appreciate at the table of the citizen whilst the _

to roam in the street of the capital the obstinate determination with which every one try to evade the administrative law on this subject be explain in fact by the general taste of the french nation

theologian in 817 the council of aix-la-chapelle decide that such delicate nourishment could scarcely be call mortification as understand by the teaching of the church in consequence of this a order be issue forbid the monk to eat poultry except during four day at easter and four at christmas but this prohibition in no way change the established custom of certain part of christendom and the faithful persist in believe that poultry and fish be identical in the eye of the church and accordingly continue to eat they indiscriminately we also see in the middle of the thirteenth century st thoma aquina who be consider a authority in question of dogma and of faith ranking poultry amongst species of aquatic origin eventually this palpable error be abandon but when the church forbid christian the use of poultry on fast day it make a exception out of consideration for the ancient prejudice in favor of teal widgeon moor-hen and also two or three kind of small amphibious quadruped hence probably arise the general and absurd belief concern the origin of teal which some say spring from the rotten wood of old ship other from the fruit of a tree or the gum on fir-tree whilst other think they come from a fresh-water shell analogous to that of the oyster and mussel as far back as modern history can be trace we find that a similar mode of fattening poultry be employ then as now and be one which the gaul must have learn from the roman amongst the charge in the household of the king of france one item be that which concern the poultry-house and which accord to a edict of st loui in 1261 bear the name of _ poulaillier _ at a subsequent period this name be give to breeder and dealer in poultry -lrb- fig 92 -rrb- the ménagier tell as that as be the present practice chicken be fatten by deprive they of light and liberty and gorge they with succulent food amongst the poultry yard in repute at that time the author mention that of hesdin a property of the duke of luxemburg in artoi that of the king at the hôtel saint-pol rue saint-antoine pari that of master hugue aubriot provost of pari and that of charlot no doubt a bourgeois of that name who also give he name to a ancient street in that quarter call the marai -lrb- illustration : fig 92 -- the poulterer draw and engrave in the sixteenth century by j amman -rrb- _ capon _ be frequently mention in poem of the twelfth and thirteenth century but the name of the _ poularde _ do not occur until the sixteenth we know that under the roman rule the gaul carry on a considerable trade in fatten goose this trade cease when gaul pass to new master but the breeding of goose continue to be carefully attend to for many century goose be more highly prize than any other description of poultry and charlemagne order that he domain should be well stock with flock of goose which be drive to feed in the field like flock of sheep there be a old proverb who eat the king 's goose return the feather in a hundred year this bird be consider a great delicacy by the work class and bourgeoisie the _ rôtisseurs _ -lrb- fig 94 -rrb- have hardly anything in they shop but goose and therefore when they be unite in a company they receive the name of _ oyer _ or _ oyeur _ the street in which they be establish with they spit always load with juicy roast be call rue des _ oues _ -lrb- goose -rrb- and this street when it cease to be frequent by the _ oyer _ become by corruption rue auxor -lrb- illustration : fig 93 -- barnacle goose -- fac-simile of a engraving on wood from the cosmographie universelle of munster folio basle 1552 -rrb- there be every reason for believe that the domestication of the wild duck be of quite recent date the attempt have succeed it be wish to follow it up by the naturalisation in the poultry-yard of two other sort of aquatic bird namely the sheldrake -lrb- _ tadorna _ -rrb- and the moorhen but without success some attribute the introduction of turkey into france and europe to jacque coeur treasurer to charle vii whose commercial connection with the east be very extensive other assert that it be due to king rené count of provence but accord to the best authority these bird be first bring into france in the time of franci i by admiral philippe de chabot and bruyérin champier assert that they be not know until even later it be at about the same period that guinea-fowl be bring from the coast of africa by portuguese merchant and the travel naturalist pierre belon who write in the year 1555 assert that in he time they have already so multiply in the house of the noble that they have become quite common -lrb- illustration : fig 94 -- the poultry-dealer -- fac-simile of a engraving on wood after cesare vecellio -rrb- the pea-fowl play a important part in the

falsehood as a hungry man have for the flesh of the peacock in the fourteenth century poultry-yard be still stock with these bird but the turkey and the pheasant gradually replace they as they flesh be consider somewhat hard and stringy this be prove by the fact that in 1581 la nouvelle coutume du bourbonnois only reckon the value of these beautiful bird at two sous and a half or about three franc of present currency -lrb- illustration : fig 95 -- state banquet -- serve the peacock -- fac-simile of a woodcut in a edition of virgil folio publish at lyon in 1517 -rrb- game -- we forefather include among the bird which now constitute feathered game the heron the crane the crow the swan the stork the cormorant and the bittern these supply the best table especially the first three which be look upon as exquisite food fit even for royalty and be reckon as thorough french delicacy there be at that time heronry as at a later period there be pheasantry people also eat bird of prey and only reject those which feed on carrion swan which be much appreciate be very common on all the principal river of france especially in the north a small island below paris have take its name from these bird and have maintain it ever since it be proverbially say that the charente be border with swan and for this same reason valencienne be call _ val des cygnes _ or the swan valley some author make it appear that for a long time young game be avoid owe to the little nourishment it contain and its indigestibility and assert that it be only when some french ambassador return from venice that the french learn that young partridge and leveret be exquisite and quite fit to appear at the most sumptuous banquet the ménagier give not only various receipt for cook they but also for dress chicken when game be out of season so as to make they taste like young partridge there be a time when they fatten pheasant as they do capon it be a secret say liébault only know to the poultry dealer but although they be much appreciate the pullet be more so and realize as much as two crown each -lrb- this do not mean the gold crown but a current coin worth three livre -rrb- plover which sometimes come from beauce in cart-load be much relish they be roasted without be draw as also be turtle-dove and lark for say a ancient author lark only eat small pebble and sand dove grain of juniper and scented herb and plover feed on air at a later period the same honor be confer on woodcock thrush starling blackbird quail and partridge be in equal repute accord to the season the _ bec-figue _ a small bird like a nightingale be so much esteem in provence that there be feast at which that bird alone be serve prepare in various way but of all bird use for the table none could be compare to the young cuckoo take just as it be full fledge as far as we can ascertain the gaul have a dislike to the flesh of rabbit and they do not even hunt they for accord to strabo southern gaul be infested with these mischievous animal which destroy the grow crop and even the bark of the tree there be considerable change in this respect a few century later for every one in town or country rear domesticated rabbit and the wild one form a article of food which be much in request in order to ascertain whether a rabbit be young strabo tell we we should feel the first joint of the fore-leg when we shall find a small bone free and movable this method be adopt in all kitchen in the present day hare be prefer to rabbit provide they be young for a old french proverb say a old hare and a old goose be food for the devil -lrb- illustration : fig 96 -- the way to skin and cut up a stag -- fac-simile of a miniature of phoebus and he staff for hunting wild animal -lrb- manuscript of the fifteenth century

doctor speak of fried slice of the young horn of the stag as the daintiest of food and the ménagier de paris show how as early as the fourteenth century beef be dish up like bear 's - flesh venison for the use of kitchen in country where the black bear do not exist this prove that bear 's flesh be in those day consider good food milk butter egg and cheese -- these article of food the first which nature give to man be not always and everywhere uniformly permit or prohibit by the church on fast day the faithful be for several century leave to they own judgment on the subject in fact there be nothing extraordinary in egg be eat in lend without scruple consider that some theologian maintain that the hen which lay they be animal of aquatic extraction it appear however that butter either from prejudice or mere custom be only use on fast day in its fresh state and be not allow to be use for cooking purpose at first and especially amongst the monk the dish be prepare with oil but as in some country oil be apt to become very expensive and the supply even to fail totally animal fat or lard have to be substitute at a subsequent period the church authorise the use of butter and milk but on this point the discipline vary much in the fourteenth century charle v king of france have ask pope gregory xi for a dispensation to use milk and butter on fast day in consequence of the bad state of he health bring on owe to a attempt have be make to poison he the supreme pontiff require a certificate from a physician and from the king 's confessor he even then only grant the dispensation after impose on that christian king the repetition of a certain number of prayer and the performance of certain pious deed in defiance of the severity of ecclesiastical authority we find in the journal of a bourgeois of pari that in the unhappy reign of charle vi -lrb- 1420 -rrb- for want of oil butter be eat in lend the same as on ordinary non-fast day in 1491 queen anne duchess of brittany in order to obtain permission from the pope to eat butter in lend represent that brittany do not produce oil neither do it import it from southern country many northern province adopt necessity as the law and have no oil use butter and thence originate that famous toast with slice of bread and butter which form such a important part of flemish food these papal dispensation be however only earn at the price of prayer and alms and this be the origin of the _ tronc pour le beurre _ that be alms-box for butter which be still to be see in some of the flemish church -lrb- illustration : fig 97 -- the manufacture of oil draw and engrave by j amman in the sixteenth century -rrb- it be not know when butter be first salt in order to preserve it or to send it to distant place but this process which be so simple and so natural date no doubt from very ancient time it be particularly practice by the norman and breton who enclose the butter in large earthenware jar for in the statute which be give to the fruiterer of pari in 1412 mention be make of salt butter in earthenware jar lorraine only export butter in such jar the fresh butter most in request for the table in pari be that make at vanvre which in the month of may the people eat every morning mix with garlic the consumption of butter be greatest in flander i be surprised say bruyérin champier speaking of that country that they have not yet try to turn it into drink in france it be mockingly call _ beurrière _ and when any one have to travel in that country he be advise to take a knife with he if he wish to taste the good roll of butter -lrb- illustration : fig 98 -- a dealer in egg -- fac-simile of a woodcut after cesare vecellio sixteenth century -rrb- it be not necessary to state that milk and cheese follow the fortune of butter in the catholic world the same as egg follow those of poultry but butter have be declare lawful by the church a claim be put in for egg -lrb- fig 98 -rrb- and pope julius iii grant this dispensation to all christendom although certain private church do not at once choose to profit by this favor the greek have always be more rigid on these point of discipline than the people of the west it be to the prohibition of egg in lend that the origin of easter egg must be trace these be harden by boil they in a madder bath and be bring to receive the blessing of the priest on good Friday and be then eat on the follow Sunday as a sign of rejoice ancient gaul be celebrate for some of its home-made cheese pliny praise those of nisme and of mount lozère in gévaudau martial mention those of toulouse & c a simple anecdote hand down by the monk of st gall who write in the ninth century prove to we that the tradition with regard to cheese be not lose in the time of charlemagne : the emperor in one of he travels alight suddenly and without be expect at the house of a bishop it be on a Friday the prelate have no fish and do not dare to set meat before the prince he therefore offer he what he have get some boil corn and green cheese charle eat of the cheese but take the green part to be bad he take care to remove it with he knife the bishop see this take the liberty of tell he guest that this be the best part the emperor tasting it find that the bishop be right and consequently order he to send he annually two case of similar cheese to aix-la-chapelle the bishop answer that he could easily send cheese but he could not be sure of send they in proper condition because it be only by open they that you could be sure of the dealer not have deceive you in the quality of the cheese ` well ' say the emperor ` before send they cut they through the middle so as to see if they be what i want you will only have to join the two half again by means of a wooden peg and you can then put the whole into a case ' under the king of the third french dynasty a cheese be make at the village of chaillot near pari which be much appreciate in the capital in the twelfth and thirteenth century the cheese of champagne and of brie which be still manufacture be equally popular and be hawk in the street accord to the book of street-cry in paris -- j' be bon fromage de champaigne or i a fromage de brie -lrb- buy my cheese from champagne and my cheese from brie -rrb- eustache deschamp go so far as to say that cheese be the only good thing which could possibly come from brie the ménagier de paris praise several kind of cheese the name of which it would now be difficult to trace owe to they frequent change during four hundred year but accord to the gallic author of this collection a cheese to be presentable at table be require to possess certain quality -lrb- in proverbial latin non argus nee helena nee maria magdalena & c -rrb- thus express in french rhyme : -- non

by retail in the town be well acquaint with the method of increase its quantity at the expense of its quality he describe how he _ froumentée _ which consist of a sort of soup be make and state that when he send he cook to make she purchase at the milk market hold in the neighborhood of the rue de la savonnerie des ecrivain and de la vieille-monnaie he enjoin she particularly to get very fresh cow 's milk and to tell the person who sell it not to do so if she have put water to it for unless it be quite fresh or if there be water in it it will turn fish and shellfish -- freshwater fish which be much more abundant in former day than now be the ordinary food of those who live on the border of lake pond or river or who at all event be not so far distant but that they could procure it fresh there be of course much diversity at different period and in different country as regard the estimation in which the various kind of fish be hold thus ausone who be a native of bordeaux speak highly of the delicacy of the perch and assert that shad pike and tench should be leave to the lower order a opinion which be subsequently contradict by the inhabitant of other part of gaul and even by the countryman of the latin poet gregory of tour who loudly praise the geneva trout but a time arrive when the higher class prefer the freshwater fish of orchy in flander and even those of the lyonnai thus we see in the thirteenth century the barbel of saint-florentin hold in great estimation whereas two hundred year later a man who be of no use or a nonentity be say to resemble a barbel which be

fish besides salt and fresh herring a enormous amount of salted mackerel which be almost as much use be bring from the sea-coast in addition to flat-fish gurnet skate fresh and salted whiting and codfish in a old document of the thirteenth century about fifty kind of fish be enumerate which be retail in the market of the kingdom and a century later the ménagier give receipt for cooking forty kind amongst which appear under the name of _ craspoi _ the salted flesh of the whale which be also call _ le lard de carême _ this coarse food which be send from the northern sea in enormous slice be only eat by the lower order for accord to a writer of the sixteenth century be it cook even for twenty-four hour it would still be very hard and indigestible the proverbe of the thirteenth century which mention the freshwater fish then in vogue also name the sea-fish most preferred and whence they come namely the shad from bordeaux the conger from la rochelle the sturgeon from blaye the fresh herring from fécamp and the cuttle-fish from coutance at a later period the conger be not eat from its be suppose to produce the plague the turbot john-dory skate and sole which be very dear be reserve for the rich the fisherman feed on the sea-dragon a great quantity of the small sea crayfish be bring into market and in certain country these be call _ santé _ because the doctor recommend they to invalid or those in consumption on the other hand freshwater crayfish be not much esteem in the fifteenth and sixteenth century except for they egg which be prepare with spice it be well know that pond frog be a favorite food of the gaul and frank they be never out of fashion in the rural district and be serve at the best table dress with green sauce at the same period and especially during lend snail which be serve in pyramid-shaped dish be much appreciate so much so that noble and bourgeois cultivate snail bed somewhat resemble we oyster bed of the present day the inhabitant of the coast at all period eat various kind of shell-fish which be call in italy sea-fruit but it be only towards the twelfth century that the idea be entertain of bring oyster to pari and mussel be not know there until much later it be notorious that henry iv be a great oyster-eater sully relate that when he be create a duke the king come without be expect to take he seat at the reception banquet but as there be much delay in go to dinner he begin by eat some _ huîtres de chasse _ which he find very fresh by _ huîtres de chasse _ be mean those oyster which be bring by the _ chasse-marées _ carrier who bring the fresh fish from the coast to pari at great speed beverage -- beer be not only one of the oldest ferment beverage use by man but it be also the one which be most in vogue in the middle age if we refer to the tale of the greek historian we find that the gaul -- who like the egyptian attribute the discovery of this refreshing drink to they god osiri -- have two sort of beer : one call _ zythus _ make with honey and intend for the rich the other call _ corma _ in which there be no honey and which be make for the poor but pliny assert that beer in gallie be call _ cerevisium _ and the grain employ for make it _ brasce _ this testimony seem true as from _ brasce _ or _ brasse _ come the name _ brasseur _ -lrb- brewer -rrb- and from _ cerevisium cervoise _ the generic name by which beer be know for century and which only lately fall into disuse -lrb- illustration : fig 104 -- the great drinker of the north -- fac-simile of a woodcut of the histoire des pay septentrionaux by olaus magnus 16mo antwerp 1560 -rrb- after a great famine domitian order all the vine in gaul to be uproot so as to make room for corn this rigorous measure must have cause beer to become even more general and although two century later probus allow vine to be replant the use of beverage make from grain become a established custom but in time whilst the people still only drink _ cervoise _ those who be able to afford it buy wine and drink it alternately with beer however as by degree the vineyard increase in all place have a suitable soil and climate the use of beer be almost entirely give up so that in central gaul wine become so common and cheap that all could drink it in the northern province where the vine would not grow beer naturally continue to be the national beverage -lrb- fig 104 -rrb- in the time of charlemagne for instance we find the emperor wisely order that person know how to brew should be attach to each of he farm everywhere the monastic house possess brewery but as early as the reign of st loui there be only a very few brewery in pari itself and in spite of all the privilege grant to they corporation even these be soon oblige to leave the capital where there cease to be any demand for the produce of they industry they reappear in 1428 probably in consequence of the political and commercial relation which have become establish between pari and the rich town of the flemish bourgeoisie and then either on account of the dearness of wine or the caprice of fashion the consumption of beer again become so general in france that accord to the journal d'un bourgeois de paris it produce to the revenue two-third more than wine it must be understand however that in time of scarcity as in the year 1415 and 1482 brewing be temporarily stop and even forbid altogether on account of the quantity of grain which be thereby withdraw from the food supply of the people -lrb- fig 105 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 105 -- the brewer design and engrave in the sixteenth century by j amman -rrb- under the roman the real _ cervoise _ or beer be make with barley but at a later period all sort of grain be indiscriminately use and it be only towards the end of the sixteenth century that add the flower or seed of hop to the oats or barley which form the basis of this beverage be think of estienne boileau 's book of trade edit in the thirteenth century show we that besides the _ cervoise _ another sort of beer be know which be call _ godale _ this name we should imagine be derive from the two german word _ god ael _ which mean good beer and be of a stronger description than the ordinary _ cervoise _ this idea be prove by the picard and flemish people call it double beer in any case it be from the word _ godale _ that the familiar expression of _ godailler _ -lrb- to tipple -rrb- be derive in fact there be hardly any sort of mixture or ingredient which have not be use in the making of beer accord to the fashion of the different period when on the return from the crusade the use of spice have become the fashion beverage as well as the food be load with it allspice juniper resin apple bread-crumbs sage lavender gentian cinnamon and laurel be each throw into it the english sugared it and the german salt it and at time they even go so far as to put darnel into it at the risk of render the mixture poisonous the object of these various mixture be naturally to obtain high-flavoured beer which become so much in fashion that to describe the want of merit of person or the lack of value in anything no simile be more common than to compare they to small beer nevertheless more delicate and less blunt palate be to be find which could appreciate beer sweeten simply with honey or scented with ambergris or raspberry it be possible however that these composition refer to mixture in which beer the produce of fermented grain be confound with hydromel or fermented honey both these primitive drink claim a origin equally remote which be bury in the most distant period of history and they have be use in all part of the world be mention in the oldest historical record in the bible the edda and in the sacred book of indium in the thirteenth century hydromel which then bear the name of _ borgérafre borgéraste _ or _ bochet _ be compose of one part of honey to twelve part of water scented with herb and allow to ferment for a month or six week this beverage which in the custom and statute of the order of cluny be term _ potus dulcissimus _ -lrb- the sweetest beverage -rrb- and which must have be both agreeable in taste and smell be specially appreciate by the monk who feast on it on the great anniversary of the church besides this a inferior quality of _ bochet _ be make for the consumption of the lower order and peasant out of the honeycomb after the honey have be drain away or with the scum which rise during the fermentation of the better quality -lrb- illustration : fig 106 -- the vintager after a miniature of the dialogue de saint gregoire -lrb- thirteenth century -rrb- -- manuscript of the royal library of brussels -rrb- cider -lrb- in latin _ sicera _ -rrb- and perry can also both claim a very ancient origin since they be mention by pliny it do not appear however that the gaul be acquaint with they the first historical mention of they be make with reference to a repast which thierry ii king of burgundy and orlean -lrb- 596-613 -rrb- son of childebert and grandson of queen brunehaut give to st colomban in which both cider and wine be use in the thirteenth century a latin poet -lrb- guillaume le breton -rrb- say that the inhabitant of the auge and of normandy make cider they daily drink but it be not likely that this beverage be send away from the locality where it be make for besides the fact that the ménagier only very curtly mention a drink make of apple we know that in the fifteenth century the parisian be satisfy with pour water on apple and steep they so as to extract a sort of half-sour half-sweet drink call _ dépense _ besides this paulmier de grandmesnil a norman by birth a famous doctor and the author of a latin treatise on wine and cider -lrb- 1588 -rrb- assert that half a century before cider be very scarce at rouen and that in all the district of caux the people only drink beer duperron add that the norman bring cider from biscay when they crop of apple fail by whom and at what period the vine be naturalised in gaul have be a long-disputed question which in spite of the most careful research remain unsolved the most plausible opinion be that which attribute the honor of have import the vine to the phoenician colony who found marseille pliny make mention of several wine of the gaul as be highly esteem he nevertheless reproach the vine-grower of marseille bezier and narbonne with doctoring they wine and with infuse various drug into they which render they disagreeable and even unwholesome -lrb- fig 106 -rrb- dioscoride however approve of the custom in use among the allobroge of mix resin with they wine to preserve they and prevent they from turn sour as the temperature of they country be not warm enough thoroughly to ripen the grape root up by order of domitian in 92 as state above the vine only reappear in gaul under protus who revoke in 282 the imperial edict of he predecessor after which period the gallic wine soon recover they ancient celebrity under the dominion of the frank who hold wine in great favor vineyard property be one of those which the barbaric law protect with the greatest care we find in the code of the salian and in that of the visigoth very severe penalty for uproot a vine or steal a bunch of grape the cultivation of the vine become general and king themselves plant they even in the garden of they city palace in 1160 there be still in pari near the louvre a vineyard of such a extent that loui vii could annually present six hogshead of wine make from it to the rector of st nichola philip augustus possess about twenty vineyard of excellent quality in various part of he kingdom the culture of the vine have thus develop the wine trade acquire a enormous importance in france gascony auni and saintonge send they wine to flander guyenne send hers to england froissart write that in 1372 a merchant fleet of quite two hundred sail come from london to bordeaux for wine this flourish trade receive a severe blow in the sixteenth century for a awful famine have invade france in 1566 charle ix do not hesitate to repeat the act of domitian and to order all the vine to be uproot and they place to be sow with corn fortunately henry iii soon after modify this edict by simply recommend the governor of the province to see that the plough be not be neglect in they district on account of the excessive cultivation of the vine -lrb- illustration : fig 107 -- interior of a hostelry -- fac-simile of a woodcut in a folio edition of virgil publish at lyon in 1517 -rrb- although the trade of a wine-merchant be one of the oldest establish in paris it do not follow that the retail sale of wine be exclusively carry on by special tradesman on the contrary for a long time the owner of the vineyard retail the wine which he have not be able to sell in the cask a broom a laurel-wreath or some other sign of the sort hang over a door denote that any one passing could purchase or drink wine within when the wine-grower do not have the quality and price of they wine announce in the village or town by the public crier they place a man before the door of they cellar who entice the public to enter and taste the new wine other proprietor instead of sell for people to take away in they own vessel establish a tavern in some room of they house where they retail drink -lrb- fig 107 -rrb- the monk who make wine extensively also open these tavern in the monastery as they only consume part of they wine themselves and this system be universally adopt by wine-grower and even by the king and the noble the latter however have this advantage that whilst they be retail they wine no one in the district be allow to enter into competition with they this prescriptive right which be call _ droit de ban-vin _ be still in force in the seventeenth century saint loui grant special statute to the wine-merchant in 1264 but it be only three century later that they form a society which be divide into four class namely hotel-keepers publichouse-keeper tavern proprietor and dealer in wine _ à pot _ that be sell to people to take away with they hotel-keeper also call _ aubergiste _ accommodate traveller and also put up horse and carriage the dealer _ à pot _ sell wine which could not be drunk on they premise there be generally a sort of window in they door through which the empty pot be pass to be return fill : hence the expression still in use in the eighteenth century _ vente a huis coupé _ -lrb- sale through a cut door -rrb- publichouse-keeper supply drink as well as _ nappe et assiette _ -lrb- tablecloth and plate -rrb- which mean that refreshment be also serve and lastly the _ tavernier _ sell wine to be drunk on the premise but without

montargis marne meulan and orléanais amongst the latter there be one which be much appreciate by henry i and of which he keep a store to stimulate he courage when he join he army the little fable of the battle of wine compose in the thirteenth century by henrus d'andely mention a number of wine which have to this day maintain they reputation : for instance the beaune in burgundy the saint-emilion in gruyenne the chabli epernay sézanne in champagne & c but he place above all with good reason accord to the taste of those day the saint-pourçain of auvergne which be then most expensive and in great request another french poet in describe the luxurious habit of a young man of fashion say that he drink nothing but saint-pourçain and in a poem compose by jean bruyant secretary of the châtelet of pari in 1332 we find du saint-pourçain que l'on meet en son sein pour sain -lrb- saint-pourçain wine which you imbibe for the good of you health -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 110 -- banner of the cooper of bayonne -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 111 -- banner of the cooper of la rochelle -rrb- towards 1400 the vineyard of aï become celebrated for champagne as those of beaune be for burgundy and it be then that we find accord to the testimony of the learn paulmier de grandmesnil king and queen make champagne they favorite beverage tradition have it that franci i charles quint henry viii and pope leon x all possess vineyard in champagne at the same time burgundy that pure and pleasant wine be not despise and it be in its honor that erasmus say happy province she may well call herself the mother of man since she produce such milk nevertheless the above-mentioned physician paulmier prefer to burgundy if not perhaps for they flavor yet for they wholesomeness the vine of the _ ile de france _ or _ vins français _ which agree he say with scholar invalid the bourgeois and all other person who do not devote themselves to manual labor for they do not parch the blood like the wine of gascony nor fly to the head like those of orlean and château-thierry nor do they cause obstruction like those of bordeaux this be also the opinion of baccius who in he latin treatise on the natural history of wine -lrb- 1596 -rrb- assert that the wine of pari be in no way inferior to those of any other district of the kingdom these thin and sour wine so much esteem in the first period of monarchy and so long abandon first lose favor in the reign of franci i who prefer the strong and stimulating production of the south notwithstanding the great number of excellent wine make in they own country the french import from other land in the thirteenth century in the battle of wine we find those of aquilum spain and above all those of cyprus speak of in high term a century later eustace deschamp praise the rhine wine and those of greece malmsey and grenache in a edict of charle vi mention be also make of the muscatel rosette and the wine of lieppe generally the malmsey which be drunk in france be a artificial preparation which have neither the color nor taste of the cyprian wine olivier de serre tell we that in he time it be make with water honey clary juice beer grounds and brandy at first the same name be use for the natural wine mull and spice which be produce in the island of madeira from the grape which the portuguese bring there from cyprus in 1420 the reputation which this wine acquire in europe induce franci i to import some vine from greece and he plant fifty acre with they near fontainebleau it be at first consider that this plant be succeed so well that there be hope say olivier de serre that france would soon be able to furnish she own malmsey and greek wine instead of have to import they from abroad it be evident however that they soon give up this delusion and that for want of the genuine wine they return to artificial beverage such as _ vin cuit _ or cook wine which have at all time be cleverly prepare by boil down new wine and add various aromatic herb to it many wine be make under the name of _ herbés _ which be merely infusion of wormwood myrtle hyssop rosemary & c mixed with sweeten wine and flavor with honey the most celebrated of these beverage bear the pretentious name of nectar those compose of spice asiatic aromatic and honey be generally call white wine a name indiscriminately apply to liquor have for they basis some slightly color wine as well as to the hypocra which be often compose of a mixture of foreign liqueur this hypocra play a prominent part in the romance of chivalry and be consider a drink of honor be always offer to king prince and noble on they solemn entry into a town -lrb- illustration : fig 112 -- butler at he duty -- fac-simile from a woodcut in the cosmographie universelle of munster folio basle 1549 -rrb- the name of wine be also give to drink compose of the juice of certain fruit and in which grape be in no way use these be the cherry the currant the raspberry and the pomegranate wine also the _ moré _ make with the mulberry which be so extol by the poet of the thirteenth century we must also mention the sour wine which be make by pour water on the refuse grape after the wine have be extract also the drink make from filbert milk of almond the syrup of apricot and strawberry and cherry and raspberry water all of which be refreshing and be principally use in summer and lastly _ tisane _ sell by the confectioner of pari and make hot or cold with prepared barley dry grape plum date gum or liquorice this _ tisane _ may be consider as the origin of that drink which be now sell to the poor at a sous a glass and which most assuredly have not much improve since olden time it be about the thirteenth century that brandy first become know in france but it do not appear that it be recognize as a liqueur before the sixteenth the celebrated physician arnauld de villeneuve who write at the end of the thirteenth century to whom credit have wrongly be give for invent brandy employ it as one of he remedy and thus express himself about it : who would have believe that we could have derive from wine a liquor which neither resemble it in nature color or effect this _ eau de vin _ be call by some _ eau de vie _ and justly so since it prolong life it prolong health dissipate superfluous matter revive the spirit and preserve youth alone or add to some other proper remedy it cure colic dropsy paralysis ague gravel & c at a period when so many doctor alchemist and other learn man make it they principal occupation to try to discover that marvellous golden fluid which be to free the human race of all its original infirmity the discovery of such a elixir could not fail to attract the attention of all such manufacturer of panacea it be therefore under the name of _ eau d'or _ -lrb- _ aqua aurus _ -rrb- that brandy first become know to the world a name improperly give to it imply as it do that it be of mineral origin whereas its beautiful golden color be cause by the addition of spice at a later period when it lose its repute as a medicine they actually sprinkle it with pure gold leave and at the same time that it cease to be exclusively consider as a remedy it become a favorite beverage it be also employ in distillery especially as the basis of various strengthen and exciting liqueur most of which have descend to we some come from monastery and other from châteaux where they have be manufacture the kitchen soup broth and stew & c -- the french word _ potage _ must originally have signify a soup compose of vegetable and herb from the kitchen garden but from the remotest time it be apply to soup in general as the gaul accord to athenæus generally eat they meat boil we must presume that they make soup with the water in which it be cook it be related that one day gregory of tour be sit at the table of king chilpéric when the latter offer he a soup specially make in he honor from chicken the poem of the twelfth and thirteenth century mention soup make of pea of bacon of vegetable and of groat in the southern province there be soup make of almond and of olive oil when du gueselin go out to fight the english knight william of blancbourg in single combat he first eat three sort of soup make with wine in honor of the three person in the holy trinity -lrb- illustration : fig 113 -- interior of a kitchen of the sixteenth century -- fac-simile from a woodcut in the calendarium romanum of jean staéffler folio tubingen 1518 -rrb- we find in the ménagier amongst a long list of the common soup the receipt for which be give soup make of dry pea and the water in which bacon have be boil and in lend salted-whale water watercress soup cabbage soup cheese soup and _ gramose _ soup which be prepare by add stewed meat to the water in which meat have already be boil and add beaten egg and verjuice and lastly the _ souppe despourvue _ which be rapidly make at the hotel for unexpected traveller and be a sort of soup make from the odds and end of the larder in those day there be no doubt but that hot soup form a indispensable part of the daily meal and that each person take it at least twice a day accord to the old proverb : -- soupe la soir soupe le matin c'est l'ordinaire du bon chrétien -lrb- soup in the evening and soup in the morning be the everyday food of a good christian -rrb- the cooking apparatus of that period consist of a whole glittering array of cauldron saucepan kettle and vessel of red and yellow copper which hardly suffice for all the rich soup for which france be so famous thence the old proverb en france sont les grands soupier but besides these soup which be in fact look upon as common and without spice a number of dish be serve under the generic name of soup which constitute the principal luxury at the great table in the fourteenth century but which do not altogether bear out the name under which we find they for instance there be haricot mutton a sort of stew thin chicken broth veal broth with herb soup make of veal roe stag wild boar pork hare and rabbit soup flavor with green pea & c the greater number of these soup be very rich very expensive several be serve at the same time and in order to please the eye as well as the taste they be generally make of various color sweeten with sugar and sprinkle with pomegranate seed and aromatic herb such as marjoram sage thyme sweet basil savoury & c -lrb- illustration : fig 114 -- coppersmith design and engrave in the sixteenth century by j amman -rrb- these description of soup be perfect luxury and be take instead of sweet as a proof of this we must refer to the famous _ soupe dorée _ the description of which be give by taillevent head cook of charle vii in the follow word toast slice of bread throw they into a jelly make of sugar white wine yolk of egg and rosewater when they be well soaked fry they then throw they again into the rosewater and sprinkle they with sugar and saffron -lrb- illustration : fig 115 -- kitchen

some favor but we can not say the same for those make with mustard hemp-seed millet verjuice and a number of other much in repute at that period for we see in rabelai that the french be the greatest soup eater in the world and boast to be the inventor of seventy sort we have already remark that broth be in use at the remotest period for from the time that the practice of boil various meat be first adopt it must have be discover that the water in which they be so boil become savoury and nourishing in the time of the great king franci i say noël du fail in he conte d'eutrapel in many place the saucepan be put on to the table on which there be only one other large dish of beef mutton veal and bacon garnish with a large bunch of cook herb the whole of which mixture compose a porridge and a real restorer and elixir of life from this come the adage ` the soup in the great pot and the dainty in the hotch-potch ' at one time they make what they imagine to be strengthen broth for invalid though they virtue must have be somewhat delusive for after have boil down various material in a close kettle and at a slow fire they then distil from this and the water thus obtain be administer as a sovereign remedy the common sense of bernard palissy do not fail to make he see this absurdity and to protest against this ridiculous custom : take a capon he say a partridge or anything else cook it well and then if you smell the broth you will find it very good and if you taste it you will find it have plenty of flavor so much so that you will feel that it contain something to invigorate you distil this on the contrary and take the water then collect and taste it and you will find it insipid and without smell except that of burn this should convince you that you restorer do not give that nourishment to the weak body for which you recommend it as a means of make good blood and restore and strengthen the spirit the taste for broth make of flour be formerly almost universal in france and over the whole of europe it be speak of repeatedly in the history and annals of monastery and we know that the norman who make it they principal nutriment be surname _ bouilleux _ they be indeed almost like the roman who in olden time before they war with eastern nation give up make bread and eat they corn simply boil in water in the fourteenth century the broth and soup be make with millet-flour and mixed wheat the pure wheat flour be steep in milk seasoned with sugar saffron honey sweet wine or aromatic herb and sometimes butter fat and yolk of egg be add it be on account of this that the bread of the ancient so much resemble cake and it be also from this fact that the art of the pastrycook take its rise wheat make into gruel for a long time be a important ingredient in cooking be the basis of a famous preparation call _ fromentée _ which be a _ bouillie _ of milk make creamy by the addition of yolk of egg and which serve as a liquor in which to roast meat and fish there be besides several sort of _ fromentée _ all equally esteemed and taillevent recommend the follow receipt which differ from the one above give : -- first boil you wheat in water then put into it the juice or gravy of fat meat or if you like it better milk of almond and by this mean you will make a soup fit for fast because it dissolve slowly be of slow digestion and nourish much in this way too you can make _ ordiat _ or barley soup which be more generally approve than the say _ fromentée _ -lrb- illustration : fig 116 -- interior of a kitchen -- fac-simile from a woodcut in the

century pie stew roast salad & c -- pastry make with fat which might be suppose to have be the invention of modern kitchen be in great repute amongst we ancestor the manufacture of sweet and savoury pastry be intrust to the care of the good _ ménagiers _ of all rank and condition and to the corporation of pastrycook who obtain they statute only in the middle of the sixteenth century the unite skill of these both in pari and in the province multiply the different sort of tart and meat pie to a very great extent so much be this the case that these ingenious production become a special art worthy of rival even cookery itself -lrb- fig 117 118 and 130 -rrb- one of the earliest known receipt for make pie be that of gaces de la bigne first chaplain of king john charle v and charle vi we find it in a sport poem and it deserve to be quote verbatim as a record of the royal kitchen of the fourteenth century it will be observe on peruse it that nothing be spare either in pastry or in cookery and that expense be not consider when it be a question of satisfy the appetite troi perdriaulx gro et reffais au milieu du paté I met mais gardes bien que tu ne failles a moi prendre six gross

to take six fine quail to put by they side after that you must take a dozen skylark which round the quail you must place and then you must take some thrush and such other little bird as you can get to garnish the pie further you must provide yourself with a little bacon which must not be in the least rank -lrb- reasty -rrb- and you must cut it into piece of the size of a die and sprinkle they into the pie if you want it to be in quite good form you must put some sour grape in and a very little salt have egg put into the paste and the crust make rather hard of the flour of pure wheat put in neither spice nor cheese put it into the oven just at the proper heat the bottom of which must be quite free from ash and when it be baked enough be not that a dish to feast on -rrb- from this period

equal they variety for on a bill of fare of a banquet of that period we find more than fifty different sort of _ potage _ mention the greater number of these dish have disappear from we book on cookery have go out of fashion but there be two stew which be popular during many century and which have maintain they reputation although they do not now exactly represent what they formerly do the _

bread crumb cinnamon ginger & c -lrb- fig 119 -rrb- the highest aim of the cook of the taillevent school be to make dish not only palatable but also please to the eye these master in the art of cooking might be say to be both sculptor and painter so much do they decorate they work they object be to surprise or amuse the guest by conceal the real nature of the disbe froissart speaking of a repast give in he time say that there be a number of dish so curious and disguise that it be impossible to guess what they be for instance the bill of fare above refer to mention a lion and a sun make of white chicken a pink jelly with diamond-shaped point and as if the object of cookery be to disguise food and deceive epicure taillevent facetiously give we a receipt for make fried or roast butter and for cooking egg on the spit -lrb- illustration : fig 119 -- interior of italian kitchen -- fac-simile of a woodcut in the book on cookery of christoforo di messisburgo banchetti compositioni di vivende 4to ferrara 1549 -rrb- the roast be as numerous as the stew a treatise of the fourteenth century name about thirty beginning with a sirloin of beef which must have be one of the most common and end with a swan which appear on table in full plumage this last be the triumph of cookery inasmuch as it present this magnificent bird to the eye of the astonished guest just as if he be live and swim he beak be gilt he body silver rest ` on a mass of brown pastry paint green in order to represent a grass field eight banner of silk be place round and a cloth of the same material serve as a

of all present the mode of prepare other roast much resemble the present system in they simplicity with this difference that strong meat be first boil to render they tender and no roast be ever hand over to the skill of the carver without first be thoroughly baste with orange juice and rise water and cover with sugar and powdered spice we must not forget to mention the broiled dish the invention of which be attribute to hunter and which rabelai continually refer to as act as stimulant and irresistibly exciting the thirst for wine at the sumptuous feast of those voracious hero -lrb- fig 120 -rrb- the custom of introduce salad after roast be already establish in the fifteenth century however a salad of whatever sort be never bring to table in its natural state for besides the raw herb dress in the same manner as in we day it contain several mixture such as cook vegetable and the crest liver or brain of poultry after the salad fish be serve sometimes fry sometimes slice with egg or reduce to a sort of pulp which be call _ carpée _ or _ charpie _ and sometimes it be boil in water or wine with strong seasoning near the salad in the course of the dinner dish of egg prepare in various way be generally serve many of these be now in use such as the poached egg the hard-boiled egg egg sauce & c -lrb- illustration : fig 121 -- shop of a grocer and druggist from a stamp of vriese -lrb- seventeenth century -rrb- -rrb- seasoning -- we have already state that the taste for spice much increase in europe after the crusade and in this rapid historical sketch of the food of the french people in the middle age it must have be observe to what a extent this taste have become develop in france -lrb- fig 121 -rrb- this be the origin of sauce all or almost all of which be highly spiced and be generally use with boil roast or grilled meat a few of these sauce such as the yellow the green and the _ caméline _ become so necessary in cooking that numerous person take to manufacture they by wholesale and they be hawk in the street of pari these sauce-crier be first call _ saulcier _ then _ vinaigriers-moustardiers _ and when loui xii unite they in a body as they business have considerably increase they be term _ sauciers-moutardiers-vinaigrier _ distiller of brandy and spirit of wine and _ buffetier _ -lrb- from _ buffet _ a sideboard -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 122 -- the cook draw and engrave in the sixteenth century by j amman -rrb- but very soon the corporation become divide no doubt from the force of circumstance and on one side we find the distiller and on the other the master-cook and cook or _ porte-chape _ as they be call because when they carry on they business of cooking they cover they dish with a _ chape _ that be a cope or tin cover -lrb- fig 122 -rrb- so as to keep they warm the list of sauce of the fourteenth century give by the ménagier de paris be most complicated but on examine the receipt it become clear that the variety of those preparation intend to sharpen the appetite result principally from the spicy ingredient with which they be flavor and it be here worthy of remark that pepper in these day exclusively obtain from america be know and generally use long before the time of columbus it be mention in a document of the time of clotaire iii -lrb- 660 -rrb- and it be clear therefore that before the discovery of the new world pepper and spice be import into europe from the east mustard which be a ingredient in so many dish be cultivate and manufacture in the thirteenth century in the neighborhood of dijon and anger accord to a popular adage garlic be the medicine -lrb- _ thériaque _ -rrb- of peasant town-people for a long time greatly appreciate _ aillée _ which be a sauce make of garlic and sell ready prepare in the street of paris the custom of use anchovy as a flavoring be also very ancient this be also do with _ botargue _ and _ cavial _ two sort of side-dish which consist of fish ' egg chiefly mullet and sturgeon properly salt or dry and mix with fresh or pickled olive the olive for the use of the lower order be bring from languedoc and provence whereas those for the rich be import from spain and some from syria it be also from the south of france that the rest of the kingdom be supply with olive oil for which to this day those province have preserve they renown but as early as the twelfth and thirteenth century oil of walnut be bring from the center of france to pari and this although cheaper be supersede by oil extract from the poppy truffle though know and esteem by the ancient disappear from the gastronomie collection of we forefather it be only in the fourteenth century that they be again introduce but evidently without a knowledge of they culinary quality since after be preserve in vinegar they be soak in hot water and afterwards serve up in butter we may also here mention sorrel and the common mushroom which be use in cooking during the middle age on the strength of the old proverb sugar have never spoil sauce sugar be put into all sauce which be not _ piquante _ and generally some perfumed water be add to they such as rose-water this be make in great quantity by expose to the sun a basin full of water cover over by another basin of glass under which be a little vase contain rose-leaf this rose-water be add to all stew pastry and beverage it be very doubtful as to the period at which white lump sugar become know in the west however in a account of the house of the dauphin viennoi -lrb- 1333 -rrb- mention be make of white sugar and the author of the ménagier de paris frequently speak of this white sugar which before the discovery or rather colonisation of america be bring ready refine from the grecian island and especially from

extract by pound the green blade of wheat vinegar be originally merely soured wine as the word _ vin-aigre _ denote the mode of manufacture it by artificial means in order to render the taste more pungent and the quality better be very ancient it be needless to state that it be scented by the infusion of herb or flower -- rose elder clove & c but it be not much before the sixteenth century that it be use for pickle herb or fruit and vegetable such as gherkin onion cucumber purslain & c salt which from the remotest period be the condiment _ par excellence _ and the trade in which have be free up to the fourteenth century become from that period the subject of repeat taxation the levying of these tax be a frequent cause of tumult amongst the people who see with marked displeasure the exigency of the excise gradually raise the price of a article of primary necessity we have already mention time during which the price of salt be so exorbitant that the rich alone could put it in they bread thus in the reign of franci i it be almost as dear as indian spice sweet dish dessert & c -- in the fourteenth century the first course of a repast be call _ met _ or _ assiette _ the last _

exclusively attach to chivalry as early as those day powerful and ingenious machine be in use which lower from the story above or raise from that below ready-served table which be make to disappear after use as if by enchantment at that period the table service of the wealthy require a considerable staff of retainer and varlet and at a later period this number be much increase thus for instance when loui of orlean go on a diplomatic mission to germany from he brother charle vi this prince in order that france might be worthily represent abroad raise the number of he household to more than two hundred and fifty person of whom about one hundred be retainer and table attendant olivier de la marche who in he mémoires give the most minute detail of the ceremonial of the court of charle the

originally no other object than that of protect the crop and fruit from bird and other animal whose nature it be to feed on they venery will be first consider sportsman always pride themselves in place xenophon the general philosopher and historian at the head of sport writer although he treatise on the chase -lrb- translate from the greek into latin under the title of de venatione -rrb- which give excellent advice respect the training of dog only speak of trap and net for capture wild animal amongst the greek arrian and oppian and amongst the roman gratius faliscus and nemesianus write on the same subject they work however except in a few isolate or scatter passage do not contain anything about venery properly so call and the first historical information on the subject be to be find in the record of the seventh century long after that period however they still hunt as it be at random attack the first animal they meet the sport of charlemagne for instance be almost always of this description on some occasion they kill animal of all sort by thousand after have track and drive they into a enclosure compose of cloth or net this illustrious emperor although usually at war in all part of europe never miss a opportunity of hunting : so much so that it might be say that he rest himself by gallop through the forest he be on these occasion not only follow by a large number of huntsman and attendant of he household but he be accompany by he wife and daughter mount on magnificent courser and surround by a numerous and elegant court who vie with each other in display they skill and courage in attack the fiercest animal it be even state that aix-la-chapelle owe its origin to a hunting adventure of charlemagne the emperor one day while chase a stag require to cross a brook which come in he path but immediately he horse have set he foot in the water he pull it out again and begin to limp as if it be hurt he noble rider dismount and on feel the foot find it be quite hot this induce he to put he hand into the water which he find to be almost boil on that very spot therefore he cause a chapel to be erect in the shape of a horse 's hoof the town be afterwards build and to this day the spring of hot mineral water be enclose under a rotunda the shape of which remind one of the old legend of charlemagne and he horse the son of charlemagne also hold hunting in much esteem and by degree the art of venery be introduce and carry to great perfection it be not however until the end of the thirteenth century that a anonymous author conceive the idea of write its principal precept in a instructive poem call le dict de la chace du cerf in 1328 another anonymous writer compose the livre du roy modus which contain the rule for hunting all furred animal from the stag to the hare then follow other poet and writer of french prose such as gace de la vigne -lrb- 1359 -rrb- gaston phoebus -lrb- 1387 -rrb- and hardouin lord of fontaine-guérin -lrb- 1394 -rrb- none of these however write exclusively on venery but describe the different sport know in they day towards 1340 alphonse xi king of castile cause a book on hunting to be compile for he use but it be not so popular as the instruction of gaston phoebus -lrb- fig 132 -rrb- if hunting with hound be know everywhere by the french name of the chase it be because the honor of have organize it into a system if not of have originate it be due to the early french sport author who be able to form a code of rule for it this also account for so many of the technical term now in use in venery being of french origin as they be no other than those adopt by these ancient author whose work so to speak have perpetuate they -lrb- illustration : fig 132 -- gaston phoebus teach the art of venery -- fac-simile of

sportsman place themselves under the protection of some special deity among the greek and roman it be diana and phoebe the gaul who have adopt the greater number of the god and goddess of rome invoke the moon when they sally forth to war or to the chase but as soon as they penetrate the sacred obscurity of the forest they appeal more particularly to the goddess _ ardhuina _ whose name of unknown origin have probably since be apply to the immense well-stocked forest of ardenne or ardenne they erect in the depths of the wood monstrous stone figure in honor of this goddess such as the head of stag on the body of man or woman and to propitiate she during the chase they hang round these idol the foot the skin and the horn of the beast they kill cernunno who be always represent with a human head surmount by stag ' horn have a altar even in lutetium which be no doubt in consequence of the great wood which skirt the bank of the seine -lrb- illustration : fig 135 -- how to take a cart to

veneration everybody bedeck it in the same way the largest oak to be find in the district be choose on which to suspend the trophy both of warrior and of hunter and at a more recent period sportsman use to hang outside they door stag ' head boar ' foot bird of prey and other trophy a custom which evidently be a relic of the one refer to on pagan idolatry be abandon hunter use to have a preside genius or protector whom they select from amongst the saint most in renown some choose st germain d'auxerre who have himself be a sportsman other st martin who have be a soldier before he become bishop of tour eventually they all agree to place themselves under the patronage of st hubert bishop of liège a renowned hunter of the eighth century this saint devoted himself to a religious life after one day haying encounter a miraculous stag whilst hunting in the wood which appear to he as bear between he horn a luminous image of we savior at first the feast of st hubert be celebrated four time a year namely at the anniversary of he conversion and death and on the two occasion on which he relic be exhibit at the celebration of each of these feast a large number of sportsman in fine

which for some unknown reason never show itself in a pack of hound this however be not the only superstitious belief attach to the noble and adventurous occupation of the follower of st hubert amongst a number of old legend which mostly belong to germany -lrb- fig 137 -rrb- mention be make of hunter who sell they soul to the devil in exchange for some enchanted arrow which never miss its aim and which reach game at extraordinary distance mention be also make in these legend of various animal which on be pursue by the hunter be miraculously save by throw themselves into the arm of some saint or by run into some holy sanctuary there be besides knight who have hunt all they life believe that they be to continue the same occupation in another world a account be give in history of the apparition of a fiery phantom to charle ix in the forest of lyon and also the ominous meeting of henry iv with the terrible _ grand-veneur _ in the forest of fontainebleau we may account for these strange tale from the fact that hunting formerly constitute a sort of freemasonry with its mysterious rite and its secret language the initiate use particular sign of recognition amongst themselves and they also have lucky and unlucky number emblematical color & c the more dangerous the sport the more it be indulge in by military man the chronicle of the monk of saint-gall describe a adventure which befall charlemagne on the occasion of he set out with he huntsman and hound in order to chase a enormous bear which be the terror of the vosge the bear after have disabled numerous dog and hunter find himself face to face with the emperor who alone dare to stand up before he a fierce combat ensue on the summit of a rock in which both be lock together in a fatal embrace the contest end by the death of the bear charle striking he with he dagger and hurl he down the precipice on this the hill resound with the cry of vive charle le grand from the numerous huntsman and other who have assemble and it be say that this be the first occasion on which the companion of the intrepid monarch give he the title of _ grand _ -lrb- magnus -rrb- so from that time king charle become king _ charlemagne _ this prince be most jealous of he rights of hunting which he would waive to no one for a long time he refuse permission to the monk of the abbey of st deni whom he nevertheless hold in great esteem to have some stag kill which be destroy they forest it be only on condition that the flesh of these animal would serve as food to the monk of inferior order and that they hide should be use for bind the missal that he eventually grant they permission to kill the offend animal -lrb- fig 138 -rrb- if we pass from the ninth to the thirteenth century we find that loui ix king of france be as keen a sportsman and as brave a warrior as any of he ancestor he be indeed as fond of hunting as of war and during he first crusade a opportunity occur to he of hunting the lion as soon as he begin to know the country of cesarea say joinville the king set to work with he people to hunt lion so that they capture many but in do so they incur great bodily danger the mode of take they be this : they pursue they on the swiftest horse when they come near one they shoot a bolt or arrow at he and the animal feeling himself wound run at the first person he could see who immediately turn he horse 's head and flee as fast as he could during he flight he drop a portion of he clothing which the lion catch up and tear think it be the person who have injure he and whilst the lion be thus engage the hunter again approach the infuriate animal and shot more bolt and arrow at he soon the lion leave the cloth and madly rush at some other hunter who adopt the same strategy as before this be repeat until the animal succumb become exhaust by the wound he have receive -lrb- illustration : fig 138 -- nature and appearance of deer and how they can be hunt with dog -- fac-simile of a miniature

to the bourgeoisie to enjoy the sport the condition he make with they be that they should always give a haunch of any animal kill to the lord of the soil it be to this that we must trace the origin of give the animal 's foot to the huntsman or to the person who have the lead of the hunting party loui xi however do not at all act in this liberal manner and although it might have be suppose that the incessant war and political intrigue in which he be constantly engage would have give he no time for amusement of this kind yet he be nevertheless the keenest sportsman of he day this tyrant of the

order he have all the castle as well as the cottage search and any net engine or sport arm find be immediately destroy he only son the heir to the throne be not exempt from these law shut up in the castle of amboise he have no permission to leave it for it be the will of the king that the young prince should remain ignorant of the noble exercise of chivalry one day the dauphin pray he governor m du bouchage with so much earnestness to give he a idea of hunting that this noble consent to make a excursion into the neighbouring wood with he the king however manage to find it out and du bouchage

seem to have have a innate taste for hunting and soon make up for lose time and the privation to which he father have subject he he hunt daily and generously allow the noble to do the same it be scarcely necessary to say that these be not slow in indulge in the privilege thus restore to they and which be one of they most ancient pastime and occupation for it must be remember that in those day of small intellectual culture hunting must have be a great if not at time the only resource against idleness and the monotony of country life everything which related to sport again become the fashion amongst the youth of the nobility and they chief occupation when not engage in war they continue as formerly to invent every sort of sport device for example they obtain from other country trap engine and hunting-weapon they introduce into france at great expense foreign animal which they take great pain in naturalising as game or in training as auxiliary in hunting after have import the reindeer from lapland which do not succeed in they temperate climate and the pheasant from tartary with which they stock the wood they import with greater success the panther and the leopard from africa which be use for furred game as the hawk be for feathered game the mode of hunting with these animal be as follow : the sportsman precede by they dog ride across country each with a leopard sit behind he on he saddle when the dog have start the game the leopard jump off the saddle and spring after it and as soon as it be catch the hunter throw the leopard a piece of raw flesh for which he give up the prey and remount behind he master -lrb- fig 142 -rrb- loui xi charle viii and loui xii often hunt thus the leopard which form a part of the royal venery be keep in a enclosure of the castle of amboise

he brother the effeminate henry iii dislike hunting as he consider it too fatiguing and too dangerous on the other hand accord to sully henry iv _ le béarnais _ who learn hunting in early youth in the pyrenee love all kind of sport and above all the most fatiguing and adventurous pursuit such as those after wolf bear and boar he never miss a chance of hunting even when in face of a enemy if he know a stag to be near he find time to hunt it and we find in the memoirs of sully that the king hunt the day after the famous battle of ivry one day when he be only king of navarre he invite the lady of pau to come and see a bear-hunt happily they refuse for on that occasion they nerve would have be put to a serious test two bear kill two of the horse and several bowman be hug to death by the

favorite royal pastime we have remark that st germain d'auxerre who at a certain period be the patron of sportsman make hunting he habitual relaxation he devote himself to it with great keenness in he youth before he become bishop that be when he be duke of auxerre and general of the troops of the province subsequently when against he will he be raise to the episcopal dignity not only do he give up

some of the most illustrious pope be also great lover of the chase namely julius ii leo x and previously to they pius ii who before become pope amongst other literary and scientific work write a latin treatise on venery under he christian name æneas silvius it be easy to understand how it happen that sport formerly possess such attraction for ecclesiastical dignitary in early life they acquire the taste and habit of people of they rank and they be accordingly extremely jealous of the rights of chase in they domain although pope clement v in he celebrated institution call clémentines have formally forbid the monk to hunt there be few who do not evade the canonical prohibition by pursue furred game and that without consider that they be violate the law of the church the papal edict permit the monk and priest to hunt under certain circumstance and especially where rabbit or beast of prey increase so much as to damage the crop it can easily be imagine that such would always be the case at a period when the people be so strictly forbid to destroy game and therefore hunting be practice at all season in the wood and field in the vicinity of each abbey the jealous peasant not themselves have the right of hunting and who continually see _ master abbot _ pass on he hunting excursion say with malice that the monk never forget to pray for the success of the litter and nest

falconry as be all bird of prey which could be train for purpose of sport all other bird without distinction be declare _ ignoble _ and no exception be make to this rule by the naturalist of the middle age even in favor of the strongest and most magnificent such as the eagle and vulture accord to this capricious classification they consider the sparrow-hawk which be the smallest of the hunting-bird to rank higher than the eagle the nickname of this diminutive sport bird be often apply to a country-gentleman who not be able to afford to keep falcon use the sparrow-hawk to capture

venery great care be take to secure that a bird should continue at one object of prey until he have secure it that be to say it be most essential to teach it not to leave the game he be after in order to pursue another which might come in he way to establish a falconry therefore not only be a very large poultry-yard require but also a considerable staff of huntsman falconer and whip besides a number of horse and dog of all sort which be either use for start the game for the hawk or for run it down when it be force to ground by the bird -lrb- illustration : fig 150 -- varlet of falconry --

a means of subsistence to many of they in this book which be for a long time the authority in matter of sport generally we find that nearly all the method and contrivance now employ for bird-fowling be know and in use in the middle age in addition to some which have since fall into disuse we accordingly read in the roy modus a description of the drag-net the mirror the screech-owl the bird-pipe -lrb- fig 161 -rrb- the trap the spring & c the use of all of which be now well understand at that time when falcon be so much require it be necessary that people should be employ to catch they when

take advantage of this weakness the plan of place a mirror which balance a sort of wicker cage or coop be adopt the pheasant think he see he fellow attack he strike against the glass and bring down the coop in which he have leisure to reflect on he jealousy -lrb- fig 163 -rrb- woodcock which be say the author the most silly bird be catch in this way the bird-fowler be cover from head to foot with clothes of the color of dead leaf only have two little hole for he eye when he see one he kneel down noiselessly and support he arm on two stick so as to keep perfectly still when the bird be not look towards he he cautiously approach it on he knee hold in he hand two little dry stick cover with red cloth which he gently wave so as to divert the bird 's attention from himself in this way he gradually get near enough to pass a noose which he keep ready at the end of a stick round the bird 's neck -lrb- fig 164 -rrb- however ingenious these trick may appear they be eclipse by one we find record in the ixeuticon a very elegant latin poem by angelis de barga write two century later in order to catch a large number of starling this author assure we it be only necessary to have two or three in a cage and when a flight of these bird be see pass to liberate they with a very long twine attach to they claw the twine must be cover with bird-lime and as the release bird instantly join

get it abolish they apply to the authority to protect they rights urge that the approach to they shop the rent of which they pay regularly be continually obstruct by a crowd of purchaser and dealer in bird the case be bring several time before parliament which only confirm the order of the king of france and the ancient privilege of the bird-catcher at the end of the sixteenth century the quarrel become so bitter that the goldsmith and changer take to throw down the cage and bird and trample they under foot and even assault and openly ill-treated the poor bird-dealer but a degree of parliament

for similar amusement be common to the gaul as well as to the whole roman empire and be historian silent on the subject we need no further information than that which be to be gather from the ruin of the numerous amphitheatre which be to be find at every center of roman occupation the circus disappear on the establishment of the christian religion for the bishop condemn it as a profane and sanguinary vestige of paganism and no doubt this lead to the cessation of combat between man and beast they continue however to pit wild or savage animal against one another and to train dog to fight with lion tiger bear and bull otherwise it would be difficult to explain the restoration by king chilpéric -lrb- ad 577 -rrb- of the circus and arena at pari and soisson the remains of one of these

history also send innumerable vessel from its harbor of lubeck -lrb- fig 197 -rrb- and hamburg these carry the merchandise of the northern country into flander and this rich province which excel in

mediterranean extend to all part and gradually become universal the northern state share in it and england which for a long time keep aloof from a stage on which it be destine to play the first part begin to give indication of its future commercial greatness the number of transaction increase as the facility for carry they on become greater consumption be extend production progressively follow and so commerce go on gain strength as it widen its sphere everything in fact seem to contribute to its expansion the downfall of the feudal system and the establishment in each country of a central power more or less strong and respected enable it to extend its operation by land with a degree of security hitherto unknown and at the same time international legislation come in to protect maritime trade which be still expose to great danger the sea which be open freely to the whole human race give robber comparatively easy means of follow they nefarious practice and with less fear of punishment than they could obtain on the shore of civilised country for this reason piracy continue its depredation long after the enactment of severe law for its suppression this maritime legislation do not wait for the sixteenth century to come into existence maritime law be promulgate more or less in the twelfth century but the trouble and agitation which weaken and disorganize empire during that period of the middle age deprive it of its power and efficiency the _ code des rhodiens _ date as far back as 1167 the _ code de la mer _ which become a sort of recognize text-book date from the same period the _ loi d'oléron _ be anterior to the twelfth century and rule the western coast of france be also adopt in flander and in england venice date she most ancient law on maritime rights from

code of law and consular jurisdiction these may be say to have originate in the sixth century in the law of the visigoth which empower foreign trader to be judge by delegate from they own country the venetian have consul in the greek empire as early as the tenth century and we may fairly presume that the french have consul in palestine during the reign of charlemagne in the thirteenth century the town of italy have consular agent in france and marseille have they in savoy in arle and in genoa thus trader of each country be always sure of find justice assistance and protection in all the centre of european commerce numerous facility for barter be add to these advantage merchant who at first travel with they merchandise and who afterwards merely send a factor as they representative finally consign it to foreign agent communication by correspondence in this way become more general and paper replace parchment as be less rare and less expensive the introduction of arabic figure which be more convenient than the roman numeral for make calculation the establishment of bank of which the most ancient be in operation in venice as early as the twelfth century the invention of bill of exchange attribute to the jew and generally in use in the thirteenth century the establishment of insurance against the risk and peril of sea and land and lastly the formation of trading company or what be now call partnership all tend to give expansion and activity to commerce whereby public and private wealth be increase in spite of obstacle which routine envy and ill-will persistently raise against great commercial enterprise for a long time the french through indolence or antipathy -- for it be more to they liking to be occupy with arm and chivalry than with matter of interest and profit -- take but a feeble part in the trade which be carry on so successfully on they own territory the noble be ashamed to mix in commerce consider it unworthy of they and the bourgeois for want of liberal feeling and expansiveness in they idea be satisfy with appropriate merely local trade foreign commerce even of the most lucrative description be hand over to foreigner and especially to jew who be often banish from the kingdom and as frequently ransom though universally despise and hate notwithstanding this they succeed in rise to wealth under the stigma of shame and infamy and the

different occasion various privilege when they frequent the fair of champagne and come to establish themselves in the inland and seaport town these italian constitute the great corporation of money-changer in pari and hoard in they coffer all the coin of the kingdom and in this way cause a perpetual variation in the value of money by which they themselves benefit in the sixteenth century

transitory existence fishery alone succeed and french commerce continue insignificant circumscribe and domestic notwithstanding the increase requirement of luxury at court this luxury contented itself with the use of the merchandise which arrive from the low country spain and italy national industry do all in its power to surmount this ignominious condition she specially turn she attention to the manufacture of silk and of stuff tissue with gold and silver the only practical attempt of the government in the sixteenth century to protect commerce and manufacture be to forbid the import of foreign merchandise and to endeavor to oppose the progress of luxury by rigid enactment certainly the government of that time little understand the advantage which a country derive from commerce when it forbid the higher class from engage in mercantile pursuit under penalty of have they privilege of nobility withdraw from they in the face of the example of italy genoa venice and especially of

discuss without agree on the question of the origin of the corporation of the middle age it may be admit we think _ à priori _ that association of artisan be as ancient as the trade themselves it may readily be imagine that the numerous member of the industrial class have to maintain and defend they common rights and common interest would have seek to establish mutual fraternal association among themselves the deeper we dive into ancient history the clearer we perceive trace more or less distinct of these kind of association to cite only two example which may serve to some extent as a historical parallel to the analogous institution of the present day we may mention the roman _ college _ which be really league of artisan follow the same calling and the scandinavian guild whose object be to assimilate the different branch of industry and trade either of a city or of some particular district indeed brotherhood amongst the labor class always exist under the german conqueror from the moment when europe so long divide into roman province shake off the yoke of subjection to rome although she still adhere to the law and custom of the nation which have hold she in subjection for so many generation we can however only regard the few trace which remain of these brotherhood as evidence of they have once exist and not as indicative of they have be in a flourishing state in the fifth century the hermit ampelius in he legend of the saint mention _ consul _ or chief of locksmith the corporation of goldsmith be speak of as exist in the first dynasty of the french king baker be name collectively in 630 in the law of dagobert which seem to show that they form a sort of trade union at that remote period we also see charlemagne in several of he statute take step in order that the number of person engage in provide food of different kind should everywhere be adequate to provide for the necessity of consumption which would tend to show a general organization of that most important branch of industry in lombardy college of artisan be establish at a early period and be no doubt on the model of the roman one ravenna in 943 possess a college of fisherman and ten year later the record of that town mention a _ chief of the corporation of trader _ and in 1001 a _ chief of the corporation of butcher _ france at the same time keep up a remembrance of the institution of roman gaul and the ancient college of trade still form association and company in pari and in the larger town in 1061 king philip i grant certain privilege to master chandler and oilman the ancient custom of the butcher be mention as early as the time of loui vii 1162 the same king grant to the wife of ive laccobre and she heir the collectorship of the due which be payable by tanner purse-makers currier and shoemaker under philip augustus similar concession become more frequent and it be evident that at that time trade be begin to take root and to require special and particular administration this lead to regulation be draw up for each trade to which philip augustus give he sanction in 1182 he confirm the statute of the butcher and the furrier and draper also obtain favourable concession from he accord to the learn augustin thierry corporation like civic community be engraft on previously exist guild such as on the college or corporation of workman which be of roman origin in the _ guild _ which signify a banquet at common expense there be a mutual assurance against misfortune and injury of all sort such as fire and shipwreck and also against all lawsuit incur for offence and crime even though they be prove against the accuse each of these association be place under the patronage of a god or of a hero and have its compulsory statute each have its chief or president choose from among the member and a common treasury supply by annual contribution roman college as we have already state be establish with a more special purpose and be more exclusively confine to the peculiar trade to which they belong but these equally with the guild possess a common exchequer enjoy equal rights and privilege elect they own president and celebrate in common they sacrifice festival and banquet we have therefore good reason for agree in the opinion of the celebrated historian who consider that in the establishment of a corporation the guild should be to a certain degree the motive power and the roman college with its organization the material which should be use to bring it into existence -lrb- illustration : fig 202 -- craftsman in the fourteenth century -- fac-simile of a miniature of a manuscript in the library of brussels -rrb- it be certain however that during several century corporation be either dissolve or hide from public notice for they almost entirely disappear from the historic record during the partial return to barbarism when the production of object of daily necessity and the preparation of food be entrust to slave under the eye of they master not till the twelfth century do they again begin to flourish and as might be suppose it be italy which give the signal for the resuscitation of the institution whose birthplace have be rome and which barbarism have allow to fall into decay brotherhood of artisan be also found at a early period in the north of gaul whence they rapidly spread beyond the rhine under the emperor henry i that be during the tenth century the ordinary condition of artisan in germany be still serfdom but two century later the greater number of trade in most of the large town of the empire have congregate together in college or body under the name of union -lrb- _ einnungen _ or _ innungen _ -rrb- -lrb- fig 202 -rrb- as for example at gozlar at würzburg at brunswick & c these college however be not establish without much difficulty and without the energetic resistance of the ruling power inasmuch as they often raise they pretension so high as to wish to substitute they authority for the senatorial law and thus to grasp the government of the city the thirteenth century witness obstinate and sanguinary feud between these two party each of which be alternately victorious whichever have the upper hand take advantage of the opportunity to carry out the most cruel reprisal against its defeat opponent the emperor frederick ii and henry vii try to put a end to these strife by abolish the corporation of workman but these powerful association fearlessly oppose the imperial authority in france the organization of community of artisan a organization which in many way be connect with the commercial movement but which must not be confound with it do not give rise to any political difficulty it seem not even to have meet with any opposition from the feudal power who no doubt find it a easy pretext for levy additional rate and tax the most ancient of these corporation be the parisian _ hanse _ or corporation of the bourgeois for canal navigation which probably date its origin back to the college of parisian _ naute _ exist before the roman conquest this mercantile association hold its meeting in the island of lutetium on the very spot where the church of notre-dame be afterwards build from the earliest day of monarchy tradesman constitute entirely the bourgeois of the town -lrb- fig 203 -rrb- above they be the nobility or clergy beneath they the artisan hence we can understand how the bourgeois who during the twelfth and thirteenth century be a distinct section of the community become at last the important commercial body itself the king invariably treat they with favor loui vi grant they new rights loui vii confirm they ancient privilege and philip augustus increase they the parisian hanse succeed in monopolise all the commerce which be carry on by water on the seine and the yonne between mantis and auxerre no merchandise come up or down the stream in boat could be disembark in the interior of pari without become as it be the property of the corporation which through its agent superintend its measurement and its sale in bulk and up to a certain point its sale by retail no foreign merchant be permit to send he goods to pari without first obtain _ lettre de hanse _ whereby he have associate with he a bourgeois of the town who act as he guarantee and who share in he profit -lrb- illustration : fig 203 -- merchant or tradesman of the fourteenth century -- fac-simile of a miniature in a manuscript of the library at brussels -rrb- there be association of the same kind in most of the commercial town situate on the bank of river and on the sea-coast as for example at rouen arle marseille narbonne toulouse ratisbon augsburg and utrecht sometimes neighbour town such as the great manufacturing city of flander agree together and enter into a leagued bond which give they greater power and constitute a offensive and defensive compact -lrb- fig 204 -rrb- a typical example of this last institution be that of the commercial association of the _ hanseatic town _ of germany which be group together to the number of eighty around they four capital viz lubeck cologne dantzic and brunswick -lrb- illustration : fig 204 -- seal of the unite trade of ghent -lrb- end of the fifteenth century -rrb- -rrb- although as we have already see previous to the thirteenth century many of the corporation of artisan have be authorise by several of the king of france to make special law whereby they might govern themselves it be really only from the reign of st loui that the first general measure of administration and police relate to these community can be date the king appoint etienne boileau a rich bourgeois provost of the capital in 1261 to set to work to establish order wise administration and good faith in the commerce of pari to this end he ascertain from the verbal testimony of the senior member of each corporation the custom and usage of the various craft which for the most part up to that time have not be commit to write he arrange and probably amend they in many way and thus compose the famous book of trade which as m depp the able editor of this valuable compilation first publish in 1837 say have the advantage of be to a great extent the genuine production of the corporation themselves and not a list of rule establish and frame by the municipal or judicial authority from that time corporation gradually introduce themselves into the order of society the royal decree in they favor be multiply and the regulation with regard to mechanical trade daily improve not only in pari and in the province and also abroad both in the south and in the north of europe especially in italy germany england and the low country -lrb- fig 205 to 213 -rrb- etienne boileau 's book of trade contain the rule of one hundred different trade association it must be observe however that several of the most important trade such as the butcher tanner glazier & c be omit either because they neglect to be register at the châtelet where the inquiry superintend by boileau be make or because some private interest induce they to keep aloof from this registration which probably impose some sort of fine and a tax upon they in the following century the number of trade association considerably increase and wonderfully so during the reign of the last of the valoi and the first of the bourbon the historian of the antiquity of pari henry sauval enumerate no fewer than fifteen hundred and fifty-one trade association in the capital alone in the middle of the seventeenth century it must be remark however that the society of artisan be much subdivide owe to the simple fact that each craft could only practice its own special work thus in boileau 's book we find four different corporation of _ patenôtriers _ or maker of chaplet six of hatter six of weaver & c besides these society of artisan there be in paris a few privileged corporation which occupy a more important position and be know under the name of _ corps des marchands _ they number at first frequently varied but finally it be settle at six and they be term _ les six corps _ they comprise the draper which always take precedence of the five other the grocer the mercer the furrier the hatter and the goldsmith these five for a long time dispute the question of precedence and finally they decide the matter by lot as they be not able to agree in any other way -lrb- illustration : fig 205 -- seal of the corporation of carpenter of st trond -lrb- belgium -rrb- -- from a impression preserve in the archive of that town -lrb- 1481 -rrb- -rrb- -lrb-

of be call upon to appear though at they own expense in the civic procession and at the public ceremonial and to carry the canopy over the head of king queen or prince on they state entry into the capital -lrb- fig 234 -rrb- it would be difficult to specify the nature of the privilege which be grant to they and of which they be so jealous it be clear however that these six body be imbue with a kind of aristocratic spirit which make they place trading much above handicraft in they own class and set a high value on they call as merchant thus contemporary historian tell we that any merchant who compromise the dignity of the company fall into the class of the lower order that mercer boast of exclude from they body the upholsterer who be but artisan that hatter who be admit into the _ six corps _ to replace one of the other trade become in consequence merchant instead of artisan which they have be up to that time notwithstanding the statute so carefully compile and revise by etienne boileau and he successor and in spite of the numerous arbitrary rule which the sovereign the magistrate and the corporation themselves strenuously endeavor to frame order and unity be far from govern the commerce and industry of pari during the middle age and what take place in paris generally repeat itself elsewhere serious dispute continually arise between the authority and those amenable to they jurisdiction and between the various craft themselves notwithstanding the relation which they bear to each other from the similarity of they employment in fact in this as in many other matter social disorder often emanate from the power whose duty it be in the first instance to have repress it thus at the time when philip augustus extend the boundary of he capital so as to include the borough in it which until then have be separate from the city the lay and clerical lord under whose feudal dominion those district have hitherto be place naturally insist upon preserve all they rights so forcibly do they do this that the king be oblige to recognize they claim and in several borough include the bourg l'abbé the beau bourg the bourg st germain and the bourg auxerroi & c there be trade association completely distinct from and independent of those of ancient pari if we simply limit we examination to that of the condition of the trade association which hold they authority immediately from royalty we still see that the cause of confusion be by no means trifle for the majority of the high officer of the crown act as delegate of the royal authority be always dispute amongst themselves the right of superintend protect judge punish and above all of exact tribute from the member of the various trade the king grant to various officer the privilege of arbitrarily dispose of the freedom of each trade for they own profit and thereby give they power over all the merchant and craftsman who be officially connect with they not only in pari but also throughout the whole kingdom thus the lord chamberlain have jurisdiction over the draper mercer furrier shoemaker tailor and other dealer in article of wear apparel the barber be govern by the king 's varlet and barber the head baker be governor over the baker and the head butler over the wine merchant -lrb- illustration : fig 234 -- group of goldsmith precede the _ chasse de st marcel _ in the reign of loui

exercise such and such a craft with assistant or companion exact for the performance of this trifling act a very considerable tax and as they prefer receive they revenue without the annoyance of have direct communication with they humble subject they appoint deputy who be authorise to collect they in they name the most celebrated of these deputy be the _ roi des merciers _ who live on the fat of the land in complete idleness and who be surround by a mercantile court which appear in all its splendor at the trade festival -lrb- illustration : fig 235 -- banner of the corporation of the unite boot and shoe maker of issoudun -rrb- the great officer of the crown exercise in they own interest and without a thought for the public advantage a complete magisterial jurisdiction over all craft they adjudicate in dispute arise between master and man decide quarrel visit either personally or through they deputy the house of the merchant in order to discover fraud or infraction in the rule of the trade and levy fine accordingly we must remember that the collector of court due have always to contend for the free exercise of they jurisdiction against the provost of pari who consider they acquisition of authority as interfere with he personal prerogative and who therefore persistently oppose they on all occasion for instance if the head baker order a artisan of the same trade to be imprison in the châtelet the high provost who be governor of the prison release he immediately and in retaliation if the high provost punish a baker the chief baker warmly espouse he subordinate 's cause at other time the artisan if they be dissatisfy with the deputy appoint by the great officer of the crown whose dependent they be would refuse to recognize he authority in this way constant quarrel and interminable lawsuit occur and it be easy to understand the disorder which must have arise from such a state of thing by degree however and in consequence of the new tendency of royalty which be simply direct to the diminution of feudal power the numerous jurisdiction relate to the various trade gradually return to the hand of the municipal provostship and this concentration of power have the best result as well for the public good as for that of the corporation themselves have examine into corporation collectively and also into they general administration we will now turn to consider they internal organization it be only after long and difficult struggle that these trade association succeed in take a definite and established position without however succeed at any time in organize themselves as one body on the same basis and with the same privilege therefore in point out the influential character of these institution generally we must omit various matter specially connect with individual association which it would be impossible to mention in this brief sketch in the fourteenth century the period when the community of craft be at the height of they development and power no association of artisan could legally exist without a license either from the king the lord the prince the abbot the bailiff or the mayor of the district in which it propose to establish itself -lrb- illustration : fig 236 -- banner of the tiler of pari with the armorial bearing of the corporation -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 237 -- banner of the nail-maker of pari with armorial

they statute provide that such change be confirm by the king or by the authority it be also necessary that these meeting at which the royal delegate be present should be duly authorise and lastly so as to render the communication between member more easy and to facilitate everything which concern the interest of the craft artisan of the same trade usually reside in the same quarter of the town and even in the same street the name of many street in pari and other town of france testify to this custom which still partially exist in the town of germany and italy -lrb- illustration : fig 242 --

a long time they strive to extend this last power or to keep it independent of municipal control and the supreme court by which it be curtail to that of exercise a simple police authority strictly confine to person or thing relate to the craft they carefully watch for any infraction of the rule of the trade they act as arbitrator between master and man particularly in quarrel when the party have have recourse to violence the function of this kind of domestic magistracy be exercise by officer know under various name such as _ king master elder guard syndic _ and _ juror _ who be besides

administrative financial and judicial and be necessarily therefore of a most complicated character philippe le bel make it exclusively a judicial court define the territorial limit of its power and give it as a judicial body privilege tend to strengthen its independence and to raise its dignity he assign political function to the great council -lrb- _ conseil d'etat _ -rrb- financial matter to the chamber of account and the hearing of case of heresy will legacy and dowry to the prelate but in opposition to the wise edict of 1295 he determine that jew should be exclude from parliament and prelate from the palace of justice by which latter proceeding he be deprive justice of the ability of the most worthy representative of the gallican church but philippe le bel and he successor while incessantly quarrel either with the aristocracy or with the clergy want the great judicial body which issue the edict and the urban or municipal magistrate -- which be subject to re-election be principally recruit from among the bourgeois -- to be a common center of opposition to any attempt at usurpation of power whether on the part of the church the nobility or the crown the great day of

pass on either to the exchequer or to the great day of troye as that advanced reformer philippe le bel die before the institution he have establish have take root for many year even down to the time of loui xi a continual conflict for supremacy be wage between the parliament of pari and the various court of the kingdom -- between the count and the parliament and between the latter and the king which without lessen the dignity of the crown gradually tend to increase the influence which the judge possess immediately on the accession of loui le hutin in 1314 a reaction commence -- the higher clergy re-enter parliament but philippe le long take care that the laity should be in a majority and do not allow that in he council of state the title councillor should be more numerous than the lawyer the latter succeed in completely carry the day on account of the service they render and the influence which they knowledge of the law of the country give they as for century the sword have rule the gown so since the emancipation of the bourgeois the lawyer have become master of the administrative and judicial world and notwithstanding the fact that they be still keep in a somewhat inferior position to the peer and baron they opinion alone predominate and they decision frequently at once settle the most important question a edict issue at val notre-dame on the 11th of march 1344 increase the number of member of parliament which from that time consist of three president fifteen clerical councillor fifteen lay councillor twenty-four clergyman and sixteen layman of the court of inquiry and five clergyman and sixteen layman of the court of petition the king fill up the vacant seat on the recommendation of the chancellor and of the parliament the reporter be enjoin to write the decision and sentence which be give by the court in large letter and far apart so that they might be more easily read the duty of police in the court the keep of the door and the internal arrangement generally for those attend the court and the parliament be entrust to the usher who divide among themselves the gratuity which be give they by virtue of they office before a advocate be admit to plead he be require to take oath and to be inscribe on the register the parliament as then establish be somewhat similar in its character to that of the old national representative government under the german and frank for century it protect the king against the undue interference of the spiritual power it defend the people against despotism but it often lack independence and political wisdom and it be not always remarkable for its correct appreciation of man and thing this tribunal although supreme over all public affair sometimes waver before the threat of a minister or of a court favorite succumb to the influence of intrigue and adapt itself to the prejudice of the time we see it in moment of error and of blindness both condemn eminent statesman and lead citizen such as jacque coeur and robertet and handing over to the executioner distinguish man of learning and science in advance of the time in which they live because they be falsely accuse of witchcraft and also do the same towards unfortunate maniac who fancy they have dealings with the devil -lrb- illustration : fig 305 -- trial of the constable de bourbon before the peer of france -lrb- 1523 -rrb- -- from a

and the greater council the greater council only assemble in case of urgency and for extraordinary and very important purpose the smaller council assemble every month and its decision be register from this arise the custom of make a similar registration in parliament confirm the decision after they have be formally arrive at the most ancient edict place on the register of the parliament of pari date from the year 1334 and be of a very important character it concern a question of royal authority and decide that in spiritual matter the right of supremacy do not belong more to the pope than to the king consequently philippe de valois order he friend and vassal who shall attend the next parliament and the keeper of the account that for the perpetual record of so memorable a decision it shall be register in the chamber of parliament and keep for reference in the treasury of the charter from that time case of complaint and other matter relate to benefice have no longer be discuss before the ecclesiastical judge but before parliament or some other secular court during the captivity of king john in england royal authority have considerably decline the power of parliament and other body of the magistracy so increase that under charle vi the parliament of pari be bold enough to assert that a royal edict should not become law until it have be register in parliament this bold and certainly novel proceed the king nevertheless do not altogether oppose as they foresee that the time would come when it might afford they the means of repudiate a treaty extort from they under difficult circumstance -lrb- fig 306 -rrb- the close connection which exist between the various parliament and they political function -- for they have occasion incessantly to interfere between the act of the government and the respective pretension of the province or of the three order -- naturally increase the importance of this supreme magistracy more than once the king have cause to repent have render it so powerful and this be the case especially with the parliament of pari in this difficulty it be interesting to note how the king act they imperceptibly curtail the various power of the other court of justice they circumscribe the power of the parliament of pari and proportionately enlarged the jurisdiction of the great bailiwick as also that of the châtelet the provost of pari be a auxiliary as well as a support to the royal power which nevertheless hold he in its grasp the châtelet be also a center of action and of strength which counteract in certain case parliamentary opposition thence arise the most implacable rivalry and dissension between these various party -lrb- illustration : fig 306 -- promulgation of a edict -- fac-simile of a miniature in anciennetés des juifs -lrb- french

how readily parliament take advantage of the most trifling circumstance or of charge base upon the very slightest grounds to summon the officer of the châtelet before its bar on suspicion of prevarication or of outrage against religion moral or the law often be these officer and the provost himself summon to appear and make _ amende honorable _ before the assembly notwithstanding which they retain they office more than once a officer of the châtelet be condemn to death and execute but the king always annul that part of the sentence which have reference to the confiscation of the goods of the condemn thus prove that in reality the condemnation have be unjust although for grave reason the royal authority have be unable to save the victim from the avenge power of parliament hugue aubriot the provost be thus condemn to imprisonment for life on the most trivial grounds and he would have undergo capital punishment if charle v have abandon he at the time of he trial during the english occupation in the disastrous reign of charle vi the châtelet of pari which take part with the people give proof of extraordinary energy and of great force of character the blood of many of its member be shed on the scaffold and this circumstance must ever remain a reproach to the judge and to those who execute they cruel sentence and a lasting crown of glory to the martyr themselves a edict of king john issue after he return from london in 1363 a short time before he death clearly define the duty of parliament they be to try case which concerned peer of france and such prelate

-lrb- fig 307 -rrb- it disregard minor matter but take cognizance of all judicial debate which concerned religion the king or the state we must remark here that advocate be only allow to speak twice in the same cause and that they be subject to fine or at least to remonstrance if they be tedious or indulge in needless repetition in they reply and especially if they do not keep carefully to the fact of the case after plead they be permit to give a summary in writing of the principal point of importance as well as they client ' grounds of defense charle v confirm these order and regulation with respect to advocate and add other which be no less important among which we find a provision for give legal assistance to poor and destitute person who go to law these regulation of charle also limit the time in which officer of justice be to get through they business under a certain penalty they also proclaim that the king should no longer hear minor cause and that whatever might be the rule of the court they forbid the president from defer they judgment or from retard the regular course of justice charle vi before he become insane contribute no less than he father to the

mahomet have say that those who should obey he will should go to paradise and there find all kind of luxury this prince wish it to be believe that he be the prophet and companion of mahomet and that he have the power of send whom he choose to paradise no one could succeed in enter the garden because a impregnable castle have be build at the entrance of the valley and it could only be approach by a cover and secret way the old man have in he court some young man from ten to twenty year of age choose from those inhabitant of the hill who seem to he capable of bear arm and who be bold and courageous from time to time he administer a certain drink to ten or twelve of these young man which send they to sleep and when they be in deep stupor he have they carry into the garden when they awake they see all we have describe : they be surround by the young damsel who sing play instrument together caress they play all sort of game and present they with the most exquisite wine and meat -lrb- fig 317 -rrb- so that these young man satiate with such pleasure do not doubt that they be in paradise and would willingly have never go out of it again at the end of four or five day the old man send they to sleep again and have they remove from the garden in the same way in which they have be bring in he then call they before he and ask they where they have be ` by you grace lord ' they answer ` we have be in paradise ' and then they related in the presence of everybody what they have see there this tale excite the astonishment of all those who hear it and the desire that they might be equally fortunate the old man would then formally announce to those who be present as follow : ` thus saith the law of we prophet he cause all who fight for they lord to enter into paradise if you obey I you shall enjoy that happiness ' by such word and plan this prince have so accustomed they to believe in he that he whom he order to die for he service consider himself lucky all the noble or other enemy of the old man of the mountain be put to death by the assassin in he service for none of they fear death provide he comply with the order and wish of he lord however powerful a man might

sincere mind attack by the troops of the sultan sindgar he defend himself vigorously and not unsuccessfully but fear lest he should fall in a unequal and protracted struggle against a adversary more

seek for the etymology of this name one must suppose that haschichinus be the latin transformation of the arabic word hachychy the name of the sect of which we be speak because the ecstacy during which they believe themselves remove to paradise be produce by means of _ haschisch _ or _ haschischa _ we know that this inebriating preparation extract from hemp really produce the most strange and delicious hallucination on those who use it all traveller who have visit the east agree in say that its effect be very superior to those of opium we evidently must attribute to some ecstatic vision the suppose existence of the enchanted garden which marco polo describe from popular tale and which of course never exist but in the imagination of the young man who be either mentally excited after

formidable tool of a religious and political chieftain who be no less ambitious than revengeful if we now turn we attention to germany we shall here find almost at the same period a local institution

of they idol -lrb- fig 319 and 320 -rrb- and for this reason it be say by these authority that the law of the tribunal of westphalium be found by charlemagne it be well know that from the ninth to the thirteenth century all that part of germany between the rhine and the weser suffer under the most complete anarchy in consequence of this and of the increase of crime which remain unpunished energetic man establish a rigorous jurisdiction which to a certain extent suppress these barbarous disorder and give some assurance to social intercourse but the very mystery which give weight to the institution be the cause of its origin be unknown it be only mention and then cursorily in historical document towards the early part of the fifteenth century this court of judicature receive the name of _ femgericht _ or _ vehmgericht _ which mean vehmic tribunal the origin of the word _ fem _ _ vehm _ or _ fam _ which have give rise to many scientific discussion still remain in doubt the most generally accept opinion be that it be derive from a latin expression -- _ vemi _ -lrb- _ vae mihi _ -rrb- woe be I the special dominion over which the vehmic tribunal reign supreme be westphalia and the country which be subject to its law be designate as the _ terre rouge _ there be no assembly of this tribunal beyond the limit of this terre rouge but it would be quite impossible to define these

certain free count jealous of one of he associate hang he with he own hand while out on a hunting excursion allege that he rank of free judge authorise he to execute summary justice from that time there be a perpetual cry of horror and indignation against a judicial institution which thus interpret its duty and before long the state undertake the suppression of these secret tribunal the first

confine itself to occasionally adjudicate in simple civil matter we must not omit to mention the council of ten of venice when speak on the subject of arbitrary execution and of tyrannical and implacable justice in some respects it be more notorious than the vehmic tribunal exercise as it do a no less mysterious power and inspiring equal terror though in other country this secret tribunal

observe the infinite variety of torture which have exist since the beginning of the world it be in fact difficult to realize the amount of ingenuity exercise by man in invent new torture in order to give themselves the satisfaction of see they fellow-creature agonizing in the most awful suffering in enter upon the subject of ancient mode of punishment we must first speak of the torture which accord to the receive phrase might be either _ previous _ or _ preparatory : previous _ when it consist of a torture which the condemn have to endure previous to capital punishment and _ preparatory _ when it be apply in order to elicit from the culprit a avowal of he crime or of that of he accomplice it be also call _ ordinary _ or _ extraordinary _ accord to the duration or violence with which it be inflict in some case the torture last five or six consecutive hour in other it rarely exceed a hour hippolyte de marsillis the learn and venerable jurisconsult of bologna who live at the beginning of the fifteenth century mention fourteen way of inflict torture the compression of the limb by special instrument or by rope only injection of water vinegar or oil into the body of the accuse application of hot pitch and starvation be the process most in use other means which be more or less apply accord to the fancy of the magistrate and the tormentor or executioner be remarkable for they singular atrocity for instance place hot egg under the arm-pits introduce dice between the skin and flesh tie light candle to the finger so that they might be consume simultaneously with the wax let water trickle drop by drop from a great height on the stomach and also the custom which be accord to writer on criminal matter a indescribable torture of water the foot with salt water and allow goat to lick they however every country have special custom as to the manner of apply torture in france too the torture varied accord to the province or rather accord to the parliament for instance in brittany the culprit tie in a iron chair be gradually bring near a blaze furnace in normandy one thumb be squeeze in a screw in the ordinary and both thumb in the extraordinary torture at autun after high boot make of spongy leather have be place on the culprit 's foot he be tie on to a table near a large fire and a quantity of boiling water be pour on the boot which penetrate the leather eat away the flesh and even dissolve the bone of the victim at orlean for the ordinary torture the accuse be strip half naked and he hand be tightly tie behind he back with a ring fix between they then by means of a rope fasten to this ring they raise the poor man who have a weight of one hundred and eighty pound attach to he foot a certain height from the ground for the extraordinary torture which then take the name of _ estrapade _ they raise the victim with two hundred and fifty pound attach to he foot to the ceiling by means of a capstan he be then allow to fall several time successively by jerk to the level of the ground by which mean he arm and leg be completely dislocate -lrb- fig 340 -rrb- at avignon the ordinary torture consist in hang the accuse by the wrist with a heavy iron ball at each foot for the extraordinary torture which be then much in use in italy under the name of _ veglium _ the body be stretch horizontally by means of rope pass through ring rivet into the wall and attach to the four limb the only support give to the culprit be the point of a stake cut in a diamond shape which just touch the end of the back-bone a doctor and a surgeon be always present feel the pulse at the temple of the patient so as to be able to judge of the moment when he could not any longer bear the pain -lrb- illustration : fig 340 -- the estrapade or question extraordinary --

again put to the torture which go on thus for six consecutive hour in pari for a long time the _ water torture _ be in use this be the most easily bear and the least dangerous a person undergo it be tie to a board which be support horizontally on two trestle by means of a horn act as a funnel and whilst he nose be be pinch so as to force he to swallow they slowly pour four _ coquemar _ -lrb- about nine pint -rrb- of water into he mouth this be for the ordinary torture for the extraordinary double that quantity be pour in -lrb- fig 341 -rrb- when the torture be end the victim be untied and

inside and outside of each leg which be tightly bind together with strong rope wedge be then drive in between the center board with a mallet four wedge in the ordinary and eight in the extraordinary torture not unfrequently during the latter operation the bone of the leg be literally burst the _ brodequin _ which be often use for ordinary torture be stocking of parchment into which it be easy enough to get the foot when it be wet but which on be hold near the fire shrink so considerably that it cause insufferable agony to the wearer whatever manner of torture be apply the accuse before

should be carefully shave from the body of person about to undergo examination by torture for fear of they conceal some countercharm which would render they insensible to bodily pain the same author also recommend as a rule when there be several person to be place on the rack for the same deed to begin with those from whom it would be most probable that confession would be first extort thus for instance when a man and a woman be to suffer one after the other he recommend that the woman be first tortured as be the weaker of the two when a father and son be concern the son should be tortured in presence of the father who naturally fear more for he son than for himself we thereby see that the judge be adept in the art of add moral to physical torture the barbarous custom of punishment by torture be on several occasion condemn by the church as early as 866 we find from pope nichola v 's letter to the bulgarian that they custom of torture the accuse be consider contrary to divine as well as to human law : for say he a confession should be voluntary and not force by means of the torture a innocent man may suffer to the utmost without make any avowal and in such a case what a crime for the judge or the person may be subdue by pain and may acknowledge himself guilty although he be not so which throw a equally great sin upon the judge -lrb- illustration : fig 342 -- type of

a painting in the danse des morts of basle engrave by mérian -rrb- the executioner do not hold the same position in all country for whereas in france italy and spain a certain amount of odium be

in parliament but after have put the seal on they it be say that the chancellor throw they under the table in token of contempt the executioner be generally forbid to live within the precinct of the city unless it be on the grounds where the pillory be situate and in some case so that he might not be mistaken amongst the people he be force to wear a particular coat either of red or yellow on the other hand he duty ensure he certain privilege in pari he possess the right of _ havage _ which consist in take all that he could hold in he hand from every load of grain which be bring into market however in order that the grain might be preserve from ignominious contact he levy he tax with a wooden spoon he enjoy many similar rights over most article of consumption independently of benefit by several tax or fine such as the toll on the petit-pont the tax on foreign trader on boat arrive with fish on dealer in herring watercress & c and the fine of five sous which be levy on stray pig -lrb- see previous chapter -rrb- & c and lastly besides the personal property of the condemn he receive the rent from the shop and stall surround the pillory in which the retail fish trade be carry on it appear that in consequence of the receipt from these various duty form a considerable source of revenue the prestige of wealth by degree dissipate the unfavourable impression traditionally attach to the duty of executioner at least we have authority for suppose this when for instance in 1418 we see the pari executioner who be then captain of the bourgeois militia come in that capacity to touch the hand of the duke of burgundy on the occasion of he solemn entry into pari with queen isabel of bavarium we may add that popular belief generally ascribe to the executioner a certain practical knowledge of medicine which be suppose inherent in the profession itself and the acquaintance with certain method of cure unknown to doctor be attribute to he people go to buy from he the fat of culprit who have be hang which be suppose to be a marvellous panacea we may also remark that in we day the proficiency of the executioner in set dislocated limb be still proverbial in many country -lrb- illustration : fig 344 -- amende honorable before the tribunal -- fac-simile of a woodcut in j damhoudère 's praxis rerum criminalium : in 4to antwerp 1556 -rrb- more than once during the thirteenth century the duty of the executioner be perform by woman but only in those case in which they own sex be concern for it be expressly state in a order of st loui that person convict of blasphemy shall be beat with birch rod the man by man and the woman by woman only without the presence of man this however be not long tolerate for we know that a period soon arrive when woman be exempt from a duty so little adapt to they physical weakness and moral sensitiveness the learn writer on criminal case josse damhoudère whom we have already mention and whom we shall take as we special guide in the enumeration of the various torture specify thirteen way in which the executioner carry out he execution and place they in the follow order : -- fire -- the sword -- mechanical force -- quarter -- the wheel -- the fork -- the gibbet -- drawing -- spike -- cut off the ear -- dismember -- flogging or beating -- and the pillory -lrb- illustration : fig 345 -- the punishment by fire -- fac-simile of a woodcut of the cosmographie universelle of munster : in folio basle 1552 -rrb- but before enter upon the detail of this revolting subject we must state that whatever punishment be inflict upon a culprit it be very rare that its execution have not be precede by the _ amende honorable _ which in certain case constitute a distinct punishment but which generally be but the prelude to the torture itself the _ amende honorable _ which be call _ simple _ or _ short _ take place without the assistance of the executioner in the council chamber where the condemn bareheaded and kneel have to state that he have falsely say or do something against the authority of the king or the honor of some person -lrb- fig 344 -rrb- for the _ amende honorable in figuris _ -- that be to say in public -- the condemn in he shirt barefoot the rope round he neck follow by the executioner and holding in he hand a wax taper with a weight which be definitely specify in the sentence which have be pass upon he but which be generally of two or four pound prostrate himself at the door of a church where in a loud voice he have to confess he sin and to beg the pardon of god and man when a criminal have be condemn to be burn a stake be erect on the spot specially design for the execution and round it a pile be prepared compose of alternate layer of straw and wood and rise to about the height of a man care be take to leave a free space round the stake for the victim and also a passage by which to lead he to it have be strip of he clothes and dress in a shirt smear with sulphur he have to walk to the center of the pile through a narrow opening and be then tightly bind to the stake with rope and chain after this faggot and straw be throw into the empty space through which he have pass to the stake until he be entirely cover by they the pile be then fire on all side at once -lrb- fig 345 -rrb- sometimes the sentence be that the culprit should only be deliver to the flame after have be previously strangle in this case the dead corpse be then immediately place where the victim would otherwise have be place alive and the punishment lose much of its horror it often happen that the executioner in order to shorten the suffering of the condemn whilst he prepare the pile place a large and pointed iron bar amongst the faggot and opposite the stake breast high so that directly the fire be light the bar be quickly push against the victim give a mortal blow to the unfortunate wretch who would otherwise have be slowly devour by the flame if accord to the wording of the sentence the ash of the criminal be to be scatter to the wind as soon as it be possible to approach the center of the burning pile a few ash be take in a shovel and sprinkle in the air they be not satisfy with burn the live they also deliver to the flame the body of those who have die a natural death before they execution could be carry out as if a anticipated death should not be allow to save they from the punishment which they have deserve it also happen in certain case where a person 's guilt be only prove after he decease that he body be disinter and carry to the stake to be burn the punishment by fire be always inflict in case of heresy or blasphemy the spanish inquisition make such a constant and cruel use of it that the expression _ auto-da-fé _ -lrb- act of faith -rrb- strangely pervert from its original meaning be the only one employ to denote the punishment itself in france in the beginning of the fourteenth century fifty-nine templar be burn at the same time for the crime of heresy and witchcraft and three year later on the 18th march 1314 jacque molay and a few other dignitary of the order of the templar also perish in the flame at the extremity of the island of notre dame on the very spot where the equestrian statue of henry iv now stand every one be acquaint with the fact that judge be find iniquitous enough to condemn joan of arc to death by fire as a witch and a heretic she execution which take place in the market-place of rouen be remarkable from a circumstance which be little known and which have never take place on any other occasion when it be suppose that the fire which surround the young heroine on all side have reach she and no doubt suffocate she although sufficient time have not elapse for it to consume she body a part of the blaze wood be withdraw in order to remove any doubt from the people and when the crowd have satisfy themselves by see she in the middle of the pile chained to the post and quite dead the executioner replace the fire it should be state in reference to this point that joan have be accuse of witchcraft there be a general belief among the people that the flame would be harmless to she and that she would be see emerge from she pile unscathed the sentence of punishment by fire do not absolutely imply death at the stake for there be a punishment of this description which be specially reserve for base coiner and which consist in hurl the criminal into a cauldron of scalding water or oil we must include in the category of punishment by fire certain penalty which be so to speak but the preliminary of a more severe punishment such as the sulphur-fire in which the hand of parricide or of criminal accuse of high treason be burn we must also add various punishment which if they do not involve death be none the less cruel such as the red-hot brazier _ bassin ardent _ which be pass backwards and forwards before the eye of the culprit until they be destroy by the scorching heat and the process of brand various mark on the flesh as a ineffaceable stigma the use of which have be continue to the present day in certain country decapitation be perform with a axe but in france it be carry out usually by means of a two-handed sword or glave of justice which be furnish to the executioner for that purpose -lrb- fig 346 -rrb- we find it record that in 1476 sixty sous parisis be pay to the executioner of pari for have buy a large _ espée à feuille _ use for beheading the condemn and for have the old sword do up which be damage and have become notch whilst carry out the sentence of justice upon messire loui de luxembourg -lrb- illustration : fig 346 -- beheading -- fac-simile of a miniature on wood in the cosmographie universelle of munster : in folio basle 1552 -rrb- originally decapitation be indiscriminately inflict on all criminal condemn to death at a later period however it become the particular privilege of the nobility who submit to it without any feeling of degradation the victim -- unless the sentence prescribe that he should be blindfold as a ignominious aggravation of the penalty -- be allow to choose whether he would have he eye cover or not he kneel down on the scaffold place he head on the block and give himself up to the executioner -lrb- fig 347 -rrb- the skill of the executioner be generally such that the head be almost invariably sever from the body at the first blow nevertheless skill and practice at time fail for case be on record where as many as eleven blow be deal and at time it happen that the sword break it be no doubt the desire to avoid this mischance that lead to the invention of the mechanical instrument now know under the name of the _ guillotine _ which be merely a improvement on a complicated machine which be much more ancient than be generally suppose as early as the sixteenth century the modern guillotine already exist in scotland under the name of the _ maiden _ and english historian relate that lord morton regent of scotland during the minority of jame vi have it construct after a model of a similar machine which have long be in use at halifax in yorkshire they add and popular tradition also have invent a analogous tale in france that this lord morton who be the inventor or the first to introduce this kind of punishment be himself the first to experience it the guillotine be besides very accurately describe in the chronicle of jean d'auton in a account of a execution which take place at genoa at the beginning of the sixteenth century two german engraving execute about 1550 by pencz and aldegrever also represent a instrument of death almost identical with the guillotine and the same instrument be to be find on a bas-relief of that period which be still exist in one of the hall of the tribunal of luneburg in hanover -lrb- illustration : decapitation of guillaume de pommier -lrb- illustration : fig 347 -- public execution -- fac-simile of a woodcut in the latin work of j millaeus praxis crimini persequendus : small folio parisis simon de coline 1541 -rrb- and he confessor at bordeaux in 1377 by order of the king of england 's lieutenant _ froissart 's chronicle _ no 2644 bibl nat'l e de paris -rrb- possibly the invention of such a machine be prompt by the desire to curtail the physical suffering of the victim instead of prolong they as under the ancient system it be however difficult to believe that the mediæval judge be actuate by any humane feeling when we find that in order to reconcile a respect for _ propriety _ with a due compliance with the end of justice the punishment of bury alive be resort to for woman who could not with decency be hang up to the gibbet in 1460 a woman name perette accuse of theft and of receive steal goods be condemn by the provost of pari to be bury alive before the gallows and the sentence be literally carry out _ quarter _ may in truth be consider the most horrible penalty invent by judicial cruelty this punishment really date from the remotest age but it be scarcely ever inflict in more modern time except on regicide who be look upon as have commit the worst of crime in almost all case the victim have previously to undergo various accessory torture : sometimes he right hand be cut off and the mutilate stump be burn in a cauldron of sulphur sometimes he arm thigh or breast be lacerate with red-hot pincers and hot oil pitch or molten lead be pour into the wound -lrb- illustration : fig 348 -- demon apply the torture of the wheel -- fac-simile of a woodcut in the grand kalendrier ou compost des berger : small folio troye nichola le rouge 1529 -rrb- after these horrible preliminary a rope be attach to each of the limb of the criminal one be bind round each leg from the foot to the knee and round each arm from the wrist to the elbow these rope be then fasten to four bar to each of which a strong horse be harness as if for tow a barge these horse be first make to give short jerk and when the agony have elicit heart-rending cry from the unfortunate man who feel he limb be dislocate without be break the four horse be all suddenly urge on with the whip in different direction and thus all the limb be strain at one moment if the tendon and ligament still resist the combined effort of the four horse the executioner assist and make several cut with a hatchet on each joint when at last -- for this horrible torture often last several hour -- each horse have draw out a limb they be collect and place near the hideous trunk which often still show sign of life and the whole be burn together sometimes the sentence be that the body should be hang to the gibbet and that the limb should be display on the gate of the town or send to four principal town in the extremity of the kingdom when this be do a inscription be place on each of the limb which state the reason of its be thus expose the _ wheel _ be the name apply to a torture of very ancient origin but which be apply during the middle age to quite a different torture from that use in olden time the modern instrument might indeed have be call the cross for it only serve for the public exhibition of the body of the criminal whose limb have be previously break alive this torture which do not date earlier than the day of franci i be thus describe : -- the victim be first tie on he back to two joist form a st andrew 's cross each of he limb be stretch out on its arm two place be hollow out under each limb about a foot apart in order that the joint alone might touch the wood the executioner then deal a heavy blow over each hollow with a square iron bar about two inch broad and round at the handle thus break each limb in two place to the eight blow require for this the executioner generally add two or three on the chest which be call _ coup de grâce _ and which end this horrible execution it be only after death that the broken body be place on a wheel which be turn round on a pivot sometimes however the sentence order that the condemn should be strangle before be break which be do in such case by the instantaneous twist of a rope round the neck strangling thus carry out be call _ garotte _ this method be still in use in spain and be specially reserve for the nobility the victim be seat on a scaffold he head lean against a beam and he neck grasp by a iron collar which the executioner suddenly tighten from behind by means of a screw for several century and down to the revolution hanging be the most common mode of execution in france consequently in every town and almost in every village there be a permanent gibbet which owe to the custom of leave the body to hang till they crumble into dust be very rarely without have some corpse or skeleton attach to it these gibbet which be call _ fourch patibulaire _ or _ justice _ because they represent the authority of the law be generally compose of pillar of stone join at they summit by wooden traverse to which the body of criminal be tie by rope or chain the gallows the pillar of which vary in number accord to the will of the authority be always place by the side of frequented road and on a eminence -lrb- illustration : fig 349 -- the gibbet of montfaucon -- from a engraving of the topography of pari in the collection of engraving of the national library -rrb- accord to prescribe rule the gallows of pari which play such a important part in the political as well as the criminal history of that city be erect on a height north of the town near the high road lead into germany montfaucon originally the name of the hill soon become that of the gallows itself this celebrated place of execution consist of a heavy mass of masonry compose of ten or twelve layer of rough stone and form a enclosure of forty foot by twenty-five or thirty at the upper part there be a platform which be reach by a stone staircase the entrance to which be close by a massive door -lrb- fig 349 -rrb- on three side of this platform rest sixteen square pillar about thirty foot high make of block of stone a foot thick these pillar be join to one another by double bar of wood which be fasten into they and bear iron chain three foot and a half long to which the criminal be suspend underneath half-way between these and the platform other bar be place for the same purpose long and solid ladder rivet to the pillar enable the executioner and he assistant to lead up criminal or to carry up corpse destine to be hang there lastly the center of the structure be occupy by a deep pit the hideous receptacle of the decaying remains of the criminal one can easily imagine the strange and melancholy aspect of this monumental gibbet if one think of the number of corpse continually attach to it and which be feast upon by thousand of crow on one occasion only it be necessary to replace _ fifty-two _ chain which be useless and the account of the city of pari prove that the expense of execution be more heavy than that of the maintenance of the gibbet a fact easy to be understand if one recall to mind the frequency of capital sentence during the middle age montfaucon be use not only for execution but also for expose corpse which be bring there from various place of execution in every part of the country the mutilate remains of criminal who have be boil quarter or behead be also hang there enclose in sack of leather or wickerwork they often remain hang for a considerable time as in the case of pierre des essarts who have be behead in 1413 and whose remains be hand over to he family for christian burial after have hang on montfaucon for three year the criminal condemn to be hang be generally take to the place of execution sit or stand in a waggon with he back to the horse he confessor by he side and the executioner behind he he bear three rope round he neck two the size of the little finger and call _ tortous _ each of which have a slip-knot the third call the _ jet _ be only use to pull the victim off the ladder and so to launch he into eternity -lrb- fig 350 -rrb- when the cart arrive at the foot of the gallows the executioner first ascend the ladder backwards draw the culprit after he by means of the rope and force he to keep pace with he on arrive at the top he quickly fasten the two _ tortous _ to the arm of the gibbet and by a jerk of he knee he turn the culprit off the ladder still hold the _ jet _ in he own hand he then place he foot on the tie hand of the condemn and suspend himself by he hand to the gibbet he finish off he victim by repeat jerk thus ensure complete strangulation when the word shall be hang until death doth ensue be to be find in a sentence it must not be suppose that they be use merely as a form for in certain case the judge order that the sentence should be only carry out as far as would prove to the culprit the awful sensation of hang in such case the victim be simply suspend by rope pass under the arm-pit a kind of exhibition which be not free from danger when it be too prolonged for the weight of the body so tighten the rope round the chest that the circulation might be stop many culprit after hang thus a hour when bring down be dead or only survive this painful process a short time -lrb- illustration : fig 350 -- hang to music -lrb- a minstrel condemn to the gallows obtain permission that one of he companion should accompany he to he execution and play he

on _ privilege and rights feudal and municipal _ -rrb- that when the criminal pass before the convent of the _ filles-dieu _ the nun of that establishment be bind to bring he out a glass of wine and three piece of bread and this be call _ le dernier morceau des patient _ it be hardly ever refuse and a immense crowd assist at this sad meal after this the procession go forward and on arrive near the gallows another halt be make at the foot of a stone cross in order that the culprit might receive the religion exhortation of he confessor the moment the execution be over the confessor and the officer of justice return to the châtelet where a repast provide by the town await they -lrb- illustration : fig 351 -- view of the pillory in the market-place of pari in the sixteenth century after a

be a aggravation of the penalty which be call _ traîner sur la claie _ the penalty of the lash be inflict in two way : first under the _ custode _ that be to say within the prison and by the hand of the gaoler himself in which case it be simply a correction and secondly in public when its administration become ignominious as well as painful in the latter case the criminal be parade about the town

the pillory be always situate in the most frequented place such as market crossways & c notwithstanding the long and dreadful enumeration we have just make of mediæval punishment we be far from have exhaust the subject for we have not speak of several more or less atrocious punishment which be in use at various time and in various country such as the _ pain of the cross _ specially employ against the jew the _ arquebusade _ which be well adapt for carry out prompt justice on soldier the _ chatouillement _ which result in death after the most intense torture the _ pal _ -lrb- fig 352 -rrb- _ flay alive _ and lastly _ drown _ a kind of death frequently employ in france hence the common expression _ gen de sac et de corde _ which be derive from the sack into which person be tie who be condemn to die by immersion but we will now turn away from these horrible scene and consider the several method of penal sequestration and prison arrangement it be unnecessary to state that in barbarous time the cruel and pitiless feeling which induce legislator to increase the horror of torture also contribute to the aggravation of the fate of prisoner each administrator of the law have he private gaol which be entirely under he will and control -lrb- fig 353 -rrb- law or custom do not prescribe any fixed rule for the internal government of prison there can be little doubt however that these prison be as small as they be unhealthy if we may judge from that in the rue de la tannerie which be the property of the provost the merchant and the alderman of pari in 1383 although this dungeon be only eleven foot long by seven foot wide from ten to twenty prisoner be often immure in it at the same time -lrb- illustration : fig 352 -- empalement -- fac-simile of a woodcut in the

important be the grand châtelet the petit châtelet the bastille the conciergerie and the for-l'evêque the ancient seat of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the bishop of pari nearly all these place of confinement contain subterranean cell which be almost entirely deprive of air and light as example of these may be mention the _ chartre bass _ of the petit châtelet where under the reign of charle vi it be prove that no man could pass a entire day without be suffocate and the fearful cell excavate thirty foot below the surface of the earth in the gaol of the abbey of saint germain des prés the

one which hold the greatest number of prisoner by a curious and arbitrary custom prisoner be compel to pay a gaol fee on enter and go out of this prison which vary accord to they rank and which be establish by a law of the year 1425 we learn from this enactment the name by which the various place of confinement composing this spacious municipal prison be know a prisoner who be confine in the _ beauvoir la mate _ or _ la salle _ have the right of have a bed bring from he own house and only have to pay the _ droit de place _ to the gaoler any one who be place in the _ boucherie _ in the _

ou sur couche de feurre ou de paille _ -rrb- if he prefer he might be place _ au puis _ in the _ gourdaine _ in the _ bercueil _ or in the _ oubliette _ where he do not pay more than in the _ fosse _ for this no doubt the smallest charge be make sometimes however the prisoner be leave between two door -lrb- _ entre deux huis _ -rrb- and he then pay much less than he would in the _ barbarie _ or in the _ gloriette _ the exact meaning of these curious name be no longer intelligible to we notwithstanding the terror which they formerly create but they very strangeness give we reason to suppose that the prison system be at that time subject to the most odious refinement of the basest cruelty from various reliable source we learn that there be a place in the grand châtelet call the _ chausse d'hypocra _ in which the prisoner have they foot continually in water and where they could neither stand up nor lie down and a cell call _ fin d'aise _ which be a horrible receptacle of filth vermin and reptile as to the _ fosse _ no staircase be attach to it the prisoner be lower down into it by means of a rope and pulley by the law of 1425 the gaoler be not permit to put more than _ two or three _ person in the same bed he be bind to give bread and water to the poor prisoner who have no means of subsistence and lastly he be enjoin to keep the large stone basin which be on the pavement full of water so that prisoner might get it whenever they wish in order to defray he expense he levy on the prisoner various charge for attendance and for bedding and he be authorise to detain in prison any person who fail to pay he the power of compelling payment of these charge continue even after a judge 's order for the release of a prisoner have be issue -lrb- illustration : fig 354 --

often protect the inhabitant from the fury of the populace in order to form a just appreciation of what the jewish quarter be like in the mediæval town one must visit the _ ghetto _ of rome or ancient

no attempt at uniformity the principal thoroughfare be line with stall in which be sell not only old clothes furniture and utensil but also new and glittering article the inhabitant of this enclosure can without cross its limit procure everything necessary to material life this quarter contain the old synagogue a square building begrime with the dirt of age and so cover with dirt and moss that the stone of which it be build be scarcely visible the building which be as mournful as a prison have only narrow loophole by way of window and a door so low that one must stoop to enter it a dark passage

which be of the same date as the synagogue and be about a league in circumference pari have never possess properly speak a regular _ jewish quarter _ it be true that the israelite settle down in the neighborhood of the market and in certain narrow street which at some period or other take the name of _ juiverie _ or _ vieille juiverie -lrb- old jewry _ -rrb- but they be never distinct from the rest of the population they only have a separate cemetery at the bottom or rather on the slope of the hill of sainte-geneviève on the other hand most of the town of france and of europe have they _

in portugal the jew in consequence of they have be on several occasion useful to the king of those two country be allow to carry on they trade and to engage in money speculation outside they own quarter a few be elevated to position of responsibility and some be even tolerate at court in the southern town of france which they enrich by commerce and tax and where they form considerable community the jew enjoy the protection of the noble we find they in languedoc and provence buying and sell property like christian a privilege which be not permit to they elsewhere : this be prove by

hatred of corporation of trade which be so powerful in france and in germany it be in the north of europe that the animosity against the jew be greatest the christian population continually threaten the jewish quarter which public opinion point to as haunt and sink of iniquity the jews be believe to be much more amenable to the doctrine of the talmud than to the law of mose however secret they may have keep they learn a portion of its tenet transpire which be suppose to inculcate the right to pillage and murder christian and it be to the vague knowledge of these odious prescription of the talmud that we must attribute the readiness with which the most atrocious accusation against the jew be always welcome besides this the public mind in those day of bigotry be naturally fill with a deep antipathy against the jewish deicide when monk and priest come annually in holy week to relate from the pulpit to they hearer the revolting detail of the passion resentment be kindle in the heart of the christian against the descendant of the judge and executioner of the savior and when on go out of the church excite by the sermon they have just hear the faithful saw in picture in the cemetery

hence it be that in many town even when the authority do not compel they to do so the israelite find it prudent to shut themselves up in they own quarter and even in they own house during the whole of passion week for in consequence of the public feeling rouse during those day of mourning and penance a false rumor be quite sufficient to give the people a pretext for offer violence to the jew in fact from the earliest day of christianity a certain number of accusation be always be make sometimes in one country sometimes in another against the israelite which always end in bring down the same misfortune on they head the most common and most easily credit report be that which attribute to they the murder of some christian child say to be sacrifice in passion week in token of they hatred of christ and in the event of this terrible accusation be once utter and maintain by popular opinion it never fail to spread with remarkable swiftness in such case popular fury not be on all occasion

therefore save thanks to richard 's desire to protect he security history do not tell what they liberty cost they but we must hope that a sense of justice alone guide the english prince and that the jew find other means besides money by which to show they gratitude there be scarcely a country in europe which can not recount similar tale in 1171 we find the murder of a child at orlean or bloi cause capital punishment to be inflict on several jew imputation of this horrible character be continually renew during the middle age and be of very ancient origin for we hear of they in the time of

erection of a chapel on the spot which be afterwards replace by the church and convent of the billette in 1370 the people of brussels be startle in consequence of the statement of a jewess who accuse

name of _ pastoureaux _ spread over the country killing and rob not only the jew but many christian also in the event of any general sickness and especially during the prevalence of epidemic the jew

they have succeed in cancel the king 's debt to he brother that necessitous monarch again mortgage they but on this occasion to he son edward soon after the son have rebel against he father the latter take back he jew and have assemble six elder from each of they community he tell they that he require 20000 silver mark and order they to pay he that sum at two state period the payment be rigorously

short time before this the english people have offer to pay a annual fine to the king on condition of he expel the jew from the country but the jew outbid they and thus obtain the repeal of the edict of banishment however on this last occasion there be no mercy show and the jew sixteen thousand in number be expel from england and the king seize upon they goods at the same period philippe le bel of

to the jew in the face of the distressing position they occupy it may be ask what powerful motive induce the jew to live amongst nation who almost invariably treat they as enemy and to remain at the mercy of sovereign whose sole object be to oppress plunder and subject they to all kind of vexation to understand this it be sufficient to remember that in they peculiar aptness for earn and hoard money they find or at least hope to find a means of compensation whereby they might be lead to forget the servitude to which they be subject there exist amongst they and especially in the southern

renown in its practice but there be another science to the study of which they apply themselves with the utmost ardor and perseverance and for which they possess in a marvellous degree the necessary quality to insure success and that science be the science of finance in matter have reference to the recover of arrears of tax to contract for the sale of goods and produce of industry to turn a royalty to account to make hazardous commercial enterprise lucrative or to the accumulate of large sum of money for the use of sovereign or poor noble the jew be always at hand and might invariably be

nevertheless face buoy themselves up with the insatiable love of gain few christian in the middle age be give to speculation and they be especially ignorant of financial matter as demand interest on loan be almost always look upon as usury and consequently such dealings be stigmatize as disgraceful the jew be far from share these high-minded scruple and they take advantage of the ignorance of christian by devote themselves as much as possible to enterprise and speculation which be at all time the distinguishing occupation of they race for this reason we find the jew who be engage in the export trade from the twelfth to the fifteenth century do a most excellent business even in the commercial town of the mediterranean we can to a certain extent in speaking of the intercourse of the jew with the christian of the middle age apply what lady montague remark as late as 1717 when compare the jew of turkey with the mussulman : the former she say have monopolize all the commerce of the empire thanks to the close tie which exist amongst they and to the laziness and want of industry of the turk no bargain be make without they connivance they be the physician and steward of all the

christian do not feel any scruple in parting with they most value treasure and give they as pledge to the jew for a loan of money when they be in need of it this plan of lending on pledge or usury belong specially to the jew in europe during the middle age and be both the cause of they prosperity and of they misfortune of they prosperity because they cleverly contrived to become possessor of all the coin and of they misfortune because they usurious demand become so detrimental to the public welfare and be often exact with such unscrupulous severity that people not unfrequently become exasperated and act of violence be commit which as often fall upon the innocent as upon the guilty the greater number of the act of banishment be those for which no other motive be assign or at all

itself by personal attack this feeling be frequently share by the authority themselves who instead of dispense equal justice to the stranger and to the citizen accord to the spirit of the law often decide with partiality and even with resentment and in some case abandon the jew to the fury of the people the people 's feeling of hatred against the sordid avarice of the jew be continually keep up by ballad which be sing and legend which be relate in the public street of the city and in the cottage of the village -- ballad and legend in which usurer be depict in hideous color -lrb- fig 366 -rrb- the most celebrated of these popular composition be evidently that which must have furnish the idea to shakespeare of the _ merchant of venice _ for in this old english drama mention be make of a bargain strike between a jew and a christian who borrow money of he on condition that if he can not refund it on a certain day the lender shall have the right of cut a pound of flesh from he body all the evil which the people say and think of the jew during the middle age seem concentrate in the shylock of the english poet the rate of interest for loan be nevertheless everywhere settle by law and at all time this rate vary accord to the scarcity of gold and be always high enough to give a very ample profit to the lender although they too often require a very much higher rate in truth the small security offer by those borrowing and the arbitrary manner in which debt be at time cancel increase the risk of the lender and the normal difficulty of obtain a loan we find everywhere in all ancient legislation a mass of rule on the rate of pecuniary interest to be allow to the jew -lrb- illustration : fig 366 -- legend of the jew call the devil from a vessel of blood -- fac-simile of a

christian and jew one of the department of the exchequer receive the register of these compact which thus acquire a legal value however it be not unfrequent for the king of england to grant of they own free will letter of release to person owe money to jew and these letter which be often equivalent to the canceling of the entire debt be even at time actually purchase from the sovereign mention of sum receive by the royal treasury for the liberation of debtor or for enable they to recover they mortgage land without payment may still be find in the register of the exchequer of london at the same time jew on the other hand also pay the king large sum in order that he might allow justice to take its course against powerful debtor who be in arrear and who could not be induce to pay we thus see that if the jew practice usury the christian and especially king and powerful noble defraud the jew in every way and be too often disposed to sell to they the smallest concession at a great price indeed christian often go so far as to persecute they in order to obtain the greatest possible amount from they and the jew of the middle age put up with anything provide they could enrich themselves -lrb- illustration : fig 367 -- view and plan of jerusalem -- fac-simile of a woodout in the liber chronicarum mundus large folio nuremberg 1493 -rrb- it must not be suppose however that great as be they capability the jew exclusively devote themselves to financial matter when they be permit to trade they be well satisfy to become artisan or agriculturist in spain they prove themselves most industrious and that kingdom suffer a great loss in consequence of they be expel from it in whatever country they establish themselves the jew carry on most of the mechanical and manual industry with cleverness and success but they could not hope to become land proprietor in country where they be in such bad odour and where the possession of land far from offer they any security could not fail to excite the envy of they enemy if as be the case oriental people be of a serious turn of mind it be easy to understand that the jew should have be still more so since they be always object of hatred and abhorrence we find a touching allegory in the talmud each time that a human being be create god order he angel to bring a soul before he throne and order this soul to go and inhabit the body which be about to be bear on earth the soul be grieve and supplicate the supreme be to spare it that painful trial in which it only see sorrow and affliction this allegory may be suitably apply to a people who have only to expect contempt mistrust and hatred everywhere the israelite therefore cling enthusiastically to the hope of the advent of a messiah who should bring back to they the happy day of the land of promise and they look upon they absence from palestine as only a pass exile but the christian say to they this messiah have long since come alas they answer if he have appear on earth should we still be miserable fulbert bishop of chartre preach three sermon to undeceive the jew by endeavor to prove to they that they messiah be no other than jesus christ but he preach to the wind for the jew remain obstinately attach to they illusion that the messiah be yet to come in any case the jews who mix up the mystery and absurdity of the talmud with the ancient law and numerous rule of the religion of they ancestor find in the practice of they national custom and in the celebration of they mysterious ceremony the sweetest emotion especially when they could devote themselves to they in the peaceful retirement of the ghetto for in all the country in which they live scatter and isolate amongst christian they be careful to conceal they worship and to conduct they ceremonial as secretly as possible the clergy in strive to convert the jew repeatedly have conference with the rabbi of a controversial character which often lead to quarrel and aggravate the lot of the jewish community if catholic proselystism succeed in completely detach a few individual or a few family from the israelitish creed these ardent convert rekindle the horror of the people against they former co-religionist by reveal some of the precept of the talmud sometimes the conversion of whole mass of jew be effect but this happen much less through conviction on they part than through the fear of exile plunder or execution these pretend conversion however do not always protect they from danger in spain the inquisition keep a close watch on convert jew and if they be not true to they new faith severe punishment be inflict upon they in 1506 the inhabitant of abrantès a town of portugal massacre all the baptize jew manoël a king of portugal forbid the convert from sell they goods and leave he dominion the church exclude they from ecclesiastical dignity and when they succeed in obtain civil employment they be receive with distrust in france the parliament try with a show of justice to prevent converted jew from be reproach for they former condition but loui xii during he press want do not scruple to exact a special tax from they and in 1611 we again find that they be unjustly denounce and under the form of a _ remonstrance to the king and the parliament of provence on account of the great family alliance of the new convert _ a appeal be make for the most cruel reprisal against this unfortunate

robbery be commit in this way that the magistrate of the town and the ecclesiastical authority forbid the inhabitant from visit the egyptian ' camp or from have any intercourse with they under penalty

they also declare that in consequence of this crime god have doom they race to perpetual misery and exile five year later we find they in the neighborhood of paris the Sunday after the middle of August say the journal of a bourgeois of pari there come to pari twelve so-called pilgrim that be to say a duke a count and ten man all on horseback they say that they be very good christian and that they come from lower egypt and on the 29th of August the anniversary of the beheading of st john the rest of the band make they appearance these however be not allow to enter pari but by order of the

the saracen they have be force to renounce they religion that at a subsequent period powerful monarch have come to free they from the yoke of the infidel and have decree that as a punishment to they for have renounce the christian faith they should not be allow to return to they country before they have obtain permission from the pope they state that the holy father to whom they have go to confess they sin have then order they to wander about the world for seven year without sleep in bed at the same time give direction to every bishop and every priest whom they meet to offer they ten livre a direction which the abbot and bishop be in no hurry to obey these strange pilgrim state that they have be only five year on the road when they arrive in paris enough have be say to show that although the object of they long pilgrimage be ostensibly a pious one the egyptian or gipsy be not very slow in give to the people whom they visit a true estimate of they questionable honesty and we do not think it would be particularly interesting to follow step by step the track of this odious band which from this period make its appearance sometimes in one country and sometimes in another not only in the north but in the south and especially in the center of europe suffice it to say that they quarrel with the authority or the inhabitant of the country which have the misfortune to be periodically visit by they have leave numerous trace in history on the 7th of November 1453 from sixty to eighty gipsy come from courtisolle arrive at the entrance of the town of cheppe near châlons-sur-marne the stranger many of whom carry javelin dart and other implement of war have ask for hospitality the mayor of the town inform they that it be not long since some of the same company or other very like they have be lodge in the town and have be guilty of various act of theft the gipsy persist in they demand the indignation of the people be arouse and they be soon oblige to resume they journey during they unwilling retreat they be pursue by many of the inhabitant of the town one of whom kill a gipsy name martin de la barre : the murderer however obtain the king 's pardon in 1532 at pleinpalai a suburb of geneva some rascal from among a band of gipsy consist of upward of three hundred in number fall upon several of the officer who be station to prevent they enter the town the citizen hurry up to the scene of disturbance the gipsy retire to the monastery of the augustin friar in which they fortify themselves : the bourgeois besiege they and would have commit summary

be kill with the exception of they chief who be take prisoner and bring before the parliament of bordeaux and order to be hung twenty-one year before this the mayor and magistrate of bordeaux give order to the soldier of the watch to arrest a gipsy chief who have shut himself up in the tower of veyrine at merignac ransack the surrounding country on the 21st of July 1622 the same magistrate order the gipsy to leave the parish of eysine within twenty-four hour under penalty of the lash it be not often that the gipsy use violence or openly resist authority they more frequently have recourse to artifice and cunning in order to attain they end a certain captain charle acquire a great reputation amongst they for the clever trickery which he continually conceive and which he troop undertake to carry out a chronicler of the time say that by means of certain herb which he give to a half-starved horse he make he into a fat and sleek animal the horse be then sell at one of the neighbouring fair or market but the purchaser detect the fraud within a week for the horse soon become thin again and usually sicken and die tallemant des réaux relate that on one occasion captain charle and he attendant take up they quarter in a village the curé of which be rich and parsimonious be much dislike by he parishioner the curé never leave he house and the gipsy could not therefore get a opportunity to rob he in this difficulty they pretend that one of they have commit a crime and have be condemn to be hang a quarter of a league from the village where they betake themselves with all they goods the man at the foot of the gibbet ask for a confessor and they go to fetch the curé he at first refuse to go but he parishioner compel he during he absence some gipsy enter he house take five hundred écus from he strong box and quickly rejoin the troop as soon as the rascal see they return he say that he appeal to the king of _ la petite egypte _ upon which the captain exclaim ah the traitor i expect he would appeal immediately they pack up secure the prisoner and be far enough away from the scene before the curé re-enter he house tallemant relate another good trick near roye in picardy a gipsy who have steal a sheep offer it to a butcher for one hundred sous -lrb- about sixty franc of we money -rrb- but the butcher decline to give more than four livre for it the butcher then go away whereupon the gipsy pull the sheep from a sack into which he have put it and substitute for it a child belong to he tribe he then run after the butcher and say give I five livre and you shall have the sack into the bargain the butcher pay he the money and go away when he get home he open the sack and be much astonish when he see a little boy jump out of it who in a instant catch up the sack and run off never be a poor man so thoroughly hoax as this butcher say tallemant des réaux the gipsy have thousand of other trick in stock as good as the one we have just relate in proof of which we have but to refer to the testimony of one of they own tribe who under the name of pechon de ruby publish towards the close of the sixteenth century la vie généreuse des mattois guex bohémiens et cagoux when they want to leave a place where they have be stop they set out in a opposite direction to that in which they be go and after travel about half a league they take they right course they possess the best and most accurate map in which be lay down not only all the town village and river but also the house of the gentry and other and they fix upon place of rendezvous every ten day at twenty league from the point from whence they set out the captain hand over to each of the chief three or four family to take charge of and these small band take different cross-road towards the place of rendezvous those who be well arm and mount he send off with a good almanac on which be mark all the fair and they continually change they dress and they horse when they take up they quarter in any village they steal very little in its immediate vicinity but in the neighbouring parish they rob and plunder in the most daring manner if they find a sum of money they give notice to the captain and make a rapid flight from the place they coin counterfeit money and put it into circulation they play at all sort of game they buy all sort of horse whether sound or unsound provide they can manage to pay for they in they own base coin when they buy food they pay for it in good money the first time as they be hold in such distrust but when they be about to leave a neighborhood they again buy something for which they tender false coin receive the change in good money in harvest time all door be shut against they nevertheless they contrive by means of picklock and other instrument to effect a entrance into house when they steal linen cloak silver and any other movable article which they can lay they hand on they give a strict account of everything to they captain who take he share of all they get except of what they earn by fortune-telling they be very clever at make a good bargain when they know of a rich merchant be in the place they disguise themselves enter into communication with he and swindle he after which they change they clothes have they horse shoe the reverse way and the shoe cover with some soft material lest they should be hear and gallop away -lrb- illustration : fig

admit that these measure sometimes partook of a barbarous character after have forbid they with a threat of six year at the galley to sojourn in spain charle v order they to leave flander under penalty of death in 1545 a gipsy who have infringe the sentence of banishment be condemn by the court of utrecht to be flog till the blood appear to have he nostril slit he hair remove he beard shave off and to be banish for life we can form some idea say the german historian grellman of the miserable condition of the gipsy from the follow fact : many of they and especially the woman have be burn by they own request in order to end they miserable state of existence and we can give the case of a gipsy who have be arrest flog and conduct to the frontier with the threat that if he reappear in the country he would be hang resolutely return after three successive and similar threat at three different place and implore that the capital sentence might be carry out in order that he might be release

no scruple whatever in kill a gipsy woman who be suckle she child just as they would have do any wild beast which come in they way m francisque michel say amongst the question which arise from a consideration of the existence of this remarkable people be one which although neglect be nevertheless of considerable interest namely how with a strange language unlike any use in europe the gipsy could make themselves understand by the people amongst whom they make they appearance for the first time : newly arrive in the west they could have none of those interpreter who be only to be find amongst a long-established people and who have political and commercial intercourse with other nation where then do the gipsy obtain interpreter the answer seem to we to be clear receive into they rank all those whom crime the fear of punishment a uneasy conscience or the charm of a roaming life continually throw in they path they make use of they either to find they way into country of which they be ignorant or to commit robbery which would otherwise have be impracticable themselves adept in all sort of bad practice they be not slow to form a alliance with profligate character who

be live who have the charge of a large number of child many of whom be steal or illegitimate i be assure that upward of five hundred large family occupy that and other house adjoining large as this court be it be formerly even bigger here without any care for the future every one enjoy the present and eat in the evening what he have earn during the day with so much trouble and often with so many blow for it be one of the fundamental rule of the cour des miracle never to lay by anything for the morrow every one who live there indulge in the utmost licentiousness both religion and law be utterly ignore it be true that outwardly they appear to acknowledge a god for they have set up in a niche a image of god the father which they have steal from some church and before which they come daily to offer up certain prayer but this be only because they superstitiously imagine that by this mean they be release from the necessity of perform the duty of christian to they pastor and they parish and be even absolved from the sin of enter a church for the purpose of robbery and purse-cutting pari the capital of the kingdom of rogue be not the only town which possess a cour des miracle for we find here and there especially at lyon and bordeaux some trace of these privileged resort of rogue and thief which then flourish under the sceptre of the grand coesre sauval state on the testimony of people worthy of credit that at sainte-anne d'auray the most holy place of pilgrimage in brittany under the superintendence of the order of reform carmelite friar there be a large field call the _ rogue 's field _ this be cover with mud hut and here the grand coesre resort annually on the principal solemn festival with he officer and subject in order to hold he council of state that be to say in order to settle and arrange respect robbery at these _ state _ meeting which be not always hold at sainte-anne d'auray all the subject of the grand coesre be present and pay homage to they lord and master some come and pay he the tribute which be require of they by the statute of the craft other render he a account of what they have do and what they have earn during the year when they have execute they work badly he order they to be punish either corporally or pecuniarily accord to the gravity of they offence when he have not himself properly govern he people he be dethrone and a successor be appoint by acclamation -lrb- illustration : fig 380 -- beggar play the fiddle and he wife accompany he with the bone -- from a old engraving of the seventeenth century -rrb- at these assembly as well as in the cours des miracle french be not speak but a strange and artificial language be use call _ jargon _ _ langue matoise narquoi _ & c this language which be still in use under the name of _ argot _ or slang have for the most part be borrow from the jargon or slang of the lower order to a considerable extent accord to the learn philologist of this mysterious language m francisque michel it be compose of french word lengthen or abbreviate of proverbial expression of word express the symbol of thing instead of the thing themselves of term either intentionally or unintentionally alter from they true meaning and of word which resemble other word in sound but which have not the same signification thus for mouth they say _ pantière _ from _ pain _ -lrb- bread -rrb- which they put into it the arm be _ lyan _ -lrb- binder -rrb- a ox be a _ cornant _ -lrb- horn -rrb- a purse a _ fouille _ or _ fouillouse _ a cock a _ horloge _ or timepiece the leg _ des quilles _ -lrb- nine-pin -rrb- a sou a _ rond _ or round thing the eye _ des luisants _ -lrb- sparkler -rrb- & c in jargon several word be also take from the ancient language of the gipsy which testify to the part which these vagabond play in the formation of the argotic community for example a shirt be call _ lime _ a chambermaid _ limogère _ sheet _ liman _ -- word all derive from the gipsy word _ lima _ a shirt : they call a écu a _ rusquin _ or _ rougesme _ from _ rujium _ the common word for money a rich man _ rupin _ a house _ turne _ a knife _ chourin _ from _ rup turna _ and _ chorus _ which in the gipsy tongue mean respectively silver castle and knife from what we have relate about rogue and the cour des miracles one might perhaps be tempt to suppose that france be specially privileged but it be not so for italy be far worse in this respect the rogue be call by the italian _ biantus _ or _ ceretanus _ and be subdivide into more than forty class the various characteristic of which have be describe by a certain rafael frianoro it be not necessary to state that the analog of more than one of these class be to be find in the short description we have give of the argotic kingdom in france we will therefore only mention those which be more especially italian it must not be forget that in the southern country where religion superstition be more marked than elsewhere the numerous family of rogue have no difficulty in practise every description of imposture inasmuch as they trust to the various manifestation of religion feel to effect they purpose thus the _ affratus _ in order to obtain more alms and offering go about in the garb of monk and priest even say mass and pretend that it be the first time they have exercise they sacred office so the _ morghigerus _ walk behind a donkey carry a bell and a lamp with they string of bead in they hand and ask how they be to pay for the bell which they be always just go to buy the _ felsus _ pretend that they be divinely inspire and endow with the gift of second sight and announce that there be hide treasure in certain house under the guardianship of evil spirit they assert that these treasure could not be discover without danger except by means of fasting and offering which they and they brethren could alone make in consideration of which they enter into a bargain and receive a certain sum of money from the owner the _ accatosus _ deserve mention on account of the cleverness with which they contrived to assume the appearance of captive recently escape from slavery shake the chain with which they say they have be bind jabber unintelligible word tell heart-rending tale of they suffering and privation and show the mark of blow which they have receive they go on they knee beg for money that they might buy off they brethren or they friend whom they say they have leave in the hand of the saracen or the turk we must mention also the _ allacrimantus _ or weeper who owe they name to the facility which they possess of shed tear at will and the _ testatorus _ who pretend to be seriously ill and about to die extort money from all those to whom they promise to leave they fortune though of course they have not a son to leave behind they we must not forget the _ protobiantus _ -lrb- master rogue -rrb- who make no scruple of exciting compassion from they own comrade -lrb- fig 381 -rrb- nor the _ vergognosus _ who notwithstanding they poverty wish to be think rich and consider that assistance be due to they from the mere fact of they be noble we must here conclude for it would occupy too much time to go through the list of these italian vagabond as for the german -lrb- fig 382 and 383 -rrb- spanish and english rogue we may simply remark that no type exist among they which be not to be meet with amongst the argotier of france or the biantus of italy in give a description therefore of the mendicity practice in these two country during the middle age we be sure to be represent what it be in other part of europe -lrb- illustration : fig 381 -- italian beggar -- from a engraving by callot -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 382 and 383 -- german beggar -- fac-simile of a woodcut in the cosmographie universelle of munster : in folio basle 1552 -rrb- the history of regular robber and highwayman during this long period be more difficult to describe it contain only disconnect anecdote of a more or less interesting character it be probable moreover that robber do not always commit they depredation singly and that they early understand the advantage of associate together the _ tafur _ or _ halegrin _ whom we notice as follower of godefroy de bouillon at the time of the crusade towards the end of the eleventh century be terribly bad character and be actually accuse by contemporary writer of violate tomb and of live on human flesh on this account they be look upon with the utmost horror by the infidel who dread more they savage ferocity than the valor of the crusader the latter even who have these horde of tafur under they command be not without considerable mistrust of they and when during they march through hungary under the protection of the cross these miscreant commit depredation godefroy de bouillion be oblige to ask pardon for they from the king of that country a ancient poet have hand down to we a story in verse setting forth the exploit of eustace the monk who after have throw aside he frock embrace the life of a robber and only abandon it to become admiral of france under philip augustus he be kill before sandwich in 1217 we have satisfactory proof that as early as the thirteenth century sharper be very expert master of they trade for the ingenious and amusing trick of which they be guilty be quite equal to the most skilled of those now record in we police report in the two follow century the science of the _ pince _ and of the _ croc _ -lrb- pincers and hook -rrb- as it be then call alone make progress and pathelin -lrb- a character in comedy and a incomparable type of craft and dishonesty -rrb- never lack disciple any more than villon do imitator we know that this charming poet who be at the same time a most expert thief narrowly escape hang on two occasion he contemporary attribute to he a poem of twelve hundred verse entitle les repues franch in which be describe the method in use among he companion for procure wine bread meat and fish without have to pay for they they form a series of interesting story the moral of which be to be gather from the follow line : -- c'est bien disné quand on eschappe san desbourcer pa ung denier et dire adieu a tavernier en torchant son nez à la nappe the meaning of this doggrel which be somewhat broad may be render -- he dine well who escape without pay a penny and who bid farewell to the innkeeper by wipe he nose on the tablecloth side by side with this poem of yillon we ought to cite one of a later period -- la légende de maître faifeu versify by charle boudigné this faifeu be a kind of villon of anjou who excel in all kind of rascality and who might possibly have teach it even to the gipsy themselves the character of panurge in the pantagruel be no other than the type of faifeu immortalise by the genius of rabelai we must also mention one of the pamphlet of guillaume bouchet write towards the end of the sixteenth century which give a very amusing account of thief of every description and also l'histoire générale des larron in which be related numerous wonderful tale of murder robbery and other atrocity which make we admiring ancestor well acquaint with the hero of the grève and of montfaucon it must not be suppose that in those day the life of a robber who pursue he occupation with any degree of industry and skill be unattended with danger for the most harmless cut-purse be hang without mercy whenever they be catch the fear however of this fate do not prevent the _ enfants de la matte _ from perform wonder brantôme relate that king charle ix have the curiosity to wish to know how the cut-purse perform they art with so much skill and dexterity and beg captain la chambre to introduce to he on the occasion of a banquet and a ball the cleverest cut-purse give they full liberty to exhibit they skill the captain go to the cours des miracle and fetch ten of the most expert of these thief whom he present to the king charle after the dinner and the ball have take place wish to see all the plunder and find that they have absolutely earn three thousand écus either in money from purse or in precious stone pearl or other jewel some of the guest even lose they cloak at which the king think he should die of laughter the king allow they to keep what they have thus earn at the expense of he guest but he forbid they to continue this sort of life under penalty of be hung and he have they enrol in the army in order to recompense they for they clever feat we may safely assert that they make but indifferent soldier

be animated by the same sentiment and imbue with the same spirit it be divide as we have already state into three great class namely the clergy the nobility and the _ liers-état _ these class each of which form a distinct body within the state carry on a existence peculiar to itself and present in its collective capacity a separate individuality hence there be a distinct ceremonial for each class we will not attempt to give in detail the innumerable law of these three kind of ceremonial we attention will be direct solely to they most characteristic custom and to they most remarkable and interesting aspect take as a whole we must altogether lay aside matter relate specially to ceremony of a purely religion character as they be connect more or less with the tradition and custom of the church and belong to quite a distinct order of thing when the german and especially the frank say the learn paleographer vallet de viriville have succeed in establish they own rule in place of that of the roman these almost savage nation and the barbarian chief who be at they head under the title of king necessarily borrow more or less the refined practice relate to ceremonial possess by the people whom they have conquer the elevation of the elect chief or king on the shield and the solemn taking of arm in the midst of the tribe seem to be the only trace of public ceremony which we can discover among the grerman the marvellous display and the impose splendor of the political hierarchy of the roman empire especially in its outward arrangement must have astonish the mind of these uncultivated people thus we find the frank king become immediately after a victory the simple and clumsy imitator of the civilisation which they have break up clovi on return to tour in 507 after have defeat alaric receive the title of _ patrician _ and _ consul _ from the emperor anastasius and bedeck himself with the purple the chlamy and the diadem the same principle of imitation be afterwards exhibit in the internal and external court ceremonial in proportion as it become develop in the royal person charlemagne who aim at everything which could adorn and add strength to a new monarchy establish a regular method for the general and special administration of he empire as also for the internal arrangement and discipline of he palace we have already refer to this twofold organization -lrb- _ vide _ chapter on private life and on food -rrb- but we may here remark that notwithstanding these ancient tendency to the creation of a fix ceremonial the trifling rule which make etiquette a science and a law be introduce by degree and have only very recently be establish amongst we in 1385 when king charle vi marry the notorious isabel of bavarium then scarcely fourteen year of age he desire to arrange for she a magnificent entry into paris the pomp and brilliancy of which should be consistent with the rank and illustrious descent of he young bride he therefore beg the old queen blanche widow of philippe de valois to preside over the ceremony and to have it conduct accord to the custom of olden time she be consequently oblige in the absence of any fixed rule on the subject to consult the official record -- that be to say the chronique du monastère de saint-denis the first embodiment of rule relate to these matter in use among the nobility which have appear in france under the title of honneurs de la cour only go back to the end of the fifteenth century it appear however that even then this be not generally admit among the nobility as the basis of ceremonial for in 1548 we find that nothing have be definitely settle this be evident from the fact that when king henrus iii desire to know the rank and order of precedence of the prince of the royal blood both duke and count -- as also that of the other prince the baron the noble of the kingdom the constable the marshal of france and the admiral and what position they have hold on great public occasion during the reign of he predecessor -- he commission jean du tillet the civil registrar of the parliament of pari to search among the royal archive for the various authentic document which might throw light on this question and serve as a precedent for the future in fact it be henri iii who in 1585 create the office of grand master of the ceremony of france entrust it to guillaume pot a noble of rhode which office for many generation remain hereditary in he family -lrb- illustration : fig 385 -- herald -lrb- fourteenth century -rrb- -- from a miniature in the chronique de saint-deni -lrb- imperial library of pari -rrb- -rrb- nevertheless the question of ceremonial and especially that of precedence have already more than once occupy the attention of sovereign not only within they own state but also in relation to diplomatic matter the meeting of council at which the ambassador of all the christian power with the delegate of the catholic church be assemble do not fail to bring this subject up for decision pope julius ii in 1504 instruct pierre de crassis he master of the ceremony to publish a decree determine the rank to be take by the various sovereign of europe or by they representative but we should add that this papal decree never receive the sanction of the party interested and that the question of precedence even at the most unimportant public ceremony be during the whole of the middle age a perpetual source of litigation in court of law and of quarrel which too often end in bloodsh it be right that we should place at the head of political ceremony those have reference to the coronation of sovereign which be not only political but owe they supreme importance and dignity to the necessary intervention of ecclesiastical authority we will therefore first speak of the consecration and coronation of the king of france pépin le bref son of charle martel and founder of the second dynasty be the first of the french king who be consecrate by the religion rite of anointing but its mode of administration for a long period undergo numerous change before become establish by a definite law thus pépin after have be first consecrate in 752 in the cathedral of boisson by the archbishop of mayence be again consecrate with he two son charlemagne and carloman in 753 in the abbey of st deni by pope stephen iii charlemagne be twice anoint by the sovereign pontiff first as king of lombardy and then as emperor loui le débonnaire he immediate successor be consecrate at rheim by pope stephen iv in 816 in 877 loui le bègue receive unction and the sceptre at compiègne at the hand of the archbishop of rheim charle le simple in 893 and robert i in 922 be consecrate and crown at rheim but the coronation of raoul in 923 be celebrate in the abbey of st médard de soisson and that of loui d'outremer in 936 at laon from the accession of king lothaire to that of loui vi -lrb- call le gro -rrb- the consecration of the king of france sometimes take place in the metropolitan church of rheim and sometimes in other church but more frequently in the former loui vi have be consecrate in the cathedral of orlean the clergy of rheim appeal against this suppose infraction of custom and they own special privilege a long discussion take place in which be bring forward the title which the church of rheim possess subsequently to the reign of clovi to the exclusive honor of have king consecrate in it and king loui le jeune son of loui le gro who be himself consecrate at rheim promulgate a special decree on this question in anticipation of the consecration of he son philippe auguste this decree finally settle the rights of this ancient church and at the same time define the order which be to be observe in future at the ceremony of consecration from that date down to the end of the reign of the bourbon of the elder line king be invariably consecrate accord to legal rite in the metropolitan church of rheim with the exception of henry iv who be crown at chartre by the bishop of that town on account of the civil war which then divide he kingdom and cause the gate of rheim to be close against he -lrb- illustration : fig 386 --

throne be erect between the chancel and the great nave upon this assemble besides the king and he officer of state twelve ecclesiastical peer together with those prelate whom the king might be please to invite and six lay peer with other officer or noble at daybreak the king send a deputation of baron to the abbey of st remus for the holy vial which be a small glass vessel call _ ampoule _ from the latin word _ ampullum _ contain the holy oil to be use at the royal anoint accord to tradition this vial be bring from heaven by a dive at the time of the consecration of clovis four of the noble remain as hostage at the abbey during the time that the abbot of st remus follow by he monk and escort by the baron go in procession to the cathedral to place the sacred vessel upon the altar the abbot of st deni in france have in a similar manner to bring from rheim with great pomp and deposit by the side of the holy vial the royal insignia which be keep in the treasury of he monastery and have be there since the reign of charlemagne they consist of the crown the sword sheathe the golden spur the gilt sceptre the rod adorn with a ivory handle in the form of a hand the sandal of blue silk embroidered with fleur de lis the chasuble or _ dalmatique _ and the _ surcot _ or royal mantle in the shape of a cape without a hood the king immediately on rise from he bed enter the cathedral and forthwith take oath to maintain the catholio faith and the privilege of the church and to dispense good and impartial justice to he subject he then walk to the foot of the altar and divest himself of part of he dress have he head bare and wear a tunic with opening on the chest on the shoulder at the elbow and in the middle of the back these opening be close by means of silver aigulet the archbishop of rheim then draw the sword from the scabbard and hand it to the king who pass it to the principal officer in attendance the prelate then proceed with the religious part of the ceremony of consecration and take a drop of the miraculous oil out of the holy vial by means of a gold needle he mix it with the holy oil from he own church this be do and sit in the posture of consecration he anoint the king who be kneel before he in five different part of the body namely on the forehead on the breast on the back on the shoulder and on the joint of the arm after this the king rise up and with the assistance of he officer put on he royal robe the archbishop hand to he successively the ring the sceptre and the rod of justice and lastly place the crown on he head at this moment the twelve peer form themselves into a group the lay peer be in the first rank immediately around the sovereign and raise they hand to the crown they hold it for a moment and then they conduct the king to the throne the consecrate prelate put down he mitre then kneel at the foot of the monarch and take the oath of allegiance he example be follow by the other peer and they vassal who be in attendance at the same time the cry of _ vive le roi _ utter by the archbishop be repeat three time outside the cathedral by the heralds-at-arm who shout it to the assemble multitude the latter reply _ noel noel noel _ and scramble for the small piece of money throw to they by the officer who at the same time cry out _ largesse largesse aux manant _ every part of this ceremony be accompany by benediction and prayer the form of which be read out of the consecration service as order by the bishop and the proceedings terminate by the return of the civil and religious procession which have compose the _ cortège _ when the sovereign be marry he wife participate with he in the honor of the consecration the symbolical investiture and the coronation but she only partook of the homage render to the king

and be settle by a decree which the emperor charle ix promulgate in 1356 at the diet of nuremberg accord to the term of this decree -- which be still preserve among the archive of frankfort-on-the-main and which be know as the _ bulle d'or _ or golden bull from the fact of its bear a seal of pure gold -- on the death of a emperor the archbishop of mayence summon for a appoint

service be conclude they retire to the sacristy of the church accompany by they officer and secretary they have thirty day for deliberation but beyond that period they be not allow to eat bread or drink water until they have agree at least by a majority to give _ a temporal chief to the christian people that be to say a king of the roman who should in due time be promote to be emperor _ the newly-elected prince be in fact at first simply _ king of the roman _ and this title be often bear by person who be merely nominate for the office by the voice of the elector or by political

even the fatal part play by these solemnity which be be continually re-enacted and on every sort of pretext during the latter day of monarchy these court be always hold with impressive pomp the

and the reception of ambassador -- without describe they in detail which would involve more space than we have at we command -- we will enter upon the subject of the special ceremonial adopt by the nobility take as we guide the standard book call honneur de la cour compile at the end of the fifteenth century by the celebrated aliénor de poitier in addition to she own observation she give those of she mother isabelle de souza who herself have but continue the work of another noble lady jeanne d'harcourt -- marry in 1391 to the count william de namur -- who be consider the best authority to be find in the kingdom of france this collection of the custom of the court form a kind of family diary embrace three generation and extend back over more than a century notwithstanding the curious and interesting character of this book and the authority which it possess on this subject we can not much to we regret do more than borrow a few passage from it but these carefully select will no doubt suffice to give some idea of the manners and custom of the nobility during the fifteenth century and to illustrate the law of etiquette of which it be the recognize code one of the early chapter of the work set forth this fundamental law of french ceremonial namely that accord to the tradition or custom of france woman however exalt they position be they even king 's daughter rank with they husband we find on the occasion of the marriage of king charle vii with mary of anjou in 1413 although probably there have never be assemble together so many prince and lady of rank that at the banquet the lady alone dine with the queen and no gentleman sit with they we may remark whilst on this subject that before the reign of franci i it be not customary for the two sex to be associate together in the ordinary intercourse of court life and we have elsewhere remark -lrb- see chapter on private life -rrb- that this departure from ancient custom exert a considerable influence not only on manners but also on public affair -lrb- illustration : fig 394 -- interview of king charle v with the emperor charle iv in paris in 1378 -- fac-simile of a miniature in the description of this interview manuscript of the fifteenth century in the library of the arsenal of pari -rrb- the authoress of the honneurs de la cour specially mention the respect which queen mary of anjou pay to the duchess of burgundy when she be at châlons in champagne in 1445 : the duchess come with all she retinue on horseback and in carriage into the courtyard of the mansion where the king and queen be and there alight she first maid of honor act as she train-bearer m de bourbon give she he right hand and the gentleman go on in front in this manner she be conduct to the hall which serve as the ante-chamber to the queen 's apartment there she stop and send in m de crequus to ask the queen if it be she pleasure that she should enter when the duchess come to the door she take the train of she dress from the lady who bear it and let it trail on the ground and as she enter she kneel and then adyance to the middle of the room there she make the same obeisance and move straight towards the queen who be stand close to the foot of she throne when the duchess have perform a further act of homage the queen advance two or three step and the duchess fall on she knee the queen then put she hand on she shoulder embrace she kiss she and command she to rise the duchess then go up to margaret of scotland wife of the dauphin afterwards loui xi who be four or five foot from the queen and pay she the same honor as she have do to the queen although the dauphine appear to wish to prevent she from absolutely kneel to she after this she turn towards the queen of sicily -lrb- isabelle de lorraine wife of rené of anjou brother-in-law of the king -rrb- who be two or three foot from the dauphine and merely bow to she and the same to another princess madame de calabre who be still more distantly connect with the blood royal then the queen and after she the dauphine kiss the three maid of honor of the duchess and the wife of the gentleman the duchess do the same to the lady who accompany the queen and the dauphine but of those of the queen of sicily the duchess kiss none inasmuch as the queen have not kiss hers and the duchess would not walk behind the queen for she say that the duke of burgundy be nearer the crown of france than be the king of sicily and also that she be daughter of the king of portugal who be greater than the king of sicily further on from the detail give of a similar reception we learn that etiquette be not at that time regulate by the law of politeness as now understand inasmuch as the voluntary respect pay by man to the gentle sex be influence much by social rank thus at the time of a visit of loui xi then dauphin to the court of brussels to which place he go to seek refuge against the anger of he father the duchess of burgundy of charolai and of clèves he near relative exhibit towards he all the token of submission and inferiority which he might have receive from a vassal the dauphin it be true wish to avoid this homage and a disussion on the subject of more than a quarter of a hour ensue at last he take the duchess of burgundy by the arm and lead she away in order to cut short the ceremony about which madame make so much to do this however do not prevent the princess on they withdraw from kneel to the ground in order to show they respect for the son of the king of france -lrb- illustration : fig 395 -- the entry of loui xi into pari -- fac-simile of a miniature in the chronique of monstrelet manuscript of the fifteenth century -lrb- imperial library of pari -rrb- -rrb- we have already see that the duchess of burgundy when about to appear before the queen take she train from she train-bearer in order that she might carry it herself in this she be only conform to a general principle which be that in the presence of a superior a person however high he rank should not himself receive honor whilst at the same time pay they to another thus a duke and a duchess amidst they court have all the thing which be use at they table cover -- hence the modern expression _ mettre le couvert _ -lrb- to lay the cloth -rrb- -- even the wash-hand basin and the _ cadenas _ a kind of case in which the cup knife and other table article be keep but when they be entertain a king all these mark of superiority be remove as a matter of etiquette from the table at which they sit and be pass on as a act of respect to the sovereign present the book of dame aliénor in a series of article to which we shall merely allude speak at great length and enter into detail respect the interior arrangement of the room in which prince and other noble child be bear the formality go through on these occasion be as curious as they be complicate and dame aliénor regret to see they fall into disuse owe to which she say we fear that the possession of the great house of the nobility be get too large as every one admit and chicanery or concealment of birth so as to make away with too many child be on the increase mourning be the next subject which we shall notice the king never wear black for mourn not even for he father but scarlet or violet the queen wear white and do not leave she apartment for a whole year hence the name of _ château hôtel _ or _ tour de la reine blanche _ which many of the building of the middle age still bear from the fact that widow queen inhabit they during the first year of they widowhood on occasion of mourn the various reception room of a house be hang with black in deep mourn such as that for a husband or a father a lady wear neither glove jewel nor silk the head be cover with a low black head-dress with trail lappet call _ chaperon barbette couvre-chef _ and _ touret _ a duchess and the wife of a knight or a banneret on go into mourn stay in they apartment for six week the former during the whole of this time when in deep mourning remain lie down all day on a bed cover with a white sheet whereas the latter at the end of nine day get up and until the six week be over remain sit in front of the bed on a black sheet lady do not attend the funeral of they husband though it be usual for they to be present at those of they father and mother for a elder brother they wear the same mourning as for a father but they do not lie down as above describe -lrb- illustration : fig 396 -- how the king-at-arm present the sword to the duke of bourbon -- from a miniature in tournoi du rous rené manuscript of the fifteenth century -lrb- imperial library of pari -rrb- -rrb- in they everyday intercourse with one another king prince duke and duchess call one another _ monsieur _ and _ madame _ add the christian name or that of the estate a superior speaking or write to a inferior might prefix to he or she title of relationship _ beau _ or _ belle _ for instance _ mon bel oncle ma belle cousine _ people in a lower sphere of life on be introduce to one another do not say monsieur jean ma belle tante -- mr john allow I to introduce you to my aunt -- but simply jean ma tante the head of a house have he seat under a canopy or _ dosseret _ -lrb- fig 396 -rrb- which he only relinquish to he sovereign when he have the honor of entertaining he such say aliénor in conclusion be the point of etiquette which be observe in germany in france in naple in italy and in all other civilised country and kingdom we may here remark that etiquette after have originate in france spread throughout all christian nation and when it have become naturalised as it be amongst the latter it acquire a settle position which it retain more firmly than it do in france in this latter country it be only from the seventeenth century and particularly under loui xiv that court etiquette really become a science and almost a species of religion observance whose minutiae be attend to as much as if they be sacramental rite though they be not unfrequently of the most childish character and whose pomp and precision often cause the most insufferable annoyance but notwithstanding the perpetual change of time and custom the french nation have always be distinguish for nobility and dignity temper with good sense and elegance if we now direct we attention to the _ tier état _ that class which to quote a celebrated expression be destine to become everything after have for a long time be look upon as nothing we shall notice that there too custom and tradition have much to do with ceremony of all kind the presence of the middle class not only give as it be a stamp of grandeur to fêtes of a aristocratic and religion character but in addition the people themselves have a number of ceremony of every description in which etiquette be not one whit less strict than in those of the court the variety of civic and popular ceremony be so great that it would require a large volume illustrate with numerous engraving to explain fully they characteristic feature the simple enumeration of the various public fêtes each of which be necessarily accompany by a distinct ceremonial would take up much time be we to attempt to give it even in the shortest manner -lrb- illustration : fig 397 -- entry of the roi de l'epinette at lille in the sixteenth century -- from a miniature in a manuscript of the library of rouen -rrb- besides the numerous ceremony which be purely religious namely the procession of the _ fête-dieu _ in rogation week and the fêtes which be both of a superstition and burlesque character such as _ des fous de l'ane des innocent _ and other of the same kind so much in vogue during the middle age and which we shall describe more in detail hereafter we should like to mention the military or gymnastic fêtes amongst these be what be call the procession of the _ confrères de l'arquebuse _ the _ archer _ the _ papegaut _ the _ roi de l'epinette _ at lille -lrb- fig 397 -rrb- and the _ forestier _ at bruge there be also what may be term the fêtes peculiar to certain place such as those of _ béhors _ of the _ champ galat _ at epinal of the _ laboureur _ at montélimar of _ guy l'an neuf _ at anjou also of the fêtes of _ may _ of the _ sheaf _ of the _ spring _ of the _ rose _ of the _ fire of st john _ & c then there be the historical or commemorative fêtes such as those of the _ géant reuss _ at dunkerque of the _ gayant _ at douai & c also of _ guet de saint-maxime _ at riez in provence the procession of _ jeanne d'arc _ at orlean of _ jeanne hachette _ at beauvai and lastly the numerous fêtes of public corporation such as the _ écoliers _ the _ nation _ the _ universités _ also the _ lendit _ the _ saint-charlemagne _ the _ baillée des rose au parlement _ the literary fêtes of the _ pay et chambres de rhetorique _ of picardy and flander of the _ clémence isaure _ at toulouse and of the _ capitole _ at rome & c the fêtes of the _ serment métiers _ and _ devoir _ of the work man 's corporation and lastly the _ fêtes patronale _ call also _ assemblées ducass foly foire kermess pardon _ & c from this simple enumeration it can easily be understand what a useless task we should impose upon ourselves be we merely to enter upon so wide and difficult a subject apart from the infinite variety of detail result from the local circumstance under which these ceremony have be institute which be everywhere celebrate at fix period a kind of general principle regulate and direct they arrangement nearly all these fêtes and public rejoicing which to a certain extent constitute the common basis of popular ceremonial bear much analogy to one another there be however certain peculiarity less known and more striking than the rest which deserve to be mention and we shall then conclude this part of we subject -lrb- illustration : fig 398 -- representation of a ballet before henrus iii and he court in the gallery of the louvre --

observe and which most persistently keep they place amongst we be far from be of modern origin thus the custom of jovially celebrate the commencement of the new year or of devote certain particular day to festivity be still universally follow in every country in the world the practice of send present on _ new year 's day _ be to be find among civilised nation in the east as well as in we own country in the middle age the intimate friend of prince and especially of the king of france receive christmas gift for which they consider themselves bind to make a ample return in england these interchange of generosity also take place on christmas day in russium on easter day the people on meeting in the street salute one another by say christ be rise these practice as well as many other have no doubt be hand down to we from the early age of christianity the same may be say of a vast number of custom of a more or less local character which have be observe in various country for century in former time at ochsenbach in wurtemberg during the carnival woman hold a feast at which they be wait upon by man and after it be over they form themselves into a sort of court of plenary indulgence from which the man be uniformly exclude and sit in judgment on one another at ramerupt a small town in champagne every year on the 1st of may twenty of the citizen repair to the adjoining hamlet of st remy hunting as they go along they be call _ the fool of rameru _ and it be say that the greatest fool lead the band the inhabitant of st remy be bind to receive they gratuitously and to supply they as well as they horse and dog with what they require to have a mass say for they to put up with all the absurd vagary of the captain and he troop and to supply they with a _ fine and handsome horned ram _ which be lead back in triumph on they return into ramerupt they set up shout at the door of the curé the procurator fiscal and the collector of tax and after the invention of gunpowder firework be let off they then go to the market-place where they dance round the ram which be decorate with ribbon no doubt this be a relic of the feast of ancient heathenism a more curious ceremony still whose origin we think may be trace to the dionysian feast of heathenism have continue to be observe to this day at béziers it bear the name of the _ feast of pepézuch _ the _ triumph of béziers _ or the _ feast of caritat _ or _ charités _ at the bottom of the rue française at béziers a statue be to be see which notwithstanding the mutilation to which it have be subject still distinctly bear trace of be a ancient work of the most refined period of art this statue represent pepézuch a citizen of béziers who accord to somewhat questionable tradition valiantly defend the town against the goth or as some say against the english its origin therefore can not be later than the thirteenth century on ascension day the day of the feast of pepézuch a immense procession go about the town three remarkable machine be particularly noticeable the first be a enormous wooden camel make to walk by mechanism and to move its limb and jaw the second be a galley on wheel fully man the third consist of a cart on which a travel theater be erect the consul and other civic authority the corporation of trade have the pastor walk in front of they the farrier on horseback all bear they respective insignia and banner form the procession a double column compose of a division of young man and young woman hold white hoop decorate with ribbon and many-coloured streamer be precede by a young girl crown with flower half veil and carry a basket this brilliant procession march to the sound of music and at certain distance the youthful couple of the two sex halt in order to perform with the assistance of they hoop various figure which be call the _ danse des treilles _ the machine also stop from time to time at various place the camel be especially make to enter the church of st aphrodise because it be say that the apostle have first come on a camel to preach the gospel in that country and there to receive the palm of martyrdom on arrive before the statue of pepézuch the young people decorate it with garland when the square of the town be reach the theater be stop like the ancient car of thespi and the actor treat the people to a few comical drollery in imitation of aristophane from the galley the youth fling sugar-plum and sweetmeat which the spectator return in equal profusion the procession close with a number of man crown with green leaf carry on they head loaf of bread which with other provision contain in the galley be distribute amongst the poor of the town in germany and in france it be the custom at the public entry of king prince and person of rank to offer they the wine make in the district and commonly sell in the town at langre for instance these wine be put into four pewter vessel call _ cimaise _ which be still to be see they be call the _ lion monkey sheep _ and _ pig _ wine symbolical name which express the different degree or phase of drunkenness which they be suppose to be capable of produce : the lion courage the monkey cunning the sheep good temper the pig bestiality we will now conclude by borrow from the excellent work of m alfr michiel on dutch and flemish painting the abridged description of a procession of corporation of trade which take place at antwerp in 1520 on the Sunday after ascension day all the corporation of trade be present every member be dress in he best suit in front of each guild a banner

the barbarian invasion bring about a revolution in the dress as well as in the social state of the people and it be from the time of these invasion that we may date properly speak the history of modern dress for the roman costume which be in use at the same time as that of the frank the hun the vandal the goth & c be subject to various change down to the ninth century these modification increase afterwards to such a extent that towards the fourteenth century the original type have altogether disappear -lrb- illustration : fig 400 and 401 -- gallo-roman costume -- from bas-relief discover in paris in 1711 underneath the choir of notre-dame -rrb- it be quite natural that man live in a temperate climate and bearing arm only when in the service of the state should be satisfy with garment which they could wear without wrap themselves up too closely the northern nation on the contrary have early learn to protect themselves against the severity of the climate in which they live thus the garment know by they as _ braie _ and by the parthian as _ sarabara _ doubtless give origin to those which have be respectively call by we _ chauss haut-de-chausses trouss grègues culotte pantalon _ & c these wander people have other reason for prefer the short and close-fitting garment to those which be long and full and these be they innate pugnacity which force they ever to be under arm they habit of dwelling in forest and thicket they love of the chase and they custom of wear armor the ancient greek and roman always go bareheaded in the town but in the country in order to protect themselves from the direct ray of the sun they wear hat much resemble we round hat make of feel plaited rush or straw other european nation of the same period also go bareheaded or wear cap make of skin of animal have no regularity of style and with the shape of which we be but little acquaint shoe and head-dress of a definite style belong to a much more modern period as also do the many variety of female dress which have be know at all time and in all country under the general name of _ robe _ the girdle be only use occasionally and its adoption depend on circumstance the woman use it in the same way as the man for in those day it be never attach to the dress the great difference in modern female costume consist in the fact of the girdle be part of the dress thus give a long or short waist accord to the requirement of fashion in the same manner a complete revolution take place in man 's dress accord as loose or tight long or short sleeve be introduce we shall commence we historical sketch from the fifth century at which period we can trace the blending of the roman with the barbaric costume -- namely the combination of the long shapeless garment with that which be worn by the german and which be accompany by tight-fitting braie thus in the recumbent statue which adorn the tomb of clovi in the church of the abbey of st geneviève the king be represent as wear the _ tunic _ and the _ toga _ but in addition gallo-roman civilization have actually give he tight-fitting braie somewhat similar to what we now call pantaloons besides this he tunic be fasten by a belt which however be not a novelty in he time for the woman then wear long dress fasten at the waist by a girdle there be nothing very remarkable about he shoe since we find that the shoe or close sandal be worn from the remotest period by nearly all nation -lrb- fig 402 and 403 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 402 -- costume of king clovi -lrb- sixth century -rrb- -- from a statue on he tomb formerly

germain-des-prés -rrb- the cloak claim a equally ancient origin the principal thing worthy of notice be the amount of ornament with which the frank enrich they girdle and the border of they tunic and cloak this fashion they borrow from the imperial court which have be transfer from rome to constantinople during the third century be not slow to adopt the luxury of precious stone and other rich decoration commonly in use amongst eastern nation follow the example of horace de vielcastel the learn author of a history of the costume of france we may here state that it be very difficult if not impossible to define the exact costume during the time of the early merovingian period the first writer who have touch upon this subject have speak of it very vaguely or not be contemporary of the time of which they write could only describe from tradition or hearsay those monument in which early costume be suppose to be represent be almost all of later date when artist whether sculptor or painter be not very exact in they delineation of costume and even seem to imagine that no other style could have exist before they time than the one with which they be daily familiar in order to be as accurate as possible although after all we can only speak hypothetically we can not do better than call to mind on the one hand what tacitus say of the german that they be almost naked except for a short and tight garment round they waist and a little square cloak which they throw over the right shoulder and on the other to carry ourselves back in imagination to the ancient roman costume we may notice moreover the curious description give of the frank by sidoine apollinaire who say they tie up they flaxen or light-brown hair above they forehead into a kind of tuft and then make it fall behind the head like a horse 's tail the face be clean shave with the exception of two long moustache they wear cloth garment fitting tight to the body and limb and a broad belt to which they hang they sword but this be a sketch make at a time when the frankish race be only know among the gaul through its maraud tribe whose raid from time to time spread terror and dismay throughout the country which they visit from the moment when the uncultivated tribe of ancient germany formally take possession of the territory which they have withdraw from roman rule they show themselves desirous of adopt the more gentle manners of the conquer nation in imitation of they chief say m jule quicherat the eminent antiquarian more than once the frank doff the war coat and the leather belt and assume the toga of roman dignity more than once they flaxen hair be show to advantage by flow over the imperial mantle and the gold of the knight the purple of the senator and patrician the triumphal crown the fasce and in short everything which the roman empire invent in order to exhibit its grandeur assist in add to that of we ancestor -lrb- illustration : fig 404 and 405 -- saint in the costume of the sixth to the eighth century -- from miniature in old manuscript of the royal library of brussels -lrb- design by count h de vielcastel -rrb- -rrb- one great and characteristic difference between the roman and the frank should however be specially mention namely in the fashion of wear the hair long a fashion never adopt by the roman and which during the whole of the first dynasty be a distinguishing mark of king and noble among the frank agathia the greek historian say the hair be never cut from the head of the frankish king ' son from early youth they hair fall gracefully over they shoulder it be part on the forehead and fall equally on both side it be with they a matter to which they give special attention we be tell besides that they sprinkle it with gold-dust and plait it in small band which they ornament with pearl and precious metal whilst person of rank be distinguish by they long and flowing hair the people wear theirs more or less short accord to the degree of freedom which they possess and the serf have they head completely shave it be customary for the noble and free class to swear by they hair and it be consider the height of politeness to pull out a hair and present it to a person frédégaire the chronicler relate that clovi thus pull out a hair in order to do honor to st germer bishop of toulouse and present it to he upon this the courtier hasten to imitate they sovereign and the venerable prelate return home with he hand full of hair delighted at the flattering reception he have meet with at the court of the frankish king durinig the merovingian period the greatest insult that could be offer to a freeman be to touch he with a razor or scissors the degradation of king and prince be carry out in a public manner by shave they head and send they into a monastery on they regain they rights and they authority they hair be always allow to grow again we may also conclude that great importance be attach to the preservation of the hair even under the king of the second dynasty for charlemagne in he capitulaire order the hair to be remove as a punishment in certain crime the frank faithful to they ancient custom of wear the hair long gradually give up shave the face at first they only leave a small tuft on the chin but by degree they allow this to increase and in the sixth and seventh century freemen adopt the usual form of beard amongst the clergy the custom prevail of shave the crown of the head in the same way as that adopt by certain monastic order in the present day priest for a long time wear beard but cease to do so on they become fashionable amongst the laity -lrb- fig 406 407 -rrb- painter and sculptor therefore commit a serious error in represent the prelate and monk of those time with large beard as far as

political trouble of internal war and of social disturbance they have neither time nor inclination for invent new fashion monument of the latter part of the ninth century prove indeed that the

shame and a dishonor to have the head shave it must not be suppose that the upper class continue to wear the long merovingian style of hair after the reign of charlemagne it be the fashion to shave the hair from above the forehead the parting be thus widen and the hair be so arrange that it should not fall lower than the middle of the neck under charle the bald whose surname prove that he be not partial to long hair this custom fall into disuse or be abandon and man have the greater part of they head shave and only keep a sort of cap of hair grow on the top of the head it be at this period that we first find the _ cowl _ worn this kind of common head-dress make from the fur of animal or from woollen stuff continue to be worn for many century and indeed almost to the present day it be originally only a kind of cap light and very small but it gradually become extend in size and successively cover the ear the neck and lastly even the shoulder no great change be make in the dress of

before proceed further in we history of mediæval dress we must forestall a remark which will not fail to be make by the reader and this be that we seem to occupy ourselves exclusively with the dress of king queen and other people of note but we must reply that though we be able to form tolerably accurate notion relative to the dress of the upper class during these remote period we do not possess any reliable information relative to that of the lower order and that the write document as well as the sculpture and painting be almost useless on this point nevertheless we may suppose that the dress of the man in the lowest rank of society have always be short and tight consist of _ braie _ or tight drawer mostly make of leather of tight tunic of _ sayon _ or doublet and of cape or cloak of coarse brown woollen the tunic be confine at the waist by a belt to which the knife the purse and sometimes the work tool be suspend the head-dress of the people be generally a simple cap make of thick coarse woollen cloth or feel and often of sheep 's skin during the twelfth century a person 's rank or social position be determine by the head-dress the cap be make of velvet for person of rank and of common cloth for the poor the _ cornette _ which be always a appendage to the cap be make of cloth with which the cap might be fasten or adjust on the head the _ mortier _ or round cap date from the earliest century and be alter both in shape and material accord to the various change of fashion but lawyer of high position continue to wear it almost in its original shape and it become

so as to join the moustache generally under loui le jeune -lrb- fig 412 -rrb- moustache go out of fashion we next find beard wear only by country people who accord to contemporary historian desire to preserve a remembrance of they participation in the crusade at the end of this century all chin be shave the crusade also give rise to the general use of the purse which be suspend to the belt by a cord of silk or cotton and sometimes by a metal chain at the time of the holy war it have become a emblem characteristic of pilgrim who before start for palestine receive from the hand of the priest the cross the pilgrim 's staff and the purse we now come to the time of loui ix -lrb- fig 414 to 418 -rrb- of that good king who accord to the testimony of he historian generally dress with the greatest simplicity but who notwithstanding he usual modesty and economy do not hesitate on great occasion to submit to the pomp require by the regal position which he hold sometimes say the sire de

lavish on dress at the marriage of philip iii son of st loui the gentleman be dress in scarlet the lady in cloth of gold embroidered and trim with gold and silver lace massive belt of gold be also worn and chaplet sparkling with the same costly metal moreover this magnificence and display -lrb- see chapter on private life -rrb- be not confine to the court for we find that it extend to the bourgeois class since philippe le bel by he edict of 1294 endeavor to limit this extravagance which in the eye of the world have a especial tendency to obliterate or at least to conceal all distinction of birth rank and condition wealth strive hard at that time to be the sole standard of dress as we approach the fourteenth century -- a epoch of the middle age at which after many change of fashion and many struggle against the ancient roman and german tradition modern national costume seem at last to have assume a settle and normal character -- we think it right to recapitulate somewhat with a view to set forth the nature of the various element which be at work from time to time in form the fashion in dress in order to give more weight to we remark we will extract almost word for word a few page from the learn and excellent work which m jule quicherat have publish on this subject towards the year 1280 he say the dress of a man -- not of a man as the word be then use which mean _ serf _ but of one to whom the exercise of human prerogative be permit that be to say of a ecclesiastic a bourgeois or a noble -- be compose of six indispensable portion : the _ braie _ or breeches the stocking the shoe the coat the surcoat or _ cotte-hardie _ and the _ chaperon _ or head-dress to these article those who wish to dress more elegantly add on the body a shirt on the shoulder a mantle and on the head a hat or _ fronteau _ -lrb- illustration : fig 417 -- costume of the common people in the fourteenth century : italian gardener and woodman -- from two engraving in the bonnart collection -rrb- the _ braie _ or _ braye _ be a kind of drawer generally knit sometimes make of woollen stuff or silk and sometimes even of undressed leather we ancestor derive this part of they dress from the ancient gaul only the gallic braie come down to the ankle whereas those of the thirteenth century only reach to the calf they be fasten above the hip by means of a belt call the _ braier _ by _ chauss _ be mean what we now call long stocking or hose the stocking be of the same color and material as the braie and be keep up by the lower part of the braie be pull over they and tie with a string the shoe be make of various kind of leather the quality of which depend on the way in which they be tan and be either of common leather or of leather which be similar to that we know as morocco and be call _ cordouan _ or _ cordua _ -lrb- hence the derivation of the word _ cordouannier _ which have now become _ cordonnier _ -rrb- shoe be generally make point this fashion of the _ poulaine _ or polish point be follow throughout the whole of europe for nearly three hundred year and when first introduce the church be so scandalize by it that it be almost place in the catalogue of heresy subsequently the taste respect the exaggerated length of the point be somewhat modify but it have become so inveterate that the tendency for pointed shoe return to they former absurd extreme be constantly show itself the pointed shoe become gradually longer during the struggle which be carry on in the reign of philippe le bel between church and state besides the shoe there be also the _ estiviaux _ thus name from _ estiva _ -lrb- summer thing -rrb- because be generally make of velvet brocade or other costly material they could only be worn in dry weather the coat -lrb- _ cotte _ -rrb- correspond with the tunic of the ancient it be a blouse with tight sleeve these sleeve be the only part of it which be expose the rest be completely cover by the surcoat or _ cotte-hardie _ a name the origin of which be obscure in shape the surcoat somewhat resemble a sack in which at a later period large slit be make in the arm as well as over the hip and on the chest through which appear the rich fur and satin with which it be line the ordinary material of the surcoat for the rich be cloth either scarlet blue or reddish brown or two or more of these color mix together and for the poor linsey-woolsey or fustian the noble prince or baron when hold a court wear surcoat of a color to match they arm which be embroider upon they but the lesser noble who frequent the house of the great speak of themselves as in the robe of such and such a noble because he whose patronage they court be oblige to provide they with surcoat and mantle these be of they patron 's favorite color and be call the livery -lrb- _ livrée _ -rrb- on account of they distribution -lrb- _ livraison _ -rrb- which take place twice a year the word have remain in use ever since but with a different signification it be however so nearly akin to the original meaning that its affinity be evident -lrb- illustration : fig 418 -- costume of english servant in the fourteenth century -- from manuscript in the british museum -rrb- -lrb- illustration : fig 419 -- costume of philip the good with hood and cockade -- from a miniature in a manuscript of the period -rrb- a interesting anecdote relative to this custom be to be find in the chronicle of matthew pari when st loui to the dismay of all he vassal and of he inferior servant have decide to take up the cross he succeed in associate the noble of he court with he in he vow by a kind of pious fraud have have a certain number of mantle prepare for christmas-day he have a small white cross embroider on each above the right shoulder and order they to be distribute among the noble on the morning of the feast when they be about to go to mass which be celebrate some time before sunrise each courtier receive the mantle give by the king at the door of he room and put it on in the dark without notice the white cross but when the day break to he great surprise he see the emblem worn by he neighbor without know that he himself wear it also they be surprised and amuse say the english historian at find that the king have thus piously entrap they as it would have be unbecome shameful and even unworthy of they to have remove these cross they laugh heartily and say that the good king on start as a pilgrim-hunter have find a new method of catch man the chaperon add m quicherat be the national head-dress of the ancient french as the _ cucullus _ which be its model be that of the gaul we can imagine its appearance by its resemblance to the domino now wear at mask ball the shape be much vary during the reign of philippe le bel either by the diminution of the cape or by the lengthening of the hood which be always sufficiently long to fall on the shoulder in the first of these change the chaperon no longer be tie round the neck require to be hold on the head by something more solid for this reason it be set on a pad or roll which change it into a regular cap the material be so stitch as to make it take certain fold which be arrange as puff as ruff or in the shape of a cock 's comb this last fashion call _ cockade _ be especially in vogue -lrb- fig 419 -rrb- -- hence the origin of the french epithet _ coquard _ which would be now express by the word _ dandy _ hat be of various shape they be make of different kind of feel or of otter or goat 's skin or of wool or cotton the expression _ chapeau de fleurs _ -lrb- hat of flower -rrb- which continually occur in ancient work do not mean any form of hat but simply a coronet of forget-me-not or rose which be a indispensable part of dress for ball or festivity down to the reign of philippe de valois -lrb- 1347 -rrb- frontlet -lrb- _ fronteaux _ -rrb- a species of fillet make of silk cover with gold and precious stone supersede the _ chapeau de fleurs _ inasmuch as they have the advantage of not fading they also possess the merit of be much more costly and be thus the means of establish in a still more marked manner distinction in the social position of the wearer -lrb-

envelop the body like a bell be slit up on the right side and be throw back over the left arm it be make with a fur collar cut in the shape of a tippet this last have be hand down to we and be worn by we judge under the name of _ toge _ and _ épitoge _ it be a very common mistake to suppose that the shirt be a article of dress of modern invention on the contrary it be one of great antiquity and its come into general use be the only thing new about it lastly we have to mention the _ chape _ which be always regard as a necessary article of dress the _ chape _ be the only protection against bad weather at a period when umbrella and cover carriage be unknown it be sometimes call _ chape de pluie _ on account of the use to which it be apply and it consist of a large cape with sleeve and be completely waterproof it be bear behind a master by he servant who on account of this service be call a _ porte-chape _ it be needless to say that the common people carry it themselves either sling over they back or fold under the arm if we now turn to female attire we shall find represent in it all the component part of male dress and almost all of they under the same name it must be remark however that the woman 's coat and surcoat often trail on the ground that the hat -- which be generally call a _ couvre-chef _ and consist of a frame of wirework cover over with stuff which be embroidered or trim with lace -- be not of a conical shape and lastly that the _ chaperon _ which be always make with a tippet or _ chausse _ never turn over so as to form a cap we may add that the use of the couvre-chef do not continue beyond the middle of the fourteenth century at which time woman adopt the custom of wear any kind of head-dress they choose the hair be keep back by a silken net or _ crépine _ attach either to a frontlet or to a metal fillet or confine by a veil of very light material call a _ mollequin _ -lrb- fig 420 -rrb- with the aid of we learn guide we have now reach a period -lrb- end of the thirteenth century -rrb- well adapt for this general study of the dress of we ancestor inasmuch as soon afterwards man 's dress at least and especially that of young courtier become most ridiculously and even indecently exaggerate to such a extent be this the case that serious calamity have befall the french nation about this time and its fashion have exercise a considerable influence over the whole continent of europe contemporary historian do not hesitate to regard these public misfortune as a providential chastisement inflict on france for its disgraceful extravagance in dress -lrb- illustration : fig 421 -- costume of a young nobleman and of a bourgeois in the fourteenth century -- from a paint window in the church of saint-ouen at rouen and from a window at moulin -lrb- bourbonnai -rrb- -rrb- we must believe that god have permit this as a just judgment on we for we sin say the monk who edit the grande chronique de st denis in 1346 at the time of the unfortunate battle of cressy although it do not belong to we to judge but what we see we testify to for pride be very great in france and especially amongst the noble and other that be to say pride of nobility and covetousness there be also much impropriety in dress and this extend throughout the whole of france some have they clothes so short and so tight that it require the help of two person to dress and undress they and whilst they be be undressed they appear as if they be be skin other wear dress plait over they loin like woman some have chaperon cut out in point all round some have tippet of one cloth other of another and some have they head-dress and sleeve reach to the ground look more like mountebank than anything else consider all this it be not surprising if god employ the king of england as a scourge to correct the excess of the french people and this be not the only testimony to the ridiculous and extravagant taste of this unfortunate period one writer speak with indignation of the _ goat ' beard _ -lrb- with two point -rrb- which seem to put the last finishing touch of ridicule on the already grotesque appearance of even the most serious people of that period another exclaim against the extravagant luxury of jewel of gold and silver and against the wear of feather which latter then appear for the first time as accessory to both male and female attire some censure and not without reason the absurd fashion of convert the ancient leather girdle mean to support the waist into a kind of heavy padded band stud with gilded ornament and precious stone and apparently invent expressly to encumber the person wear it other contemporary writer and amongst these pope urban v and king charle v -lrb- fig 422 -rrb- inveigh against the _ poulaine _ which have more than ever come into favor and which be only consider correct in fashion when they be make as a kind of appendix to the foot measure at least double its length and ornament in the most fantastical manner the pope anathematize this deformity as a mockery of god and the holy church and the king forbid craftsman to make they and he subject to wear they all this be as nothing in comparison with the profuse extravagance display in fur which be most outrageous and ruinous and of which we could not form a idea be it not for the item in certain royal document from which we gather that in order to trim two complete suit for king john no fewer than six hundred and seventy marten ' skin be use it be also state that the duke of berry the youngest son of that monarch purchase nearly ten thousand of these same skin from a distant country in the north in order to trim only five mantle and as many surcoat we read also that a robe make for the duke of orlean grandson of the same king require two thousand seven hundred and ninety ermine ' skin it be unnecessary to state that in consequence of this large consumption skin could only be purchase at the most extravagant price for example fifty skin cost about one hundred franc -lrb- or about six thousand of present currency -rrb- show to what a enormous expense those person be put who desire to keep pace with the luxury of the time -lrb-

with instinctive modesty adopt a upper garment the object of which seem to be to conceal the absurd fashion which they have not the courage to rid themselves of this heavy and ungraceful tunic call a _ housse _ consist of two broad band of a more or less costly material which start from the neck fall behind and before thus almost entirely conceal the front and back of the person and only allow the under garment to be see through the slit which naturally open on each side of it a fact worthy of remark be that whilst male attire through a depravity of taste have extend to the utmost limit of extravagance woman 's dress on the contrary owing to a strenuous effort towards a dignified and elegant simplicity become of such a character that it combine all the most approved fashion of female costume which have be in use in former period the statue of queen jeanne de bourbon wife of charle v formerly place with that of she husband in the church of the célestins at paris give the most

middle age there be but one common standard of fashion which vary from time to time accord to the particular custom of each country and accord to the peculiarity of each race in italy for instance dress always maintain a certain character of grandeur ever recall the fact that the influence of antiquity be not quite lose in germany and switzerland garment have generally a heavy and massive appearance in holland still more so -lrb- fig 436 and 437 -rrb- england uniformly study a kind of instinctive elegance and propriety it be a curious fact that spain invariably partook of the heaviness peculiar to germany either because the gothic element still prevail there or that the walloon fashion have a special attraction to she owing to association and general usage france be then as it be now fickle and capricious fantastical and wavering but not from indifference but because she be always ready to borrow from every quarter anything which please she she however never fail to put she own stamp on whatever she adopt thus make any fashion essentially french even though she have only just borrow it from spain england germany or italy in all these country we have see and still see entire province adhering to some ancient costume cause they to differ altogether in character from the rest of the nation this be simply owe to the fact that the fashion have become obsolete in the neighbouring place for every local costume faithfully and rigorously preserve by any community at a distance from the center of political action or government must have be originally bring there by
