impression of a american in france pari _ August _ 9 1834 since we first land in france every step of we journey have remind we that we be in a old country every thing we see speak of the past of a antiquity without limit everywhere we eye rest on the handiwork of those who have be dead for age and we be in the midst of custom which they have bequeath to they descendant the church be so vast so solid so venerable and time-eaten the dwelling so gray and of such antique architecture and in the large town like rouen rise so high and overhung with such quaint projection the narrow and cavernous street the thatched cot be so mossy and so green with grass the very hill about they look scarcely as old for there be youth in they vegetation -- they shrub and flower the countrywoman wear such high cap such long waist and such short petticoat -- the fashion of bonnet be a innovation of yesterday which they regard with scorn we pass female ride on donkey the old testament beast of burden with pannier on each side as be the custom hundred of year since we see ancient dame sit at they door with distaff twist the thread by twirl the spindle between the thumb and finger as they do in the day of homer a flock of sheep be grazing on the side of a hill they be attend by a shepherd and a brace of prick-eared dog which keep they from stray as be do thousand of year ago speckled bird be hop by the side of the road it be the magpie the bird of ancient fable flock of what i at first take for the crow of we country be stalk in the field or sailing in the air over the old elm it be the rook the bird make as classical by addison as he cousin the raven by the latin poet then there be the old chateaus on the hill build with a appearance of military strength they tower and battlements tell of feudal time the grove by which they be surround be for the most part clip into regular wall and pierce with regularly arched passage lead in various direction and the tree compel by the shears to take the shape of obelisk and pyramid or other fantastic figure accord to the taste of the middle age as we draw nearer to pari we see the plant which noah first commit to the earth after the deluge -- you know what that be i hope -- train on low stake and grow thickly and luxuriantly on the slope by the side of the highway here too be the tree which be the subject of the first christian miracle the fig its branch heavy with the burst fruit just begin to ripen for the market but when we enter pari and pass the barrière d'etoile with its lofty triumphal arch when we sweep through the arch of neuilly and come in front of the hotel des invalides where the aged or maimed soldier the living monument of so many battle be walk or sit under the elm of its broad esplanade when we see the colossal statue of statesman and warrior frown from they pedestal on the bridge which bestride the muddy and narrow channel of the seine when we come in sight of the gray pinnacle of the tuillery and the gothic tower of notre-dame and the roman one of st sulpice and the dome of the pantheon under which lie the remains of so many of the great man of france and the dark column of place vendòme work with figure in relief and the obelisk bring from egypt to ornament the place loui quatorze the association with antiquity which the country present from be general become particular and historical they be recollection of power and magnificence and extend empire of valor and skill in war which have hold the world in fear of dynasty that have rise and pass away of battle and victory which have leave no other fruit than they monument the solemnity of these recollection do not seem to press with much weight upon the mind of the people it have be say that the french have become a graver nation than formerly if so what must have be they gayety a hundred year ago to I they seem as light-hearted and as easily amuse as if they have do nothing but make love and quiz they priest since the day of loui xiv -- as if they street have never flow with the blood of frenchman shed by they brethren -- as if they have never win and lose a mighty empire i can not imagine the present generation to be less gay than that which listen to the comedy of molière at they first representation particularly when i perceive that even molière 's piece be too much burden with thought for a frenchman of the present day and that he prefer the lighter and more frivolous vaudeville the parisian have he amusement as regularly as he meal the theater music the dance a walk in the tuillery a refection in the café to which lady resort as commonly as the other sex perpetual business perpetual labor be a thing of which he seem to have no idea i wake in the middle of the night and i hear the fiddle go and the sound of foot keep time in some of the dependency of the large building near the tuillery in which i have my lodgings when a generation of frenchman have play and laugh and dance and drink they fill -- when they have see they allotted number of vaudeville and swallow they destine allowance of weak wine and bottled small-beer they be sweep off to the cemetery of montmartre or of père la chaise or some other of the great burial-place which lie just without the city i go to visit the latter of these the other day you be remind of you approach to it by the row of stone-cutter ' shop on each side of the street with a glitter display of polished marble monument the place of the dead be almost a gayer-looking spot than the ordinary haunt of parisian life it be traverse with shady walk of elm and lime and its inmate lie amidst thicket of ornamental shrub and plantation of the most gaudy flower they monument be hang with wreath of artificial flower or of those natural one which do not lose they color and shape in dry like the amaranth and the ever-lasting part of the cemetery seem like a city in miniature the sepulchral chapel through the window of which you see crucifix and taper stand close to each other beside the path intermingle with statue and bust there be one part of this repository of the dead which be little visit that in which the poor be bury where those who have dwell apart from they more fortunate fellow-creature in life lie apart in death here be no walk no shade of tree no plant shrubbery but ridge of raw earth and tuft of coarse herbage show where the body be throw together under a thin covering of soil i be about to walk over the spot but be repel by the sickening exhalation that rise from it letter ii a journey to florence florence _ sept _ 27 1834 i have now be in this city a fortnight and have establish myself in a suite of apartment lately occupy as the landlord tell I in hope i presume of get a higher rent by a russian prince the arno flow or rather stand still under my window for the water be low and near the western wall of the city be frugally dam up to preserve it for the public bath beyond this stream so renowned in history and poetry be at this season but a feeble rill almost lose among the pebble of its bed and scarcely suffice to give drink to the pheasant and hare of the grand duke 's cascine on its bank opposite my lodgings at the south end of the _ ponte alla carraia _ be a little oratory before the door of which every good catholic who pass take off he hat with a gesture of homage and at this moment a swarthy weasel-faced man with a tin box in he hand be gather contribution to pay for the service of the chapel rattle he coin to attract the attention of the pedestrian and call out to those who seem disposed to pass without pay to the north and west the peak of the appenine be in full sight rise over the spire of the city and the grove of the cascine every evening i see they through the soft delicately-colored haze of a italian sunset look as if they have catch something of the transparency of the sky and appear like mountain of fairy-land instead of the bleak and barren ridge of rock which they really be the weather since my arrival in tuscany have be continually serene the sky wholly cloudless and the temperature uniform -- oppressively warm in the street at noon delightful at morning and evening with a long beautiful golden twilight occasion by the reflection of light from the orange-colored haze which invest the atmosphere every night i be remind that i be in the land of song for until two o'clock in the morning i hear all manner of tune chant by people in the street in all manner of voice i believe i have give you no account of we journey from pari to this place that part of it which lay between paris and chalon on the saone may be describe in a very few word monotonous plain cover with vineyard and wheat-field with very few tree and those spoil by be lop for fuel -- sunburnt woman drive cart or at work in the field -- gloomy cheerless-looking town with narrow filthy street -- troops of beggar surround you carriage whenever you stop or whenever the nature of the road oblige the horse to walk and chant they request in the most doleful whine imaginable -- such be the sight and sound that meet you for the greater part of two hundred and fifty mile there be however some exception as to the aspect of the country autun one of the most ancient town of france and yet retain some remains of roman architecture lie in a beautiful and picturesque region a little beyond that town we ascend a hill by a road wind along a glen the rocky side of which be clothe with a unpruned wood and a clear stream run dash over the stone now on one side of the road and then on the other -- the first instance of a brook leave to follow its natural channel which i have see in france two young frenchman who be we fellow-passenger be wild with delight at this glimpse of unspoiled nature they follow the meanderings of the stream leap from rock to rock and shout till the wood ring again of chalon i have nothing to tell you abelard die there and he tomb be erect with that of eloise in the church of st marcel but the church be destroy and the monument have be transport to the cemetery of père la chaise and with it all the poetry of the place be vanish but if you would make yourself supremely uncomfortable travel as i do in a steamboat down the saone from chalon to lyon on a rainy day crowd into a narrow dirty cabin with bench on each side and a long table in the middle at which a set of frenchman with they hat on be play card and eat _ déjeuners à la fourchette _ all day long and deafen you with they noise while waiter be run against you leg and tread on you toe every moment and the water be drop on you head through the crack of the deck-floor you would be force to admit the superlative misery of such a mode of travel the approach to lyon however make some amends for these inconvenience the shore of the river hitherto low and level begin to rise into hill break with precipice and crown by castle some in ruin and other entire and seemingly a part of the very rock on which they stand so old and mossy and strong do they seem what strike I most in lyon be the superiority of its people in look and feature to the inhabitant of paris -- the clatter and jar of silk-loom with which its street resound -- and the picturesque beauty of its situation place as it be among steep and rock with the quiet saone on one side and the swiftly-running rhone on the other in we journey from lyon to marseille we travel by land instead of take the steamboat as be commonly do as far as avignon the common book of travels will tell you how numerous be the ruin of feudal time perch upon the height all along the rhone remnant of fortress and castle overlook a vast extent of country and once serve as place of refuge to the cultivator of the soil who dwell in they vicinity -- how frequently also be to be meet with the earlier yet scarcely less fresh trace of roman colonization and dominion in gateway triumphal arch wall and monument -- how on enter provence you find yourself among a people of a different physiognomy from those of the northern province speak a language which rather resemble italian than french -- how the beauty of the woman of avignon still do credit to the taste of the clergy who make that city for more than half a century the seat of the papal power -- and how as you approach the shore of the mediterranean the mountain which rise from the fruitful valley shoot up in wilder form until they summit become mere pinnacle of rock wholly bare of vegetation marseille be seat in the midst of a semicircle of mountain of whitish rock the steep and naked side of which scarce afford a footing for the goat stretch into the mediterranean they inclose a commodious harbor in front of which be two or three rocky island anchor in a sea of more vivid blue than any water i have ever before see the country immediately surround the city be a arid and dusty valley intersect here and there with the bed of a brook or torrent dry during the summer it be carefully cultivate however and plant with vineyard and orchard of olive fig and pomegranate tree the tree be small and low the foliage of the olive thin and pale the leaf of the fig broad and few and the soil appear everywhere at they root as well as between the row of vine the vegetation when view from a little distance have a meager and ragged appearance the whiteness of the hill which the eye can hardly bear to rest upon at noon the intense blue of the sea the peculiar form of the foliage and the deficiency of shade and verdure make I almost fancy myself in a tropical region the greek judge well of the commercial advantage of marseille when they make it the seat of one of they early colony i find its street animated with a bustle which i have not see since i leave new york and its port throng with vessel from all the nation whose coast border upon the great midland sea of europe marseille be the most flourishing seaport in france it have already become to the mediterranean what new york be to the united state and its trade be regularly increase the old town be ugly but the lower or new part be nobly build of the light-colored stone so commonly use in france and so easily work -- with broad street and what be rare in french town convenient sidewalk new street be lay out garden be convert into building-lot the process of level hill and fill up hollow be go on as in new york the city be extend itself on every side and large fortune have be make by the rise in the value of land property in a conversation with a intelligent gentleman resident at marseille and largely engage in commercial and moneyed transaction the subject of the united state bank be mention opinion in france on this question of we domestic politics differ accord as the opportunity of information possess by the individual be more or less ample or as he be more or less in favor of chartered bank the gentleman remark that without any reference to the question of the united state bank he hope the day would never come when such a institution would be establish in france the project he say have some advocate but they have not yet succeed and he hope never would succeed in the introduction of that system of paper currency which prevail in the united state he deprecate the dangerous and uncertain facility of obtain credit which be the fruit of that system which produce the most ruinous fluctuation in commerce encourage speculation and extravagance of all kind and involve the prudent and laborious in the ruin which fall upon the rash and reckless he declare himself satisfied with the state of the currency of france with which if fortune be not suddenly build up they be not suddenly overthrow and period of apparent prosperity be not follow by season of real distress i make the journey from marseille to florence by land how grand and wild be the mountain that overlook the mediterranean how intense be the heat as we wind we way along the gallery of rock cut to form a road how excellent be the fruit and how thick the mosquito at nice how sumptuous be the palace how narrow and dark the street and how pallid the dame of genoa and how beautiful we find we path among the tree overrun with vine as we approach southern italy be matter which i will take some other opportunity of relate on the 12th of September we _ vetturino _ set we down safe at the _ hotel de l'europe _ in florence i think i shall return to america even a better patriot than when i leave it a citizen of the united state travel on the continent of europe find the contrast between a government of power and a government of opinion force upon he at every step he find himself delay at every large town and at every frontier of a kingdom or principality to submit to a strict examination of the passport with which the jealousy of the ruler of these country have compel he to furnish himself he see everywhere guard and sentinel arm to the tooth station in the midst of a population engage in they ordinary occupation in a time of profound peace and to supply the place of the young and robust thus withdraw from the labor of agriculture he behold woman perform the work of the field he see the many retain in a state of hopeless dependence and poverty the effect of institution forge by the ruling class to accumulate wealth in they own hand the want of self-respect in the inferior class engender by this state of thing show itself in the act of rapacity and fraud which the traveller meet with throughout france and italy and worse still in the shameless corruption of the italian custom-house the officer of which regularly solicit a paltry bribe from every passenger as the consideration of leave he baggage unexamined i be tell that in this place the custom of give present extend even to the court of justice the officer of which from the highest to the lowest be in the constant practice of receive they no american can see how much jealousy and force on the one hand and necessity and fear on the other have to do with keep up the exist government of europe without thank heaven that such be not the condition of he own country letter iii tuscan scenery and climate florence _ October _ 11 1834 the bridge over the arno immediately under my window be the spot from which cole 's fine landscape which you perhaps remember see in the exhibition of we academy be take it give you may recollect a view of the arno travel off towards the west its bank overhang with tree the mountain-ridge rise in the distance and above they the sky flush with the color of sunset the same rich hue i behold every evening in the quarter where they be see by the artist when he make they permanent on he canvas there be a great deal of prattle about italian sky : the sky and cloud of italy so far as i have have a opportunity of judge do not present so great a variety of beautiful appearance as we own but the italian atmosphere be far more uniformly fine than ours not to speak of its astonishing clearness it be pervade by a certain warmth of color which enrich every object this be more remarkable about the time of sunset when the mountain put on a aerial aspect as if they belong to another and fairer world and a little after the sun have go down the air be flush with a glory which seem to transfigure all that it inclose many of the fine old palace of florence you know be build in a gloomy though grand style of architecture of a dark-colored stone massive and lofty and overlook narrow street that lie in almost perpetual shade but at the hour of which i be speak the bright warm radiance reflect from the sky to the earth fill the darkest lane stream into the most shadowy nook and make the prison-like structure glitter as with a brightness of they own it be now nearly the middle of October and we have have no frost the strong summer heat which prevail when i come hither have by the slowest gradation subside into a agreeable autumnal temperature the tree keep they verdure but i perceive they foliage grow thinner and when i walk in the cascine on the other side of the arno the rustling of the lizard as they run among the heap of crisp leaf remind I that the autumn be wear away though the ivy which clothes the old elm have put forth a profuse array of blossom and the walk murmur with bee like we orchard in spring as i look along the declivity of the appenine i see the raw earth every day more visible between the rank of olive-tree and the well-pruned maple which support the vine if i have find my expectation of italian scenery in some respects below the reality in other respects they have be disappoint the form of the mountain be wonderfully picturesque and they effect be heighten by the rich atmosphere through which they be see and by the building impose from they architecture or venerable from time which crown the eminence but if the hand of man have do something to embellish this region it have do more to deform it not a tree be suffer to retain its natural shape not a brook to flow in its natural channel a exterminate war be carry on against the natural herbage of the soil the country be without wood and green field and to he who view the vale of the arno from the top of fiesole or any of the neighbor height grand as he will allow the circle of the mountain to be and magnificent the edifice with which the region be adorn it appear at any time after midsummer a huge valley of dust plant with low row of the pallid and thin-leaved olive or the more dwarfish maple on which the vine be train the simplicity of nature so far as can be do be destroy there be no fine sweep of forest no broad expanse of meadow or pasture ground no ancient and towering tree cluster about the villa no row of natural shrubbery follow the course of the brook and river the stream which be often but the bed of torrent dry during the summer be confine in straight channel by stone wall and embankment the slope be break up and disfigure by terrace and the tree be keep down by constant pruning and lop until half way up the side of the appenine where the limit of cultivation be reach and thence to the summit be a barren steep of rock without herbage or soil the grander feature of the landscape however be fortunately beyond the power of man to injure the lofty mountain-summits bare precipice cleft with chasm and pinnacle of rock pierce the sky betoken far more than any thing i have see elsewhere a break up of the crust of the globe in some early period of its existence i be tell that in may and June the country be much more beautiful than at present and that owe to a drought it now appear under a particular disadvantage the academy of the fine art have have its exhibition since i arrive in its room which be gratuitously open to the public i find a large crowd of gazer at the picture and statue many have come to look at some work order by a acquaintance other make the place a morning lounge in the collection be some landscape by morghen the son of the celebrated engraver very fresh and clear a few piece send by bezzolus one of the most eminent italian painter of he time a statue of galileo not without merit by costolus for there be always a galileo or two i believe at every exhibition of the kind in florence portrait good bad and indifferent in great abundance and many square foot of canvas spoil by attempt at historical painting let I remark by the way that a work of art be a sacred thing in the eye of italian of all class never to be deface never to be touch a thing to be look at merely a statue may stand for age in a public square within the reach of any one who pass and with no sentinel to guard it and yet it shall not only be safe from mutilation but the surface of the marble shall never be scratch or even irreverently score with a lead pencil so general be this reverence for art that the most perfect confidence be repose in it i remember that in pari as i be look at a colossal plaster cast of napoleon at the hotel des invalides a fellow arm with a musket who stand by it bolt upright in the stiff attitude to which the soldier be drill gruffly remind I that i be too near though i be not within four foot of it in florence it be take for grant that you will do no mischief and therefore you be not watch letter iv a day in florence pisa _ December _ 11 1834 it be gratify to be able to communicate a piece of political intelligence from so quiet a nook of the world as this don miguel arrive here the other day from genoa where you know there be a story that he and the duchess of berrus a hopeful couple be lay they head together he go to pay he respects to the grand duke of tuscany who be now at pisa and it be say by the gossip of the place that he be coldly receive and be give to understand that he could not be allow to remain in the tuscan territory there be probably nothing in all this don miguel have now depart for rome and the talk of to-day be that he will return before the end of the winter he be doubtless wander about to observe in what manner he be receive at the petty court which be influence by the austrian policy and in the mean time lie in wait for some favorable opportunity of renew he pretension to the crown of spain pisa offer a greater contrast to florence than i have imagine could exist between two italian city this be the very seat of idleness and slumber while florence from be the residence of the court and from the vast number of foreigner who throng to it present during several month of the year a appearance of great bustle and animation four thousand english a american friend tell I visit florence every winter to say nothing of the occasional resident from france germany and russium the number of visitor from the latter country be every year increase and the echo of the florence gallery have be teach to repeat the strange accent of the sclavonic let I give you the history of a fine

saunter stiffly along the arno or take they way to the public gallery and museum they massive clean and brightly-polished carriage also begin to rattle through the street set out on excursion to some part of the environs of florence -- to fiesole to the pratolino to the bello sguardo to the poggio imperiale sight of a different kind now present themselves sometimes it be a troop of stout

torch the gleam of they eye through they mask and they sable garb give they a kind of supernatural appearance i return to bed and fall asleep amidst the shout of people return from the opera singing as they go snatch of the music with which they have be entertain during the evening such be a picture of what pass every day at florence -- in pisa on the contrary all be stagnation and repose -- even the presence of the sovereign who usually pass a part of the winter here be incompetent to give a momentary liveliness to the place the city be nearly as large as florence with not a third of its population the number of stranger be few most of they be invalid and the rest be the quietest people in the world the rattle of carriage be rarely hear in the street in some of which there prevail a stillness so complete that you might imagine they desert of they inhabitant i have now be here three week and on one occasion only have i see the people of the place awaken to something like animation

the italian court florence _ may _ 12 1835 night before last a man-child be bear to the grand duke of tuscany and yesterday be a day of great rejoicing in consequence the five hundred bell of florence keep up a horrid ringing through the day and in the evening the public edifice and many private house be illuminate to-day and to-morrow the rejoicing continue and in the mean time the gallery and museum be close lest idle people should amuse themselves rationally the tuscan be please with the birth of a heir to the dukedom first because the succession be likely to be keep in a good sort of a family and secondly because for want of male child it would have revert to the house of austrium and the province would have be govern by a foreigner i be glad of it also for the sake of the poor tuscan who be a mild people and if they must be under a despotism deserve to live under a good-natured one a austrian prince if he be to govern tuscany as the emperor govern the lombardo-venetian territory would introduce a more just and efficient system of administer the law between man and man but at the same time a more barbarous severity to political offender i see at volterra last spring four person who be condemn at florence for a alleged conspiracy against the state they be walk with instrument of music in they hand on the top of the fortress which command a extensive view of mountain vale and sea include the lower val d'arno and reach to leghorn and even to corsica they be well-dressed and i be assure they personal comfort be attend to a different treatment be the fate of the state prisoner who languish in the dungeon of austrium in tuscany no man 's life be take for any offense whatever and banishment be a common sentence against those who be deem dangerous or intractable subject in all the other province a harsher system prevail in sardinia capital execution for political cause be frequent and long and mysterious detention be resort to as in lombardy with a view to strike terror into the mind of a discontented people the royal family of naple kill people by way of amusement prince charle a brother of the king sometime in the month of April last find a old man cut myrtle twig on some of the royal hunting-grounds of which he have the superintendence he direct he attendant to seize the offender and tie he to a tree and when they have do this order they to shoot he this they refuse upon which he take a loaded musket from the hand of one of they and with the greatest deliberation shoot he dead upon the spot he royal highness soon after set out for rome to amuse himself with the ceremony of the holy week and to figure at the ball give by torlonium and other roman noble where he signalize himself by he attention to the english lady of the truth of the story i have relate i have be assure by several respectable person in naple about the middle of may i be at the spot where the murder be say to have be commit it be on the border of the lake of agnano we reach it by a hollow wind road cut deep through the hill and rock thousand of year ago it be a pretty and solitary spot a neat pavilion of the royal family stand on the shore and the air be fragrant with the blossom of the white clover and the innumerable flower which the soil of italy for a short season before the summer heat and drought pour forth so profusely the lake be evidently the crater of a old volcano : it lie in a perfect bowl of hill and the perpetual escape of gas bubble up through the water show that the process of chemical decomposition in the earth below have not yet cease close by in the side of the circular hill that surround the lake stand the famous _ grotto del cane _ close with a door to enable the keeper to get a little money from the foreigner who come to visit it you may be sure i be careful not to trim any of the myrtle with my penknife but to return to tuscany -- it be after all little better than a austrian province like the other country of italy the grand duke be a near relative of the emperor he have the rank of colonel in the austrian service and a treaty of offense and defense oblige he to take part in the war of austrium to the extent of furnish ten thousand soldier it be well understand that he be watch by the agent of the austrian government here who form a sort of high police to which he and he cabinet be subject and that he would not venture upon any measure of national policy nor even displace or appoint a minister without the consent of metternich the birth of a son to the grand duke have be signalize i have just learn by a display of princely munificence five thousand crown have be present to the archbishop who perform the ceremony of christen the child the servant of the ducal household have receive two month ' wages in addition to they usual salary five hundred young woman have receive marriage portion of thirty crown each all the article of property at the great pawnbroking establishment manage by goverment pledge for a less sum than four livre have be restore to the owner without payment and finally all person confine for larceny and other offence of a less degree than homicide and other enormous crime have be liberate and turn loose upon society again the grand duke can well afford to be generous for from a million and three hundred thousand people he draw by taxation four million of crown annually of which a million only be compute to be expend in the military and civil expense of he government the remainder be of course apply to keep up the state of a prince and to the enrich of he family he pass you know for one of the richest potentate in europe letter vi venice -- the tyrol munich _ August _ 6 1835 since my last letter i have visit venice a city which realize the old mythological fable of beauty bear of the sea i must confess however that my first feeling on enter it be that of disappointment as we pass in we gondola out of the lagoon up one of the numerous canal which permeate the city in every direction in such a manner that it seem as if you could only pass you time either within door or in a boat the place appear to I a vast assemblage of prison surround with they moat and i think how weary i should soon grow of my island prison and how glad to escape again to the main-land but this feeling quickly give way to delight and admiration when i land and survey the clean though narrow street never incommode by dust nor disturbed by the noise and jostle of carriage and horse by which you may pass to every part of the city -- when i look again at the row of superb building with they marble step ascend out of the water of the canal in which the gondola be shooting by each other -- when i stand in the immense square of st mark surround by palace rest on arcade under which the shop rival in splendor those of pari and crowd of the gay inhabitant of both sex assemble towards evening and sit in group before the door of the coffee-house -- and when i gaze on the barbaric magnificence of the church of st mark and the doge 's palace surround by the old emblem of the power of venice and overlook the adriatic once the empire of the republic the architecture of venice have to my eye something watery and oceanic in its aspect under the hand of palladio the grecian order seem to borrow the lightness and airiness of the gothic as you look at the numerous window and the multitude of column which give a striated appearance to the front of the palace you think of stalactite and icicle such as you might imagine to ornament the abode of the water-god and sea-nymph the only thing need to complete the poetic illusion be transparency or brilliancy of color and this be wholly want for at venice the whitest marble be soon clouded and blacken by the corrosion of the sea-air it be not my intention however to do so hackneyed a thing as to give a description of venice one thing i must confess seem to I extraordinary : how this city deprive as it be of the commerce which build it up from the shallows of the adriatic and uphold it so long and so proudly should not have decay even more rapidly than it have do trieste have draw from it almost all its trade and flourish by its decline i walk through the arsenal of venice which comprehend the navy yard a enormous structure with range of broad lofty roof support by massive portion of wall and spacious dock-yard the whole large enough to build and fit out a navy for the british empire the pleasure-boat of napoleon and he empress and that of the present viceroy be there : but the ship of war belong to the republic have moulder away with the bucentaur i see however two austrian vessel the same which have convey the polish exile to new york lie under shelter in the dock as if place there to show who be the present master of the place it be melancholy to wander through the vast unoccupied space of this noble edifice and to think what must have be the riches the power the prosperity and the hope of venice at the time it be build and what they be at the present moment it seem almost impossible that any thing should take place to arrest the ruin which be gradually consume this renowned city some writer have assert that the lagoon around it be annually grow shallower by the deposition of earth bring down by stream from the land that they must finally become marsh and that they consequent insalubrity will drive the inhabitant from venice i do not know how this may be but the other cause i have mention seem likely to produce nearly the same effect i remember as these idea pass through my mind a passage in which one of the sacred poet foretell the desertion and desolation of tyre the city that make itself glorious in the midst of the sea thy riches and thy fair thy merchandise thy mariner and thy pilot thy calker and the occupier of thy merchandise and all thy man of war that be in thee shall fall into the midst of the sea in the day of thy ruin i leave this most pleasing of the italian city which i have see on the 24th of June and take the road for the tyrol we pass through a level fertile country formerly the territory of venice water by the piave which run blood in one of bonaparte 's battle at evening we arrive at ceneda where we italian poet da ponte be bear situate just at the base of the alp the rocky peak and irregular spire of which beautifully green with the showery season rise in the background ceneda seem to have something of german cleanliness about it and the floor of a very comfortable inn at which we stop be of wood the first we have see in italy though common throughout the tyrol and the rest of germany a troop of barelegged boy just break loose from school whooping and swing they book and slate in the air pass under my window such a sight you will not see in southern italy the education of the people be neglect except in those province which be under the government of austrium it be a government severe and despotic enough in all conscience but by provide the means of education for all class it be do more than it be aware of to prepare they for the enjoyment of free institution in the lombardo-venetian kingdom as it be call there be few child who do not attend the public school on leave ceneda we enter a pass in the mountain the gorge of which be occupy by the ancient town of serravalle rest on arcade the architecture of which denote that it be build during the middle age near it i remark a old castle which formerly command the pass one of the finest ruin of the kind i have ever see it have a considerable extent of battlemented wall in perfect preservation and both that and its circular tower be so luxuriantly load with ivy that they seem almost to have be cut out of the living verdure as we proceed we become aware how worthy this region be to be the birthplace of a poet a rapid stream a branch of the piave tinge of a light and somewhat turbid blue by the soil of the mountain come tumble and roar down the narrow valley perpendicular precipice rise on each side and beyond the gigantic brotherhood of the alp in two long file of steep pointed summit divide by deep ravine stretch away in the sunshine to the northeast in the face of one the precipice by the way-side a marble slab be fix inform the traveller that the road be open by the late emperor of germany in the year 1830 we follow this romantic valley for a considerable distance pass several little blue lake lie in they granite basin one of which be call the _ lago morto _ or dead lake from have no outlet for its water at length we begin to ascend by a wind road the steep side of the alp -- the prospect enlarge as we go the mountain summit rise to sight around we one behind another some of they white with snow over which the wind blow with a wintery keenness -- deep valley open below we and gulf yawn between rock over which old bridge be throw -- and solemn fir forest clothing the broad declivity the farm-house place on these height instead of be of brick or stone as in the plain and valley below be principally build of wood the second story which serve for a barn be encircle by a long gallery and cover with a project roof of plank hold down with large stone we stop at vena a wretched place with a wretched inn the hostess of which show we a chin swollen with the _ goitre _ and usher we into dirty comfortless room where we pass the night when we awake the rain be beat against the window and on look out the forest and side of the neighbor mountain at a little height above we appear hoary with snow we set out in the rain but have not proceed far before we hear the sleet striking against the window of the carriage and soon come to where the snow cover the ground to the depth of one or two inch continue to ascend we pass out of italy and enter the tyrol the storm have cease before we go through the first tyrolese village and we could not help be strike with the change in the appearance of the inhabitant -- the different costume the less erect figure the awkward gait the lighter complexion the neatly-kept habitation and the absence of beggar as we advance the cloud begin to roll off from the landscape disclose here and there through opening in they broad skirt as they sweep along glimpse of the profound valley below we and of the white side and summit of mountain in the mid-sky above at length the sun appear and reveal a prospect of such wildness grandeur and splendor as i have never before see lofty peak of the most fantastic shape with deep cleft between sharp needle of rock and overhang crag infinite in multitude shoot up everywhere around we glisten in the new-fallen snow with thin wreath of mist creep along they side at interval swollen torrent look at a distance like long train of foam come thunder down the mountain and cross the road plunge into the verdant valley which wind beneath beside the highway be field of young grain press to the ground with the snow and in the meadow ranunculus of the size of rose large yellow violet and a thousand other alpine flower of the most brilliant hue be peep through they white cover we stop to breakfast at a place call landro a solitary inn in the midst of this grand scenery with a little chapel beside it the water from the dissolve snow be drop merrily from the roof in a bright June sun we need not to be tell that we be in germany for we see it plainly enough in the nicely-washed floor of the apartment into which we be show in the neat cupboard with the old prayer-book lie upon it and in the general appearance of housewifery a quality unknown in italy to say nothing of the evidence we have in the beer and tobacco-smoke of the traveller ' room and the guttural dialect and quiet tone of the guest from landro we descend gradually into the beautiful valley of the tyrol leave the snow behind though the white peak of the mountain be continually in sight at bruneck in a inn resplendent with neatness -- so at least it seem to we eye accustom to the negligence and dirt of italian housekeeping -- we have the first specimen of a german bed it be narrow and short and make so high at the head by a number of huge square bolster and pillow that you rather sit than lie the principal cover be a bag of down very properly denominate the upper bed and between this and the feather-bed below the traveller be expect to pass the night a asthmatic patient on a cold winter night might perhaps find such a couch tolerably comfortable if he could prevent the narrow cover from slip off on one side or the other the next day we be afford a opportunity of observe more closely the inhabitant of this singular region by a festival or holiday of some sort which bring they into the road in great number array in they best dress -- the man in short jacket and small-clothes with broad gay-colored suspenders over they waistcoat and leathern belt ornament with gold or silver leaf -- the woman in short petticoat compose of horizontal band of different color -- and both sex for the most part wear broad-brimmed hat with hemispherical crown though there be a sugar-loaf variety much affect by the man adorn with a band of lace and sometimes a knot of flower they be a robust healthy-looking race though they have a awkward stoop in the shoulder but what strike I most forcibly be the devotional habit of the people the tyrolese might be cite as a illustration of the remark that mountaineer be more habitually and profoundly religious than other person of all sex young and old whom we meet in the road be repeat they prayer audibly we pass a troop of old woman all in broad-brimmed hat and short gray petticoat carry long stave one of whom hold a bead-roll and give out the prayer to which the other make the response in chorus they look at we so solemnly from under they broad brim and march along with so grave and deliberate a pace that i could hardly help fancy that the wicked austrian have catch a dozen elder of the respectable society of friend and put they in petticoat to punish they for they heresy we afterward see person go to the labor of the day or return tell they rosary and say they prayer as they go as if they devotions have be they favorite amusement at regular interval of about half a mile we see wooden crucifix erect by the way-side cover from the weather with little shed bear the image of the savior crown with thorn and frightfully dash with streak and drop of red paint to represent the blood that flow from he wound the outer wall of the better kind of house be ornament with painting in fresco and the subject of these be mostly sacred such as the virgin and child the crucifixion and the ascension the number of house of worship be surprising i do not mean spacious or stately church such as we meet with in italy but most commonly little chapel disperse so as best to accommodate the population of these the smallest neighborhood have one for the morning devotions of its inhabitant and even the solitary inn have its little consecrated building with its miniature spire for the convenience of pious wayfarer at sterz a little village beautifully situate at the base of the mountain call the brenner and contain as i should judge not more than two or three thousand inhabitant we count seven church and chapel within the compass of a square mile the observance of the roman catholic church be nowhere more rigidly comply with than in the tyrol when we stop at bruneck on Friday evening i happen to drop a word about a little meat for dinner in a conversation with the spruce-looking landlady who appear so shocked that i give up the point on the promise of some excellent and remarkably well-flavored trout from the stream that flow through the village -- a promise that be literally fulfil at the post-house on the brenner where we stop on Saturday evening we be absolutely refuse any thing but soup-maigre and fish the postmaster tell we that the priest have positively forbid meat to be give to traveller think of that -- that we who have eat wild-boar and pheasant on good Friday at rome under the very nostril of the pope himself and he whole conclave of cardinal should be refuse a morsel of flesh on a ordinary Saturday at a tavern on a lonely mountain in the tyrol by the order of a parish priest before get we soup-maigre we witness another example of tyrolese devotion eight or ten traveller apparently labor man take possession of the entrance hall of the inn and kneel pour forth they orison in the german language for half a hour with no small appearance of fervency in the morning when we be ready to set out we inquire for we coachman a italian and find that he too although not remarkably religious have catch something of the spirit of the place and be at the _ gotteshaus _ as the waiter call the tavern chapel offer he morning prayer we descend the brenner on the 28th of June in a snow-storm the wind whirling the light flake in the air as it do with we in winter it change to rain however as we approach the beautiful and picturesque valley water by the river inn on the bank of wrhich stand the fine old town of innsbruck the capital of the tyrol here we visit the church of the holy cross in which be the bronze tomb of maximilian i and twenty or thirty bronze statue range on each side of the nave represent fierce warrior chief and gown prelate and stately damsel of the middle age these be all curious for the costume the warrior be case in various kind of ancient armor and brandish various ancient weapon and the robe of the female be flow and by no means ungraceful almost every one of the statue have its hand and finger in some constrain and awkward position as if the artist know as little what to do with they as some awkward and bashful people know what to do with they own such a crowd of figure in that ancient garb occupy the floor in the midst of the living worshiper of the present day have a effect which at first be startling from innsbruck we climb and cross another mountain-ridge scarcely less wild and majestic in its scenery than those we have leave behind on descend we observe that the crucifix have disappear from the road and the broad-brimmed and sugar-loaf hat from the head of the peasantry the man wear hat contract in the middle of the crown like a hour-glass and the woman cap edge with a broad band of black fur the fresco on the outside of the house become less frequent in short it be apparent that we have enter a different region even if the custom-house and police officer on the frontier have not signify to we that we be now in the kingdom of bavarium we pass through extensive forest of fir here and there checker with farm and finally come to the broad elevated plain bath by the isar in which munich be situate letter vii a excursion to rock river princeton illinoi _ June _ 21 1841 i have just return from a excursion to rock river one of the most beautiful of we western stream we leave princeton on the 17th of the month and after pass a belt of forest which conceal one of the branch of the bureau river find ourselves upon the wide unfenced prairie spread away on every side until it meet the horizon flock of turtle-dove rise from we path scare at we approach quail and rabbit be see run before we the prairie-squirrel a little striped animal of the marmot kind cross the road we start plover by the dozen and now and then a prairie-hen which fly off heavily into the grassy wilderness with these animal the open country be populous but they have they pursuer and destroyer not the settler of the region for they do not shoot often except at a deer or a wild turkey or a noxious animal but the prairie-hawk the bald-eagle the mink and the prairie-wolf which make merciless havoc among they and they brood about fifteen mile we come to dad joe 's grove in the shadow of which thirteen year ago a settler name joe smith who have fight in the battle of the thame one of the first white inhabitant of this region seat himself and plant he corn and gather he crop quietly through the whole indian war without be molest by the savage though he be careful to lead he wife and family to a place of security as smith be a settler of such long standing he be look to as a kind of patriarch in the county and to distinguish he from other joe smith he receive the venerable appellation of dad he have since remove to another part of the state but he well-known hospitable cabin inhabit by another inmate be still there and he grove of tall tree stand on a ridge amidst the immense savannah yet retain he name as we descend into the prairie we be strike with the novelty and beauty of the prospect which lay before we the ground sink gradually and gently into a low but immense basin in the midst of which lie the marshy tract call the winnebago swamp to the northeast the sight be intercept by a forest in the midst of the basin but to the northwest the prairie be see swell up again in the smoothest slope to they usual height and stretch away to a distance so vast that it seem boldness in the eye to follow they the winnebago and other indian tribe which formerly possess this country have leave few memorial of they existence except the name of place now and then as at indiantown near princeton you be show the hole in the ground where they store they maize and sometimes on the border of the river you see the trunk of tree which they fell evidently hack by they tomahawk but perhaps the most remarkable of they remains be the path across the prairie or beside the large stream call indian trail -- narrow and well-beaten way sometimes a foot in depth and many of they doubtless trodden for hundred of year as we go down the ridge upon which stand dad joe 's grove we see many boulder of rock lie on the surface of the soil of the prairie the western people naturally puzzle to tell how they come there give they the expressive name of lose rock we enter a forest of scatter oak and after travel for half a hour reach the winnebago swamp a tract cover with tall and luxuriant water-grass which we cross on a causey build by a settler who keep a toll-gate and at the end of the causey we ford a small stream call winnebago inlet cross another vast prairie we reach the neighborhood of dixon the approach to which be denote by grove farm-house herd of cattle and inclosed corn field checker the broad green prairie dixon name after a ancient settler of the place still live be a country town situate on a high bank of rock river five year ago two log-cabin only stand on the solitary shore and now it be a considerable village with many neat dwelling a commodious court-house several place of worship for the good people and a jail for the rogue build with a triple wall of massive log but i be glad to see that it have no inmate rock river flow through high prairie and not like most stream of the west through a alluvial country the current be rapid and the pellucid water glide over a bottom of sand and pebble its admirer declare that its shore unite the beauty of the hudson and of the connecticut the bank on either side be high and bold sometimes they be perpendicular precipice the base of which stand in the run water sometimes they be steep grassy or rocky bluff with a space of dry alluvial land between they and the stream sometimes they rise by a gradual and easy ascent to the general level of the region and sometimes this ascent be interrupt by a broad natural terrace majestic tree grow solitary or in clump on the grassy acclivity or scatter in natural park along the lower land upon the river or in thick grove along the edge of the high country back of the bluff extend a fine agricultural region rich prairie with a undulating surface intersperse with grove at the foot of the bluff break forth copious spring of clear water which hasten in little brook to the river in a drive which i take up the leave bank of the river i see three of these in the space of as many mile one of these be the spring which supply the town of dixon with water the next be a beautiful fountain rush out from the rock in the midst of a clump of tree as merrily and in as great a hurry as a boy let out of school the third be so remarkable as to have receive a name it be a little rivulet issue from a cavern six or seven foot high and about twenty from the entrance to the further end at the foot of a perpendicular precipice cover with forest-tree and fringed with bush in the neighborhood of dixon a class of emigrant have establish themselves more opulent and more luxurious in they taste than most of the settler of the western country some of these have build elegant mansion on the left bank of the river amidst the noble tree which seem to have grow up for that very purpose indeed when i look at they i could hardly persuade myself that they have not be plant to overshadow older habitation from the door of one of these dwelling i survey a prospect of exceed beauty the winding of the river allow we a sight of its water and its beautifully diversified bank to a great distance each way and in one direction a high prairie region be see above the wood that fringe the course of this river of a lighter green than they and touch with the golden light of the setting sun i be tell that the character of rock river be throughout its course much as i have describe it in the neighborhood of dixon that its bank be high and free from marsh and its water rapid and clear from its source in wisconsin to where it enter the mississippus amidst rocky island what should make its shore unhealthy i can not see yet they who inhabit they be much subject to intermittent fever they tell you very quietly that every body who come to live there must take a seasoning i suppose that when this country become settle this will no longer be the case rock river be not much subject to inundation nor do its water become very low in summer a project be on foot i be tell to navigate it with steam-vessel of a light draught when i arrive at dixon i be tell that the day before a man name bridge living at washington grove in ogle county come into town and complain that he have receive notice from a certain association that he must leave the county before the seventeenth of the month or that he would be look upon as a proper subject for lynch law he ask for assistance to defend he person and dwelling against the lawless violence of these man the people of dixon county come together and pass a resolution to the effect that they approve fully of what the inhabitant of ogle county have do and that they allow mr bridge the term of four hour to depart from the town of dixon he go away immediately and in great trepidation this bridge be a notorious confederate and harborer of horse-thief and counterfeiter the thinly-settled portion of illinoi be much expose to the depredation of horse-thief who have a kind of center of operation in ogle county where it be say that they have a justice of the peace and a constable among they own associate and where they contrive to secure a friend on the jury whenever any one of they number be try trial after trial have take place and it have be find impossible to obtain a conviction on the clearest evidence until last April when two horse-thief be on trial eleven of the jury threaten the twelfth with a taste of the cowskin unless he would bring in a verdict of guilty he do so and the man be condemn before they be remove to the state-prison the court-house be burn down and the jail be in flame but luckily they be extinguish without the liberation of the prisoner such at length become the general feeling of insecurity that three hundred citizen of ogle county as i understand have form themselves into a company of volunteer for the purpose of clear the county of these man two horse-thief have be seize and flog and bridge they patron have be order to remove or abide the consequence as we be return from dixon on the morning of the 19th we hear a kind of hum noise in the grass which one of the company say proceed from a rattlesnake we dismount and find in fact it be make by a prairie-rattlesnake which lay coil around a tuft of herbage and which we soon dispatch the indian call this small variety of the rattlesnake the massasauger horse be frequently bite by it and come to the door of they owner with they head horribly swell but they be recover by the application of hartshorn a little further on one of the party raise the cry of wolf and look we see a prairie-wolf in the path before we a prick-eared animal of a reddish-gray color standing and gaze at we with great composure as we approach he trot off into the grass with he nose near the ground not deign to hasten he pace for we shout and shortly afterward we see two other run in a different direction the prairie-wolf be not so formidable a animal as the name of wolf would seem to denote he be quite as great a coward as robber but he be exceedingly mischievous he never take full-grown sheep unless he go with a strong troop of he friend but seize young lamb carry off sucking-pig rob the henroost devour sweet corn in the garden and plunder the water-melon patch a herd of prairie-wolf will enter a field of melon and quarrel about the division of the spoil as fiercely and noisily as so many politician it be they way to gnaw a hole immediately into the first melon they lay hold of if it happen to be ripe the inside be devour at once if not it be drop and another be seek out and a quarrel be pick with the discoverer of a ripe one and loud and shrill be the bark and fierce the growl and snap which be hear on these occasion it be surprising i be tell with what dexterity a wolf will make the most of a melon absorb every remnant of the pulp and hollow it out as clean as it could be scrape by a spoon this be when the allowance of melon be scarce but when they be abundant he be as careless and wasteful as a government agent enough of natural history i will finish my letter another day _ June 26th _ let I caution all emigrant to illinois not to handle too familiarly the wild parsnip as it be commonly call a umbelliferous plant grow in the moist prairie of this region i have handle it and have pay dearly for it have such a swell face that i could scarcely see for several day the regulator of ogle county remove bridge 's family on Monday last and demolish he house he make preparation to defend himself and keep twenty armed man about he for two day but think at last that the regulator do not mean to carry they threat into effect he dismiss they he have take refuge with he friend the aikin family who live i believe in jefferson grove in the same county and who it be say have also receive notice to quit letter viii example of lynch law princeton illinoi _ July 2 1841 _ in my last letter i mention that the regulator in ogle county on rock

else in the autumn when the animal be keep near the dwelling of they owner to be feed with indian corn and be in excellent order the thief select the best from the drive and these be pass from one station to another till they arrive at some distant market where they be sell it be say that they have they regular line of communication from wisconsin to st loui and from the wabash to the mississippus in ogle county they seem to have be bolder than elsewhere and more successful notwithstanding the notoriety of they crime in avoid punishment the impossibility of punish they by process of law the burning of the court-house at oregon city last April and the threat of deadly vengeance throw out by they against such as should attempt to bring they to justice lead to the formation of a company of citizen regulator they call themselves who resolve to take the law into they own hand and drive the felon from the neighborhood this be not the first instance of the kind which have happen in illinois some twenty year since the southern county contain a gang of horse-thief so numerous and well-organized as to defy punishment by legal means and they be expel by the same method which be now adopt in ogle county i have just learn since i write the last sentence that the society of regulator include not only the county of ogle but those of de kalb and winnebago where the depredation of the horse-thief and the perfect impunity with which they manage to exercise they call have exhaust the patience of the inhabitant in those county as well as in ogle they patron live at some of the

president by greenough be of course one of the thing which i take a early opportunity of look at and although the bad light in which it be place prevent the spectator from properly appreciate the feature i could not help see with satisfaction that no position however unfavorable could impair the majesty of that noble work or at all event destroy its grand general effect the house of representative i have not see since 1832 and i perceive that the proceedings be conduct with less apparent decorum than formerly and that the member no longer sit with they hat on whether they have come to the conclusion that it be well to sit uncovered in order to make up by this token of mutual respect for the too frequent want of decorum in they proceedings or whether the change have be make because it so often happen that all the member be talk together the rule be that the person speak must be barehead or whether finally it be find during the late long summer session that a hat make the wearer really uncomfortable be question which i ask on the spot but to which i get no satisfactory answer i visit the senate chamber and see a member of that dignified body as somebody call it in

superficial cultivation large dwelling be see at a distance from each other and each with its group of smaller building look as solitary and chilly as french chateaus and now and then we see a gang of

receive the leaf thus prepared roll they into long even roll and then cut they into plug of about four inch in length which be afterwards pass through a press and thus become ready for market as we enter the room we hear a murmur of psalmody run through the sable assembly which now and then swell into a strain of very tolerable music verse sweeten toil -- say the stanza which dr johnson be so fond of quote and really it be so good that i will transcribe the whole of it -- verse sweeten toil however rude the sound -- all at she work the village maiden sing nor while she turn the giddy wheel around revolve the sad vicissitude of thing verse it seem can sweeten the toil of slave in a tobacco factory we encourage they singing as much as we can say the brother of the proprietor himself a

virginium in 1788 be here it be of the size of life represent gen washington in the costume of he day and in a ordinary standing posture it gratify curiosity but raise no particular moral emotion compare with the statue by greenough it present a good example of the difference between the work of a mere sculptor -- skillful indeed but still a mere sculptor -- and the work of a man of genius i shall shortly set out for charleston south carolina letter x a journey from richmond to charleston charleston _ march _ 6 1843 i leave richmond on the afternoon of a keen march day in the railway train for petersburg where we arrive after dark and therefore could form no judgment of the appearance of the town here we be transfer to another train of car among the passenger be a lecturer on mesmerism with he wife and a young woman who accompany they as a mesmeric subject the young woman accustom to be easily put to sleep seem to get through the night very comfortably but the spouse of the operator appear to be much disturb by the frequent and capricious opening of the door by the other passenger which let in torrent of intensely cold air from without and chide the offender with a wholesome sharpness about two o'clock in the morning we reach blakely on the roanoke where we be make to get out of the car and be march in long procession for about a quarter of a mile down to the river a negro walk before we to light we way bear a blaze pine torch which scatter spark like a steam-engine and a crowd of negro follow we bear we baggage we go down a steep path to the roanoke where we find a little old steamboat ready for we and in about fifteen minute be struggle upward against the muddy and rapid current in little more than a hour we have proceed two mile and a half up the river and be land at a place call weldon here we take the car for wilmington in north carolina and shabby vehicle they be denote we arrival in a milder climate by be extremely uncomfortable for cold weather as morning dawn we see ourselves in the midst of the pine forest of north carolina vast tract of level sand overgrown with the long-leaved pine a tall stately tree with sparse and thick twig end in long brush of leaf murmur in the strong cold wind extend everywhere around we at great distance from each other we pass log-house and sometimes a dwelling of more pretension with a piazza and here and there field in which cotton or maize have be plant last year or a orchard with a few small mossy tree the pool beside the road be cover with ice just form and the negro who like a good fire at almost any season of the year and who find a abundant supply of the finest fuel in these forest have make blaze fire of the resinous wood of the pine wherever they be at work the tract of sandy soil we perceive be intersperse with marsh crowd with cypress-tree and verdant at they border with a growth of evergreen such as the swamp-bay the gallberry the holly and various kind of evergreen creeper which be unknown to we northern climate and which become more frequent as we proceed we pass through extensive forest of pine which have be _ box _ as it be call for the collection of turpentine every tree have be score by the axe upon one of its side some of they as high as the arm could reach down to the root and the broad wound be cover with the turpentine which seem to saturate every fiber of the long-leaved pine sometimes we see large flake or crust of the turpentine of a light-yellow color which have fall and lay beside the tree on the ground the collection of turpentine be a work of destruction it strip acre after acre of these noble tree and if it go on the time be not far distant when the long-leaved pine will become nearly extinct in this region which be so sterile as hardly to be fit for produce any thing else we see large tract cover with the standing trunk of tree already kill by it and other tract beside they have be freshly attack by the spoiler i be tell that the tree which grow up when the long-leaved pine be destroy be the loblolly pine or as it be sometimes call the short-leaved pine a tree of very inferior quality and in little esteem about half-past two in the afternoon we come to wilmington a little town build upon the white sand of cape fear some of the house stand where not a blade of grass or other plant can grow a few evergreen oak in place pleasantly overhang the water here we take the steamer for charleston i may as well mention here a fraud which be sometimes practice upon those who go by this route to charleston advertisement be distribute at new york and elsewhere inform the public that the fare from baltimore to charleston by the railway through washington and richmond be but twenty-two dollar i take the railway pay from place to place as i go and find that this be a falsehood i be make to pay seven or eight dollar more in the course of my journey i be tell that to protect myself from this imposition i should have purchase at baltimore a through ticket as it be call that be should have pay in advance for the whole distance but the advertisement do not inform I that this be necessary no wonder that trick upon traveller should have become a proverbial expression for they be a much-enduring race more or less plunder in every part of the world the next morning at eight o'clock we find ourselves enter charleston harbor sullivan 's island with fort moultrie breathing recollection of the revolution on we right jame island on we leave in front the stately dwelling of the town and all around on the land side the horizon bound by a apparent belt of evergreen -- the live-oak the water-oak the palmetto the pine and plant about the dwelling the magnolia and the wild orange -- give to the scene a summer aspect the city of charleston strike the visitor from the north most agreeably he perceive at once that he be in a different climate the spacious house be surround with broad piazza often a piazza to each story for the sake of shade and coolness and each house generally stand by itself in a garden plant with tree and shrub many of which preserve they verdure through the winter we see early flower already open the peach and plum-tree be in full bloom and the wild orange as they call the cherry-laurel be just put forth its blossom the building -- some with stuccoed wall some build of large dark-red brick and some of wood -- be not keep fresh with paint like ours but be allow to become weather-stained by the humid climate like those of the european town the street be broad and quiet unpaved in some part but in none as with we offensive both to sight and smell the public building be numerous for the size of the city and well-built in general with sufficient space about they to give they a noble aspect and all the advantage which they could derive from they architecture the inhabitant judge from what i have see of they which be not much i confess do not appear undeserving of the character which have be give they of possess the most polished and agreeable manners of all the american city i may shortly write you again from the interior of south carolina

peninsula be flow under my window on the opposite shore be forest of tall tree bright in the new verdure of the season a hunter who have range they the whole day have just arrive in a canoe bring with he a deer which he have kill i have this moment return from a ramble with my host through a hammock he look for he cow and i unsuccessfully for a thicket of orange-tree he be something of a florist and gather for I as we go some of the forest plant which be in bloom we have flower here say he every month in the year i have use the word hammock which here in florida have a peculiar mean a hammock be a spot cover with a growth of tree which require a richer soil than the pine such as the oak the mulberry the gum-tree the hickory & c the greater part of east florida consist of pine barren -- a sandy level produce the long leaved pine and the dwarf palmetto a low plant with fan-like leaf and root of a prodigious size the hammock be a kind of oasis a verdant and luxuriant island in the midst of these sterile sand which make about nine-tenth of the soil of east florida in the hammock grow the wild lime the native orange both sour and bitter-sweet and the various vine and gigantic creeper of the country the hammock be choose for plantation here the cane be cultivate and grove of the sweet orange plant but i shall say more of florida hereafter when i have see more of it meantime let I speak of my journey hither i leave charleston on the 30th of march in one of the steamer which ply between that city and savannah these steamer be among the very best that float -- quiet commodious clean fresh as if just build and furnish with civil and ready-handed waiter we pass along the narrow and wind channel which divide the broad island of south carolina from the main-land -- island famed for the rice culture and particularly for the excellent cotton with long fiber name the sea-island cotton we fellow-passenger be mostly planter of these island and they family person of remarkably courteous frank and agreeable manners the shore on either side have little of the picturesque to show we extensive marsh wave with coarse water-grass sometimes a cane-brake sometimes a pine grove or a clump of cabbage-leaved palmetto here and there a pleasant bank border with live-oaks streaming with moss and at wide interval the distant habitation of a planter -- these be the element of the scenery the next morning early we be pass up the savannah river and the city be in sight standing among its tree on a high bank of the stream savannah be beautifully lay out its broad street be thickly plant with the pride of indium and its frequent open square shaded with tree of various kind oglethorpe seem to have understand how a city should be build in a warm climate and the people of the place be fond of remind the stranger that the original plan of the founder have never be depart from the town so charmingly embowered remind I of new haven though the variety of tree be greater in my walk about the place i pass a large stuccoed building of a dull-yellow color with broad arched window and a stately portico on each side of which stand a stiff look palmetto as if keep guard the grim aspect of the building lead I to ask what it be and i be answer that it be the old united state bank it be the building in which the savannah branch of that bank transact business and be now shut up until the time shall come when that great institution shall be revive meantime i be pained to see that there exist so little reverence for its memory and so little gratitude for its benefit that the boy have take to smash the window so that those who have the care of the building have be oblige to cover they with plank in another part of the city i be show a african church a neat spacious wooden building rail in and keep in excellent order with a piazza extend along its entire front it be one of the four place of worship for the black of the town and be build by negro workman with material purchase by the contribution of the whites south of the town extend a uninclosed space on one side of which be a pleasant grove of pine in the shade of which the member of a quoit-club practice they athletic sport here on a Saturday afternoon for that be they stated time of assemble i be introduce to some of the most distinguished citizen of savannah and witness the skill with which they throw the discus no apprentice be they in the art there be no striking far from the stake no send the discus rolling over the green they heap the quoit as snugly around the stake as if the amusement have be they profession in the same neighborhood just without the town lie the public cemetery surround by a ancient wall build before the revolution which in some place show the mark of shot fire against it in the skirmish of that period i enter it hope to find some monument of those who found the city a hundred and ten year ago but the inscription be of comparatively recent date most of they commemorate the death of person bear in europe or the northern state i be tell that the remains of the early inhabitant lie in the brick tomb of which there be many without any inscription whatever at a little distance near a forest lie the burial-place of the black population a few tree trail with long moss rise above hundred of nameless grave overgrow with weed but here and there be scattered memorial of the dead some of a very humble kind with a few of marble and half a dozen spacious brick tomb like those in the cemetery of the whites some of they be erect by master and mistress to the memory of favorite slave one of they commemorate the death of a young woman who perish in the catastrophe of the steamer pulaskus of whom it be record that during the whole time that she be in the service of she mistress which be many year she never commit a theft nor utter a falsehood a brick monument in the shape of a little tomb with a marble slab insert in front have this inscription : in memory of henrietta gatlin the infant stranger bear in east florida aged 1 year 3 month a graveyard be hardly the place to be merry in but i could not help smile at some of the

and add : a address be deliver at he death by the rev mr johnson dr kollock thoma william and henry cunningham while in savannah i pay a visit to bonaventure formerly a country seat of governor tatnall but now abandon a pleasant drive of a mile or two through a bud forest take we to the place which be now itself almost grow up into forest cedar and other shrub hide the old terrace of the garden which be finely situate on the high bank of a river tree of various kind have also nearly fill the space between the noble avenue of live-oak which be plant around the mansion but these oak -- never see finer tree -- certainly i never see so many majestic and venerable tree together i look far down the immense arch that overshadow the broad passage as high as the nave of a gothic cathedral apparently as old and stretch to a greater distance the huge bough be clothe with gray moss yard in length which cling to they like mist or hang in still festoon on every side and give they the appearance of the vault of a vast vapory cavern the cawing of the crow and the scream of the jay however remind we that we be in the forest of the mansion there be no remains but in the thicket of magnolia and other tree among rosebush and creep plant we find a burial-place with monument of some person to whom the seat have belong savannah be more healthy of late year than it formerly be a arrangement have be make with the owner of the plantation in the immediate vicinity by which the culture of rice have be abandon and the land be no longer allow to be overflow within a mile from the city the place have since become much less subject to fever than in former year i leave with a feeling of regret the agreeable society of savannah the steamboat take we to st mary 's through passage between the sea-island and the main-land similar to those by which we have arrive at savannah in the course of the day we pass a channel in which we see several huge alligator bask on the bank the grim creature slide slowly into the water at we approach we pass st mary 's in the night and in the morning we be in the main ocean approach the st john 's where we see a row of pelican stand like creature who have nothing to do on the sand we enter the majestic river the vast current of which be dark with the infusion of the swamp turf from which it be drain we pass jacksonville a little town of great activity which have spring up on the sandy bank within two or three year beyond we sweep by the mouth of the black creek the water of which probably from the color of the mud which form the bed of its channel have to the eye a ebony blackness and reflect object with all the distinctness of the kind of looking-glass call a black mirror a few hour bring we to picolata lately a military station but now a place with only two house letter xiii st augustine st augustine east florida _ April 2 1843 _ when we leave picola on the 8th of April we find ourselves journey through a vast forest a road of eighteen mile in length over the level sand bring you to this place tall pine a thin growth stand wherever we turn we eye and the ground be cover with the dwarf palmetto and the whortleberry which be here a evergreen yet there be not want sight to interest we even in this dreary and sterile region as we pass a clearing in which we see a young white woman and a boy drop corn and some negro cover it with they hoe we behold a large flock of white crane which rise in the air and hover over the forest and wheel and wheel again they spotless plumage glisten in the sun like new-fallen snow we cross the track of a recent hurricane which have break off the huge pine midway from the ground and whirl the summit to a distance from they trunk from time to time we ford little stream of a deep-red color flow from the swamp tinge as we be tell with the root of the red bay a species of magnolia as the horse wade into the transparent crimson we think of the butchery commit by the indian on that road and could almost fancy that the water be still color with the blood they have shed the driver of we wagon tell we many narrative of these murder and point out the place where they be commit he show we where the father of this young woman be shoot dead in he wagon as he be go from st augustine to he plantation and the boy whom we have see be wound and scalp by they and leave for dead in another place he show we the spot where a party of player on they way to st augustine be surprised and kill the indian take possession of the stage dress one of they array himself in the garb of othello another in that of richard the third and another take the costume of falstaff i think it be wild cat 's gang who engage in this affair and i be tell that after the capture of this chief and some of he warrior they recount the circumstance with great glee at another place we pass a small thicket in which several armed indian as they afterward related lay conceal while a officer of the united state army ride several time around it without any suspicion of they presence the same man commit immediately afterward several murder and robbery on the road at length we emerge upon a shrubby plain and finally come in sight of this oldest city of the united state seat among its tree on a sandy swell of land where it have stand for three hundred year i be strike with its ancient and homely aspect even at a distance and could not help liken it to picture which i have see of dutch town though it want a windmill or two to make the resemblance perfect we drive into a green square in the midst of which be a monument erect to commemorate the spanish constitution of 1812 and thence through the narrow street of the city to we hotel i have call the street narrow in few place be they wide enough to allow two carriage to pass abreast i be tell that they be not originally intend for carriage and that in the time when the town belong to spain many of they be floor with a artificial stone compose of shell and mortar which in this climate take and keep the hardness of rock and that no other vehicle than a hand-barrow be allow to pass over they in some place you see remnant of this ancient pavement but for the most part it have be ground into dust under the wheel of the cart and carriage introduce by the new inhabitant the old house build of a kind of stone which be seemingly a pure concretion of small shell overhang the street with they wooden balcony and the garden between the house be fence on the side of the street with high wall of stone peeping over these wall you see branch of the pomegranate and of the orange-tree now fragrant with flower and rise yet higher the lean bough of the fig with its broad luxuriant leaf occasionally you pass the ruin of house -- wall of stone with arch and staircase of the same material which once belong to stately dwelling you meet in the street with man of swarthy complexion and foreign physiognomy and you hear they speak to each other in a strange language you be tell that these be the remains of those who inhabit the country under the spanish dominion and that the dialect you have hear be that of the island of minorca twelve year ago say a acquaintance of mine when i first visit st augustine it be a fine old spanish town a large proportion of the house which you now see roof like barn be then flat-roofed they be all of shell-rock and these modern wooden building be not yet erect that old fort which they be now repair to fit it for receive a garrison be a sort of ruin for the outwork have partly fall and it stand unoccupied by the military a venerable monument of the spanish dominion but the orange-grove be the ornament and wealth of st augustine and they produce maintain the inhabitant in comfort orange-tree of the size and height of the pear-tree often rise higher than the roof of the house embower the town in perpetual verdure they stand so close in the grove that they exclude the sun and the atmosphere be at all time aromatic with they leaf and fruit and in spring the fragrance of the flower be almost oppressive these grove have now lose they beauty a few year since a severe frost kill the tree to the ground and when they sprout again from the root a new enemy make its appearance -- a insect of the _ coccus _ family with a kind of shell on its back which enable it to withstand all the common application for destroy insect and the ravages of which be show by the leaf become black and sere and the twig perish in October last a gale drive in the spray from the ocean strip the tree except in sheltered situation of they leaf and destroy the upper branch the trunk be now put out new sprout and new leaf but there be no hope of fruit for this year at least the old fort of st mark now call fort marion a foolish change of name be a noble work frown over the matanza which flow between st augustine and the island of st anastasium and it be worth make a long journey to see no record remain of its original construction but it be suppose to have be erect about a hundred and fifty year since and the shell-rock of which it be build be dark with time we see where it have be strike with cannon-ball which instead of splitting the rock become imbedded and clogged among the loosen fragment of shell this rock be therefore one of the best material for a fortification in the world we be take into the ancient prison of the fort -- dungeon one of which be dimly light by a grate window and another entirely without light and by the flame of a torch we be show the half-obliterated inscription scrawl on the wall long ago by prisoner but in another corner of the fort we be take to look at two secret cell which be discover a few year since in consequence of the sinking of the earth over a narrow apartment between they these cell be deep under ground vaulted overhead and without window in one of they a wooden machine be find which some suppose might have be a rack and in the other a quantity of human bone the door of these cell have be wall up and conceal with stucco before the fort pass into the hand of the american if the inquisition say the gentleman who accompany we be establish in florida as it be in the other american colony of spain these be its secret chamber yesterday be palm Sunday and in the morning i attend the service in the catholic church one of the ceremony be that of pronounce the benediction over a large pile of leaf of the cabbage-palm or palmetto gather in the wood after the blessing have be pronounce the priest call upon the congregation to come and receive they the man come forward first in the order of they age and then the woman and as the congregation consist mostly of the descendant of minorcan greek and spaniard i have a good opportunity of observe they personal appearance the younger portion of the congregation have in general expressive countenance they form it appear to I be generally slighter than those of we people and if the cheek of the young woman be dark they have regular feature and brilliant eye and finely form hand there be spirit also in this class for one of they have since be point out to I in the street as have draw a dirk upon a young officer who presume upon some improper freedom of behavior the service be close by a plain and sensible discourse in english from the priest mr rampon a worthy and useful french ecclesiastic on the obligation of temperance for the temperance reform have penetrate even hither and cold water be all the rage i go again the other evening into the same church and hear a person declaim in a language which at first i take to be minorcan for i could make nothing else of it after listen for a few minute i find that it be a frenchman preach in spanish with a french mode of pronunciation which be odd enough i ask one of the old spanish inhabitant how he be edify by this discourse and he acknowledge that he understand about a eighth part of it i have much more to write about this place but must reserve it for another letter letter xiv st augustine st augustine _ April 24 1843 _ you can not be in st augustine a day without hear some of its inhabitant speak of its agreeable climate during the sixteen day of my residence here the weather have certainly be as delightful as i could imagine we have the temperature of early June as June be know in new york the morning be sometimes a little sultry but after two or three hour a fresh breeze come in from the sea sweep through the broad piazza and breathing in at the window at this season it come laden with the fragrance of the flower of the pride of indium and sometimes of the orange-tree and sometimes bring the scent of rose now in full bloom the night be gratefully cool and i have be tell by a person who have live here many year that there be very few night in the summer when you can sleep without a blanket a acquaintance of mine a invalid who have try various climate and have keep up a kind of run fight with death for many year retreat from country to country as he pursue declare to I that the winter climate of st augustine be to be prefer to that of any part of europe even that of sicily and that it be better than the climate of the west indy he find it genial and equable at the same time that it be not enfeeble the summer heat be prevent from be intense by the sea-breeze of which i have speak i have look over the work of dr forry on the climate of the united state and have be surprise to see the uniformity of climate which he ascribe to key west as appear by the observation he have collect the season at that place glide into each other by the softest gradation and the heat never even in midsummer reach that extreme which be feel in higher latitudes of the american continent the climate of florida be in fact a insular climate the atlantic on the east and the gulf of mexico on the west temper the air that blow over it make they cooler in summer and warmer in winter i do not wonder therefore that it be so much the resort of invalid it would be more so if the softness of its atmosphere and the beauty and serenity of its season be generally know nor should it be suppose that accommodation for person in delicate health be want they be in fact become better with every year as the demand for they increase among the acquaintance whom i have make here i remember many who have come hither for the benefit of they health be detain for life by the amenity of the climate it seem to I say a intelligent gentleman of this class the other day as if i could not exist out of florida when i go to the north i feel most sensibly the severe extreme of the weather the climate of charleston itself appear harsh to I here at st augustine we have occasional frost in the winter but at tampa bay on the western shore of the peninsula no further from this place than from new york to albany the dew be never congeal on the grass nor be a snow-flake ever see float in the air those who have pass the winter in that place speak with a kind of rapture of the benignity of the climate in that country grow the cocoa and the banana and other production of the west indy person who have explore florida to the south of this during the past winter speak of have refresh themselves with melon in January grow where they have be self-sown and of have see the sugar-cane where it have be plant by the indian tower uncropped almost to the height of the forest tree i must tell you however what be say to I by a person who have pass a considerable time in florida and have journey as he tell I in the southern as well as the northern part of the peninsula that the climate be mild and agreeable say he i admit but the annoyance to which you be expose from insect counterbalance all the enjoyment of the climate you be bite by mosquito and gallinipper drive mad by cloud of sand-fly and sting by scorpion and centipede it be not safe to go to bed in southern florida without look between the sheet to see if there be not a scorpion wait to be you bed-fellow nor to put on a garment that have be hang up in you room without turn it wrong side out to see if a scorpion have not find a lodging in it i have not however be incommode at st augustine with these varmint as they call they at the south only the sand-fly a small black midge i have sometimes find a little importunate when walk out in a very calm evening of the salubrity of east florida i must speak less positively although it be certain that in st augustine emigrant from the north enjoy good health the owner of the plantation in the neighborhood prefer to pass the hot season in this city not care to trust they constitution to the experiment of a summer residence in the country of course they be settle on the richest soil and these be the least healthy the pine barren be safer when not intersperse with marsh the sandy land that bear the pine be esteem healthy all over the south yet there be plantation on the st john 's where emigrant from the north reside throughout the year the opinion seem everywhere to prevail and i believe there be good reason for it that florida notwithstanding its low and level surface be much more healthy than the low country of south carolina and georgia the other day i go out with a friend to a sugar plantation in the neighborhood of st augustine as we ride into the inclosure we breathe the fragrance of young orange-tree in flower the glossy leaf of which green at all season be tremble in the wind a troop of negro child be at play at a little distance from the cabin and one of they run along with we to show we a grove of sour orange which we be look for he point we to a copse in the middle of a field to which we proceed the tree which be of considerable size be full of flower and the golden fruit be thick on the branch and lay scatter on the ground below i gather a few of the orange and find they almost as acid as the lemon we stop to look at the building in which the sugar be manufacture in one of they be the mill where the cane be crush with iron roller in another stand the huge cauldron one after another in which the juice be boil down to the proper consistence in another be barrel of sugar of syrup -- a favorite article of consumption in this city -- of molasses and a kind of spirit resemble jamaica rum distil from the refuse of the molasses the proprietor be absent but three negro well-clad young man of a very respectable appearance and intelligent physiognomy one of whom be a distiller be occupy about the building and show they to we near by in the open air lay a pile of sugar cane of the ribbon variety strip with red and white which have be pluck up by the root and reserve for plant the negro of st augustine be a good-looking specimen of the race and have the appearance of be very well treat you rarely see a negro in ragged clothing and the colored child though slave be often dress with great neatness in the color people whom i saw in the catholic church i remark a more agreeable open and gentle physiognomy than i have be accustom to see in that class the spanish race blend more kindly with the african than do the english and produce handsomer man and woman i have be to see the quarry of coquina or shell-rock on the island of st anastasium which lie between st augustine and the main ocean we land on the island and after a walk of some distance on a sandy road through the thick shrub we arrive at some hut build of a frame-work of pole thatch with the radiate leaf of the dwarf palmetto which have a very picturesque appearance here we find a circular hollow in the earth the place of a old excavation now shaded with red-cedar and the palmetto-royal bristle with long pointed leaf which bent over and embower it and at the bottom be a spring within a square curb of stone where we refresh ourselves with a draught of cold water the quarry be at a little distance from this the rock lie in the ridge a little below the surface form a stratum of no great depth the block be cut out with crowbar thrust into the rock it be of a delicate cream color and be compose of mere shell and fragment of shell apparently cement by the fresh water percolate through they and deposit calcareous matter bring from the shell above whenever there be any mixture of sand with the shell rock be not form of this material the old fort of st mark and the greater part of the city be build it be say to become harder when expose to the air and the rain but to disintegrate when frequently moisten with sea-water large block be lie on the shore ready to be convey to the fort which be undergo repair it be some consolation to know that this fine old work will undergo as little change in the original plan as be consistent with the modern improvement in fortification lieutenant benham who have the charge of the repair have strong antiquarian taste and will preserve as much as possible of its original aspect it must lose its battlements however its fine mural crown battlements be now obsolete except when they be of no use as on the roof of church and gothic cottage in another part of the same island which we visit afterward be a dwelling-house situate amid orange-grove closely plant row of the sour orange the native tree of the country intersect and shelter orchard of the sweet orange the lemon and the lime the tree be all young have be plant since the great frost of 1835 and many of they still show the ravages of the gale of last October which strip they of they leaf come this way say a friend who accompany I he force a passage through a tall hedge of the sour orange and we find ourselves in a little fragrant inclosure in the midst of which be a tomb form of the artificial stone of which i have heretofore speak it be the resting-place of the former proprietor who sleep in this little circle of perpetual verdure it bear no inscription not far from this spot i be show the root of a ancient palm-tree the species that produce the date which formerly tower over the island and serve as a sea-mark to vessel approach the shore some of the account of st augustine speak of date as among its fruit but i believe that only the male tree of the date-palm have be introduce into the country on we return to the city in cross the matanza sound so name probably from some sanguinary battle with the aborigine on its shore we pass two minorcan in a boat take home fuel from the island these people be a mild harmless race of civil manners and abstemious habit mingle with they be many greek family with name that denote they origin such as geopoli cercopolus & c and with a cast of feature equally expressive of they descent the minorcan language the dialect of mahon _ el mahone _ as they call it be speak by more than half of the inhabitant who remain here when the country be cede to the united state and all of they i believe speak spanish besides they child however be grow up in disuse of these language and in another generation the last trace of the majestic speech of castile will have be efface from a country which the spaniard hold for more than two hundred year some old custom which the minorcan bring with they from they native country be still keep up on the evening before easter Sunday about eleven o'clock i hear the sound of a serenade in the street go out i find a party of young man with instrument of music group about the window of one of the dwelling sing a hymn in honor of the virgin in the mahonese dialect they begin as i be tell with tap on the shutter a answering knock within have tell they that they visit be welcome and they immediately begin the serenade if no reply have be hear they would have pass on to another dwelling i give the hymn as it be kindly take down for I in write by a native of st augustine i presume this be the first time that it have be put in print but i fear the copy have several corruption occasion by the unskillfulness of the copyist the letter _ e _ which i have put in italics represent the guttural french _ e _ or perhaps more nearly the sound of _ u _ in the word but the _ sh _ of we language be represent by _ sc _ follow by a _ i _ or a _ e _ the _ g _ both hard and soft have the same sound as in we language disciarem lu dol cantarem anb ' alagria y n'arem a dá las pascuas a marium o marium sant grabiel quus

for savannah never be softer or more genial air breathe out of the heaven than those which play around we as we plough the water of the matanza sound pass under the dark wall of the old fort and leave it behind we stand for the passage to the main ocean it be a common say in st augustine that florida be the best poor man 's country in the world and truly i believe that those who live on the shore of this sound find it so its green water teem with life and produce abundance of the finest fish ------ of shell or fin and exquisitest name clam be dig up on the pure sand along the beach where the fisherman drag they boat ashore and wherever the salt water dash there be a oyster if he can find aught upon which to anchor he habitation along the edge of the marsh next to the water you see a row -- a wall i should rather say -- of oyster apparently sprout one out of another as high as the tide flow they be call here though i do not know why ratoon oyster the abundance of fish solve the problem which have puzzle many how the minorcan population of st augustine live now that they orange-tree upon which they formerly depend be unproductive in the steamboat be two or three person who have visit florida with a view of purchase land now that the indian war be end colonization have revive and people be throng into the country to take advantage of the law which assign a hundred and sixty acre to every actual settler in another year the influx of population will probably be still greater though the confusion and uncertainty which exist in regard to the title of the land will somewhat obstruct the settlement of the country before the spanish government cede it to the united state they make numerous grant to individual intend to cover all the best land of the territory many of the land grant have never be survey and they situation and limit be very uncertain the settler therefore if he be not very careful may find he farm overlaid by a old spanish claim i have say that the war be end although the seminole chief sam jone and about seventy of he people remain the country be in profound peace from one end to the other and you may traverse the part most distant from the white settlement without the least danger or molestation from the indian how be it i ask one day of a gentleman who have long reside in st augustine that after what have happen you can think it safe to let these people remain it be perfectly safe he answer sam jone profess and i believe truly to have have less to do with the murder which have be commit than the other chief though it be certain that dr perrine whose death we so much lament be shoot at indian key by he man besides he have a quarrel with one of the seminole chief whose relative he have kill and if he be to follow they to they new country he would certainly be put to death it be he interest therefore to propitiate the favor of the whites by the most unexceptionable behavior for he life depend upon be allow to remain there be yet another reason which you will understand from what i be about to say before the war break out the indian of this country those very man who suddenly become so bloodthirsty and so formidable be a quiet and inoffensive race badly treat for the most part by the whites and passively submit to ill treatment without any appearance of feeling or spirit when they at length resolve upon war they conceal they family in the island of the everglade whither they suppose the whites would never be able to follow they they rule of warfare be this never to endanger the life of one of they warrior for the sake of gain the greatest advantage over they enemy they strike only when they feel themselves in perfect safety if they see a opportunity of destroy twenty white man by the sacrifice of a single indian the whites be allow to escape act on this principle if they retreat have be as inaccessible as they suppose it they would have keep up the warfare until they have drive the whites out of the territory when however general worth introduce a new method of prosecute the war follow up the indian with a close and perpetual pursuit chase they into they great shallow lake the everglade and to its most secret island they see at once that they be conquer they see that further hostility be hopeless and return to they former submissive and quiet demeanor it be well perhaps add my friend in a kind of postscript that a few indian should remain in florida they be the best hunter of runaway slave in the world and may save we from a maroon war the indian name of the everglade i be tell signify grass-water a term which well express its appearance it be a vast lake broader by thousand of acre in a wet than in a dry season and so shallow that the grass everywhere grow from the bottom and overtop its surface the bottom be of hard sand so firm that it can be ford almost everywhere on horseback and here and there be deep channel which the traveller cross by swim he horse general worth 's success in quell the insurrection of the seminole have make he very popular in florida where the energy and sagacity with which the closing campaign of the war be conduct be speak of in the highest term he have lately fix he head-quarter at st augustine in the afternoon we steamer put in between two sandy point of land and we arrive at st mary 's formerly a buccaneer settlement but now so zealous for good order that we captain tell we the inhabitant object to he take in wood for he steamboat on Sunday the place be full of grove of the orange and lime -- young tree which have grow up since 1835 and which not have suffer like those of st augustine by the gale i find beautifully luxuriant in this place it be my fate to experience the plague of sand-fly cloud of they come into the

night the vessel leave the wharf and stand out into the river where the current of air sweep most of we tormentor away the next morning as we be thread the narrow channel by which the inland passage be make from st mary 's to savannah we see from time to time alligator bask on the bank some of we fellow-passenger take rifle and shoot at they as we go by the smaller one be often kill the larger generally take the rifle-ball upon they impenetrable back and walk apparently unhurt into the water one of these monstrous creature i see receive he death-wound have be fire at twice the ball probably

active in this sport and often say to the bystander i hit the ` gator that time i do we pass where two of these huge reptile be lie on the bank among the rank sedge one of they with he head towards we a rifle-ball from the steamer strike the ground just before he face and he immediately make for the water drag with he awkward leg a huge body of about fifteen foot in length a shower of ball fall about he as he reach the river but he paddle along with as little apparent concern as the steamboat we be in the tail of the alligator be say to be no bad eating and the negro be fond of it i have hear however that the wife of a south carolina cracker once declare she dislike of it in the follow term : coon and collard be pretty good fixin but ` gator and turnip i can not go no how collard you

chewer of the indian weed -- frank and careless spitter -- who have never be discipline by the fear of woman into any hypocritical concealment of they talent or unmanly reserve in its exhibition i

ever hear the canal connect the hudson with lake champlain praise for its beauty yet it be actually beautiful -- that part of it at least which lie between dunham 's basin and the lake a distance of twenty-one mile for of the rest i can not speak to form the canal two or three stream have be divert a little from they original course and lead along a certain level in the valley through which they flow to pour themselves into champlain in order to keep this level a perpetually wind course have be take never even for a few rod approach a straight line on one side be the path beat by the foot of the horse who drag the boat but the other be a irregular bank cover sometimes with grass and sometimes with shrub or tree and sometimes steep with rock i be delighted on my journey to this place to exchange a seat in a stage-coach drive over the sandy and dusty road north of saratoga by a sulky and careless driver for a station on the top of the canal-packet the weather be the finest imaginable the air that blow over the field be sweet with the odor of clover blossom and of shrub in flower a canal they say be but a ditch but this be as unlike a ditch as possible it be rather a gentle stream wind in the most apparently natural meander goldsmith could find no more picturesque epithet for the canal of holland than slow the slow canal the yellow blossom vale -- but if the canal of that country have be like this i be sure he would have know how to say something better for they on the left bank grass over to the water 's edge i see ripe strawberry peep out among the clover and shortly afterward a young man belong to the packet leap on board from the other side with a large basket of very fine strawberry i gather they say he down in the swamp the swamp be full of they we have they afterward with we tea proceeding still further the scenery become more bold steep hill rise by the side of the canal with farm-house scatter at they foot we pass close to perpendicular precipice and rocky shelf sprout with shrub and under impend wood at length a steep broad mountain rise before we its side shaded with scattered tree and streak with long horizontal line of rock and at its foot a cluster of white house this be whitehall and here the water of the canal plunge noisily through a rocky gorge into the deep basin which hold the long and narrow lake champlain there be a young man on board who speak english imperfectly and whose accent i could not with certainty refer to any country or language with which i be acquaint as we land he leap on shore and be surround at once by half a dozen person chatter canadian french the french population of canada have scatter itself along the shore of lake champlain for a third of the distance between the northern boundary of this state and the city of new york and since the late trouble in canada more numerously than ever in the hotel where i pass the night most of the servant seem to be emigrant from canada speaking of foreigner remind I of a incident which occur on the road between saratoga spring and dunham 's basin as the public coach stop at a place call emerson we attention be attract by a wagon-load of person who have stop at the inn and be just resume they journey the father be a robust healthy-looking man of some forty year of age the mother a buxom dame the child some six or seven of various age with flaxen hair light-blue eye and broad ruddy cheek they be irish say one of my fellow-passenger i maintain on the contrary that they be american git ap say the man to he horse pronounce the last word very long git ap go ` lang my antagonist in the dispute immediately acknowledge that i be right for git ap and go ` lang could never have be utter with such purity of accent by a irishman we learn on inquiry that they be emigrant from the neighborhood proceed to the western canal to take passage for michigan where the residence of a year or two will probably take somewhat from the florid ruddiness of they complexion i look down into the basin which contain the water of the champlain lie considerably below the level on which whitehall be build and could not help think that it be scoop to contain a wider and deeper collection of water craggy mountain stand one behind the other surround it on all side from whose foot it seem as if the water have retire and here and there be marshy recess between the hill which might once have be the bay of the lake the burlington one of the model steamboat for the whole world which navigate the champlain be lie moor below my journey however be to be by land at seven o'clock in the morning we set out from whitehall in a strong wagon to cross the mountainous country lie east of the lake git ap say we good-natured driver to he cattle and we climb and descend one rugged hill after another pass by cottage which we be tell be inhabit by canadian french we have a passenger from essex county on the west side of the lake a lady who in she enthusiastic love of a mountainous country seem to wish that the hill be higher and another from the prairie of the western state who accustom for many year to the easy and noiseless glide of carriage over the smooth summer road of that region could hardly restrain herself from exclaim at every step against the ruggedness of the country and the roughness of the way a third passenger be a emigrant from vermont to chatauque county in the state of new york who be now return on a visit to he native county the hill of vermont and who entertain we by sing some stanza of what he call the michigan song much in vogue as he say in these part before he emigrate eight year ago here be a sample : they talk about vermont they say no state 's like that : ` tis true the girl be handsome the cattle too be fat but who amongst its mountain of cold and ice would stay when he can buy paraira in michigan - _ i-a _ by paraira you must understand prairie it be a most splendid song continue the singer it touch off one state after another connecticut for example : connecticut have blue law and when the beer on Sunday get work in the barrel they flog it well on Monday at benson in vermont we emerge upon a smoother country a country of rich pasture field heavy with grass almost ready for the scythe and thick-leaved grove of the sugar-maple and the birch benson be a small but rather neat little village with three white church all of which appear to be newly build the surrounding country be chiefly fit for the grazing of flock whose fleece however just at present hardly pay for the shear letter xvii a excursion to vermont and new hampshire keene new hampshire _ July _ 13 1843 i resume my journey where i stop short in my last namely on reach benson in vermont among the highland west of lake champlain we go on through a pastoral country of the freshest verdure where we see large flock of sheep grazing from time to time we have glimpse of the summit of a long blue ridge of mountain to the east of we and now and then the more varied and airy peak of the mountain which lie to the west of the lake they tell I that of late year this part of the country have suffer much from the grasshopper and that last summer in particular these insect have make they appearance in immense army devour the plant of the ground and leave it bare of herbage they pass across the country say one person to I like hail storm ravage it in broad stripe with interval between in which they be less numerous at present however whether it be the long and severe winter which do not fairly end till the close of April or whether it be the uncommonly showery weather of the season hitherto that destroy these insect in some early stage of they existence i be tell that there be now scarce a grasshopper in all these meadow and pasture everywhere the herbage be uncommonly luxuriant and everywhere i see the turf thickly sprinkle with the blossom of the white clover on the hill in the valley among rock by stream by the road-side and whenever the thinner shade of the wood allow the plant of the field to take root we might say of the white clover with even more truth than montgomery say of the daisy : -- but this bold floweret climb the hill hide in the forest haunt the glen play on the margin of the rill peep o'er the fox 's den all with whom i speak have take notice of the uncommon abundance of the white clover this year and the idea seem to prevail that it have its regular period of appear and disappear -- remain in the field until it have take up its nutriment in the soil and then give place to other plant until they likewise have exhaust the quality of the soil by which they be nourished however this may be its appearance this season in such profusion throughout every part of the country which i have see be very remarkable all over the highland of vermont and new hampshire in they valley in the gorge of they mountain on the sandy bank of the connecticut the atmosphere for many a league be perfumed with the odor of its blossom i pass a few day in the valley of one of those stream of northern yermont which find they way into champlain if i be permit to draw aside the veil of private life i would briefly give you the singular and to I most interesting history of two maiden lady who dwell in this valley i would tell you how in they youthful day they take each other as companion for life and how this union no less sacred to they than the tie of marriage have subsist in uninterrupted harmony for forty year during which they have share each other 's occupation and pleasure and work of charity while in health and watch over each other tenderly in sicknesss for sickness have make long and frequent visit to they dwelling i could tell you how they sleep on the same pillow and have a common purse and adopt each other 's relation and how one of they more enterprising and spirited in she temper than the other might be say to represent the male head of the family and take upon herself they transaction with the world without until at length she health fail and she be tend by she gentle companion as a fond wife attend she invalid husband i would tell you of they dwelling encircle with rose which now in the day of they broken health bloom wild without they tendance and i would speak of the friendly attention which they neighbor people of kind heart and simple manners seem to take pleasure in bestow upon they but i have already say more than i fear they will forgive I for if this should ever meet they eye and i must leave the subject one day i have take a walk with a farmer of the place over he extensive and luxuriant pasture and be return by the road when a well-made young fellow in a cap with thick curly hair carry he coat on he arm wear a red sash round he waist and walk at a brisk pace overtake we etes-vous canadien -- be you a canadian say my companion un peu -- a little -- be the dry answer where be you go ask the farmer again in english to middlebury reply he and immediately climb a fence and strike across a field to save a angle in the road as if perfectly familiar with the country these canadian french say the farmer come swarm upon we in the summer when we be about to begin the hay-harvest and of late year they be more numerous than formerly every farmer here have he french laborer at this season and some two or three they be hardy and capable of long and severe labor but many of they do not understand a word of we language and they be not so much to be rely upon as we own countryman they therefore receive lower wages what do you pay they eight dollar a month be the common rate when they leave you service they make up they pack and bring they for you inspection that you may see that they have take nothing which do not belong to they i have hear of theft commit by some of they for i do not suppose that the best of the canadian leave they home for work but i have always decline to examine they baggage when they quit my house a shower drive we to take shelter in a farm-house by the road the family speak with great sympathy of john a young french canadian a gentlemanly young fellow they call he who have be much in they family and who have just come from the north look quite ill he have be in they service every summer since he be a boy at the approach of the warm weather he annually make he appearance in rag and in autumn he be dismiss a sprucely-dressed lad for he home on Sunday as i go to church i see company of these young frenchman in the shade of barn or pass along the road fellow of small but active person with thick lock and a lively physiognomy the french have become so numerous in that region that for they and the irish a roman catholic church have be erect in middlebury which you know be not a very large village on Monday morning we take the stage-coach at middlebury for this place a old quaker in a broad-brimmed hat and a coat of the ancient cut shaped somewhat like the upper shell of the tortoise come to hand in he granddaughter a middle-aged woman whom he have that morning accompany from lincoln a place about eighteen mile distant where there be a quaker neighborhood and a quaker meeting-house the denomination of quaker seem to be die out in the united state like the indian race not that the family become extinct but pass into other denomination it be very common to meet with neighborhood formerly inhabit by quaker in which there be not a trace of they leave not far from middlebury be a village on a fine stream call quaker village with not a quaker in it everywhere they be lay aside they peculiarity of costume and in many instance also they peculiarity of speech which be barbarous enough as they actually exist though if they would but speak with grammatical propriety they form of discourse be as commodious as venerable and i would be content to see they generally adopt i hope they will be slow to lay aside they better characteristic : they abhorrence of violence and the peaceful and wholesome subjection in which of all religious denomination they seem to have best succeed in hold the passion in such remote and secluded neighborhood as lincoln they sect will probably make the longest stand against the encroachment of the world i perceive however that the old gentleman 's son who be with he and as i learn be also a quaker have nothing peculiar in he garb before sunset we be in sight of those magnificent mountain summit the pico killington peak and shrewsbury peak rise in a deep ultra-marine blue among the cloud that roll about they for the day be showery we be set down at rutland where we pass the night and the next morning cross the mountain by the pass of clarendon and shrewsbury the cloud be cling to the summit and we travel under a curtain of mist uphold on each side by mountain-wall a young woman of uncommon beauty whose forefinger on the right hand be dot all over with puncture of the needle and who be probably a mantua-maker take a seat in the coach for a short distance we make some inquiry about the country but receive very brief though good-natured answer for the young lady be a confirm stammerer i thought of a epigram i have somewhere read in which the poet compliment a lady who have this defect by say that the word which she wish to utter be reluctant to leave so beautiful a mouth and linger long about the pearly tooth and rosy lip we pass through a tract cover with loose stone and the quaker 's granddaughter who prove to be a chatty person tell we a story which you may possibly have hear before where do you get all the stone with which you have make these substantial fence say a visitor to he host on whose grounds there appear no lack of such material look about you in the field and you will see be the answer i have look rejoin the questioner and do not perceive where a single stone be miss and that be what have puzzle I soon after reach the highest elevation on the road we enter the state of new hampshire we way lead we into a long valley form by a stream sometimes contract between rough woody mountain and sometimes spread out for a short distance into pleasant meadow and we follow its gradual descent until we reach the border of the connecticut we cross this beautiful river at bellows fall where a neat and thriving village have its seat among craggy mountain which at a little distance seem to impend over it here the connecticut struggle and foam through a narrow passage of black rock span by a bridge i believe this be the place speak of in peter 's history of connecticut where he relate that the water of the river be so compress in its passage between rock that a iron bar can not be drive into it a few mile below we enter the village of walpole pleasantly situate on the knoll to the east of the meadow which border the river walpole be once a place of some literary note as the residence of dennie who forty year since or more before he become the editor of the port folio here publish the farmer 's museum a weekly sheet the literary department of which be amply and entertainingly fill keene which end we journey in the stage-coach be a flourish village on the rich meadow of the ashuelot with hill at a moderate distance swell upward on all side it be a village after the new england pattern and a beautiful specimen of its kind -- broad street plant with rock-maple and elm neat white house white paling and shrub in the front inclosure during this visit to new hampshire i find myself in a hilly and rocky region to the east of this place and in sight of the summit of monadnock which at no great distance from where i be begin to upheave its huge dark mass above the surrounding country i arrive late in the evening at a dwelling the door of which be open to I by two damsel all health and smile in the morning i see a third sister of the same florid bloom and healthful proportion they be none of those slight frail figure copy of the monthly plate of fashion with waist of artificial slenderness which almost force you to wonder how the different part of the body be keep together -- no pallid face nor narrow chest nor lean hand but form which might have satisfy a ancient statuary with a well-formed bust face glowing with health round arm and plump finger they be such woman in short as we mother fifty year ago might have be i have not observe any particular appearance of health in the female of the country through which i have pass on the contrary i have be disappoint in they general pallidness and look of debility i inquire of my host if there be any cause to which this difference could be trace i have no doubt of the cause reply he these girl be healthy because i have avoid three great error they have neither be bring up on unwholesome diet nor subject to unwholesome mode of dress nor keep from daily exercise in the open air they have never drunk tea or coffee nor live upon any other than plain and simple food they dress -- you know that even the pressure of the easiest costume impede the play of the lung somewhat -- they dress have never be so tight as to hinder free respiration and the proper expansion of the chest finally they have take exercise every day in the open air assist I in tend my fruit tree and in those other rural occupation in which they sex may best take part they parent have never enjoy very good health nor be the child particularly robust in they infancy yet by a rational physical education they have be make such as you see they i take much pleasure in wander through the wood in this region where the stem of the primeval forest still stand -- straight trunk of the beech the maple the ash and the linden tower to a vast height the hollow be traverse by clear rapid brook the mowing field at that time be full of strawberry of large size and admirable flavor which you could scarce avoid crush by dozen as you walk i would gladly have linger during a few more of these glorious summer day in this wild country but my engagement do not permit it and here i be about to take the stage-coach for worcester and the western railroad letter xviii liverpool -- manchester manchester england _ may _ 30 1845 i suppose a smoother passage be never make across the atlantic than ours in the good ship liverpool for two-third of the way we slide along over a placid sea before the gentlest zephyr that ever sweep the ocean and when at length the wind become contrary they only impede we progress without make it unpleasant the liverpool be one of the strongest safest and steadiest of the packet-ship she commander prudent skillful always on the watch and as it almost seem to I in every part of the vessel at once the passenger be good-tempered and quiet like the sea on which we be sail and with all these advantage in we favor i be not dispose to repine that we be a week longer in cross the atlantic than some vessel which leave new york nearly the same time it be matter of rejoice to all of we however when we see the irish coast like a faint cloud upon the horizon and still more be we delight when after beat about for several day in what be call the chop of the channel we behold the mountain of wale i could hardly believe that what i saw be actually mountain summit so dimly be they outline define in the vapory atmosphere of this region the nearer and lower steep only be fully visible and the higher and remoter one half lose in the haze it seem to I as if i be look at the reflection of mountain in a dull mirror and i be ready to take out my pocket-handkerchief to wipe the dust and smoke from its surface about thirty mile from liverpool we take on board a pilot whose fair complexion unbronzed by the sun be remark by the lady and soon after a steamer arrive and take we in tow at twelve o'clock in the night the liverpool by the aid of the high tide clear the sand-bar at the mouth of the port and be drag into the dock and the next morning when i awake i find myself in liverpool in the midst of fog and rain liverpool say one of its inhabitant to I be more like a american than a english city it be new bustling and prosperous i see some evidence of this after i have get my baggage through the custom-house which be attend with considerable delay the officer prying very closely into the contents of certain package which i be take for friend of mine to they friend in england cut the packthread break the seal and tear the wrapper without mercy i see the street crowd with huge dray carry merchandise to and fro and admire the solid construction of the dock in which lay thousand of vessel from all part of the globe the wall of these dock be build of large block of red sandstone with broad gateway open to the river mersey and when the tide be at its height which i believe be about thirty foot from low water the gate be open and vessel allow to enter and depart when the tide begin to retire the gate be close and the water and the vessel lock in together along the river for mile the bank be flank with this massive masonry which in some place i should judge to be nearly forty foot in height meantime the town be spread into the interior new street be open in one field you may see the brickmaker occupy in they call and in the opposite one the bricklayer build row of house new church and new public building of various kind be go up in these neighborhood the street which contain the shop have for the most part a gay and showy appearance the building be generally of stucco and show more of architectural decoration than in we city the greater part of the house however be build of brick which have a rough surface and soon acquire in this climate a dark color give a gloomy aspect to the street the public building which be rather numerous be of a drab-colored freestone and those which have be build for forty or fifty year the town hall for example and some of the church appear almost of a sooty hue i go through the room of the town hall and be show the statue of canning by chantry a impressive work as it seem to I one of the room contain a portrait of he by lawrence look very much like a feeble old gentleman whom i remember as not long since a appraiser in the new york custom-house we be show a lofty saloon in which the common council of liverpool enjoy they dinner and very good dinner the woman who show we the room assure we they be but the spirit of corporation reform have break in upon the old order of thing and those good dinner which a year or two since be eat weekly be now eat but once a fortnight and money be save i stroll to

bottom it be overlook by a little chapel you enter it by a arched passage cut through the living rock which bring you by a steep descent to the narrow level of which i have speak where you find yourself among grave set with flower and half conceal by shrubbery while along the rocky side of the hollow in which you stand you see tomb or blank arch for tomb which be yet to be excavate we find the thicket within and around this valley of the dead musical with innumerable bird which build here undisturbed among the monument be one erect to huskisson a mausoleum with a glass door through which you see he statue from the chisel of gibson on return by the passage through the rock we find preparation make for a funeral service in the chapel which we enter four man come staggering in under the weight of a huge coffin accompany by a clergyman of impose stature white hair and florid complexion four other coffin be soon after bring in and place in the church attend by another clergyman of less pre-possessing appearance who to my disappointment read the service he do it in the most detestable manner with much grimace and with the addition of a supernumerary syllable after almost every word end with a consonant the clerk deliver the response in such a mumble tone and with so much of the lancashire dialect as to be almost unintelligible the other clergyman look i think as if like myself he be sorry to hear the beautiful funeral service of he church so profaned in a drive which we take into the country we have occasion to admire the much talk of verdure and ornamental cultivation of england green hedge rich field of grass sprinkle with flower beautiful residence be on every side and the wheel of we carriage roll over the smoothest road in the world the lawn before the house be keep smoothly shaven and carefully level by the roller at one of these english house to which i be admit by the hospitality of its opulent owner i admire the variety of shrub

view of make it a place for private residence it have a pretty little lake plantation of tree and shrub which have just begin to strike root pleasant nook and hollow eminence which command extensive view and the whole be traverse with road which be never allow to proceed from place to place in a straight line the tree be too newly plant to allow I to call the place beautiful but within a few year it will be eminently so i have follow the usual practice of traveller in visit the ancient town of chester one of the old walled town of england distant about fifteen mile from liverpool -- ramble through the long gallery open to the street above the ground-story of the house enter its crumble old church of red freestone one of which be the church of st john of norman architecture with round arch and low massive pillar and look at the grotesque old carving represent event in scripture history which ornament some of the house in watergate-street the wall be say to have be erect as early as the time of william the conqueror and here and there be tower rise above they they be still keep in repair and afford a walk from which you enjoy a prospect of the surrounding country but no ancient monument be allow to stand in the way of modern improvement as they be call and i find workman at one corner tumble down the stone and digging up the foundation to let in a railway the river dee wind pleasantly at the foot of the city wall i be amuse by a instance of the english fondness for hedge which i saw here in a large green field a hawthorn hedge be plant all along the city wall as if

the coach be a ruddy round-faced man in a box-coat and a huge woollen cravat walk about and occasionally give a look at the porter whom we take to be the coachman so well do he appearance agree with the description usually give of that class we be not mistake for in a short time we see he button he coat and deliberately disentangle the lash from the handle of a long coach whip we take we seat with he on the outside of the coach and be roll along smoothly through a level country of farm and hedge-row and field yellow with buttercup until at the distance of seven mile we reach stockport another populous manufacturing town lie in the smoke of its tall chimney at nearly the same distance beyond stockport the country begin to swell into hill divide by brook and valley and the hedge-row

the peak we procure here a odd vehicle call a car with seat on the side where the passenger sit face each other as in a omnibus to take we to edale one of the valley of derbyshire we new acquaintance who be about to proceed on foot to one of the neighbor village be persuade to take a seat with we as far as he road be the same with ours we climb out of the valley up the bare green hill and here we driver who be from cheshire and whose mode of speak english make he unintelligible to we point to a house on a distant road and make a attempt to communicate something which he appear to think interesting we derbyshire friend translate he the water say he that fall on one side of the roof of that ` ouse go into the ` umber and the water that fall on the other side go into the mersey last winter that ` ouse be cover owre wus ' snow and they make a _ h_archway to go in and out we ` ad a _ h_eighteen month 's storm last winter by a eighteen month 's storm we learn on inquiry that he mean eighteen week of continued cold weather the last winter have be remarkable for its severity we kind interpreter now leave we and take he way across the field down a path which lead through a chasm between high tower-like rock call the winnet which etymoloist say be a corruption of windgate a name give to this mountain-pass from the current of air which be always blow through it turn out of the main road we begin to ascend a steep green declivity to the right of we rise a peaked summit the name of which we driver tell we be mam tor we leave the vehicle and climb to its top where a wide and beautiful prospect be out-spread before we to the north lay edale a deep and almost circular valley surround by a wavy outline of pastoral hill bare of tree but clothe in live green to they summit except on the northern side of the valley where half-way down they be black with a thick growth of heath at the bottom of the valley wind a little stream with a fringe of tree some of which on account of the lateness of the season be not yet in leaf and near this stream be scatter for the most part the habitation in another direction lay the valley of hopedale with its two village hope and castleton its ancient castle of the peveril seat on a rock over the entrance of the peak cavern and its lead mine work ever since the time of the saxon the odin mine as they be call the white cinder of which lay in heap at they entrance we leave the driver to take we baggage to its destination and pursue we way across the field descend a little distance from the summit we come upon what appear to be a ancient trench thickly overgrow with grass which seem to encircle the upper part of the hill it be a roman circumvallation the grass be gemm with wild pansy yellow freak with jet and fragrant some of which we gather for a memorial of the spot in descend to the valley we come upon a little rivulet among hazel and holly and young oak as wild and merry as a mountain brook of we own country cowslip and wild hyacinth be in flower upon its bank and blue violet as scentless as we own we follow it until it fall into the larger stream when we cross a bridge and arrive at a white house among tree just put out they leaf with plot of flower in the lawn before it here we receive a cordial welcome from a hospitable and warmhearted scotchman after dinner we host take we up the side of the mountain which form the northern barrier of edale we walk through a wretched little village consist of low cottage build of stone one or two of which be alehouse pass the parsonage pleasantly situate on the edge of a little brook and then the parson himself a young man just from cambridge who be occupy in sketch one of the picturesque point in the scenery about he new habitation a few minute active climb bring we among the heath formm a thick elastic carpet under we foot on which we be glad to seat ourselves for a moment 's rest we hear the cuckoo upon every side and when we rise to pursue we walk we frequently startle the moor-fowl singly or in flock the time allow by the game law for shoot they have not yet arrive but in the mean time they have be unmercifully hunt by the hawk for we often find the remains of such as have be slay by these winged sportsman lie in we path as we ascend we find on the top of the hill a level of several rod in width cover to a considerable depth with peat the produce of the decayed root of the heath which have spring and perish for century it be now soft with the abundant rain which have fall and seam with deep muddy crack over which we make we way with difficulty at length we come to a spot from which we could look down into another valley that say we host be the woodland we look and see a green hollow among the hill like edale but still more bare of tree though like edale it have its little stream at the bottom the next day we cross the mam tor a second time on a visit to the derbyshire mine on we way i hear the lark for the first time the little bird so frequently name in english poetry rise singing from the grass almost perpendicularly until nearly lose to the sight in the cloud float away first in one direction then in another descend towards the earth arise again pour forth a perpetual uninterrupted stream of melody until at length after the space of somewhat more than a quarter of a hour he reach the ground and close he flight and he song together the cavern which contain the derbyshire spar of various kind have be the frequent theme of tourist and it be hardly worth while to describe they for the thousandth time imagine a fissure in the limestone rock descend obliquely five hundred foot into the bowels of the earth with a floor of fall fragment of rock and sand jagged wall which seem as if they would fit closely into each other if they could be bring together sheet in many place with a glittering calcareous deposit and gradually approach each other overhead -- imagine this and you will have a idea of the blue john mine into which we descend the fluor-spar take from this mine be of a rich blue color and be work into vase and cup which be extremely beautiful the entrance to the peak cavern as it be call be very grand a black opening of prodigious extent yawn in the midst of a precipice nearly three hundred foot in height and you proceed for several rod in this vast portico before the cave begin to contract to narrower dimension at a little distance from this open a fine stream rush rapidly from under the limestone and flow through the village above and almost impend over the precipice be the castle of the peveril the wall of which build of a kind of stone which retain the chisel mark make eight hundred year since be almost entire though the roof have long ago fall in and tree be grow in the corner here live the english nobleman say we friend when they be robber -- before they become gentleman the castle be three story in height and the space within its thick and strong wall be about twenty-five foot square these would be think narrow quarter by the present nobility the race of gentleman who have succeed to the race of robber the next day we attend the parish church the young clergyman give we a discourse on the subject of the trinity and a tolerably clever one though it be only sixteen minute long the congregation be a healthy though not a very intelligent look set of man and woman the derbyshire people have a say -- darbyshire bear and darbyshire breed strong o ' the yarm and weak o ' the yead the latter line translate into english would be -- strong of the arm and weak of the head and i be assure that like most proverb it have a good deal of truth in it the labor people of edale and its neighborhood so far as i could learn be not remarkable for good moral and indifferent or worse than indifferent to the education of they child they be however more fortunate in regard to the wages of they labor than in many other agricultural district a manufactory for prepare cotton thread for the lace-maker have be establish in edale and the woman and girl of the place who be employ in it be pay from seven to eight shilling a week the farm laborer receive from twelve to thirteen shilling a week which be a third more than be pay to the same class in some other county the people of the peak judge from the psalmody i hear at church be not without a ear for music i be at a funeral not long since say we host a young man bear deaf and dumb go mad and cut he throat the people come from far and near to the burial hot ale be hand about and drunk in silence and a candle stand on the table at which the company light they pipe the only sound to be hear be the passionate sobbing of the father at last the funeral service commence and the hymn be give out they set it to a tune in the minor key and i never hear any music perform in a manner more pathetic on Monday we leave edale and a beautiful drive we have along the bank of the derwent woody and rocky and wild enough in some place to be think a river of we own country of we visit to chatsworth the seat of the duke of devonshire one of the proudest of the modern english nobility and to haddon hall the finest specimen remain of the residence of they ancestor i will say nothing for these have already be describe till people be tire of read they we pass the night at matlock in sight of the rock call the high tor in the hot season it swarm with cockney and to gratify they taste the place beautiful as it be with precipice and wood have be spoil by mock ruin and fantastic name there be a piece of scene-painting for example place conspicuously among the tree on the hill-side represent a ancient tower and another represent a old church one place of retreat be call the romantic rock and another the lover 's walk to-day we arrive at derby and hasten to see its arboretum this be a inclosure of eleven acre give by the late mr josiah strutt to the town and beautifully lay out by london author of the work on rural architecture it be plant with every kind of tree and shrub which will grow in the open air of this climate and open to the public for a perpetual place of resort shall we never see a example of the like munificence in new york letter xx work of art london _ June _ 18 1845 i have now be in london a fortnight of course you will not expect I to give you what you will find in the guide-book and the picture of london the town be yet talk of a statue of a greek slave by we countryman power which be to be see a few day since at a print-shop in pall mall i go to look at it the statue represent a greek girl expose naked for sale in the slave-market she hand be fetter the drapery of she nation lie at she foot and she be shrink from the public gaze i look at it with surprise and delight i be dazzle with the soft fullness of the outline the grace of the attitude the noble yet sad expression of the countenance and the exquisite perfection of the workmanship i could not help acknowledge a certain literal truth in the expression of byron concern a beautiful statue that it -- fill the air around with beauty it have fix the reputation of power and make he fortune the possessor of the statue a mr grant have refuse to dispose of it except to a public institution the value which be set upon it may be infer from this circumstance that one of the richest nobleman in england tell the person who have charge of the statue that if mr grant would accept two thousand pound sterling for it he should be glad to send he a check for the amount some whisper of criticism have be utter but they appear to have be drown and silence in the general voice of involuntary admiration i hear that since the exhibition of the statue order have be send to power from england for work of sculpture which will keep he employ for year to come the exhibition of painting by the royal academy be now open i see nothing in it to astonish one who have visit the exhibition of we academy of the art of design in new york except that some of the worst picture be hang in the most conspicuous place this be the case with four or five picture by turner -- a great artist and a man of genius but who paint very strangely of late year to my unlearned eye they be mere blotch of white paint with streak of yellow and red and without any intelligible design to use a phrase very common in england they be the most extraordinary picture i ever see haydon also have spoil several yard of good canvas with a most hideous picture of uriel and satan and to this be assign one of the very best place in the collection there be more uniformity of style and coloring than with we more appearance of a attempt to conform to a certain general model so that of course there be fewer unpleasant contrast of manner : but this be no advantage inasmuch as it prevent the artist from seek to attain excellence in the way for which he be best fit the number of painting be far greater than in we exhibition but the proportion of good one be really far smaller there be some extremely clever thing by webster who appear to be a favorite with the public some fine miniature by thorburn a young scotch artist who have suddenly become eminent and several beautiful landscape by stanfield a artist of high promise we observe in the catalogue the name of three or four of we american artist but on look for they work we find they all hang so high as to be out of sight except one and that be in what be call the condemn room where only a glimmer of light enter and where the hang committee be in the practice of thrust any such picture as they can not help exhibit but wish to keep in the dark my english friend apologize for the wretchedness of the collection its row of indifferent portrait and its multitude of feeble imitation in historical and landscape painting by say that the more eminent artist be prepare themselves to paint the wall and ceiling of the new house of parliament in fresco the pinnacle and turret of that vast and magnificent structure build of a cream-colored stone and florid with gothic tracery copy from the ancient chapel of st stephen the greater part of which be not long ago destroy by fire be rise from day to day above the city roof we walk through its broad and long passage and look into its unfinished hall swarm with stone-cutter and mason and think that if half of they be to be paint in fresco the best artist of england have the work of year before they with the exhibition of drawing in water-color which be a separate affair from the painting in oil i be much better pleased the late improvement in this branch of art be i believe entirely due to english artist they have give to they drawing of this class a richness a force of effect a depth of shadow and strength of light and a truth of representation which astonish those who be accustom only to the meagreness and tenuity of the old manner i have hardly see any landscape which exceed in the perfectness of the illusion one or two which i saw in the collection i visit and i could hardly persuade myself that a flower-piece on which i look represent a bunch of hollyhock be not the real thing after all so crisp be the leaf so juicy the stalk and with such skillful relief be flower heap upon flower and leaf upon leaf letter xxi the park of london -- the police london _ June _ 24 1845 nothing can be more striking to one who be accustom to the little inclosure call public park in we american city than the spacious open grounds of london i doubt in fact whether any person fully comprehend they extent from any of the ordinary description of they until he have see they or try to walk over they you begin at the east end of st jame 's park and proceed along its graveled walk and its colonnade of old tree among its thicket of ornamental shrub carefully inclose its grass-plot maintain in perpetual freshness and verdure by the moist climate and the ever-dropping sky its artificial sheet of water cover with aquatic bird of the most beautiful species until you begin almost to wonder whether the park have a western extremity you reach it at last and proceed between the green field of constitution hill when you find yourself at the corner of hyde park a much more spacious pleasure-ground you proceed westward in hyde park until you be weary when you find yourself on the verge of kensington garden a vast extent of ancient wood and intervene lawn to which the eye see no limit and in whose walk it seem as if the whole population of london might lose itself north of hyde park after pass a few street you reach the great square of regent 's park where as you stand at one boundary the other be almost undistinguishable in the dull london atmosphere north of this park rise primrose hill a bare grassy eminence which i hear have be purchase for a public ground and will be plant with tree all round these immense inclosure press the densest population of the civilized world within such be they extent be a fresh and pure atmosphere and the odor of plant and flower and the twittering of innumerable bird more musical than those of we own wood which build and rear they young here and the hum of insect in the sunshine without be close and crowded street swarm with foot-passenger and choke with dray and carriage these park have be call the lung of london and so important be they regard to the public health and the happiness of the people that i believe a proposal to dispense with some part of they extent and cover it with street and house would be regard in much the same manner as a proposal to hang every tenth man in london they will probably remain public grounds as long as london have a existence the population of you city increase with such prodigious rapidity you sultry summer and the corrupt atmosphere generate in hot and crowded street make it a cause of regret that in lay out new york no preparation be make while it be yet practicable for a range of park and public garden along the central part of the island or elsewhere to remain perpetually for the refreshment and recreation of the citizen during the torrid heat of the warm season there be yet unoccupied land on the island which might i suppose be procure for the purpose and which on account of they rocky and uneven surface might be lay out into surpassingly beautiful pleasure-grounds but while we be discuss the subject the advance population of the city be sweep over they and cover they from we reach if we go out of the park into the street we find the cause of a corrupt atmosphere much more carefully remove than with we the street of london be always clean every day early in the morning they be sweep and some of they i believe at other hour also by a machine draw by one of the powerful dray-horse of this country whenever a unusually large and fine horse of this breed be produce in the country he be send to the london market and remarkable animal they be of a height and stature almost elephantine large-limbed slow-paced shaggy-footed sweep the ground with they fetlock each huge foot arm with a shoe weigh from five to six pound one of these strong creature be harness to a street-cleaning machine which consist of brush turn over a cylinder and sweep the dust of the street into a kind of box whether it be wet or dry dust or mud the work be thoroughly perform it be all draw into the receptacle provide for it and the huge horse stalk backward and forward along the street until it be almost as clean as a drawing-room i call the other day on a friend a american who tell I that he have that morning speak with he landlady about she carelessness in leave the shutter of she lower room unclosed during the night she answer that she never take the trouble to close they that so secure be the city from ordinary burglary under the arrangement of the new police that it be not worth the trouble the window of the parlor next to my sleeping-room open upon a rather low balcony over the street door and they be unprovided with any fastening which in new york we should think a great piece of negligence indeed i be tell that these night robbery be no longer practice except when the thief be assist by a accessary in the house all class of the people appear to be satisfy with the new police the officer be man of respectable appearance and respectable manners if i lose my way or stand in need of any local information i apply to a person in the uniform of a police officer they be sometimes more stupid in regard to these matter than there be any occasion for but it be one of the duty of they office to assist stranger with local information beg be repress by the new police regulation and want skulk in hole and corner and prefer its petition where it can not be overhear by man arm with the authority of the law there be a great deal of famine in london say a friend to I the other day but the police regulation drive it out of sight i be go through oxford-street lately when i see a elderly man of small stature poorly dress with a mahogany complexion walk slowly before I as i pass he he say in my ear with a hollow voice i be starve to death with hunger and these word and that hollow voice sound in my ear all day walk in hampstead heath a day or two since with a english friend we be accost by two laborer who be sit on a bank and who say that they have come to that neighborhood in search of employment in hay-making but have not be able to get either work or food my friend appear to distrust they story but in the evening as we be walk home we pass a company of some four or five laborer in frock with bludgeon in they hand who ask we for something to eat you see how it be gentleman say one of they we be hungry we have come for work and nobody will hire we we have have nothing to eat all day they tone be dissatisfied almost menacing and the englishman who be with we refer to it several time afterward with a expression of anxiety and alarm i hear it often remark here that the difference of condition between the poorer and the richer class become greater every day and what the end will be the wisest pretend not to foresee letter xxii edinburgh edinburgh _ July _ 17 1845 i have be often tell since i arrive in england that in edinburgh i should see the finest city i ever see i confess that i do not feel quite sure of this but it require scarcely more than a single look to show I that it be perfectly true it be hardly possible to imagine a nobler site for a town than that of edinburgh and it be build as nobly you stand on the edge of the deep gulf which separate the old and the new town and before you on the opposite bank rise the picturesque building of the ancient city -- pile deep and massy close and high look in they venerable and enduring aspect as if they be part of the steep bank on which they stand a original growth of the rock as if when the vast bed of stone crystallize from the water or cool from they fusion by fire they form themselves by some freak of nature into this fantastic resemblance of the habitation of man to the right you eye rest upon a crag crown with a grand old castle of the middle age on which guard be march to and fro and near you to the left rise the rocky summit of carlton hill with its monument of the great man of scotland behind you stretch the broad street of the new town overlook by massive structure build of the stone of the edinburgh quarry which have the look of palace street of palace and walk of slate form the new town not a house of brick or wood exist in edinburgh all be construct of the excellent and lasting stone which the earth supplies almost close to they foundation high and solid bridge of this material with broad arch connect the old town with the new and cross the deep ravine of the cowgate in the old town at the bottom of which you see a street between prodigiously high building swarm with the poorer population of edinburgh from almost any of the eminence of the town you see spread below you its magnificent bay the frith of forth with its rocky island and close to the old town rise the lofty summit of arthur 's seat and salisbury crag a solitary silent mountainous district without habitation or inclosure graze by flock of sheep to the west flow leith-water in its deep valley span by a noble bridge and the wind of this chilly climate that strike the stately building of the new town along the cliff that border this glen come from the very cloud beyond the frith lie the hill of fifeshire a glimpse of the blue grampian ridge be see where the frith contract in the northwest to a narrow channel and to the southwest lie the pentland hill whose spring supply edinburgh with water all around you be place the name of which be familiar name of history poetry and romance from this magnificence of nature and art the transition be painful to what i saw of the poorer population on Saturday evening i find myself at the market which be then hold in high-street and the netherbow just as you enter the canongate and where the old wooden effigy of john knox with stare black eye freshly paint every year stand in its pulpit and still seem preach to the crowd hither a throng of sickly-looking dirty people bring with they they unhealthy child have crawl from the narrow wynd or alley on each side of the street we enter several of these wynd and pass down one of they between house of vast height story pile upon story till we come to the deep hollow of the cowgate child be swarm in the way all of they breed in that close and impure atmosphere of a sickly appearance and the aspect of premature age in some of they which be carry in arm be absolutely frightful here be misery say a scotch gentleman who be my conductor i ask he how large a proportion of the people of edinbugh belong to that wretched and squalid class which i see before I more than half be he reply i will not vouch for the accuracy of he statistics of course he estimate be but a conjecture in the midst of this population be a house of refuge for the destitute establish by charitable individual for the relief of those who may be find in a state of absolute destitution of the necessaries of life here they be employ in menial service lodge and feed until they can be send to they friend or employment find for they we go over the build a spacious structure in the canongate of the plainest puritan architecture with wide low room which at the time of the union of scotland with england serve as the mansion of the duke of queensbury the accommodation of course be of the humblest kind we be show into the sewing-room be we see several healthy-looking young woman at work some of they barefoot such of the inmate as can afford it pay for they board from three and sixpence to five shilling a week besides they labor in this part of the city also be the night asylum for the houseless here those who find themselves without a shelter for the night be receive into a antechamber provide with bench where they first get a bowl of soup and be then introduce into a bathing-room where they be strip and scour they be next furnished with clean garment and accommodate with a lodging on a inclined plane of plank a little raise from the floor and divide into proper compartment by strip of board they own clothes be in the mean time wash and return to they when they leave the place it be a very different spectacle from the crowd in the Saturday evening market that meet my eye the next morning in the clean and beautiful street of the new town the throng of well-dressed church-goer pass each other in all direction the woman it appear to I be rather gaily dress and a large number of they prettier than i have see in some of the more southern city i attend worship in one of the free church as they be call in which dr candlish officiate in the course of he sermon he read long portion of a address from the general assembly of the free church of scotland appoint the follow Thursday as a day of fasting and prayer on account of the peculiar circumstance of the time and more especially the danger flow from the influence of popery allude to the grant of money lately make by parliament to the roman catholic college at maynooth the address propose no definite opposition but protest against the measure in general and as it seem to I rather vague term in the course of the address the title of national church be claim for the free church notwithstanding its separation from the government and the era of that separation be refer to in phrase similar to those in which we speak of we own declaration of national independence there be one or two allusion to the persecution which the free church have suffer and something be say about she child be hunt like partridge upon the mountain but it be clear that if she minister have be hunt they have be hunt into fine church and if persecute they have be persecute into comfortable living this free church as far as i can learn be extremely prosperous dr candlish be a fervid preacher and he church be crowd in the afternoon i attend at one of the church of the established or endowed presbyterian church where a quiet kind of a preacher hold forth and the congregation be thin this maynooth grant have occasion great dissatisfaction in england and scotland if the question have be leave to be decide by the public opinion of these part of the kingdom the grant would never have be make a immense majority of all class and almost all denomination disapprove of it a dissent clergyman of one of the evangelical persuasion as they be call say to I -- the dissenter claim nothing from the government they hold that it be not the business of the state to interfere in religious matter and they object to bestow the public money upon the seminary of any religious denomination in a conversation which i have with a eminent man of letter and a warm friend of the english church he say : the government be give offense to many who have hitherto be its firmest supporter there be no necessity for the maynooth grant the catholic would have be as well satisfy without it as they be with it for you see they be already clamor for the right to appoint through they bishop the professor in the new irish college the catholic be already establish they school and build they church with they own means : and this act of apply the money of the nation to the education of they priest be a gratuitous offense offer by the government to its best friend in a sermon which i hear from the dean of york in the magnificent old minster of that city he commend the liberality of the motive which have induce the government to make the grant but speak of the measure as one which the friend of the english church view with apprehension and anxiety they may dismiss they fear say a shrewd friend of mine with whom i be discuss the subject endowment be a cause of lukewarmness and weakness we presbyterian friend here instead of protest so vehemently against what sir robert peel have do should thank he for endow the catholic church for in do it he have deprive it of some part of its hold upon the mind of man there be much truth doubtless in this remark the support of religion to be effectual should depend upon individual zeal the history of the endowed chapel of dissent denomination in england be a curious example of this congregation have fall away and come to nothing and it be a general remark that nothing be so fatal to a sect as a liberal endowment which provide for the celebration of public worship without individual contribution letter xxiii the scottish lake glasgow _ July _ 19 1845 i must not leave scotland without write you another letter on the 17th of this month i embark at newhaven in the environs of edinburgh on board the little steamer prince albert for stirl on we way we see several sample of the newhaven fishwive a peculiar race distinguish by a costume of they own fresh-colored woman who walk the street of edinburgh with a large wicker-basket on they shoulder a short blue cloak of coarse cloth under the basket short blue petticoat thick blue stocking and a white cap i be tell that they be the descendant of a little flemish colony which long ago settle at newhaven and that they be celebrate for the readiness and point of they joke which like those of they sister of billingsgate be not always of the most delicate kind several of these have be relate to I but on run they over in my mind i find to my dismay that none of they will look well on paper the wit of the newhaven fishwife seem to I however like that of we western boatman to consist mainly in the ready application of quaint saying already current among themselves it be a wet day with occasional shower and sometimes a sprinkling of scotch mist i try the cabin but the air be too close the steamboat in this country have but one deck and that deck have no shelter so i be content to stand in the rain for the sake of the air and scenery after pass a island or two the frith which form the bay of edinburgh contract into the river forth we sweep by country seat one of which be point out as the residence of the late dugald stewart and another that of the earl of elgin the plunderer of the parthenon and castle tower and church some of they in ruin ever since the time of john knox and hill half see in the fog until we come opposite to the ochil mountain whose grand rocky buttress advance from the haze almost to the river here in the winding of the forth we steamer go many time backward and forward first towards the mountain and then towards the level country to the south in almost parallel course like the track of a ploughman in a field at length we pass a ruin tower and some fragment of massy wall which once form a part of cambus kenneth abbey seat on the rich land of the forth for the monk in great britain at least seem always to have choose for the site of they monastery the bank of a stream which would supply they with trout and salmon for friday we be now in the presence of the rocky hill of stirl with the town on its declivity and the ancient castle the residence of the former king of scotland on its summit we go up through the little town to the castle which be still keep in perfect order and the rampart of which frown as grimly over the surrounding country as they do century ago no troops however be now station here a few old gunner alone remain and major somebody i forget he name take he dinner in the banqueting-room and sleep in the bed-chamber of the stuart i wish i could communicate the impression which this castle and the surrounding region make upon I with its vestige of power and magnificence and its present silence and desertion the passage to the dungeon where pine the victim of state in the very build where the court hold its revel lie open and the chapel in which prince and princess be christen and worship and be crown and wed be turn into a armory from its window we be show within the inclosure of the castle a green knoll graze by cattle where the disloyal noble of scotland be behead close to the castle be a green field intersect with path which we be tell be the tilting-ground or place of tournament and beside it rise a rock where the lady of the court

now the scene of another and a unbloody warfare the warfare between the free church and the government church close to the church of the establishment at the foot of the rock of stirl the soldier of the free church have erect they place of worship and the sound of hammer from the unfinished interior could be hear almost up to the castle we take place the same day in the coach for callander in the highland in a short time we come into a country of hillock and pasture brown and barren half cover with fern the breckan of the scotch where the broom flower gaudily by the road-side and harebell now in bloom in little company be swing heavy with the rain on they slender stem cross the teith we find ourselves in doune a highland village just before enter which we pass a throng of strapping lass who have just finish they daily task at a manufactory on the teith and be return to they home between doune and callander we pass the wood of cambus-more full of broad beech which delight in the tenacious mountain soil of this district this be the seat of a friend of the scott family and here sir walter in he youth pass several summer and become familiar with the scene which he have so well describe in he lady of the lake at callander we halt for the night among a crowd of tourist scotch english american and german more numerous than the inn at which we stop could hold i go out into the street to get a look at the place but a genuine scotch mist cover I with water soon compel I to return i hear the people a well-limbed brawny race of man with red hair and beard talk to each other in gaelic and see through the fog only a glimpse of the side of the mountain and crag which surround the village the next morning be uncommonly bright and clear and we set out early for the trosach we now see that the village of callander lay under a dark crag on the bank of the teith wind pleasantly among its alder and overlook by the grand summit of benledus which rise to the height of three thousand foot a short time bring we to the stream which daughter of three mighty lake from vennachar in silver break and we skirt the lake for nearly its whole length loch vennachar lie between hill of comparatively gentle declivity pasture by flock and tuft with patch of the prickly gorse and coarse fern on its north bank lie lanrick mead a little grassy level where scott make the tribe of clan alpine assemble at the command of roderick dhu at a little distance from vennachar lie loch achray which we reach by a road wind among shrub and low tree birch and wild rose in blossom with which the air be fragrant cross a little stone bridge which we driver tell we be the bridge of turk we be on the edge of loch achray a little sheet of water surround by wild rocky hill with here and there a interval of level grassy margin or a grove beside the water turn from loch achray we reach a inn with a gaelic name which i have forget how to spell and which if i be to spell it you could not pronounce this be on the edge of the trosach and here we breakfast it be the fashion i believe for all tourist to pass through the trosach on foot the mob of traveller with whom i find myself on the occasion -- there be some twenty of they -- do so to a man even the lady who make about a third of the number walk the distance to loch katrine be about a mile and a half between lofty mountain along a glen fill with mass of rock which seem to have be shake by some convulsion of nature from the high steep on either side and in whose shelf and crevice time have plant a thick wood of the birch and ash but i will not describe the trosach after walter scott head what he say of they in the first canto of he poem loch katrine when we reach it be crisp into little wave by a fresh wind from the northwest and a boat with four brawny highlander be wait to convey we to the head of the lake we launch upon the dark deep water between craggy and shrubby steep the summit of which rise on every side of we and one of the rower a intelligent-looking man take upon himself the task of point out to we the place mention by the poet there say he as we recede from the shore be the spot in the trosach where fitz jame lose he gallant gray he then repeat in a sort of recitation dwelling strongly on the rhyme the line in the lady of the lake which relate that incident yonder be the island where douglass conceal he daughter under that broad oak whose bough almost dip into the water be the place where she skiff be moor on that rock cover with heath fitz jame stand and wind he bugle near it but out of sight be the silver strand where the skiff receive he on board further on he point out on the south side of the lake half way up among the rock of the mountain the place of the goblin cave and still beyond it the wild pass where birch wave of beal-a-nam-bo on the north shore the hill have a gentler slope and on they skirt which spread into something like a meadow we see a solitary dwelling in that say he rob roy be bear in about two hour we strong-armed rower have bring we to the head of the lake before we reach it we see the dark crest of ben lomond loftier than any of the mountain around we peer over the hill which form the southern rampart of loch katrine we land and proceed -- the man on foot and the woman on pony -- through a wild craggy valley overgrow with low shrub to inversnaid on loch lomond where a stream freshly swollen by rain tumble down a pretty cascade into the lake as we descend the steep bank we see a man and woman sit on the grass weave basket the woman as we pass stop she work to beg and the child chubby and ruddy come run after we with please give I a penny to buy a scone at iversnaid we embark in a steamboat which take we to the northern extremity of the lake where it narrow into a channel like a river here we stop to wait the arrival of a coach and in the mean time the passenger have a hour to wander in the grassy valley of glenfalloch close in by high mountain i hear the roar of mountain-stream and pass northward find myself in sight of two torrent one from the east and the other from the west side of the valley throw themselves foam and white from precipice to precipice till they water which be gather in the summit of the mountain reach the meadow and steal through the grass to mingle with those of the lake the coach at length arrive and we be again take on board the steamer and convey the whole length of loch lomond to its southern extremity we pass island after island one of which show among its thick tree the remains of a fortress erect in the day of feudal warfare and robbery and another be fill with deer towards the southern end of the lake the towering mountain peak beyond peak which overlook the lake subside into hill between which the stream call leven-water flow out through a rich and fertile valley coach be wait at balloch where we land to take we to dumbarton near the lake we pass a magnificent park in the midst of which stand a castle a veritable castle a spacious massive building of stone with a tower and battlements on which a flag be fly it belong to a dry-goods merchant in glasgow say the captain of the steamboat who be in the coach with we and the flag be put up by he boy the merchant be get finer seat than the nobility i be sorry to say that i have forget both the name of the merchant and that of he castle he be as i be tell a liberal as well as a opulent man have build a school-house in the neighborhood and being of the free church party be then engage in build a church near renton on the bank of the leven i see a little neighborhood embosome in old tree there say we captain smollet be bear a column have be erect to he memory in the town of renton which we see as we pass the fork rock on which stand dumbarton castle be now in sight overlook the clyde we be whirl into the town and in a few minute be on board a steamer which as evening set in land we at glasgow i must reserve what i have to tell of glasgow and ayrshire for yet another letter letter xxiv glasgow -- ayr -- alloway dublin _ July _ 24 1845 i promise another letter concern scotland but i have not time to write it until the irish channel lay between I and the scottish coast when we reach glasgow on the 18th of July the street be swarm with people i inquire the occasion and be tell that this be the annual fair the artizan be all out with they family and great number of country people be saunter about this fair be once what its name import a annual market for the sale of merchandise but it be now a mere holiday in which the principal sale as it appear to I be of gingerbread and whisky i stroll the next morning to the green a spacious open ground that stretch along the clyde one part of it be occupy with the booth and temporary theater and wagon of showman around and among which a vast throng be assemble who seem to delight in be deafen with the cry of the showman and the music of they instrument in one place a band be play in another a gong be thunder and from one of the balcony a fellow in regal robe and a pasteboard crown surround by several person of both sex in tawdry stage-dress who seem to have just get out of bed and be yawn and rub they eye be vociferate to the crowd in praise of the entertainment which be shortly to be offer they while not far off the stentor of a rival company under a flag which announce a new pantomime for a penny be declaim with equal vehemence i make my way with difficulty through the crowd to the ancient street call the salt market in which scott place the habitation of baillie jarvie it be obstruct with little stall where toy and other inconsiderable article be sell here at the corner of one of the street stand the old tower of the tolbooth where rob roy be confine a solid piece of ancient architecture the main building have be remove and a modern house supply its place the tower have be pierce below for a thoroughfare and its clock still report the time of day to the people of glasgow the crowd through which i pass have that squalid appearance which mark extreme poverty and uncertain means of subsistence and i be able to form some idea of the prodigious number of this class in a populous city of great britain like glasgow for populous she be and prosperous as a city increase with a rapidity almost equal to that of new york and already she number it be estimate three hundred thousand inhabitant of these it be say that full one-third be irish by birth or bear of irish parent the next day which be Sunday before go to church i walk towards the west part of the city where the street be broad and the house extremely well-built of the same noble material as the new town of edinburgh and many of the dwelling have fine garden they site in many place overlook the pleasant valley of the clyde and i could not help acknowledge that glasgow be not without claim to the epithet of beautiful which i should have deny she if i have form my judgment from the commercial street only the people of glasgow also have show they good sense in erect the statue which adorn they public square only to man who have some just claim to distinction here be no statue for example of the profligate charle ii or the worthless duke of york or the silly duke of cambridge as you will see in other city but here the marble effigy of walter scott look from a lofty column in the principal square and not far from it be that of the inventor watt while the statue erect to military man be to those who like wellington have acquire a just renown in arm the street be full of well-dressed person go to church the woman for the most part i must say far from beautiful i turn with the throng and follow it as far as st enoch 's church in buchanan-street where i hear a long discourse from a sensible preacher dr barr a minister of the established kirk of scotland in the afternoon i climb one of the steep street to the north of my hotel and find three place of worship build with considerable attention to architectural effect and fresh as it seem from the hand of the mason they all as i be tell belong to the free kirk which have lately be rent from the establishment and threaten to leave it a mere shadow of a church like the episcopal church in ireland nothing say a intelligent glasgow friend of mine can exceed the zeal of the friend of the free church one of we glasgow merchant have just give fifteen hundred pound towards the fund for provide _ manse _ or parsonage for the minister of that church and i know of several who have subscribe a thousand in all the college of scotland the professor be oblige by way of test to declare they attachment to the presbyterian church as by law establish parliament have just refuse to repeal this test and the friend of the free church be determine to find a college of they own twenty thousand pound have already be subscribe before the government refuse to dispense with this test and the project will now be support with more zeal than ever i go into one of these free church and listen to a sermon from dr lindsay a comfortable-looking professor in some new theological school it be quite common-place though not so long as the scotch minister be in the habit of give for excessive brevity be by no means they besetting infirmity at the close of the exercise he announce that a third service would be hold in the evening the subject continue he will be the thought and exercise of jonah in the whale 's belly in return to my hotel i pass by another new church with a uncommonly beautiful steeple and elaborate carving i inquire its name it be the new st john 's and be another of the building of the free church on Monday we make a excursion to the birthplace of burn the railway between glasgow and ayr take we through paisley worthy of note as have produce we eminent ornithologist alexander wilson and along the bank of castle semple loch full of swan a beautiful sheet of water sleeping among green field which shelve gently to its edge we pass by irvine where burn learn the art of dress flax and traverse a sandy tract close to the sea be set down at ayr near the new bridge you recollect burn 's dialogue between the auld brig of ayr and the new in which the former predict that vain as she rival might be of she new and fresh appearance the time would shortly come when she would be as much dilapidated as herself the prediction be fulfil the bridge have begin to give way and workman be busy in repair its arch we follow a pleasant road sometimes agreeably shaded by tree to alloway as we go out of ayr we hear a great hammering and clicking of chisel and look to the right we see workman busy in build another of the free church with considerable elaborateness of architecture in the early norman style the day be very fine the sun bright and the sky above we perfectly clear but as be generally the case in this country with a east wind the atmosphere be thick with a kind of dry haze which veil distant object from the sight the sea be to we right but we could not discern where it end and the horizon begin and the mountain of the island of arran and the lone and lofty rock of ailsa craig look at first like faint shadow in the thick air and be soon altogether undistinguishable we come at length to the little old paint kirk of alloway in the midst of a bury ground roofless but with gable-end still stand and its interior occupy by tomb a solid upright marble slab before the church mark the place where william burn the father of the poet lie bury a little distance beyond flow the doon under the old bridge cross by tam o'shanter on the night of he adventure with the witch this little stream well deserve the epithet of bonnie which burn have give it its clear but dark current flow rapidly between bank often shaded with ash alder and other tree and sometimes overhang by precipice of a reddish-colored rock a little below the bridge it fall into the sea but the tide come not up to embitter its water from the west bank of the stream the land rise to hill of considerable height with a heathy summit and wooded slope call brown carrick hill two high cliff near it impend over the sea which be commonly call the head of ayr and not far from these stand a fragment of a ancient castle i have sometimes wonder that bear as burn be in the neighborhood of the sea which i be tell be often swell into prodigious wave by the strong west wind that beat on this coast he should yet have take little if any of he poetic imagery from the ocean either in its wilder or its gentler mood but he occupation be among the field and he thought be of those who dwell among they and he imagination never wander where he feeling go not the monument erect to burn near the bridge be a ostentatious thing with a gilt tripod on its summit i be only interested to see some of the relic of burn which it contain among which be the bible give by he to he highland mary a road from the monument lead along the stream among the tree to a mill at a little distance above the bridge where the water pass under steep rock and i follow it the wild rose and the woodbine be in full bloom in the hedge and these to I be a better memorial of burn than any thing which the chisel could execute a barefoot lassie come down the grassy bank among the tree with a pail and after wash she foot in the swift current fill the pail and bear it again over the bank we see many visitor saunter about the bridge or enter the monument some of they seem to be country people -- young man with they sister and sweetheart and other in white cravat with a certain sleekness of appearance i take to be of the profession of divinity at the inn beside the doon a young woman with a face and head so round as almost to form a perfect globe give we a dish of excellent strawberry and cream and we set off for the house in which burn be bear it be a clay-built cottage of the humblest class and now serve with the addition of two new room of a better architecture for a ale-house mr hasting the landlady show we the register in which we remark that a very great number of the visitor have take the pain to write themselves down as shoemaker major burn one of the son of the poet have lately visit the place with he two daughter and a younger brother and they have inscribe they name in the book we return to ayr by a different road from that by which we go to alloway the haymaker be at work in the field and the vegetation be everywhere in its highest luxuriance you may smile at the idea but i affirm that a potato field in great britain at this season be a prettier sight than a vineyard in italy in this climate the plant throw out a abundance of blossom pink and white and just now the potato field be as fine as so many flower garden we cross the old bridge of ayr which be yet in good preservation though carriage be not allow to pass over it look up the stream we see solitary slope and grove on its left bank and i fancy that i have in my eye the sequestered spot on the bank of the ayr where burn and he highland mary hold the meeting describe in he letter and part to meet no more letter xxv ireland -- dublin dublin _ July _ 25 1845 we leave glasgow on the morning of the 22d and take the railway to ardrossan be soon at the beach one of those iron steamer which navigate the british water far inferior to we own in commodious and comfortable arrangement but strong and safe receive we on board and at ten o'clock we be on we way to belfast the coast of ayr with the cliff near the birthplace of burn continue long in sight we pass near the mountain of arran high and bare steep swell out of the sea which have a look of almost complete solitude and at length ailsa craig begin faintly to show itself high above the horizon through the thick atmosphere we pass this lonely rock about which flock of sea-bird the solan goose and the gannet on long white wing with jetty tip be continually wheeling and with a glass we could discern they sit by thousand on the shelf of the rock where they breed the upper part of ailsa above the cliff which reach more than half-way to the summit appear not to be destitute of soil for it be tinge with a faint verdure in about nine hour -- we be promise by a lie advertisement it should be six -- we have cross the channel over smooth water and be make we way between green shore almost without a tree up the bay at the bottom of which stand or rather lie for its site be low the town of belfast we have yet enough of daylight leave to explore a part at least of the city it look like albany say my companion and really the place bear some resemblance to the street of albany which be situate near the river nor be it without a appearance of commercial activity the people of belfast you know be of scotch origin with some infusion of the original race of ireland i hear english speak with a scotch accent but i be oblige to own that the severity of the scottish physiognomy have be soften by the migration and the mingling of breed i present one of my letter of introduction and meet with so cordial a reception that i could not but regret the necessity of leave belfast the next morning at a early hour the next day we be in we seat on the outside of the mail-coach we pass through a well-cultivated country intersperse with town which have a appearance of activity and thrift the dwelling of the cottager look more comfortable than those of the same class in scotland and we be strike with the good look of the people man and woman whom we pass in great number go to they work at length have traverse the county of down we enter lowth when a immediate change be visible we be among wretched and dirty hovel squalid-looking man and woman and ragged child -- the stature of the people seem dwarf by the poverty in which they have so long live and the jet-black hair and broad face which i see around I instead of the light hair and oval countenance so general a few mile back show I that i be among the pure celtic race shortly after enter the county of lowth and close on the confines of armagh perhaps partly within it we traverse near the village of jonesborough a valley full of the habitation of peat-digger its aspect be most remarkable the barren hill that inclose it be dark with heath and gorse and with ledge of brown rock and they lower declivity as well as the level of the valley black with peat which have be cut from the ground and lay in row the man be at work with spade cut it from the soil and the woman be press the water from the portion thus separate and expose it to the air to dry they dwelling be of the most wretched kind low windowless hovel no higher than the heap of peat with swarm of dirty child around they it be the property of peat earth to absorb a large quantity of water and to part with it slowly the spring therefore in a region abound with peat make no brook the water pass into the spongy soil and remain there form morass even on the slope of the hill as we pass out of this black valley we enter a kind of glen and the guard a man in a lace hat and scarlet coat point to the left and say there be a pretty place it be a beautiful park along a hill-side grove and lawn a broad domain jealously inclose by a thick and high wall beyond which we have through the tree a glimpse of a stately mansion we guard be a genuine irishman strongly resemble the late actor power in physiognomy with the very brogue which power sometimes give to he personage he be a man of pithy speech communicative and acquaint apparently with every body of every class whom we pass on the road besides he we have for fellow-passenger three very intelligent irishman on they way to dublin one of they be a tall handsome gentleman with dark hair and hazel eye and a rich south-irish brogue he be fond of he joke but next to he sit a graver personage in spectacles equally tall with fair hair and light-blue eye speak with a decide scotch accent by my side be a square-built fresh-colored personage who have travel in america and whose accent be almost english i think i could not be mistake in suppose they to be sample of the three different race by which ireland be people we now enter a fertile district meadow heavy with grass in which the haymaker be at work and field of wheat and barley as fine as i have ever see but the habitation of the peasantry have the same wretched look and they inmate the same appearance of poverty wherever the coach stop we be beset with swarm of beggar the wittiest beggar in the world and the raggedest except those of italy one or two green mound stand close to the road and we see other at a distance they be danish fort say the guard every thing we do not know the history of we put upon the dane add the south of ireland man these grassy mound which be from ten to twenty foot in height be now suppose to have be the burial place of the ancient celt the peasantry can with difficulty be persuade to open any of they on account of a prevalent superstition that it will bring bad luck a little before we arrive at drogheda i see a tower to the right apparently a hundred foot in height with a doorway at a great distance from the ground and a summit somewhat dilapidated that be one of the round tower of ireland concern which there be so much discussion say my english-looking fellow-traveller these round tower as the dublin antiquarian tell I be probably build by the early christian missionary from italy about the seventh century and be use as place of retreat and defense against the pagan not far from drogheda i see at a distance a quiet-looking valley that say the english-looking passenger be the valley of the boyne and in that spot be fight the famous battle of the boyne which the irish be fight about yet in america add the south of ireland man they point out near the spot a cluster of tree on a eminence where jame behold the defeat of he follower we cross the boyne enter drogheda dismount among a crowd of beggar take we place in the most elegant railway wagon we have ever see and in a hour be set down in dublin i will not weary you with a description of dublin score of traveller have say that its public building be magnificent and its row of private house in many of the street be so many range of palace score of traveller have say that if you pass out of these fine street into the ancient lane of the city you see mud-house that scarcely afford a shelter and be yet inhabit some of these say a dublin acquaintance to I which be now roofless and no longer keep out the weather yet show by they elaborate cornice and they elegant chimney-piece that the time have be and that not very long since when they be inhabit by the opulent class he lead I back of dublin castle to show I the house in which swift be bear it stand in a narrow dirty lane call holy 's court close to the well-built part of the town : its window be break out and its shutter fall to piece and the house on each side be in the same condition yet they be swarm with dirty and ragged inmate i have see no loftier nor more spacious dwelling than those which overlook st stephen 's green a noble park plant with tree under which the showery sky and mild temperature maintain a verdure all the year even in midwinter about merrion square another park the house have scarcely a less stately appearance and one of these with a strong broad balcony from which to address the people in the street be inhabit by o'connell the park of the university in the midst of the city be of great extent and the beautiful public grounds call phenix park have a circumference of eight mile do not suppose say a friend to I that these spacious house which you see about you be always furnish with a magnificence correspond to that of they exterior it be often the case that a few room only of these great range of apartment be provide with furniture and the rest leave empty and unoccupied the irishman of the higher class as well as of the humbler be naturally improvident generous fond of enjoy the moment and do not allow he income to accumulate either for the purpose of hoarding or the purpose of display i go into conciliation hall which resemble a new york lecture-room and be show the chair where the autocrat of ireland the liberator as they call he sit near the chairman at the repeal meeting conciliation hall be at that time silent for o'connell be make a journey through several of the western county i think of ireland for the purpose of address and encourage he follower i inquire of a intelligent dissenter what be the state of the public feeling in ireland with regard to the repeal question and whether the popularity of o'connell be still as great as ever as to o'connell he answer i do not know whether he influence be increase but i be certain that it be not decline with regard to the question of repeal the union there be a very strong lean among intelligent man in ireland to the scheme of a federal government in other word to the creation of a irish parliament for local legislation leave matter which concern ireland in common with the rest of the empire to be decide by the british parliament i mention a extraordinary declaration which i have hear make by john o'connell on the floor of parliament in answer to a speech of mr wyse a irish catholic member who support the new-college bill this younger o'connell denounce wyse as no catholic as a apostate from he religion for support the bill and declare that for himself after the catholic bishop of ireland have express they disapproval of the bill he inquire no further but feel himself bind as a faithful member of the catholic church to oppose it it be that declaration say the gentleman which have cause a panic among those of the irish protestant who be well-affected to the cause of repeal if the union should be repeal they fear that o'connell whose devotion to the catholic church appear to grow stronger and stronger and whose influence over the catholic population be almost without limit will so direct the legislation of the irish parliament as only to change the religious oppression that exist from one party to the other there be much greater liberality at present among the catholic than among they adversary in ireland but i can not say how much of it be owe to the oppression they endure the fact that o'connell have be backward to assist in any church reform in ireland have give occasion to the suspicion that he only desire to see the revenue and the legal authority of the episcopal church transfer to the catholic church if that should happen and if the principle avow by john o'connell should be the rule of legislation scarcely any body but a catholic will be able to live in ireland mr wall to whom we country be indebted for the hudson river portfolio and who reside in the united state for twenty-two year be here and be i should think quite successful in he profession some of he later landscape be superior to any of he production that i remember among they be a view on lough corrib in which the ruin castle on the island of that lake be a conspicuous object it be a oil painting and be a work of great merit the dublin art union make it they first purchase from the exhibition in which it appear mr wall remember america with much pleasure and nothing can exceed he kindness to such of the american as he meet in ireland he take we to the exhibition of the royal hibernian society among its picture be a portrait of a lady by burton in water-color most surprising for its perfection of execution and expression its strength of color and absolute nature burton be a native of dublin and be but twenty-five year old the irish connoisseur claim for he the praise of be the first artist in water-color in the world he paint with the left hand there be several other fine thing by he in the exhibition maclise another irish artist have a picture in the exhibition represent a dramatic author offer he piece to a actor the story be tell in gil bla it be a miracle of execution though it have the fault of hardness and too equal a distribution of light i have no time to speak more at large of this exhibition and my letter be already too long this afternoon we sail for liverpool letter xxvi

and ingenuity i put these quality together as necessary to each other mere humanity without tact and skill would fail deplorably the rude and coarse method of government which consist in severity be the most obvious one they suggest themselves to the dullest mind and cost nothing but bodily strength to put they in execution the gentler method require reflection knowledge and dexterity it be these which dr conolly apply with perfect success he have take great pain to make himself acquaint by personal observation with the treatment of the insane in different hospital not only in england but on the continent he find that to be the most efficacious which interfere least with they personal liberty and on this principle the truth of which a experience of several year have now confirm he found the system of treatment at hanwell we have letter to dr conolly with the kindness and gentleness of whose manners we be much strike he conduct we over the several ward of the asylum we find in it a thousand person of both sex not one of whom be in seclusion that be to say confine because it be dangerous to allow he to go at large nor be they subject to any apparent restraint whatever some be

enter one of the ward a girl of a earnest and determine aspect as soon as she see dr conolly begin to scream violently and spring towards he thrust aside the bystander by main force two of the female attendant come immediately up and strive to appease she hold she back without severity as a mother would restrain she infant i see they struggle with she for some time how they finally dispose of she i do not observe but she scream have cease before we leave the ward among the patient be one who we be tell be remarkable for he extravagant love of finery and whose cell be plaster over with glare

you room very fine here say the doctor yes say he smile and evidently delighted but my dear sir all be vanity -- all be vanity sir and vexation of spirit there be but one thing that we ought to strive for and that be the kingdom of heaven as there be no disputing this proposition we pass on to another cell at the door of which stand a tall erect personage who be busy with a pot of paint and a brush inscribe the pannel with motto and scrap of verse the wall of he room be cover with poetry and pithy sentence some of the latter appear to be of he own composition and be not badly turn they purport generally be this : that birth be but a trivial accident and that virtue and talent be the only true nobility this man be find wander about in chiswick full of a plan for educate the prince of wale in a manner to enable he to fill the throne with credit and usefulness as he name could not be learn the appellation of chiswick be give he which he have himself adopt style himself mr chiswick in he motto but always take care to put the name between inverted comma as we proceed a man rise from he seat and lay both hand on a table before he so as to display he finger ornament with ring make of black ribbon in which glass button be set for jewel address dr conolly with great respect formally set forth that he be in great want of a new coat for sunday the one he have on be positively unfit to appear in and that a better have be promise he the doctor stop inquire into the case and the poor fellow be gratify by the assurance that the promise coat should be speedily forthcoming in he progress through the ward dr conolly listen with great patience to the various complaint of the inmate one of they come up and tell we that he do not think the method of the institution judicious the patient say he be many of they grow worse one in particular who have be here for several week i can see be grow worse every day dr conolly ask the name of this patient -- i can not tell say the man but i can bring he to you bring he then say the doctor and after a moment 's absence he return lead up one of the healthiest and quietest look man in the ward he look better to be sure say the man but he be really worse a burst of laughter from the patient who stand by follow this say and one of they look at I knowingly touch he forehead to intimate that the objector be not exactly in he sens in one of the female ward we be introduce as gentleman from america to a respectable-looking old lady in black who sit with a crutch by she side be you not lawyer she ask and when we assure she that we be only yankee she rebuke we mildly for assume such a disguise when she know very well that we be a couple of attorney and you doctor she add i be surprise that you should have any thing to do with such a deception the doctor answer that he be very sorry she have so bad a opinion of he as she must be sensible that he have never say any thing to she which be not true ah doctor she rejoin but you be the

that event these poor people say she think that i be here on the same account as themselves when i be only here to prepare the way for the second come i be think please yer honor that it be quite time i be let out of this place say a voice as we enter one of the ward dr conolly tell I that he have several irish patient in the asylum and that they give he the most trouble on account of the hurry in which they be to be discharge we hear the same request eagerly make in the same brogue by various other patient of both sex as i leave this multitude of lunatic promiscuously gather from the poor and the reduce class comprise all variety of mental disease from idiocy to madness yet all of they hold in such admirable order by the law of kindness that to the casual observer most of they betray no symptom of insanity and of the rest many appear to be only very odd people quietly pursue they own harmless whim i could not but feel the highest veneration for the enlighten humanity by which the establishment be direct i consider also if the feeling of personal liberty the absence of physical restraint and the power of moral motive have such power to hold together in perfect peace and order even a promiscuous band of lunatic how much greater must be they influence over the mind of man in a state of sanity and on how false a foundation rest all the government of force the true basis of human polity appoint by god in we nature be the power of moral motive which be but another term for public opinion of the political controversy which at present agitate the country the corn-law question be that which call forth the most feel i mean on the part of those who oppose the restriction on the introduction of foreign grain -- for on the other side it appear to I that the battle be languidly fight nothing can exceed the enthusiasm of the adversary of the corn-law with some of they the repeal of the tax on bread be the remedy for all political evil free trade free trade be the burden of they conversation and although a friend of free trade myself to the last and uttermost limit i have be in circle in england in which i have a little too much of it yet this be a example to prove what a strong hold the question have take of the mind of man and how completely the thought of many be absorb by it against such a feeling as that which have be kindle in great britain on the corn-law question no law in we country could stand so far as i can judge it be spread as well as grow stronger i be tell that many of the farmer have become proselyte of the league the league be a powerful and prodigiously numerous association with ample and increase fund publish able tract support well-conducted journal and hold crowded public meeting which be address by some of the ablest speaker in the unite kingdom i attend one of these at covent garden stage pit box and gallery of that large building be fill with one of the most respectable-looking audience man and woman i have ever see among the speaker of the evening be cobden and fox cobden in physiognomy and appearance might almost pass for a american and have a certain new england sharpness and shrewdness in he way of deal with a subject he address be argumentative yet there be a certain popular clearness about it a fertility of familiar illustration and a earnest feeling which make it uncommonly impressive fox be one of the most fluent and ingenious speaker i ever hear in a popular assembly both be listen to by a audience which seem to hang on every word that fall from they lip the musical world here be talk about colman 's improvement in the piano i have see the instrument which the inventor bring out from america it be furnish with a row of brass reed like those of the instrument call the seraphine these take up the sound make by the string of the piano and prolong it to any degree which be desire it be a splicing of the sound of one instrument upon another yet if the invention be to be leave where it be in colman 's instrument it could not succeed with the public the note of the reed be too harsh and nasal and want the sweetness and mellowness of tone which belong to the string of the piano at present the invention be in the hand of mr rand the portrait painter a countryman of ours who be one of the most ingenious mechanician in the world he have improve the tone of the reed till they rival in softness and fullness those of the string and in fact can hardly be distinguish from they so that the sound of the two instrument run into one another without any apparent difference mr rand have contrived three or four different machine for make the reed with dispatch and precision and if the difficulty of keep the string which be undergo a constant relaxation in perfect unison with the reed can be overcome i see nothing to prevent the most complete and brilliant success letter xxvii change in paris paris _ August _ 9 1845 my last letter be date at london in my passage across england i have be nearly a fortnight in paris in ten year i find a considerable change in the external aspect of this great capital the street be cleaner in many of they sidewalk have be make not always the widest to be sure but smoothly floor with the asphaltum of seyssel which answer the purpose admirably the gutter have be remove from the middle of the street to the edge of the curbstone and lately the curbstone have be make to project over they so that the foot-passenger may escape the bespatter from carriage-wheel which he would otherwise be sure to get in a rainy day and there be many such day in this climate -- it have rain every day but one since i enter france new passage have be cut from street to street old street have be make wider new street have be make with broad sidewalk and stately row of house hew from the easily work cream-colored stone of the quarry of the seine the sidewalk of the boulevard and all the public square wherever carriage do not pass have be cover with this smooth asphaltic pavement and in the boulevard have be erect some magnificent building with richly carve pilaster and other ornament in relief and statue in niche and balcony support by stone bracket work into bunch of foliage new column and statue have be set up and new fountain pour out they water among these be the fountain of molière in the rue richelieu where the effigy of the comic author chisel from black marble with flow periwig and broad-skirted coat preside over a group of naked allegorical figure in white marble at whose foot the water be gush out in external morality also there be some improvement public gaming-house no longer exist and there be fewer of those uncleanly nuisance which offend against the code of what addison call the lesser moral the police have have order to suppress they on the boulevard and the public square the parisian be however the same gay people as ever and as easily amuse as when i see they last they crowd in as great number to the opera and the theater the boulevard though better pave be the same lively place the guingette be as throng the public garden be as full of dancer in these as at the new tivolus lately open at chateau rouge in the suburb a broad space make smooth for the purpose be leave between tent where the young grisette of pari marry and unmarried or in that equivocal state which lie somewhere between dance on Sunday evening till midnight at a earlier hour on the same day as well as on other day at old franconus 's hippodrome among the tree just beyond the triumphal arch of neuilly imitation of the steeple chase with female rider who leap over hedge and of the ancient chariot-race with charioteer helmeted and mail and standing in gilt tub on wheel be perform in a vast amphiteatre to a crowd that could scarcely have be contain in the colosseum of home i have hear since i come here two or three people lament the physical degeneracy of the parisian one of they quote a say from a report of marshal soult that the parisian recruit for the army of late year be neither man nor soldier this seem to imply a moral as well as a physical deterioration they be grow smaller and smaller in stature say the gentleman who make this quotation and it be difficult to find among they man who be of the proper height to serve as soldier the principal cause no doubt be in the prevail licentiousness among that class who make the greater part of the population of paris the woman of the finest person rarely become mother whatever may be the cause i witness a remarkable example of the smallness of the parisian stature on the day of my arrival which be the last of the three day keep in memory of the revolution of July i go immediately to the champ elysées to see the people engage in they amusement some twenty boy not fully grow as it seem to I at first be dancing and caper with great agility to the music of a instrument look at they nearer i see that those who have seem to I boy of fourteen or fifteen be mature young man some of they with very fierce mustach since my arrival i have see the picture which vanderlyn be paint for the rotunda at washington it represent the landing of columbus on the shore of the new world the great discoverer accompany by he lieutenant and other be represent as take possession of the newly find country some of the crew be see scramble for what they imagine to be gold dust in the sand of the shore and at a little distance among the tree be the naked native in attitude of wonder and worship the grouping be happy the expression and action skillfully vary -- the color so far as i could judge in the present state of the picture agreeable eight or ten week hard work say the artist will complete it it be vanderlyn 's intention to finish it and take it to the united state in the course of the autumn letter xxviii a journey through the netherland arnheim guelderland _ August _ 19 1848 after write my last i be early asleep that i might set out early the next morning in the diligence for brussels this i do and pass through compeigne where joan of arc be make prisoner -- a town lie in the midst of extensive forest with here and there a noble group of tree and through noyon where calvin be bear and in the old gothic church of which he doubtless worship and through cambray where fenelon live and through field of grain and poppy and clover where woman be at work reap the wheat or mowing and stack the ripe poppy or digging with spade in they wet clothes for it have rain every day but one during the thirteen we be in france we arrive in the afternoon of the second day at the french frontier from this a railway take we in a few hour to brussels imagine a rather clean-looking city of large light-colored building mostly cover with stucco situate on a irregular declivity with a shady park in the highest part surround by palace and a little lower down a fine old gothic cathedral and still lower down the old town hall also of gothic architecture and scarcely less venerable standing in a noble paved square around which be white and stately edifice build in the era of the spanish dominion -- imagine handsome shop and a good-looking people with a liberal sprinkling of priest in they long-skirted garment and throw in the usual proportion of dirt and misery and mendicancy in the corner and by-place and you have brussels before you it still rain but we get a tilbury and drive out to see the battle-ground of waterloo it be a dreary drive beside the wood of soigne and through a part of it -- that melancholy-looking forest of tall-stemmed beech -- beech beech nothing but beech -- and through the walloon village -- waterloo be one of they -- and through field where wet woman be at work and over road where dirty child by dozen be dabble like duck in the puddle at last we stop at the village of mont st jean whence we walk through the slippery mud to the mound erect in the midst of the battle-field and climb to its top overlook a country of gentle declivity and hollow here the various position of the french and ally army during the battle which decide the fate of a empire be point out to we by a young walloon who sell wine and dram in a shed beside the monument the two race which make up the population of belgium be still remarkably distinct notwithstanding the century which have elapse since they occupy the same country together the fleming of teutonic origin keep they blue eye and fair hair and they ancient language -- the same nearly as the dutch of the sixteenth century the walloon a celtic race or celtic mixed with roman be still know by they dark hair and black eye and speak a dialect derive from the latin resemble that of some of the french province both language be uncultivated and the french have be adopt as the language of commerce and literature in belgium if you would see a city wholly flemish in its character you should visit antwerp to which the railway take you in a hour and a half the population here be almost without walloon intermixture and there be little to remind you of what you have see in france except the french book in the bookseller ' window the art themselves have a character of they own which never come across the alp the church the interior of which be always carefully keep fresh with paint and gilding be crowd with statue in wood carve with wonderful skill and spirit by flemish artist in century go by -- oaken saint look down from pedestal and adam and eve in the remorse of they first transgression support by the help of the tree of knowledge and the serpent a curiously work pulpit the wall be hang with picture by the flemish master wherever space can be find for they in the cathedral be the descent from the cross by ruben which prove what one might almost doubt who have only see he picture in the louvre that he be a true artist and a man of genius in the noblest sense of the term we pass two night in antwerp and then go down the scheldt in a steamer which in ten hour bring we to rotterdam sometimes cross a arm of the sea and sometimes thread a broad canal the house on each side of these channel after we enter holland be for the most part freshly paint the flat plain on each side protect by embankment and streak by long wide ditch full of water and row of pollard willow windmill by score some grind corn but most of they pump water out of the meadow and pour it into the channel stand on the bank and be swing they long arm madly in a high wind on arrive at rotterdam you perceive at once that you be in holland the city have as many canal as street the canal be generally overhang with row of elm and the street keep scrupulously clean with the water of the canal which be salt every morning there be a vigorous splashing and mop perform before every door by plump servant girl in white cap and thick wooden shoe we hotel stand front a broad sheet of water like the lagoon at venice where a solid and straight stone wharf be shaded with a row of elm and before we door lay several huge vessel fasten to the wharf which look as if they be send thither to enjoy a vacation for they be neither load nor unload nor do any person appear to be busy about they rotterdam be at that time in the midst of a fair which fill the open square and the wider street of the city with booth and attract crowd of people from the country there be damsel from north holland fair as snow and some of they pretty in long-eared lace cap with they plump arm bare and there be maiden from another province the name of which i do not learn equally good-looking with arm as bare and face in white muslin cap draw to a point on each cheek olycoek be frying and waffle bake in temporary kitchen on each side of the street the country about rotterdam be little better than a marsh the soil serve only for pasture and the field be still cover with yellow blossom as in the time of goldsmith and still tuft with willow i see house in the city standing in pool of dull blue water reach by a bridge from the street : i suppose however there might be garden behind they many of the house decline very much from the perpendicular they be however apparently well-built and be spacious we make no long stay in rotterdam but after look at its bronze statue of erasmus and its cathedral which be not remarkable in any other respect than that it be a gothic building of brick stone be scarce in holland we take the stage-coach for the hague the next day green meadow spot with buttercup and dandelion flat and low lower than the canal with which the country be intersect and which bring in between they at high tide the water of the distant sea stretch on every side they be strip with long line of water which be constantly pump out by the windmill and send with the ebb tide through the canal to the ocean herd of cattle be feed among the bright verdure from time to time we pass some pleasant country-seat the wall bright with paint and the grounds surround by a ditch call it a moat if you please the surface of which be green with duck-weed but within this watery inclosure be little artificial elevation cover with a closely-shaven turf and plantation of shrubbery and in the more extensive and ostentatious of they be what might be call grove and forest before one of these house be a fountain with figure mouth of lion and other animal gush profusely with water which must have be pump up for the purpose into a reservoir by one of the windmill pass through schiedam still famous for its gin and delft once famous for its crockery we reach in a couple of hour the hague the cleanest of city pave with yellow brick and as full of canal as rotterdam i call on a old acquaintance who receive I with a warm embrace and a kiss on each cheek he be in he morning-gown which he immediately exchange for a elegant frock coat of the latest parisian cut and take we to see baron vorstolk 's collection of picture which contain some beautiful thing by the flemish artist and next to the public collection call the museum from this we drive to the chateau du bois a residence of the dutch stadtholder two hundred year ago when holland be a republic and a powerful and formidable one it be pleasantly situate in the edge of a wood which be say to be part of a original forest of the country i could believe this for here the soil rise above the marshy level of holland and tree of various kind grow irregularly intermingle as in the natural wood of we own country the chateau du bois be principally remarkable for a large room with a dome the interior of which be cover with large painting by ruben jordaen and other artist we friend take leave of we and we drive out to schevele where charle ii embark for england when he return to take possession of he throne here dwell a people who supply the fish-market of the hague speak among themselves a dialect which be not understand elsewhere in holland and wear the same costume which they wear century ago we pass several of the woman go to market or return with large basket on they head place on the crown of a broad-brimmed straw bonnet tie at the side under the chin and strap creature they be stride along in they striped black and white petticoat in the street of scheveling i see the tallest woman i think i ever meet with a very giantess considerably more than six foot high straddle about the street of the little village and scour and scrub the pavement with great energy close at hand be the shore a strong west wind be drive the surge of the north sea against it a hundred fishing vessel rock in the surf moor and lash together with rope form a line along the beach the man of scheveling in knit woollen cap short blue jacket and short trowser of prodigious width be walk about on the shore but the wind be too high and the sea too wild for they to venture out along this coast the north sea have heap a high range of sand-hill which protect the low land within from its own inundation but to the north and south the shore be guard by embankment raise by the hand of man with great cost and watch and keep in constant repair we leave the hague and take the railway in a little more than two hour be at amsterdam a great commercial city in decay where nearly half of the inhabitant live on the charity of the rest the next morning be Sunday and take advantage of a interval of fair weather for it still continue to rain every day i go to the oudekerk or old church as the ancient cathedral be call which might have be a impressive building in its original construction but be now spoil by cross-beam paint gallery partition pew and every sort of architectural enormity but there be a noble organ with a massive and lofty front of white marble richly sculptured occupy the west end of the chancel i listen to a sermon in dutch the delivery of which owing partly to the disagreeable voice of the speaker and partly no doubt to my ignorance of the language seem to I a kind of bark the man all wear they hat during the service but half the woman be without bonnet when the sermon and prayer be over the rich tone of the organ break forth and flood the place with melody every body visit broek near amsterdam the pride of dutch village and to broek i go accordingly it stand like the rest among dyke and canal but consist altogether of the habitation of person in comfortable circumstance and be remarkable as you know for its scrupulous cleanliness the common street and footway be keep in the same order as the private garden-walk they be pave with yellow brick and as a fair be to open in the place that afternoon the most public part of they be sand for the occasion but elsewhere they appear as if just wash and mop i have never see any collection of human habitation so free from any thing offensive to the sens saardam where peter the great begin he apprenticeship as a shipwright be among the sight of holland and we go the next day to look at it this also be situate on a dyke and be a extremely neat little village but have not the same appearance of opulence in the dwelling we be show the chamber in which the emperor of russium lodge and the hole in the wall where he sleep for in the old dutch house as in the modern one of the farmer the bed be a sort of high closet or more properly speak a shelf within the wall from which a door open into the room i should have mention that in go to broek i stop to look at one of the farm-house of the country and at saardam i visit another they be dairy house in which the milk of large herd be make into butter the lower story of the dwelling pave with brick be use in winter as a stable for the cattle in the summer it be carefully cleanse and paint so that not a trace of its former use remain and it then become both the dairy and the abode of the family the story above be as neat as the hand of dutch housewife can make it the parlor the dining-room the little box in the wall which hold the bed be resplendent with cleanliness in go from amsterdam by railway to utrecht we perceive the canal by which the plain be intersect become fewer and fewer and finally we begin to see crop of grain and potato a sign that we have emerge from the marsh we stop to take a brief survey of utrecht a part of its old cathedral have be convert into a beautiful gothic church the rest have be level many year ago by a whirlwind but what i find most remarkable in the city be its public walk the old wall by which utrecht be once inclosed have be throw down the rubbish have form hillock and slope which almost surround the entire city and border one of its principal canal on these hillock and slope tree and shrub have be plant and walk lay out through the green turf until it have become one of the most varied and charming pleasure-grounds i ever see -- swell into little eminence sink into little valley descend in some place smoothly to the water and in other impend over it we fall in with a music-master of whom we ask a question or two he happen to know a little german by the help of which he piece out he dutch so as to make it tolerably intelligible to I he insist upon show we every thing remarkable in utrecht and finally walk we tire the same evening the diligence bring we to arnheim a neat-looking town with about eighteen hundred inhabitant in the province of guelderland where the region retain not a trace of the peculiarity of holland the country west of the town rise into command eminence overlook the noble rhine and i feel already that i be in germany though i have yet to cross the frontier letter xxix american artist abroad rome _ October _ 1845 you would perhaps like to hear what the american artist on the continent be do i meet with leutze at düsseldorf after a sojourn of some day in holland in which i be oblige to talk to the dutchman in german and get my answer in dutch with but a dim apprehension of each other 's meaning as you may suppose on both side after be smoke through and through like a herr with the fume of bad tobacco in the railway wagon and in the diligence which take we over the long and monotonous road on the plain of the rhine between arnheim and düsseldorf -- after dodge as well as we be able the english traveller generally the most disagreeable of the travel tribe who swarm along the rhine in the summer season it be a refreshment to stop a day at düsseldorf and take breath and meet a american face or two we find leutze engage upon a picture the subject of which be john knox reprove queen mary it promise to be a capital work the stern gravity of knox the embarrassment of the queen and the scorn with which the french damsel of she court regard the saucy reformer be extremely well express and tell the story impressively at düsseldorf which be the residence of so many eminent painter we expect to find some collection or at least some of the best specimen of the work of the modern german school it be not so however -- fine picture be paint at düsseldorf but they be immediately carry elsewhere we visit the studio of schröter -- a man with humor in every line of he face who have nothing to show we but a sketch just prepare for the easel of the scene in goëthe 's faust where mephistophile in auerbach 's cellar bore the edge of the table with a gimlet and a stream of champagne gush out köhler a eminent artist allow we to see a clever painting on he easel in a state of considerable forwardness represent the rejoicing of the hebrew maiden at the victory of david over goliath at lessing 's -- a painter whose name stand in the first rank and whom we do not find at home -- we see a sketch on which he be engage represent the burning of john huss yet it be but a sketch a painting in embryo but i be wander from the american artist at cologne whither we be accompany by leutze he procure we the sight of he picture of columbus before the council of salamanca one of he best leutze rank high in germany as a young man of promise devote himself with great energy and earnestness to he art at florence we find greenough just return from a year 's residence at graefenberg whence he have bring back he wife a patient of priessnitz and the water cure in florid health he be now apply himself to the completion of the group which he have engage to execute for the capitol at washington it represent a american settler a athletic man in a hunting shirt and cap a graceful garb by the way rescue a female and she infant from a savage who have just raise he tomahawk to murder they part of the group the hunter and the indian be already in marble and certainly the effect be wonderfully fine and noble the hunter have approach he enemy unexpectedly from behind and grasp both he arm hold they back in such a manner that he have no command of they muscle even for the purpose of free himself besides the particular incident represent by the group it may pass for a image of the aboriginal race of america overpower and render helpless by the civilized race greenough 's statue of washington be not as popular as it deserve to be but the work on which he be now engage i be very sure will meet with a different reception in a letter from london i speak of the beautiful figure of the greek slave by power at florence i saw in he studio the original model from which he workman be cut two copy in marble at the same place i see he proserpine a ideal bust of great sweetness and beauty the fair chest swell out from a circle of leaf of the acanthus about this also the workman be busy and i learn that seven copy of it have be recently order from the hand of the artist by its side stand the unfinished statue of eve with the fatal apple in she hand a earlier work which the world have just begin to admire i find that connoisseur be divide in opinion concern the merit of power as a sculptor all allow he the highest degree of skill in execution but some deny that he have show equal ability in he conception he be confessedly say one of they to I who however have not see he greek slave the greatest sculptor of bust in the world -- equal in fact to any that the world ever see the finest head of antiquity be not of a higher order than he he then go on to express he regret that power have not confine he labor to a department in which he be so pre-eminent i have hear that power who possess great mechanical skill have devise several method of he own for give precision and perfection to the execution of he work it may be that my unlearned eye be dazzle by this perfection but really i can not imagine any thing more beautiful of its kind than he statue of the greek slave gray be at this moment in florence though he be soon come to rome he have make some copy from titian one of which i see it be a madonna and child in which the original painting be render with all the fidelity of a mirror so indisputably be it a titian and so free from the stiffness of a copy that as i look at it i fully sympathize with the satisfaction express by the artist at have attain the method of give with ease the peculiarity of color which belong to titian 's picture a american landscape painter of high merit be g l brown now reside at florence he possess great knowledge of detail which he know how to keep in its place subdue it and render it subservient to the general effect i saw in he studio two or three picture in which i admire he skill in copy the various form of foliage and other object nor be i less pleased to see that he be not content with this sort of merit but in go back from the foreground have the art of pass into that appearance of a infinity of form and outline which the eye meet with in nature i could not help regret that one who copy nature so well should not prefer to represent she as she appear in we own fresh and glorious land instead of live in italy and painting italian landscape to refer again to foreign artist -- before i leave florence i visit the annual exhibition which have be open in the academy of the fine art there be one or two landscape remind I somewhat of cole 's manner but greatly inferior and one or two good portrait and two or three indifferent historical picture the rest appear to I decidedly bad wretched landscape portrait some of which be absolutely hideous stiff ill-colored and full of grimace here at rome we have a american sculptor of great ability henry k brown who be just begin to be talk about he be execute a statue of ruth gleaning in the field of boaz of which the model have be ready for some month and be also model a figure of rebecca at the well when i first see he ruth i be greatly strike with it but after visit the studio of wyatt and gibson and observe they sleek imitation of grecian art they learn and faultless statue nymph or goddess or god of the greek mythology it be with infinite pleasure that my eye rest again on the figure and face of ruth perhaps not inferior in perfection of form but certainly inform with a deep human feeling which i find not in they elaborate work the artist have choose the moment in which ruth be address by boaz as she stand among the gleaner he quote to I the line of keat on the song of the nightingale -- perchance the self-same song that find a path to the sad heart of ruth when sick for home she stand in tear amid the alien 's corn she be not in tear but she aspect be that of one who listen in sadness she eye be cast down and she thought be of the home of she youth in the land of moab over she left arm hang a handful of ear of wheat which she have gather from the ground and she right rest on the drapery about she bosom nothing can be more graceful than she attitude or more expressive of melancholy sweetness and modesty than she physiognomy one of the copy which the artist be execute -- there be two of they -- be design for a gentleman in albany brown will shortly or i be greatly mistaken achieve a high reputation among the sculptor of the time rosseter a american painter who have pass six year in italy be engage on a large picture the subject of which be take from the same portion of scripture history and which be intend for the gallery of a american gentleman it represent naomus with she two daughter-in-law when orpah kiss she but ruth cleave unto she the principal figure be those of the hebrew matron and ruth who have make they simple preparation for they journey to the land of israel while orpah be turn sorrowfully away to join a caravan of she country people this group be well compose and there be a fine effect of the ray of the rise sun on the mountain and rock of moab at the studio of lang a philadelphium artist i see two agreeable picture one of which represent a young woman whom she attendant and companion be array for she bridal as a companion piece to this but not yet finish he have upon the easel a picture of a beautiful girl deck for espousal of a different kind about to take the veil and kneel in the midst of a crowd of friend and priest while one of they be cut off she glossy and flowing hair both picture be design for a boston gentleman but a duplicate of the first have already be paint for the king of wirtemberg letter xxx buffalo -- cleveland -- detroit steamer oregon lake huron off thunder bay _ July _ 24 1846 as i approach the city of buffalo the other morning from the east i find myself oblige to confess that much of the beauty of a country be owe to the season for twenty or thirty mile before we reach lake erie the field of this fertile region look more and more arid and sun-scorched and i could not but contrast they appearance with that of the neighborhood of new york where in a district comparatively sterile a uncommonly showery season have keep the herbage fresh and deep and make the tree heavy with leaf here on the contrary i see meadow tinge by the drought with a reddish hue pasture graze to the root of the grass and tree spread what seem to I a meager shade yet the harvest of wheat and even of hay in western new york be say to be by no means scanty buffalo continue to extend on every side but the late addition to the city do not much improve its beauty its nucleus of well-built street do not seem to have grow much broader within the last five year but the suburb be rapidly spread -- small wooden house scatter or in cluster build hastily for emigrant along unpaved and powdery street i see however on a little excursion which i make into the surrounding country that pleasant little neighborhood be rise up at no great distance with they neat house they young tree and they new shrubbery they have a fine building material at buffalo -- a sort of brown stone easily work -- but i be sorry to see that most of the house build of it both in the town and country seem to have stand for several year we visit the new fort which the government be erect on the lake a little to the north of the town command the entrance of niagara river it be small but of wonderful apparent strength with wall of prodigious thickness and so sturdy in its defence that it seem to I one might as well think of cannonade the cliff of weehawken it be curious to see how as we grow more ingenious in the means of attack we devise more effectual means of defense a castle of the middle age in which a grim warrior of that time would hold he enemy at bay for year would now be batter down before breakfast the finest old fort of the last century be now find to be unsafe against attack that which we have at st augustine be a uncommonly good sample of its kind but when i be in florida three or four year since a engineer of the united state be engage in reconstruct it do mankind gain any thing by these improvement as they be call in the art of war do not these more dreadful engine of attack on the one side and these more perfect means of protection on the other leave the balance just where it be before on Tuesday evening at seven o'clock we take passage in the steamer oregon for chicago and soon lose sight of the roof and spire of buffalo a lady of buffalo on she way to cleveland place herself at the piano and sing several song with such uncommon sweetness and expression that i see no occasion to be surprise at what i hear of the concert of leopold de meyer at buffalo the night before the concert room be crowd with people cling to each other like bee when they swarm and the whole affair seem a outbreak of popular enthusiasm a veteran teacher of music in buffalo famous for be hard to be please by any public musical entertainment find himself unable to sit still during the first piece play by de meyer but rise in the fullness of he delight and continue standing when the music cease he run to he and shake both of he hand again and again with most uncomfortable energy at the end of the next performance he spring again on the platform and hug the artist so rapturously that the room ring with laughter de meyer be to give another concert on Tuesday evening at niagara fall and the people of buffalo be prepare to follow he the taste of we people be certainly much change within the last twenty year a friend of ours use to relate as a good joke the conversation of two man who come to the conclusion that paganinus be the greatest man in the world they be only a little in advance of they age if such be the honor reap by de meyer we shall not be astonish if sivorus when he come over pass for the greatest man of he time the next morning find we with the southern shore of lake erie in sight -- a long line of wood with here and there a cluster of habitation on the shore that village where you see the light-house say one of the passenger who come from the hill of maine be grand river and from that place to cleveland which be thirty mile distant you have the most beautiful country under the sun -- perfectly beautiful sir not a hill the whole way and the finest farm that be ever see you can buy a good farm there for two thousand dollar in two or three hour afterward we be at cleveland and i hasten on shore it be situate beyond a steep bank of the lake nearly as elevated as the shore at brooklyn which we call brooklyn height as i stand on the edge of this bank and look over the broad lake below I stretch beyond the sight and quiver in the summer wind i be remind of the line of southey : -- along the bend line of shore such hue be throw as when the peacock 's neck assume its proudest tint of amethyst embathe in emerald glory but it be not only along the line of the shore that these hue prevail the whole lake glow with soft amethystine and emerald tinge in irregular mass like the shades of water silk cleveland stand in that beautiful country without a hill of which my fellow-passenger speak -- a thrive village yet to grow into a proud city of the lake country it be build upon broad dusty way in which not a pebble be see in the fat dark earth of the lake shore and which be shaded with locust-tree the variety call seed-locust with crowded twig and cluster foliage -- a tree choose doubtless for its rapid growth as the best means of get up a shade at the shortest notice here and there be garden fill with young fruit-tree among the largest and hardiest in appearance be the peach-tree which here spread broad and sturdy branch escape the disease that make it a short-lived tree in the atlantic state and produce fruit of great size and richness one of my fellow-passenger could hardly find adequate expression to signify he high sense of the deliciousness of the cleveland peach i make my way to a street of shop : it have a busy appearance more so than usual i be tell for a company of circus-rider whose tent i have see from a distance on the lake be in town and this have attract a throng of people from the country i see a fruit-stall tend by a man who have the coarsest red hair i think i ever see and of whom i buy two or three enormous bough apple as he call they he apologize for the price he demand the farmer say he know that just now there be a call for they early fruit while the circus people be in town and they make I pay a ` igh price for it i tell he i perceive he be no yankee i be a londoner he reply and i leave london twelve year ago to slave and be a poor man in ohio he acknowledge however that he have two or three time get together some property but the lord he say lay he hand on it on return to the steamer i find a party of country people mostly young person of both sex thin and lank figure by no means equal as production of the country to they bough apple they pass through the fine spacious cabin on the upper deck extend between the state-room the whole length of the steamer at length they come to a large mirror which stand at the stern and seem by its reflection to double the length of the cabin they walk on as if they would extend they promenade into the mirror when suddenly observe the reflection of they own person advance and think it another party they politely make way to let it pass the party in the mirror at the same moment turn to the same side which first show they the mistake they have make the passenger have some mirth at they expense but i must do we visitor the justice to say that they join in the laugh with a very good grace the same evening at twelve o'clock we be at detroit you must lock you state-room in the night say one of the person employ about the vessel for detroit be full of thief we follow the advice sleep soundly and see nothing of the thief nor of detroit either for the steamboat be again on she passage through lake st clair at three this morning and when i awake we be move over the flat as they be call at the upper end of the lake the steamer be thread she way in a fog between large patch of sedge of a pea-green color we have wait several hour at detroit because this passage be not safe at night and steamer of a larger size be sometimes ground here in the day-time i have hope when i begin to bring down the narrative of my voyage to this moment but my sheet be full and i shall give you the remainder in another letter letter xxxi a trip from detroit to mackinaw steamer oregon lake michigan _ July _ 25 1846 soon after pass the flat describe in my last letter and enter the river st clair the steamer stop to take in wood on the canadian side here i go on shore all that we could see of the country be a road along the bank a row of cottage at a considerable distance from each other along the road a narrow belt of clear field behind they and beyond the field the original forest standing like a long lofty wall with its crowded stem of enormous size and immense height root in the strong soil -- ash and maple and elm the largest of they species scatter in the foreground be number of leafless elm so huge that the settler as if in despair of bring they to the ground by the ax have girdle they and leave they to decay and fall at they leisure we go up to one of the house before which stand several of the family attract to the door by the sight of we steamer among they be a intelligent-looking man originally from the state of new york who give quick and shrewd answer to we inquiry he tell we of a indian settlement about twenty mile further up the st clair here dwell a remnant of the chippewa tribe collect by the canadian government which have build for they comfortable log-house with chimney furnish they with horse and neat cattle and utensil of agriculture erect a house of worship and give they a missionary the design of plant they here saidth esettler be to encourage they to cultivate the soil and what have be the success of the plan i ask it have meet with no success at all he answer the worst thing that the government could do for these people be to give they every thing as it have do and leave they under no necessity to provide for themselves they chop over a little land a acre or two to a family they squaw plant a little corn and a few bean and this be the extent of they agriculture they pass they time in hunting and fishing or in idleness they find deer and bear in the wood behind they and fish in the st clair before they door and they squander they yearly pension in one respect they be just like white man they will not work if they can live without what fish do they find in the st clair various sort trout and white-fish be the finest but they be not so abundant at this season sturgeon and pike be just now in season and the pike be excellent one of we happen to observe that the river might easily be cross by swim the settler answer : not so easily as you might think the river be as cold as a well and the swimmer would soon be chill through and perhaps take with the cramp it be this coldness of the water which make the fish so fine at this season this mention of sturgeon tempt I to relate a anecdote which i hear as i be come up the hudson a gentleman who live east of the river a little back of tivolus catch last spring one of these fish which weigh about a hundred and sixty pound he carry it to a large pond near he house the longest diameter of which be about a mile and without take it out of the net in which he have catch it he knot part of the mesh closely around it and attach they to a pair of line like rein put the creature into the water to the end of the line he have take care to attach a buoy to mark the place of the fish in the pond he keep a small boat and when he have a mind to make a water-excursion he row to the place where the buoy be float tie the line to the boat and pull they so as to disturb the fish be draw backward and forward with great rapidity over the surface the pond in its deepest part have only seven foot water so that there be no danger of be drag under we now proceed up the river and in about two hour come to a neat little village on the british side with a windmill a little church and two or three little cottage prettily screen by young tree immediately beyond this be the beginning of the chippewa settlement of which we have be tell log-house at the distance of nearly a quarter of a mile from each other stand in a long row beside the river with scatter tree about they the largest of the forest some girdle and leafless some untouched and green the smallest tree between have be cut away here and there a indian woman in a blue dress and bare-headed be walk along the road cow and horse be grazing near the house patch of maize be see tend in a slovenly manner and by no means clear of bush but nobody be at work in the field two female come down to the bank with paddle and put off into the river in a birch-bark canoe the end of which be carve in the peculiar indian fashion a little beyond stand a group of boy and girl on the water 's edge the boy in shirt and leggin silently watch the steamer as it shoot by they still further on a group of child of both sex seven in number come run with shrill cry down the bank it be then about twelve o'clock and the weather be extremely sultry the boy in a instant throw off they shirt and leggin and plunge into the water with shout but the girl be in before they for they wear only a kind of petticoat which they do not take off but cast themselves into the river at once and slide through the clear water like seal this little indian colony on the edge of the forest extend for several mile along the river where its bank be highest and best adapt to the purpose of settlement it end at last just below the village which bear the name of fort sarana in the neighborhood of which i be show a odd-looking wooden building and be tell that this be the house of worship provide for the indian by the government at fort huron a village on the american side opposite to fort saranae we stop to land passenger three indian make they appearance on the shore one of whom a very large man wear a kind of turban and a white blanket make into a sort of frock with bar of black in several place altogether a striking costume one of this party a well-dressed young man stop to speak with somebody in the crowd on the wharf but the giant in the turban with he companion stride rapidly by apparently not deign to look at we and disappear in the village he be scarcely out of sight when i perceive a boat approach the shore with a curiously mottle sail as it come nearer i see that it be a quilt of patchwork take from a bed in the bottom of the boat lay a barrel apparently of flour a stout young fellow pull a pair of oar and a slender-waisted damsel neatly dress sit in the stern ply a paddle with a dexterity which she might have learn from the chippewa lady and guide the course of the boat which pass with great speed over the water we be soon upon the broad water of lake huron and when the evening close upon we we be already out of sight of land the next morning i be awaken by the sound of rain on the hurricane deck a cool east wind be blow i open the outer door of my state-room and snuff the air which be strongly impregnate with the odor of burnt leaf or grass proceeding doubtless from the burning of wood or prairie somewhere on the shore of the lake for mile after mile for hour after hour as we fly through the mist the same odor be perceptible : the atmosphere of the lake be full of it will it rain all day i ask of a fellow-passenger a salem man in a white cravat the cloud be thin he answer the sun will soon burn they off in fact the sun soon melt away the cloud and before ten o'clock i be show to the north of we the dim shore of the great manitoulin island with the faintly descried opening call the west strait through which a throng of speculator in copper mine be this summer constantly pass to the sault de ste marie on the other side be the sandy isle of bois blanc the name of which be commonly corrupt into bob low island thickly cover with pine and show a tall light-house on the point nearest we beyond another point lay like a cloud the island of mackinaw i have see it once before but now the hazy atmosphere magnify it into a lofty mountain its limestone cliff impend over the water seem larger the white fort -- white as snow -- build from the quarry of the island look more commanding and the rocky crest above it seem almost to rise to the cloud there be a good deal of illusion in all this as we be convince as we come nearer but mackinaw with its rock rise from the most transparent water that the earth pour out from she spring be a stately object in any condition of the atmosphere the captain of we steamer allow we but a moment at mackinaw a moment to gaze into the clear water and count the fish as they play about without fear twenty or thirty foot below we steamer as plainly see as if they lay in the air a moment to look at the fort on the height dazzling the eye with its new whiteness a moment to observe the habitation of this ancient village some of which show you roof and wall of red-cedar bark confine by horizontal strip of wood a kind of architecture between the wigwam and the settler 's cabin a few basket of fish be lift on board in which i see trout of enormous size trout a yard in length and white-fish smaller but hold perhaps in higher esteem and we turn we course to the strait which lead into lake michigan i remember hear a lady say that she be tire of improvement and only want to find a place that be finish where she might live in peace i think i shall recommend mackinaw to she i see no change in the place since my visit to it five year ago it be so lucky as to have no _ back-country _ it offer no advantage to speculation of any sort it produce it be true the finest potato in the world but none for exportation it may however on account of its very cool summer climate become a fashionable watering-place in which case it must yield to the common fate of american village and improve as the phrase be letter xxxii journey from detroit to princeton princeton illinoi _ July _ 31 1846 soon after leave the island of mackinaw we enter the strait and pass into lake michigan the odor of burnt leaf continue to accompany we and from the western shore of the lake thickly cover with wood we see large column of smoke several mile apart rise into the hazy sky the steamer turn towards the eastern shore and about a hour before sunset stop to take in wood at the upper maneto island where we land and stroll into the forest part of the island be high but this where we go on shore consist of hillock and hollow of sand like the wave of the lake in one of its storm and look as if successive storm have sweep they up from the bottom they be cover with a enormous growth of tree which must have stand for century we admire the astonishing transparency of the water on this shore the clean sand without any intermixture of mud the pebble of almost chalky whiteness and the stone in the edge of the lake to which adhere no slime nor green moss nor aquatic weed in the light-green depths far down but distinctly see shoal of fish some of they of large size come quietly play about the huge hull of we steamer on the shore be two log-house inhabit by woodman one of whom draw a pail of water for the refreshment of some of the passenger from a well dig in the sand by he door it be not so good as the lake water say i for i see it be not so clear it be colder though answer the man but i must say that there be no purer or sweeter water in the world than that of we lake next morning we be coast the western shore of lake michigan a high bank present a long line of forest this be break by the little town of sheboygan with its light-house among the shrub of the bank its cluster of house just build among which be two hotel and its single schooner lie at the mouth of a river you probably never hear of sheboygan before it have just spring up in the forest of wisconsin the leaf have hardly wither on the tree that be fell to make room for its house but it will make a noise in the world yet it be the prettiest place on the lake say a passenger whom we leave there with three chubby and healthy child a lady who have already live long enough at sheboygan to be proud of it further on we come to milwaukie which be rapidly become one of the great city of the west it lie within a semicircle of green pastoral declivity sprinkle with scatter tree where the future street be to be build we land at a kind of wharf form by a long platform of plank lay on pile under which the water flow and extend to some distance into the lake and along which a car run on a railway take the passenger and they baggage and a part of the freight of the steamer to the shore will you go up to town sir be the question with which i be salute by the driver of a throng of vehicle of all sort as soon as i reach the land they be range along a firm sandy beach between the lake and the river of milwaukie on one side the light-green water of the lake of crystalline clearness come roll in before the wind and on the other the dark thick water of the river lay still and stagnant in the sun we do not go up to the town but we could see that it be compactly build and in one quarter nobly a year or two since that quarter have be destroy by fire and on the spot several large and lofty warehouse have be erect with a hotel of the largest class they be of a fine light-brown color and when i learn that they be of brick i inquire of a by-stander if that be the natural color of the material they be milwaukie brick he answer and neither paint nor stain and be better brick besides than be make at the eastward milwaukie be say to contain at present about ten thousand inhabitant here the belt of forest that border the lake stretch back for several mile to the prairie of wisconsin the german say a passenger be already in the wood hacking at the tree and will soon open the country to the prairie we make a short stop at racine prettily situate on the bank among the scatter tree of a oak opening and another at southport a rival town eleven mile further south it be surprising how many person travel as way-passenger from place to place on the shore of these lake five year ago the number be very few now they comprise at least half the number on board a steamboat ply between buffalo and chicago when all who travel from chicago to buffalo shall cross the peninsula of michigan by the more expeditious route of the railway the chicago and buffalo line of steamer which its owner claim to be the finest line in the world will still be crowd with people take up or to be set down at some of the intermediate town when we awake the next morning we steamer be at chicago any one who have see this place as i have do five year ago when it contain less than five thousand people would find some difficulty in recognize it now when its population be more than fifteen thousand it have its long row of warehouse and shop its bustling street its huge steamer and crowd of lake-craft lie at the wharf its villa embower with tree and its suburb consist of the cottage of german and irish laborer stretch northward along the lake and westward into the prairie and widen every day the slovenly and raw appearance of a new settlement begin in many part to disappear the german have already a garden in a little grove for they holiday as in they town in the old country and the roman catholic have just finish a college for the education of those who be to proselyte the west the day be extremely hot and at sunset we take a little drive along the belt of firm sand which form the border of the lake light-green wave come to the shore in long line with a crest of foam like a miniature surf rolling in from that inland ocean and as they dash against the leg of the horse and the wheel of we carriage the air that play over they be exceedingly refreshing when we set out the follow day in the stage-coach for peru i be surprise to see how the settlement of chicago have extend westward into the open country three year ago say a traveller in the coach it be think that this prairie could neither be inhabit nor cultivate it be so level and so little elevated that for week its surface would remain covered with water but we have find that as it be intersect with road the water either run off in the ditch of the highway or be absorb into the sand which lie below this surface of dark vegetable mould and it be now as you perceive begin to be cover with habitation if you ever go by the stage-coach from chicago to peru on the illinoi river do not believe the glozing tongue of the agent who tell you that you will make the journey in sixteen hour double the number and you will be nearer the truth a violent rain fall in the course of the morning the coach be heavily loaded nine passenger within and three without besides the driver the day be hot and the horse drag we slowly through the black mud which seem to possess the consistency and tenacity of sticking-plaster we have a dinner of grouse which here in certain season be sell for three cent apiece at a little tavern on the road we have pass the long green mound which bear the name of mount joliet and now a little before sunset have travel somewhat less than fifty mile we be about to cross the channel of the illinois canal for the second or third time there have once be a bridge at the crossing-place but the water have rise in the canal and the timber and plank have float away leave only the stone which form its foundation in attempt to ford the channel the blunder driver come too near the bridge the coach-wheel on one side rise upon the stone and on the other sink deep into the mud and we be overturn in a instant the outside passenger be pitch head-fore-most into the canal and four of those within be lie under water we extricate ourselves as well as we could the man wade out the woman be carry and when we get on shore it be find that although drench with water and plaster with mud nobody be either drown or hurt a farm wagon pass at the moment ford the canal without the least difficulty and take the female passenger convey they to the next farm-house about a mile distant we get out the baggage which be completely soak with water set up the carriage on its wheel in do which we have to stand waist high in the mud and water and reach the hospitable farm-house about half-past nine o'clock its owner be a emigrant from kinderhook on the hudson who claim to be a dutchman and a christian and i have no reason to doubt that he be either he kind family make we free of they house and we pass the night in dry ourselves and get we baggage ready to proceed the next day we travel in a vehicle build after the fashion of the english post-coach set high upon spring which be the most absurd kind of carriage for the road of this country that could be devise those stage-wagon which ply on long island in one of which you sometimes see about a score of quaker and quakeress present a much better model besides be tumble into the canal we narrowly escape be overturn in a dozen other place where the mud be deep or the road uneven in my journey the next day i be strike with the difference which five year have make in the aspect of the country frame or brick house in many place have take the place of log-cabin the road for long distance now pass between fence the broad prairie inclose be turn into immense field of maize oats and wheat and be spot here and there with young orchard or little grove and clump of bright-green locust-tree and where the prairie remain open it be now depasture by large herd of cattle its herbage shorten and its flower less numerous the wheat harvest this year be say to have fail in northern illinoi the rust have attack the field which promise the fairest and they be leave unreaped to feed the quail and the prairie-hens another tedious day 's journey over a specially bad road bring we to peru a little before midnight and we pass the rest of the night at a inn just below the bank on the margin of the river in listen to the mosquito a massachusett acquaintance the next morning furnish we with a comfortable conveyance to this pleasant neighborhood letter xxxiii return to chicago chicago _ August _ 8 1846 you may be certain that in return to this place from princeton i do not take the stage coach i have no fancy for another plunge into the illinois canal nor for be overturn upon the prairie in one of those vehicle which seem to be set high in the air in order they may more easily lose they balance we procure a private conveyance and make the journey in three day -- three day of extreme heat which compel we to travel slowly the quail which have repair for shade to the fence by the side of the road run from they into the open field as we pass with they beak open as if pant with the excessive heat the number of these bird at the present time be very great they swarm in the stubble field and in the prairie and manifest little alarm at the approach of man still more numerous it appear to I be the grouse or prairie-hen as they call they here which we frequently see walk leisurely at we approach into the grass from the road whither they resort for the sake of scatter grain of oats or wheat that have fall from the loaded wagon go to chicago at this season they be full fed and fearless and fly heavily when they be start we frequently see they feed at a very short distance from people at work in the field in some neighborhood they seem almost as numerous as fowl in a poultry-yard a settler go out with he gun and in a quarter of a hour bring in half a dozen bird which in the new york market would cost two dollar a pair at one place where we stop to dine they give we a kind of pie which seem to I a appropriate dessert for a dinner of prairie-hen it be make of the fruit of the western crab-apple and be not unpalatable the wild apple of this country be a small tree grow in thicket natural orchard in spring it be profusely cover with light-pink blossom which have the odor of violet and at this season it be thickly hang with fruit of the color of its leaf another wild fruit of the country be the plum which grow in thicket plum-patch as they be call where they be produce in great abundance and sometimes i be tell of excellent quality in a drive which i take the other day from princeton to the alluvial land of the bureau river i pass by a declivity where the shrub be red with the fruit just begin to ripen the slope be sprinkle by they with crimson spot and the odor of the fruit be quite agreeable i have eat worse plum than these from we market but i hear that there be a later variety larger and of a yellow color which be finer i speak in my last of the change cause in the aspect of the country by cultivation now and then however you meet with view which seem to have lose nothing of they original beauty one such we stop to look at from a eminence in a broad prairie in lee county between knox grove and pawpaw grove the road pass directly over the eminence which be round and regular in form with a small level on the summit and bear the name of the mound on each side the view extend to a prodigious distance the prairie sink into basin of immense breadth and rise into swell of vast extent dark grove stand in the light-green waste of grass and a dim blue border apparently of distant wood encircle the horizon to give a pastoral air to the scene large herd of cattle be grazing at no great distance from we i mention in my last letter that the wheat crop of northern illinois have partially fail this year but this be not the greatest calamity which have befall this part of the country the season be uncommonly sickly we pass the first night of we journey at pawpaw grove -- so name from the number of pawpaw-tree which grow in it but which here scarcely find the summer long enough to perfect they fruit the place have not have the reputation of be unhealthy but now there be scarce a family in the neighborhood in which one or more be not ill with a intermittent or a bilious fever at the inn where we stop the landlady a stout pennsylvanium woman be just so far recover as to be able as she inform we to poke about and she daughter a strapping lass go out to pass the night at the bedside of one of the numerous sick neighbor the sickness be ascribe by the settler to the extremely dry and hot weather follow a rainy June at almost every place where we stop we hear similar account pale and hollow-eyed people be lounge about be the place unhealthy i ask one of they _ i _ reckon so he answer and he look show that he have sufficient reason at aurora where we pass the second night a busy little village with mill and manufactory on the fox river which here rush swiftly over a stony bed they confess to the fever and ague at naperville pleasantly situate among numerous grove and little prairie swell into hill we hear that the season be the most sickly the inhabitant have know here at chicago which boast and with good reason i believe of its healthy site dysentery and bilious attack be just now very common with occasional case of fever it be a common remark in this country that the first cultivation of the earth render any neighborhood more or less unhealthy nature say a western man to I some year since resent the violence do she and punish those who first break the surface of the earth with the plough the beautiful rock river district with its rapid stream its noble grove its bank disposed in natural terrace with fresh spring gush at they foot and airy prairie stretch away from they summit be esteem one of the most healthy country in the world as long as it have but few inhabitant with the break up of the soil come in bilious fever and intermittent a few year of cultivation will render the country more healthy and these disease will probably disappear as they have do in some part of western new york i can remember the time when the genesee country as it be call be think quite a sickly region -- a land just in the skirt of the shadow of death it be now as healthy i believe as any part of the state letter xxxiv voyage to sault ste marie sault ste marie _ August _ 13 1846 when we leave chicago in the steamer the other morning all the vessel in the port have they flag display at half-mast in token of dissatisfaction with the fate of the harbor bill you may not recollect that the bill set apart half a million of dollar for the construction or improvement of various harbor of the lake and authorize the deepen of the passage through the st clair flat now intricate and not quite safe by which these bulky steamer make they way from the lower lake to the upper the people of the lake region have watch the progress of the bill through congress with much interest and anxiety and congratulate each other when at length it receive a majority of vote in both house the president 's veto have turn these congratulation into expression of disappointment which be hear on all side sometimes express with a good deal of energy but although the news of the veto reach chicago two or three day before we leave the place nobody have see the message in which it be contain perhaps the force of the president 's reasoning will reconcile the mind of people here to the disappointment of they hope it be a hot August morning as the steamer wisconsin a unwieldy bulk dip and bob upon the small wave and tremble at every stroke of the engine sweep out into the lake the southwest wind during the warmer portion of the summer month be a sort of sirocco in illinoi it blow with considerable strength but pass over a immense extent of heated plain it bring no coolness it be such a air that accompany we on we way north from chicago and as the passenger huddle into the shady place outside of the state-room on the upper deck i thought of the flock of quail i have see gasp in the shadow of the rail-fence on the prairie people here expose themselves to a draught of air with much less scruple than they do in the atlantic state we do not take cold by it they say to I when i see they sit in a current of wind after perspire freely if they do not take cold it be odds but they take something else a fever perhaps or what be call a bilious attack the vicissitude of climate at chicago and its neighborhood be more sudden and extreme than with we but the inhabitant say that they be not often the cause of catarrh as in the atlantic state whatever may be the cause i have meet with no person since i come to the west who appear to have a catarrh from this region perhaps will hereafter proceed singer with the clearest pipe some forty mile beyond chicago we stop for half a hour at little fort one of those flourish little town which be spring up on the lake shore to besiege future congress for money to build they harbor this settlement have start up in the wood within the last three or four year and its cluster of roof two of the broadest of which cover respectable-looking hotel already make a considerable figure when view from the lake we pass to the shore over a long platform of plank frame upon two row of post or pile plant in the sandy shallows we make a port in this manner on any part of the western shore of the lake say a passenger and convenient port they be except in very high wind on the eastern shore the coast of michigan they have not this advantage the ice and the northwest wind would rend such a wharf as this in piece on this side too the water of the lake except when a east wind blow be smoother than on the michigan coast and the steamer therefore keep under the shelter of this bank at southport still further north in the new state of wisconsin we procure a kind of omnibus and be drive over the town which for a new settlement be uncommonly pretty we cross a narrow inlet of the lake a _ creek _ in the proper sense of the term a wind channel with water in the midst and a rough growth of water-flag and sedge on the side among they grow the wild rice its bend spike heavy with grain almost ready for the harvest in the northern marsh of wisconsin say one of we party i have see the indian woman gather this grain two of they take they place in a canoe one of they seat in the stern push it with she paddle through the shallows of stand water while the other sit forward bend the head of the rice-plant over the side of the canoe strike they with a little stick and cause the grain to fall within it in this way be collect large quantity which serve as the winter food of the menomony and some other tribe the grain of the wild rice i be tell be of a dark color but palatable as food the gentleman who give I this account have make several attempt to procure it in a fit state to be sow for judge buel of albany who be desirous of try its cultivation on the grassy shallows of we eastern river he be not successfull at first because as soon as the grain be collect it be kiln-dried by the indian which destroy the vegetative principle at length however he obtain and send on a small quantity of the fresh rice but it reach judge buel only a short time before he death and the experiment probably have not be make on one side of the creek be a sloping bank of some height where tall old forest tree be grow among these stand three house just build and the space between they and the water be form into garden with regular terrace face with turf another turn of we vehicle bring we into a public square where the oak of the original forest be leave stand a miniature of the _ champ elysées _ surround which among the tree stand many neat house some of they build of a drab-colored brick back of the town we have a glimpse of a prairie approach within half a mile of the river we be next drive through a street of shop and thence to we steamer the street of southport be bed of sand and one of the passenger who profess to speak from some experience describe the place as haunt by myriad of flea it be not till about one o'clock of the second night after leave chicago that we land at mackinaw and after a infinite deal of trouble in get we baggage together and keep it together we be drive to the mission house a plain comfortable old wooden house build thirty or forty year since by a missionary society and now turn into a hotel beside the road close to the water 's edge stand several wigwam of the potawottamy pyramid of pole wrap around with rush matting each contain a family asleep the place be crowd with people on they way to the mining region of lake superior or return from it and we be oblige to content ourselves with narrow accommodation for the night at half-past seven the next morning we be on we way to the sault ste marie in the little steamer general scott the wind be blow fresh and a score of person who have intend to visit the sault be withhold by the fear of seasickness so that half a dozen of we have the steamer to ourselves in three or four hour we find ourselves glide out of the lake through smooth water between two low point of land cover with fir and pine into the west strait we pass drummond 's island and then coast st joseph 's island on the woody shore of which i be show a solitary house there i be tell live a long-nosed englishman a half-pay officer with two wife sister each the mother of a numerous offspring this english polygamist have be more successful in seek solitude than in avoid notoriety the very loneliness of he habitation on the shore cause it to be remark and there be not a passenger who make the voyage to the sault to whom he house be not point out and he story related it be hint to I that he have a third wife in toronto but i have my private doubt of this part of the story and suspect that it be throw in to increase my wonder beyond the island of st joseph we pass several islet of rock with fir-tree grow from the cleft here in summer i be tell the indian often set up they wigwam and subsist by fishing there be none in sight as we pass but we frequently see on either shore the skeleton of the chippewa habitation these consist not like those of the potawottamy of a circle of stick place in the form of a cone but of slender pole bent into circle so as to make a almost regular hemisphere over which while it serve as a dwelling birch-bark and mat of bulrush be throw on the western side of the passage opposite to st joseph 's island stretch the long coast of sugar island luxuriant with a extensive forest of the sugar-maple here the indian manufacture maple-sugar in the spring i inquire concern they agriculture they plant no corn nor squash say a passenger who have reside for some time at the sault they will not ripen in this climate but they plant potato in the sugar-bush and dig they when the spring open they have no other agriculture they plant no bean as i believe the indian do elsewhere a violent squall of wind and rain fall upon the water just as we enter that broad part of the passage which bear the name of muddy lake in ordinary weather the water be here perfectly pure and translucent but now they agitation bring up the loose earth from the shallow bottom and make they as turbid as the missourus with the exception of a narrow channel in the midst where the current run deep rocky hill now begin to show themselves to the east of we we pass the sheet of water know by the name of lake george and come to a little river which appear to have its source at the foot of a precipitous ridge on the british side it be call garden river and a little beyond it on the same side lie garden village inhabit by the indian it be now desert the indian have go to attend a great assemblage of they race hold on one of the manitoulin island where they be to receive they annual payment from the british government here be log-house and skeleton of wigwam from which the covering have be take a indian when he travel take with he he family and he furniture the mat for he wigwam he implement for hunting and fishing he dog and cat and find a home wherever he find pole for a dwelling a tornado have recently pass over the garden village the numerous girdled-tree which stand on its little clearing have be twist off midway or near the ground by the wind and the roof have in some instance be lift from the cabin at length after a wind voyage of sixty mile between wild bank of forest in some place smoking with fire in some look as if never violate either by fire or steel with huge carcass of tree moulder on the ground and venerable tree stand over they beard with streaming moss we come in sight of the white rapid of the sault sainte marie we pass the humble cabin of the half-breed on either shore with here and there a round wigwam near the water we glide by a white chimney standing behind a screen of fir-tree which we be tell have belong to the dwelling of tanner who himself set fire to he house the other day before murder mr schoolcraft and in a few minute be at the wharf of this remotest settlement of the northwest letter xxxv fall of the st mary sault ste marie _ August _ 15 1846 a crowd have assemble on the wharf of the american village at the sault sainte marie popularly call the _ soo _ to witness we landing man of all age and complexion in hat and cap of every form and fashion with beard of every length and color among which i discover two or three pair of mustach it be a party of copper-mine speculator just flit from copper harbor and eagle river mix with a few indian and half-breed inhabitant of the place among they i see a face or two quite familiar in wall-street i have a conversation with a intelligent geologist who have just return from a examination of the copper mine of lake superior he have pitch he tent in the field near the village choose to pass the night in this manner as he have do for several week past rather than in a crowded inn in regard to the mine he tell I that the external token the surface indication as he call they be more favorable than those of any copper mine in the world they be still however mere surface indication the vein have not be work to that depth which be necessary to determine they value with any certainty the mixture of silver with the copper he regard as not give any additional value to the mine inasmuch as it be only occasional and rare sometimes he tell I a mass of metal would be discover of the size of a man 's fist or smaller compose of copper and silver both metal closely unite yet both perfectly pure and unalloyed with each other the mass of virgin copper find in bed of gravel be however the most remarkable feature of these mine one of they which have be discover this summer but which have not be raise be estimate to weigh twenty ton i saw in the propeller independence by which this party from the copper mine be bring down to the sault one of these mass weigh seventeen hundred and fifty pound with the appearance of have once be fluid with heat it be so pure that it might have be cut in piece by cold steel and stamp at once into coin two or three year ago this settlement of the sault de ste marie be but a military post of the united state in the midst of a village of indian and half-breed there be perhaps a dozen white resident in the place include the family of the baptist missionary and the agent of the american fur company which have remove its station hither from mackinaw and build its warehouse on this river but since the world have begin to talk of the copper mine of lake superior settler flock into the place carpenter be busy in knock up house with all haste on the government land and large warehouse have be build upon pile drive into the shallows of the st mary five year hence the primitive character of the place will be altogether lose and it will have become a bustling yankee town resemble the other new settlement of the west here the navigation from lake to lake be interrupt by the fall or rapid of the river st mary from which the place receive its name the crystalline water of lake superior on they way through the channel of this river to lake huron here rush and foam and roar for about three quarter of a mile over rock and large stone close to the rapid with birchen-canoe moor in little inlet be a village of the indian consist of log-cabin and round wigwam on a shrubby level reserve to they by the government the morning after we arrival we go through this village in search of a canoe and a couple of indian to make the descent of the rapid which be one of the first thing that a visitor to the sault must think of in the first wigwam that we enter be three man and two woman as drunk as man and woman could well be the squaw be speechless and motionless too far go as it seem to raise either hand or foot the man though apparently unable to rise be noisy and one of they who call himself a half-breed and speak a few word of english seem disposed to quarrel before the next door be a woman busy in wash who speak a little english the old man out there she say in answer to we question can paddle canoe but he be very drunk he can not do it to-day be there nobody else we ask who will take we down the fall i do not know the indian all drunk to-day why be that why be they all drunk to-day oh the whisky answer the woman give we to understand that when a indian could get whisky he get drunk as a matter of course by this time the man have come up and after address we with the customary _ bon jour _ manifest a curiosity to know the nature of we errand the woman explain it to he in english oh messieurs je vous servirai say he for he speak canadian french i go i go we tell he that we doubt whether he be quite sober enough oh messieurs je suis parfaitement capable -- first rate first rate we shake he off as soon as we could but not till after he have time to propose that we should wait till the next day and to utter the maxim whisky good -- too much whisky no good in a log-cabin which some half-breed be engage in building we find two man who be easily persuade to leave they work and pilot we over the rapid they take one of the canoe which lay in a little inlet close at hand and enter it push it with they long pole up the stream in the edge of the rapid arrive at the head of the rapid they take in we party which consist of five and we begin the descent at each end of the canoe sit a half-breed with a paddle to guide it while the current draw we rapidly down among the agitate water it be surprising with what dexterity they keep we in the smoothest part of the water seem to know the way down as well as if it have be a beaten path in the field at one time we would seem to be directly approach a rock against which the wave be dash at another to be descend into a hollow of the water in which we canoe would be inevitably fill but a single stroke of the paddle give by the man at the prow put we safely by the seeming danger so rapid be the descent that almost as soon as we descry the apparent peril it be pass in less than ten minute as it seem to I we have leave the roar of the rapid behind we and be glide over the smooth water at they foot in the afternoon we engage a half-breed and he brother to take we over to the canadian shore he wife a slender young woman with a lively physiognomy not easily to be distinguish from a french woman of she class accompany we in the canoe with she little boy the birch-bark canoe of the savage seem to I one of the most beautiful and perfect thing of the kind construct by human art we be in one of the finest that float on st mary 's river and when i look at its delicate rib mere shaving of white cedar yet firm enough for the purpose -- the thin broad lath of the same wood with which these be inclosed and the broad sheet of birch-bark impervious to water which sheathe the outside all firmly sew together by the tough slender root of the fir-tree and when i consider its extreme lightness and the grace of its form i could not but wonder at the ingenuity of those who have invent so beautiful a combination of ship-building and basket-work it cost I twenty dollar say the half-breed and i would not take thirty for it we be ferry over the wave where they dance at the foot of the rapid at this place large quantity of white-fish one of the most delicate kind know on we continent be catch by the indian in they season with scoop-net the whites be about to interfere with this occupation of the indian and i see the other day a seine of prodigious length construct with which it be intend to sweep nearly half the river at once they will take a hundred barrel a day say a inhabitant of the place on the british side the rapid divide themselves into half a dozen noisy brook which roar round little island and in the boiling pool of which the speckled trout be catch with the rod and line we land at the warehouse of the hudson bay company where the goods intend for the indian trade be deposit and the fur bring from the northwest be collect they be surround by a massive stockade within which live the agent of the company the walk be gravel and well-kept and the whole bear the mark of british solidity and precision a quantity of fur have be bring in the day before but they be lock up in the warehouse and all be now quiet and silent the agent be absent a half-breed nurse stand at the door with he child and a scotch servant apparently with nothing to do be lounge in the court inclose by the stockade in short there be less bustle about this center of one of the most powerful trading-company in the world than about one of we farm-house cross the bay at the bottom of which these building stand we land at a canadian village of half-breed here be one or two wigwam and a score of log-cabin some of which we enter in one of they we be receive with great appearance of deference by a woman of decidedly indian feature but light-complexioned barefoot with blue embroidered leggings fall over she ankle and sweep the floor the only peculiarity of indian costume about she the house be as clean as scour could make it and she two little child with little french physiognomy be fairer than many child of the european race these people be descend from the french voyageur and settler on one side they speak canadian french more or less but generally employ the chippewa language in they intercourse with each other near at hand be a burial ground with grave of the indian and half-breed which we enter some of the grave be cover with a low roof of cedar-bark other with a wooden box over other be place a little house like a dog-kennel except that it have no door other be cover with little log-cabin one of these be of such a size that a small indian family would have find it amply large for they accommodation it be a practice among the savage to protect the grave of the dead from the wolf by stake drive into the ground and meeting at the top like the rafter of a roof and perhaps when the indian or half-breed exchange he wigwam for a log-cabin he respect for the dead lead he to make the same improvement in the architecture of they narrow house at the head of most of these monument stand wooden cross for the population here be principally roman catholic some of they inscribe with the name of the dead not always accurately spell not far from the church stand a building regard by the half-breed as a wonder of architecture the stone house _ la maison de pierre _ as they call it a large mansion build of stone by a former agent of the northwest or hudson bay company who live here in a kind of grand manorial style with he servant and horse and hound and give hospitable dinner in those day when it be the fashion for the host to do he best to drink he guest under the table the old splendor of the place have depart its garden be overgrow with grass the barn have be blow down the kitchen in which so many grand dinner be cook consume by fire and the mansion with its broken and patched window be now occupy by a scotch farmer of the name of wilson we climb a ridge of hill back of the house to the church of the episcopal mission build a few year ago as a place of worship for the chippewa who have since be remove by the government it stand remote from any habitation with three or four indian grave near it and we find it fill with hay the view from its door be uncommonly beautiful the broad st mary lie below with its border village and woody valley its white rapid and its rocky island picturesque with the pointed summit of the fir-tree to the northwest the sight follow the river to the horizon where it issue from lake superior and i be tell that in clear weather one might discover from the spot on which i stand the promontory of gro cap which guard the outlet of that mighty lake the country around be smoking in a dozen place with fire in the wood when i return i ask who kindle they it be old tanner say one the man who murder schoolcraft there be great fear here of tanner who be think to be lurk yet in the neighborhood i be go the other day to look at a view of the place from a eminence reach by a road pass through a swamp full of larch and fir be you not afraid of tanner i be ask mr schoolcraft since the assassination of she husband have come to live in the fort which consist of barracks protect by a high stockade it be rumor that tanner have be see skulk about within a day or two and yesterday a place be discover which be suppose to have serve for he retreat it be a hollow thickly surround by shrub which some person have evidently make he habitation for a considerable time there be a dispute whether this man be insane or not but there be no dispute as to he malignity he have threaten to take the life of mr bingham the venerable baptist missionary at this place and as long as it be not certain that he have leave the neighborhood a feeling of insecurity prevail nevertheless as i know no reason why this man should take it into he head to shoot I i go whither i list without the fear of tanner before my eye letter xxxvi indian at the sault mackinaw _ August _ 19 1846 we be detain two day longer than we expect at the sault de ste marie by the failure of the steamer general scott to depart at the proper time if we could have find a steamer go up lake superior we should most certainly have quiet we impatience at this delay by embark on board of she but the only steamer in the river st mary above the fall which be a sort of arm or harbor of lake superior be the julium palmer and she be lie aground in the pebble and sand of the shore she have just be drag over the portage which pass round the fall where a broad path with hillock flatten and trunk hew off close to the surface give token of the vast bulk that have be move over it the moment she touch the water she stick fast and the engineer be oblige to go to cleveland for additional machinery to move she forward he have just arrive with the proper apparatus and the steamer have begin to work its way slowly into the deep water but some day must yet elapse before she can float and after that the engine must be put together have the julium palmer be ready to proceed up the lake i should certainly have seize the occasion to be present at a immense assemblage of indian on madeleine island this island lie far in the lake near its remoter extremity on one of its cape call la pointe be a missionary station and a indian village and here the savage be gather in vast number to receive they annual payment from the united state there be already two thousand of they at la pointe when i leave the place say a intelligent gentleman who have just return from the lake and they be starve if a indian family have a stock of provision on hand sufficient for a month it be sure to eat it up in a week and the indian at la pointe have already consume all they have provide and be live on what they could shoot in the wood or get by fishing in the lake i inquire of he the probable number of indian the occasion would bring together seven thousand he answer among they be some of the wildest tribe on the continent whose habit have be least change by the neighborhood of the white man a new tribe will come in who never before would have any transaction with the government they be call the pillager a fierce and warlike race proud of they independence and next to the blackfeet and the camanch the most ferocious and formidable tribe within the territory of the united state they inhabit the country about red river and the head-water of the mississippus i be further tell that some of the indian trader have express they determination to disregard the law set up they tent at la pointe and sell spirit to the savage if they do knife will be draw be the common say at the sault and at the fort i learn that a requisition have arrive from la pointe for twenty man to enforce the law and prevent disorder we can not send half the number say the officer who command at the fort we have but twelve man in all the rest of the garrison have be order to the mexican frontier and it be necessary that somebody should remain to guard the public property the call for troops have since be transfer to the garrison at mackinaw from which they will be send i learn afterward from a intelligent lady of the half-caste at the sault that letter have arrive from which it appear that more than four thousand indian be already assemble at la pointe and that they stock of provision be exhaust they expect say the lady to be pay off on the 15th of August but the government have change the time to nearly a month later this be unfortunate for the indian for now be the time of they harvest the season for gather wild rice in the marsh and they must in consequence not only suffer with hunger now but in the winter also in a stroll which we make through the indian village situate close to the rapid we fall in with a half-breed a sensible-looking man living in a log cabin whose boy the offspring of a squaw of the pure indian race be practice with they bow and arrow you do not go to la pointe we ask it be too far to go for a blanket be he answer -- he speak tolerable english this man seem to have inherit from the white side of he ancestry somewhat of the love of a constant habitation for a genuine indian have no particular dislike to a distant journey he take he habitation with he and be at home wherever there be game and fish and pole with which to construct he lodge in a further conversation with the half-breed he speak of the sault as a delightful abode and expatiate on the pleasure of the place it be the greatest place in the world for fun say he we dance all winter we woman be all good dancer we little girl can dance single and double jig as good as any body in the state that little girl there point to a long-haired girl at the door will dance as good as any body the fusion of the two race in this neighborhood be remarkable the mixed breed run by gradual shades into the aboriginal on the one hand and into the white on the other child with a tinge of the copper hue in the family of white man and child scarcely less fair sometimes see in the wigwam some of the half-caste lady at the fall of st mary who have be educate in the atlantic state be person of graceful and dignified manners and agreeable conversation i attend worship at the fort at the sault on Sunday the service be conduct by the chaplain who be of the methodist persuasion and a missionary at the place assist by the baptist missionary i look about I for some evidence of the success of they labor but among the worshiper i see not one male of indian descent of the female half a dozen perhaps be of the half-caste and as two of these walk away from the church i perceive that they wear a fringed clothing for the ankle as if they take a certain pride in this badge of they indian extraction in the afternoon we drive down the west bank of the river to attend religious service at a indian village call the little rapid about two mile and a half from the sault here the methodist have build a mission-house maintain a missionary and instruct a fragment of the chippewa tribe we find the missionary mr speight a kentuckian who have wander to this northern region quite ill and there be consequently no service we walk through the village which be prettily situate on a swift and deep channel of the st mary where the green water rush between the main-land and a wooded island it stand on rich meadow of the river with a path run before it parallel with the bank along the velvet sward and back at no great distance by the thick original forest which not far below close upon the river on both side the inhabitant at the door and window of they log-cabin have a demure and subdue aspect they be dress in they clean Sunday clothes and the peace and quiet of the place form a strong contrast to the debauchery we have witness at the village by the fall we fall in with a indian a quiet little man of very decent appearance who answer we question with great civility we ask to whom belong the meadow lie back of the cabin on which we see patch of rye oats and potato oh they belong to the mission the indian work they be they good people these indian oh yes good people do they never drink too much whisky well i guess they drink too much whisky sometimes there be a single wigwam in the village apparently a supplement to one of the log-cabin we look in and see two indian loom from which two unfinished mat be depend mr speight the wife of the missionary tell we that a few day before the village have be full of these lodge that the indian delighted in they greatly and always put they up during the mosquito season for a mosquito say the good lady will never enter a wigwam and that lately the mosquito have disappear and the night have grow cooler they have take down all but the one we see we pass a few minute in the house of the missionary to which mr speight kindly invite we she give a rather favorable account of the indian under she husband 's charge but manifestly a honest one and without any wish to extenuate the defect of they character there be many excellent person among they she say they be a kind simple honest people and some of they be eminently pious do they follow any regular industry many of they be as regularly industrious as the whites rise early and continue at they work in the field all day they be not so attentive as we could wish to the education of they child it be difficult to make they send they child regularly to school they think they confer a favor in allow we to instruct they and if they happen to take a little offense they child be keep at home the great evil against which we have to guard be the love of strong drink when this be offer to a indian it seem as if it be not in he nature to resist the temptation i have know whole congregation of indian good indian ruin and bring to nothing by the opportunity of obtain whisky as often as they please we inquire whether the number of the people at the mission be diminish she could not speak with much certainty as to this point have be only a year and a half at the mission but she think there be a gradual decrease the family of the indian she say in answer to one of my question be small in one family at the village be six child and it be the talk of all the indian far and near as something extraordinary generally the number be much smaller and more than half the child die in infancy they means would not allow they to rear many child even if the number of birth be greater such appear to be the destiny of the red race while in the presence of the white -- decay and gradual extinction even under circumstance apparently the most favorable to its preservation on Monday we leave the fall of st mary in the steamer general scott on we return to mackinaw there be about forty passenger on board man in search of copper-mine and man in search of health and traveller from curiosity virginian new yorker wanderer from illinois indiana massachusett and i believe several other state on reach mackinaw in the evening we party take quarter in the mansion house the oblige host of which stretch he means to the utmost for we accommodation mackinaw be at the present moment crowd with stranger attract by the cool healthful climate and the extreme beauty of the place we be pack for the night almost as closely as the potawottamy whose lodge be on the beach before we parlor and garret be turn into sleeping-room bed be make on the floor and in the passage and double-bedded room be make to receive four bed it be no difficult feat to sleep at mackinaw even in a August night and we soon forget in a refreshing slumber the narrowness of we quarter letter xxxvii the island of mackinaw steamer st loui lake huron _ August _ 20 1846 yesterday evening we leave the beautiful island of mackinaw after a visit of two day delightfully pass we have climb its cliff ramble on its shore thread the walk among its thicket drive out in the road that wind through its wood -- road pave by nature with limestone pebble a sort of natural macadamization and the time of we departure seem to arrive several day too soon the fort which crown the height near the shore command a extensive prospect but a still wider one be to be see from the old fort fort holme as it be call among whose ruin intrenchment the half-breed boy and girl now gather gooseberry it stand on the very crest of the island overlook all the rest the air when we ascend it be load with the smoke of burn forest but from this spot in clear weather i be tell a magnificent view might be have of the strait of mackinaw the wooded island and the shore and cape of the great mainland place know to history for the past two century for when you be at mackinaw you be at no new settlement in look for sample of indian embroidery with porcupine quill we find ourselves one day in the warehouse of the american fur company at mackinaw here on the shelf be pile of blanket white and blue red scarf and white boot snow-shoe be hang on the wall and wolf-trap rifle and hatchet be sling to the ceiling -- a assortment of goods destine for the indian and half-breed of the northwest the person who attend at the counter speak english with a foreign accent i ask he how long he have be in the northwestern country to say the truth he answer i have be here sixty year and some day you be bear here then i be a native of mackinaw french by the mother 's side my father be a englishman be the place as considerable sixty year ago as it now be more so there be more trade here and quite as many inhabitant all the house or nearly all be then build two or three only have be put up since i could easily imagine that mackinaw must have be a place of consequence when here be the center of the fur trade now remove further up the country i be show the large house in which the head of the company of _ voyageur _ engage in the trade be lodge and the barracks a long low building in which the _ voyageur _ themselves seven hundred in number make they quarter from the end of June till the beginning of October when they go out again on they journey this interval of three month be a merry time with those light-hearted frenchman when a boat make its appearance approach mackinaw they fall to conjecture to what company of _ voyageur _ it belong as the dispute grow warm the conjecture become bet till finally unable to restrain they impatience the boldest of they dash into the water swim out to the boat and climb on board shake hand with they brethren amidst the shout of those who stand on the beach they talk on the new england coast of chebacco boat build after a peculiar pattern and call after chebacco a ancient settlement of sea-faring man who have foolishly change the old indian name of they place to ipswich the mackinaw navigator have also give they name to a boat of peculiar form sharp at both end swell at the side and flat-bottom a excellent sea-boat it be say as it must be to live in the wild storm that surprise the mariner on lake superior we take yesterday a drive to the western shore the road twine through a wood of over-arching beech and maple intersperse with the white-cedar and fir the driver stop before a cliff sprout with beech and cedar with a small cavity at the foot this he tell we be the skull cave it be only remarkable on account of human bone have be find in it further on a white paling gleam through the tree it inclose the solitary burial ground of the garrison with half a dozen grave there be few bury here say a gentleman of we party the soldier who come to mackinaw sick get well soon the road we travel be cut through the wood by captain scott who command at the fort a few year since he be the marksman whose aim be so sure that the western people say of he that a raccoon on a tree once offer to come down and surrender without give he the trouble to fire we pass a farm surround with beautiful grove in one of its meadow be fight the battle between colonel croghan and the british officer holme in the war of 1813 three luxuriant beech stand in the edge of the wood north of the meadow one of they be the monument of holme he lie bury at its root another quarter of a mile lead we to a little bay on the solitary shore of the lake look to the northwest it be call the british landing because the british troops land here in the late war to take possession of the island we wander about awhile and then sit down upon the embankment of pebble which the wave of the lake heave for century have heap around the shore of the island -- pebble so clean that they would no more soil a lady 's white muslin gown than if they have be of newly polish alabaster the water at we foot be as transparent as the air around we on the main-land opposite stand a church with its spire and several roof be visible with a background of wood behind they there say one of we party be the old mission church it be build by the catholic in 1680 and have be a place of worship ever since the name of the spot be point st ignace and there live a indian of the full caste who be send to rome and educate to be a priest but he prefer the life of a layman and there he live on that wild shore with a library in he lodge a learn savage occupy with reading and study you may well suppose that i feel a strong desire to see point st ignace its venerable mission church its indian village so long under the care of catholic pastor and its learn savage who talk italian but the time of my departure be already fix my companion be point out on that shore the mouth of carp river which come down through the forest roaring over rock and in any of the pool of which you have only to throw a line with any sort of bait to be sure of a trout when the driver of we vehicle call out you boat be come we look and see the st loui steamer not one of the largest but one of the finest boat in the line between buffalo and chicago make rapidly for the island with a train of black smoke hanging in the air behind she we hasten to return through the wood and in a hour and a half we be in we clean and comfortable quarter in this well-ordered little steamer but i should mention that before leave mackinaw we do not fail to visit the principal curiosity of the place the sugar loaf rock a remarkable rock in the middle of the island of a sharp conical form rise above the tree by which it be surround and lift the stunt birch on its shoulder higher than they like a tall fellow hold up a little boy to overlook a crowd of man -- and the arched rock on the shore the atmosphere be thick with smoke and through the opening span by the arch of the rock i see the long wave roll up by a fresh wind come one after another out of the obscurity and break with roar on the beach the path along the brow of the precipice and among the evergreen by which this rock be reach be singularly wild but another which lead to it along the shore be no less picturesque -- pass under impend cliff and overshadow cedar and between huge block and pinnacle of rock i speak in one of my former letter of the manifest fate of mackinaw which be to be a watering-place i can not see how it be to escape this destiny people already begin to repair to it for health and refreshment from the southern border of lake michigan its climate during the summer month be delightful there be no air more pure and elastic and the wind of the south and southwest which be so hot on the prairie arrive here temper to a grateful coolness by the water over which they have sweep the night be always in the hottest season agreeably cool and the health of the place be proverbial the world have not many island so beautiful as mackinaw as you may judge from the description i have already give of part of it the surface be singularly irregular with summit of rock and pleasant hollow open glade of pasturage and shady nook to some the savage visitor who occasionally set up they lodge on its beach as well as on that of the surround island and paddle they canoe in its water will be a additional attraction i can not but think with a kind of regret on the time which i suppose be near at hand when its wild and lonely wood will be intersect with highway and fill with cottage and boarding-house letter xxxviii a excursion to the water gap stroudsberg monroe co penn _ October _ 23 1846 i reach this place last evening have take easton in my way do it ever occur to you in pass through new jersey how much the northern part of the state be in some respects like new york and how much the southern part resemble pennsylvanium for twenty mile before reach easton you see spacious dwelling-house often of stone substantially build and barn of the size of church and large farm with extensive wood of tall tree as in pennsylvanium where the right of soil have not undergo so many subdivision as with we i be show in warren county in a region apparently of great fertility a farm which be say to be two mile square it belong to a farmer of german origin whose comfortable mansion stand by the way and who come into the state many year ago a young man i have hear he say say a passenger that when he father bring he out with he young wife into warren county and set he down upon what then appear a barren little farm now a part of he large and productive estate he heart fail he however he go to work industriously practice the strictest economy and by apply lime copiously to the soil make it highly fertile it be lime which make this region the richest land in new jersey the farmer find limestone close at hand burn it in they kiln and scatter it on the surface the person of whom i speak take off large crop from he little farm and as soon as he have any money beforehand he add a few acre more so that it gradually grow to its present size rich as he be he be a worthy man he son who be numerous be all fine fellow not a scape-grace among they and he have settle they all on farm around he easton which we enter soon after dark be a pretty little town of seven thousand inhabitant much more substantially build than town of the same size in this country many of the house be of stone and to the side of some of they you see the ivy clinging and hide the masonry with a veil of evergreen foliage the middle of the street be unpaved and very dusty but the broad flagging on the side under the window of the house be sedulously sweep the situation of the place be uncommonly picturesque if ever the little borough of easton shall grow into a great town it will stand on one of the most commanding site in the world unless its inhabitant shall have spoil it by improvement the delaware which form the eastern bind of the borough approach it from the north through high wooded bank and flow away to join the susquehanna between craggy precipice on the south side the lehigh come down through a deep verdant hollow and on the north the bushkill wind through a glen shaded with tree on the rocky bank of which be one of the finest drive in the world in the midst of the borough rise a crag as lofty as that on which stirl castle be build -- in europe it would most certainly have be crown with its castle steep and grassy on one side and precipitous and rocky on the other where it overhang the bushkill the college stand on a lofty eminence overlook the dwelling and street but it be a ugly building and have not a tree to conceal even in part its ugliness besides these be various other eminence in the immediate vicinity of this compact little town which add greatly to its beauty we set out the next morning for the delaware water gap follow the road along the delaware which be here uncommonly beautiful the steep bank be mostly cover with tree sprout from the rocky shelf and below be a fringe of tree between the road and the river a little way from the town the driver point out in the midst of the stream a long island of loose stone and pebble without a leaf or stem of herbage it be there say he that gaetter six year ago be hang for the murder of he wife the high and steep bank of the river the rock and the tree he proceed to tell we be cover on that day with eager spectator from all the surrounding country every one of whom look immediately down on the island could enjoy a perfect view of the process by which the poor wretch in the hand of the hangman be turn off about five mile from easton we stop to water we horse at a inn a large handsome stone house with a chatty landlord who speak with a strong german accent complain pathetically of the potato disease which have get into the field of the neighborhood but glory in the abundant crop of maize and wheat which have be gather two mile further on we turn away from the river and ascend to the table-land above which we find green with extensive field of wheat just spring under the autumnal sun in one of the little village nestle in the hollow of that region we stop for a few moment and fall into conversation with a tolerably intelligent man though speak english with some peculiarity that indicate the race to which he belong a sample of he dialect may amuse you we ask he what the people in that part of the country think of the new tariff oh say he there be different obinion some like it and some not how do the democrat take it the democratic in brinciple like it do it have any effect on the election it brevent a goot many democrat from vote for they candidate for congress mr brodhead because he be for the old tariff this be a very strong democratic district and mr brodhead 's majority be only about a sousand a little beyond this village we come in sight of the water gap where the blue ridge have be cleave down to its base to form a passage for the delaware two lofty summit black with precipice of rock form the gate through which the river issue into the open country here it run noisily over the shallows as if boast aloud of the victory it have achieve in break its way through such mighty barrier but within the gap it sleep in quiet pool or flow in deep glassy current by the side of these you see large raft compose of enormous trunk of tree that have float down with the spring flood from the new york forest and here wait for they turn in the saw-mill along the shore it be a bright morning with a keen autumnal air and we dismount from we vehicle and walk through the gap it will give you reader a idea of the water gap to say that it consist of a succession of lofty peak like the highland of the hudson with a wind and irregular space between they a few rod wide to give passage to the river they be unlike the highland however in one respect that they side be cover with large loose block detach from the main precipice among these grow the original forest which descend to they foot fringe the river and embower the road the present autumn be i must say in regard to the coloring of the forest one of the shabbiest and least brilliant i remember to have see in this country almost as sallow and dingy in its hue as a autumn in europe but here in the water gap it be not without some of its accustomed brightness of tint -- the sugar-maple with its golden leaf and the water-maple with its foliage of scarlet contrast with the intense green of the hemlock-fir the pine the rosebay-laurel and the mountain-laurel which here grow in the same thicket while the ground below be carpet with humbler evergreen the aromatic wintergreen and the trail arbutus the water gap be about a mile in length and near its northern entrance a excellent hotel the resort of summer visitor stand on a cliff which rise more than a hundred foot almost perpendicularly from the river from this place the eye follow the water gap to where mountain shut in one behind another like the tooth of a saw and between they the delaware twine out of sight before the hotel a fine little boy of about two year of age be at play the landlord show we on the calf of the child 's leg two small lurid spot about a quarter of a inch apart that say he be the bite of a copper-head snake we ask when this happen it be last summer answer he the child be play on the side of the road when he be hear to cry and see to make for the house as soon as he come my wife call my attention to what she call a scratch on he leg i examine it the spot be already purple and hard and the child be cry violently i know it to be the bite of a copper-head and immediately cut it open with a sharp knife make the blood to flow freely and wash the part with water at the same time we get a yerb -lrb- such be he pronunciation -rrb- on the hill which some call lion-heart and other snake-head we steep this yerb in milk which we make he drink the doctor have be send for and when he come apply hartshorn but i believe that open the wound and let the blood flow be the most effectual remedy the leg be terribly swollen and for ten day we think the little fellow in great danger but after that he become better and finally recover how do you know that it be a copper-head that bite he we send to the place where he be at play find the snake and kill it a violent rain have fall just before and it have probably wash he down from the mountain-side the boy appear very healthy now much better than before he be formerly delicate and troubled with a eruption but that have disappear and he have become hardy and fond of the open air we dine at the hotel and leave the water gap as we pass out of its jaw we meet a man in a little wagon carry behind he the carcass of a deer he have just kill they be hunt at this time of the year and kill in considerable number in the extensive forest to the north of this place a drive of four mile over hill and valley bring we to stroudsburg on the bank of the pocano -- a place of which i shall speak in my next letter letter xlii a excursion to the water gap easton penn _ October _ 24 1846 my yesterday 's letter leave I at stroudsburg about four mile west of the delaware it be a pleasant village situate on the bank of the pocano from this stream the inhabitant have divert a considerable portion of the water bring the current through this village in a canal make it to dive under the road and rise again on the opposite side after which it hasten to turn a cluster of mill to the north be see the summit of the pocano mountain where this stream have its spring with wood stretch down its side and cover the adjacent country here about nine mile to the north of the village deer haunt and be hunt i hear of one man who have already kill nine of these animal within two or three week a traveller from wyome county whom i meet at we inn give I some account of the winter life of the deer they inhabit he say the swamp of mountain-laurel thicket through which a man would find it almost impossible to make he way the laurel-bush and the hemlock scatter among they intercept the snow as it fall and form a thick roof under the shelter of which near some pool or rivulet the animal remain until spring open as snugly protect from the severity of the weather as sheep under the shed of a farm-yard here they feed upon the leaf of the laurel and other evergreen it be contrary to the law to kill they after the christmas holiday but sometimes they retreat be invade and a deer or two kill they flesh however be not wholesome on account of the laurel leave on which they feed and they skin be nearly worthless i express my surprise that the leaf of the mountain laurel the _ kalmium latifolium _ which be so deadly to sheep should be the winter food of the deer it be because the deer have no gall answer the man that the pison do not take effect but they meat will not do to eat except in a small quantity and cook with pork which i think help take the pison out of it the deer he go on to say be now pass out of the blue into the gray after the holiday when they hair become long and they winter coat be quite grow they hide be soft and tender and tear easily when dress and it would be folly to kill they even if there be no law against it he go on to find a parallel to the case of the deer-skin in the hide of neat-cattle which when bring from a hot country like south america be firmer and tougher than when obtain in a colder climate like ours the wyoming traveller give a bad account of the health just at present of the beautiful valley in which he live we have never before say he know what it be to have the fever and ague among we but now it be very common as well as other fever the season have neither be uncommonly wet nor uncommonly dry but it have be uncommonly hot i hear the same account of various other district in pennsylvanium mifflin county for example be sickly this season as well as other part of the state which hitherto have be almost uniformly healthy here however in stroudsburg and its neighborhood they boast that the fever and ague have never yet make its appearance i be glad to hear a good account of the pecuniary circumstance of the pennsylvanium farmer they get in debt like every body else during the prosperous year of 1835 and 1836 and have be ever since work themselves gradually out of it i have never say a intelligent gentleman of stroudsburg know the owner of the farm so free from debt and so generally easy and prosperous in they condition as at this moment it be to be hope that have be so successful in pay they private debt they will now try what can be do with the debt of the state we leave stroudsburg this morning -- one of the finest morning of this autumnal season -- and soon climb a eminence which look down upon cherry hollow this place remind I with the exception of its forest of the valley in the peak of derbyshire the same rounded summit the same green basin-like hollow but here on the hill-side be tall grove of oak and chestnut instead of the brown heath and the large stone house of the german householder be very unlike the derbyshire cottage the valley be four mile in length and its eastern extremity be wash by the delaware climb out of this valley and pass for some mile through yellow wood and field of spring corn not indian corn we find ourselves at length travel on the side of another long valley which terminate at its southern extremity in the wind gap the wind gap be a opening in the same mountain ridge which be cleave by the water gap but unlike that it extend only about half-way down to the base through this open border on each side by large loose block of stone the road pass after you have reach the open country beyond you look back and see the ridge stretch away eastward towards the water gap and in the other direction towards the southwest till it sink out of sight a rocky wall of uniform height with this opening in the midst which look as if part of the mountain have here fall into a abyss below beyond the wind gap we come to the village of windham lie in the shelter of this mountain barrier and here about twelve o'clock we driver stop a moment at a inn to give water to he horse the bar-room be full of fresh-colored young man in military uniform talk pennsylvanium german rather rapidly and vociferously they surround a thick-set man in a cap and shirt-sleeve whom they call tscho or joe and insist that he should give they a tune on he fiddle spiel tscho spiel spiel be shout on every side and at last tscho take the floor with a fiddle and begin to play about a dozen of the young man stand up on the floor in couple face each other and hammer out the tune with they foot give a tread or tap on the floor to correspond with every note of the instrument and occasionally cross from side to side i have never see dancing more diligently perform when the player have draw the final squeak from he violin we get into we vehicle and in somewhat more than a hour be enter the little village of nazareth pleasantly situate among field the autumnal verdure of which indicate they fertility nazareth be a moravian village of four or five hundred inhabitant look prodigiously like a little town of the old world except that it be more neatly keep the house be square and solid of stone or brick build immediately on the street a pavement of broad flag run under they window and between the flag and the carriage-way be a row of tree in the center of the village be a square with a arcade for a market and a little aside from the main street in a hollow cover with bright green grass be another square in the midst of which stand a large white church near it be a avenue with two immense lime-tree grow at the gate lead to the field in which they bury they dead look upon this square be a large building three or four story high where a school for boy be keep to which pupil be send from various part of the country and which enjoy a very good reputation we enter the garden of this school a inclosure thickly overshadow with tall forest and exotic tree of various kind with shrub below and wind walk and summer-house and bench the boy of the school be amusing themselves under the tree and the arched walk be ring with they shrill voice we visit also the bury place which be situate on a little eminence back with a wood and command a view of the village the moravian grave be simple in its decoration a small flat stone of a square shape lie in the midst between the head and foot be inscribe with the name of the dead the time and place of he birth and the time when to use they own language he depart and this be the sole epitaph but innovation have be recently make on this simplicity a rhyming couplet or quatrain be now sometimes add or a word in praise of the dead one recent grave be load with a thick tablet of white marble which cover it entirely and bear a inscription as voluminous as those in the burial place of other denomination the grave as in all moravian bury grounds be arrange in regular row with path at right angle between they and sometimes a rose-tree be plant at the head of the sleeper as we be leave nazareth the innkeeper come to we and ask if we would allow a man who be travel to easton to take a seat in we carriage with the driver we consent and a respectable-looking well-clad middle-aged person make he appearance when we have proceed a little way we ask he some question to which he make no other reply than to shake he head and we soon find that he understand no english i try he with german which bring a ready reply in the same language he be a native of pennsylvanium he tell I bear at snow hill in lehigh county not very many mile from nazareth in turn he ask I where i come from and when i bid he guess he assign my birthplace to germany which show at least that he be not very accurately instruct in the diversity with which he mother tongue be speak as we enter easton the yellow wood on the hill and peak that surround the place be light up with a glowing autumnal sunset soon afterward we cross the lehigh and take a walk along its bank in south easton where a little town have recently grow up the sidewalk along its dusty street be freshly sweep for Saturday night as it begin to grow dark we find ourselves stroll in front of a row of iron mill with the canal on one side and the lehigh on the other one of these be a roll mill into which we could look from the bank where we stand and observe the whole process of the manufacture which be very striking the whole interior of the building be light at night only by the mouth of several furnace which be kindle to a white heat out of one of these a thick bar of iron about six foot in length and heat to a perfect whiteness be draw and one end of it present to the cylinder of the mill which seize it and draw it through between they roll out to three or four times its original size a sooty workman grasp the opposite end of the bar with pincers as soon as it be fairly through and return it again to the cylinder which deliver it again on the opposite side in this way it pass backward and forward till it be roll into a enormous length and shoot across the black floor with a twining motion like a serpent of fire at last when press to the proper thinness and length it be coil up into a circle by the help of a machine contrived for the purpose which roll it up as a shopkeeper roll up a ribbon we find a man near where we stand begrime by the soot of the furnace handle the clumsy mass of iron which bear the name of bloom the roll mill he say belong to rodenbough stewart & co who have very extensive contract for furnish iron to the nailmaker and wire manufacturer will they stop the mill for the new tariff say i they will stop for nothing reply the man the new tariff be a good tariff if people would but think so it cost the iron-masters fifteen dollar a ton to make they iron and they sell it for forty dollar a ton if the new tariff oblige they to sell it for considerable less they will still make money so revolve the cycle of opinion twenty year ago a pennsylvanian who question the policy of the protective system would have be look upon as a sort of curiosity now the bloomers and stable-boy begin to talk free trade what will they talk twenty year hence letter xl boston -- lawrence -- portland portland _ July _ 31 1847 i leave boston for this place a few day since by one of the railway i never come to boston or go out of it without be agreeably strike with the civility and respectable appearance of the hackney-coachman the porter and other for whose service the traveller have occasion you feel generally in you intercourse with these person that you be deal with man who have a character to maintain there be a sober substantial look about the dwelling of boston which please I more than the gayer aspect of we own city in new york we be careful to keep the outside of we house fresh with paint a practice which do not exist here and which i suppose we inherit from the hollander who learn it i know not where -- could it have be from the chinese the country house of holland along the canal be bright with paint often of several different color and be as gay as pagoda in they moist climate where mould and moss so speedily gather the practice may be found in better reason than it be with we boston say a friend to whom i speak of the appearance of comfort and thrift in that city be a much more crowded place than you imagine and where people be crowd there can not be comfort in many of the neighborhood back of those house which present so respectable a aspect be building rise close to each other inhabit by the poorer class whose family be huddle together without sufficient space and air and here it be that boston poverty hide itself you be more fortunate on you island that you population can extend itself horizontally instead of heap itself up as we have begin to do here the first place which we could call pleasant after leave boston be andover where stuart and wood now venerable with year instruct the young orthodox minister and missionary of new england it be prettily situate among green declivity a little beyond at north andover we come in sight of the roof and spire of the new city of lawrence which already begin to show proudly on the sandy and sterile bank of the merrimac a rapid and shallow river a year ago last February the building of the city be begin it have now five or six thousand inhabitant and new colonist be daily thronging in brick kiln be smoke all over the country to supply material for the wall of the dwelling the place i be tell astonish visitor with its bustle and confusion the street be encumber with heap of fresh earth and pile of stone brick beam and board and people can with difficulty hear each other speak for the constant thundering of hammer and the shout of cartman and wagoner urge they ox and horse with they load through the deep sand of the way before the last shower say a passenger you could hardly see the city from this spot on account of the cloud of dust that hang perpetually over it rome say the old adage be not build in a day but here be a city which in respect of its growth put rome to shame the romulus of this new city who like the latian of old give he name to the community of which he be the founder be mr abbot lawrence of boston a rich manufacturer money-making and munificent and more fortunate in build city and endow school than in foretell political event he be the modern amphion to the sound of whose music the pleasant chink of dollar gather in many a goodly dividend all the stone which form the foundation of this thebe dance into they place and half the mountain roll into a wall beyond lawrence in the state of new hampshire the train stop a moment at exeter which those who delight in such comparison might call the eton of new england it be celebrate for its academy where bancroft everett and i know not how many more of the new england scholar and man of letter receive the first rudiment of they education it lie in a gentle depression of the surface of the country not deep enough to be call a valley on the bank of a little stream and have a pleasant retired aspect at durham some ten mile further on we find a long train of freight-car crowd with the child of a sunday-school just ready to set out on a pic-nic party the boy shout and the girl of whom the number be prodigious show we they smile face a few middle-aged man and a still greater number of matron be disperse among they to keep they in order at dover where be several cotton mill we see a similar train with a still larger crowd and when we cross the boundary of new hampshire and enter south berwick in maine we pass through a solitary forest of oak where long table and bench have be erect for they reception and the bird be twitter in the branch over they at length the sight of numerous group gather blue-berry in a extensive tract of shrubby pasture indicate that we be approach a town and in a few minute we have arrive at portland the conductor whom we find intelligent and communicative recommend that we should take quarter during we stay at a place call the veranda or oak grove on the water about two mile from the town and we follow he advice we drive through portland which be nobly situate on a eminence overlook casco bay its maze of channel and almost innumerable island with they green slope cultivate field and rocky shore we pass one arm of the sea after another on bridge and at length find ourselves on a fine bold promontory between presumpscot river and the water of casco bay here a house of entertainment have just be open -- the beginning of a new watering-place which i be sure will become a favorite one in the hot month of we summer the surrounding country be so intersect with strait that let the wind come from what quarter it may it breathe cool over the water and the tide rise twelve foot can not ebb and flow without push forward the air and draw it back again and thus cause a motion of the atmosphere in the stillest weather we pass twenty-four hour in this pleasant retreat among the oak of its grove and along its rocky shore enjoy the agreeable coolness of the fresh and brace atmosphere to tell the truth we have find it quite cool enough ever since we reach boston five day ago sometimes in fact a little too cool for the thin garment we be accustom to wear at this season return to portland we take passage in the steamer huntress for augusta up the kennebeck i think to give you in this letter a amount of this part of my journey but i find i must reserve it for my next letter xli the kennebeck keene new hampshire _ August 11 1847 _ we leave portland early in the afternoon on board the steamer huntress and sweep out of the harbor among the numerous green island which here break the swell of the atlantic and keep the water almost as smooth as that of the hudson it be say remark a passenger that there be as many of these island as there be day in the year but i do not know that any body have ever count they two of the loftiest rock-bound with verdant summit and stand out beyond the rest overlook the main ocean bear light-house and near these we enter the mouth of the kennebeck which here come into the sea between bank of massive rock at the mouth of the river be forest of stake for the support of the net in which salmon shad and alewife be take the shad fishery they tell I be not yet over though the month of August be already come we pass some small village where we see the keel of large unfinished vessel lie high upon the stock at bath one of the most considerable of these place but a small village still be five or six on which the ship-builder be busy these i be tell when once launch would never be see again in the place where they be build but would convey merchandise between the great port of the world the activity of ship-building in the state of maine say a gentleman whom i afterward meet be at this moment far greater than you can form any idea of without travel along we coast in solitary place where a stream or creek large enough to float a ship be find we builder lay the keel of they vessel it be not necessary that the channel should be wide enough for the ship to turn round it be enough if it will contain she lengthwise they choose a bend in the river from which they can launch she with she head down stream and aid by the tide float she out to sea after which she proceed to boston or new york or some other of we large seaport to do she part in carry on the commerce of the world i learn that the ship-builder of maine purchase large tract of forest in virginium and other state of the south for they supply of timber they obtain they oak from the virginium shore they hard pine from north carolina the covering of the deck and the smaller timber of the large vessel be furnish by maine they take to the south cargo of lime and other product of maine and bring back the huge trunk produce in that region the larger tree on the bank of the navigable river of maine be long ago work into the keel of vessel it be not far from bath and a considerable distance from the open sea that we see a large seal on a rock in the river he turn he head slowly from side to side as we pass without allow himself to be disturb by the noise we make and keep he place as long as the eye could distinguish he the presence of a animal always associate in the imagination with uninhabited coast of the ocean make we feel that we be advance into a thinly or at least a newly peopled country above bath the channel of the kennebeck widen into what be call merrymeet bay here the great androscoggin bring in its water from the southwest and various other small stream from different quarter enter the bay make it a kind of congress of river it be full of wooded island and rocky promontory project into the water and overshade it with they tree as we pass up we see from time to time farm pleasantly situate on the island or the border of the river where a soil more genial or more easily till have tempt the settler to fix himself at length we approach gardiner a flourish village beautifully situate among the hill on the right bank of the kennebeck all trace of sterility have already disappear from the country the shore of the river be no longer rock-bound but disposed in green terrace with woody eminence behind they leave gardiner behind we we go on to hallowell a village bearing similar mark of prosperity where we land and be take in carriage to augusta the seat of government three or four mile beyond augusta be a pretty village seat on green and apparently fertile eminence that overlook the kennebeck and itself overlook by still higher summit cover with wood the house be neat and shaded with tree as be the case with all new england village in the agricultural district i find the legislature in session the senate a small quiet body deliberate for aught i could see with as much grave and tranquil dignity as the senate of the united state the house of representative be just at the moment occupy by some railway question which i be tell excite more feeling than any subject that have be debate in the whole session but even this occasion no unseemly agitation the surface be gently rippled nothing more while at augusta we cross the river and visit the insane asylum a state institution lie on the pleasant declivity of the opposite shore it be a handsome stone build one of the medical attendant accompany we over a part of the building and show we some of the ward in which there be then scarcely any patient and which appear to be in excellent order with the best arrangement for the comfort of the inmate and a scrupulous attention to cleanliness when we express a desire to see the patient and to learn something of the manner in which they be treat he reply we do not make a show of we patient we only show the building we visit be of course soon dispatch we learn afterward that this be either insolence or laziness on the part of the officer in question whose business it properly be to satisfy any reasonable curiosity express by visitor it have be we intention to cross the country from augusta directly to the white hill in new hampshire and we take seat in the stage-coach with that view back of augusta the country swell into hill of considerable height with deep hollow between in which lie a multitude of lake we pass several of these beautifully embosome among wood meadow and pasture and be tell that if we continue on the course we have take we should scarcely ever find ourselves without some sheet of water in sight till we arrive at fryeburg on the boundary between maine and new hampshire one of they in the township of winthrop strike we as particularly beautiful its shore be clean and bold with little promontory run far into the water and several small island at winthrop we find that the coach in which we set out would proceed to portland and that if we intend to go on to fryeburg we must take seat in a shabby wagon without the least protection for we baggage it be already begin to rain and this circumstance decide we we remain in the coach and proceed on we return to portland i have scarcely ever travel in a country which present a finer appearance of agricultural thrift and prosperity than the portion of the county of kennebeck and cumberland through which we road carry we the dwelling be large neatly paint surround with fruit-tree and shrub and the farm in excellent order and apparently productive we descend at length into the low country cross the androscoggin to the county of york where as we proceed the country become more sandy and sterile and the house have a neglect aspect at length after a journey of fifty or sixty mile in the rain we be again set down in the pleasant town of portland letter xlii the white mountain springfield mass _ August _ 13 1847 i have not space in my last letter which be write from keene in new hampshire to speak of a visit i have just make to the white mountain do not think i be go to bear you with a set description of my journey and ascent of mount washington a few note of the excursion may possibly amuse you from conway where the stage-coach set you down for the night in sight of the summit of the mountain the road to the old notch be a very picturesque one you follow the path of the saco along a wide valley sometimes in the wood that overhang its bank and sometimes on the edge of rich grassy meadow till at length as you leave behind you one summit after another you find yourself in a little plain apparently inclose on every side by mountain further on you enter the deep gorge which lead gradually upward to the notch in the midst of it be situate the willey house near which the willey family be overtake by a avalanche and perish as they be make they escape it be now enlarged into a house of accommodation for visitor to the mountain nothing can exceed the aspect of desolation present by the lofty mountain-ridge which rise on each side they be streak with the path of landslide occur at different period which have leave the rocky rib of the mountain bare from they bald top to the forest at they foot and have fill the side of the valley with heap of earth gravel stone and trunk of tree from the willey house you ascend for about two mile a declivity by no means steep with these dark ridge frown over you you path here and there cross by stream which have make for themselves passage in the granite side of the mountain like narrow staircase down which they come tumble from one vast block to another i afterward make acquaintance with two of these and follow they upward from one clear pool and one white cascade to another till i be tire the road at length pass through what may be compare to a natural gateway a narrow chasm between tall cliff and through which the saco now a mere brook find its way you find yourself in a green opening look like the bottom of a drain lake with mountain summit around you here be one of the house of accommodation from which you ascend mount washington if you should ever think of ascend mount washington do not allow any of the hotel-keeper to cheat you in regard to the distance it be about ten mile from either the hotel to the summit and very little less from any of they they keep a set of worn-out horse which they hire for the season and which be train to climb the mountain in a walk by the worst bridle-path in the world the poor hack be generally tolerably sure-footed but there be exception to this guide be send with the visitor who generally go on foot strong-legged man carry long stave and watch the lady lest any accident should occur some of these especially those from the house in the notch commonly call tom crawford 's be unmannerly fellow enough the scenery of these mountain have not be sufficiently praise but for the glacier but for the peak white with perpetual snow it would be scarcely worth while to see switzerland after see the white mountain the depth of the valley the steepness of the mountain-side the variety of aspect show by they summit the deep gulf of forest below seam with the open course of river the vast extent of the mountain region see north and south of we gleam with many lake take I with surprise and astonishment imagine the forest to be shear from half the broad declivity -- imagine scatter habitation on the thick green turf and footpath lead from one to the other and herd and flock browz and you have switzerland before you i admit however that these accessory add to the variety and interest of the landscape and perhaps heighten the idea of its vastness i have be tell however that the white mountain in autumn present a aspect more glorious than even the splendor of the perpetual ice of the alp all this mighty multitude of mountain rise from valley fill with dense forest have then put on they hue of gold and scarlet and see more distinctly on account of they brightness of color seem to tower higher in the clear blue of the sky at that season of the year they be little visit and only awaken the wonder of the occasional traveller it be not necessary to ascend mount washington to enjoy the finest view some of the lower peak offer grander though not so extensive one the height of the main summit seem to diminish the size of the object behold from it the sense of solitude and immensity be however most strongly feel on that great cone overlook all the rest and form of loose rock which seem as if break into fragment by the power which upheave these ridge from the depths of the earth below at some distance on the northern side of one of the summit i see a large snow-drift lie in the August sunshine the franconium notch which we afterwards visit be almost as remarkable for the two beautiful little lake within it as for the savage grandeur of the mountain-wall between which it pass at this place i be show a hen cluck over a brood of young puppy they be litter near the nest where she be sit when she immediately abandon she egg and adopt they as she offspring she have a battle with the mother and prove victorious after which however a compromise take place the slut nurse the puppy and the hen cover they as well as she could with she wing she be strut among they when i see she with a appearance of pride at have produce so gigantic a brood from franconium we proceed to bath on or near the connecticut and enter the lovely valley of that river which be as beautiful in new hampshire as in any part of its course hanover the seat of dartmouth college be a pleasant spot but the traveller will find there the worst hotel on the river windsor on the vermont side be a still finer village with trim garden and street shaded by old tree bellows fall be one of the most striking place for its scenery in all new england the coach bring we to the railway station in the pleasant village of greenfield we take seat in the train and leave on we leave the quiet old street of deerfield under they ancient tree and pass a dozen or more of the village on the meadow of the connecticut find ourselves in less than two hour in this flourish place which be rapidly rise to be one of the most important town in new england letter xliii a passage to savannah augusta georgium _ march 29 1849 _ a quiet passage by sea from new york to savannah would seem to afford little matter for a letter yet those who take the trouble to read what i be about to write will i hope admit that there be some thing to be observe even on such a voyage it be indeed a remarkably quiet one and worthy of note on that account if on no other we have a quiet vessel quiet weather a quiet good-natured captain a quiet crew and remarkably quiet passenger when we leave the wharf at new york last week in the good steamship tennessee we be not conscious at first as we sit in the cabin that she be in motion and proceed down the harbor there be no beating or churning of the sea no struggle to get forward she paddle play in the water as smoothly as those of a terrapin without jar or noise the tennessee be one of the tightest and strongest boat that navigate we coast the very flooring of she deck be compose of timber instead of plank and help to keep she massive frame more compactly and solidly together it be she first voyage she fifty-one passenger loll on sofa fresh from the upholsterer 's and sleep on mattress which have never be press by the human form before in state-room where foul air have never collect nor be it possible that the air should become impure in they to any great degree for the tennessee be the best-ventilated ship i ever be in the main cabin and the state-room be connect with each other and with the deck by numerous opening and pipe which keep up a constant circulation of air in every part i have speak of the passenger as remarkably quiet person several of they i believe never speak during the passage at least so it seem to I the silence would have be almost irksome but for two lively little girl who amuse we by they prattle and two young woman apparently just marry too happy to do any thing but laugh even when suffer from seasickness and whom we now and then hear shout and squeal from they state-room there be two dark-haired long-limbed gentleman who lay the greater part of the first and second day at full length on the sofa in the after-cabin each with a spittoon before he chew tobacco with great rapidity and industry and apparently absorb in the endeavor to fill it within a give time there be another with that atrabilious complexion peculiar to marshy country and circle of a still deeper hue about he eye who sit on deck speechless and motionless wholly indifferent to the sound of the dinner-bell he countenance fix in a expression which seem to indicate a utter disgust of life yet we have some snatch of good talk on the voyage a robust old gentleman a native of norwalk in connecticut tell we that he have be read a history of that place by the rev mr hall i find say he that in he account of the remarkable people of norwalk he have omit to speak of two of the most remarkable two spinster sarah and phebe comstock relative of mine and friend of my youth of whom i retain a vivid recollection they be in opulent circumstance for the neighborhood in which they live possess a farm of about two hundred acre they be industrious frugal and extremely charitable but they never relieve a poor family without visit it and inquire carefully into its circumstance sarah be the housekeeper and phebe the farmer phebe know nothing of kitchen matter but she know at what time of the year greensward should be break up and corn plant and potato dig she drop indian corn and sow english grain with she own hand in the time of planting or of harvest it be sarah who visit and relieve the poor i remember that they have various way of employ the young people who call upon they if it be late in the autumn there be a chopping-board and chopping-knife ready with the foot of neat-cattle from which the oily part have be extract by boil ` you do not want to be idle ' they would say ` chop this meat and you shall have you share of the mince-pie that we be go to make ' at other time a supply of old woollen stocking be ready for unraveling ` we know you do not care to be idle ' they would say ` here be some stocking which you would oblige we by unravel ' if you ask what use they make of the spool of woollen thread obtain by this process they would answer : ` we use it as the weft of the linsey-woolsey with which we clothe we negro ' they have negro slave in those time and old tone a faithful black servant of theirs who have see more than a hundred year be alive yet they practice one very peculiar piece of economy the white hickory you know yield the purest and sweetest of saccharine juice they have they hickory fuel cut into short billet which before place on the fire they lay on the andiron a little in front of the blaze so as to subject it to a pretty strong heat this cause the syrup in the wood to drop from each end of the billet where it be catch in a cup and in this way a gallon or two be collect in the course of a fortnight with this they flavor they finest cake they die about thirty year since one at the age of eighty-nine and the other at the age of ninety on the tomb-stone of one of they it be record that she have be a member of the church for seventy year they father be a remarkable man in he way he be a rich man in he time and keep a park of deer one of the last know in connecticut for the purpose of supply he table with venison he pride himself on the strict and literal fulfillment of he word on one occasion he have a law-suit with one of he neighbor before a justice of the peace in which he be cast and order to pay ten shilling damages and a shilling as the fee of court he pay the ten shilling and ask the justice whether he would allow he to pay the remain shilling when he next pass he door the magistrate readily consent but from that time old comstock never go by he house whenever he have occasion to go to church or to any other place the direct road to which lead by the justice 's door he be careful to take a lane which pass behind the dwelling and at some distance from it the shilling remain unpaid up to the day of he death and it be find that in he last will he have direct that he corpse should be carry by that lane to the place of interment when we leave the quarantine ground on Thursday morning after lie moor all night with a heavy rain beating on the deck the sky be begin to clear with a strong northwest wind and the deck be slippery with ice when the sun rise it throw a cold white light upon the water and the passenger who appear on deck be muffle to the eye as we proceed southwardly the temperature grow milder and the day close with a calm and pleasant sunset the next day the weather be still milder until about noon when we arrive off cape hattera a strong wind set in from the northeast cloud gather with a showery aspect and every thing seem to betoken a impending storm at this moment the captain shift the direction of the voyage from south to southwest we run before the wind leave the storm if there be any behind we and the day close with another quiet and brilliant sunset the next day the third of we voyage break upon we like a day in summer with amber-colored sunshine and the blandest breeze that ever blow a awning be stretch over the deck to protect we from the beam of the sun and all the passenger gather under it the two dark-complexioned gentleman leave the task of fill the spittoon below and come up to chew they tobacco on deck the atrabilious passenger be see to interest himself in the direction of the compass and once be think to smile and the hale old gentleman repeat the history of he norwalk relative on the fourth morning we land at savannah it be delightful to eye which have see only russet field and leafless tree for month to gaze on the new and delicate green of the tree and the herbage the weep willow droop in full leaf the later oak be put forth they new foliage the locust-tree have hang out they tender spray and they cluster of blossom not yet unfold the chinese wistarium cover the side of house with its festoon of blue blossom and rose be nod at we in the wind from the top of the brick wall which surround the garden yet winter have be here i see the orange-tree which since the great frost seven or eight year ago have spring from the ground and grow to the height of fifteen or twenty foot have a few day before my arrival feel another severe frost and stand cover with sere dry leaf in the garden some of they yet cover with fruit the tree be not kill however as formerly though they will produce no fruit this season and new leaf-bud be begin to sprout on they bough the dwarf-orange a hardier tree have escape entirely and its blossom be begin to open i visit bonaventure which i formerly describe in one of my letter it have lose the interest of utter solitude and desertion which it then have a gothic cottage have be build on the place and the avenue of live-oak have be surround with a inclosure for the purpose of make a cemetery on the spot yet there they stand as solemn as ever lift and stretch they long irregular branch overhead hang with mass and festoon of gray moss it almost seem when i look up to they as if the cloud have come nearer to the earth than be they wont and form themselves into the shadowy rib of the vault above I the drive to bonaventure at this season of the year be very beautiful though the road be sandy it be partly along a avenue of tall tree and partly through the wood where the dog-wood and azalea and thorn-tree be in blossom and the ground be sprinkle with flower here and there be dwelling beside the road they be unsafe the greater part of the year say the gentleman who drive I out and who speak from professional knowledge a summer residence in they be sure to bring dangerous fever savannah be a healthy city but it be like rome imprison by malaria the city of savannah since i see it six year ago have enlarged considerably and the addition make to it increase its beauty the street have be extend on the south side on the same plan as those of the rest of the city with small park at short distance from each other plant with tree and the new house be handsome and well-built the communication open with the interior by long line of railway have no doubt be the principal occasion of this prosperity these and the savannah river send enormous quantity of cotton to the savannah market one should see with the bodily eye the multitude of bale of this commodity accumulate in the warehouse and elsewhere in order to form a idea of the extent to which it be produce in the southern state -- long train of car heap with bale steamer after steamer load high with bale come down the river acre of bale on the wharf acre of bale at the railway station -- one should see all this and then carry he thought to the million of the civilized world who be clothe by this great staple of we country i come to this place by steamer to charleston and then by railway the line of the railway one hundred and thirty-seven mile in length pass through the most unproductive district of south carolina it be in fact nothing but a waste of forest with here and there a open field half a dozen glimpse of plantation and about as many village none of which be considerable and some of which consist of not more than half a dozen house aiken however sixteen mile before you reach the savannah river have a pleasant aspect it be situate on a comparatively high tract of country sandy and barren but healthy and hither the planter resort in the hot month from they home in the less salubrious district pretty cottage stand disperse among the oak and pine and immediately west of the place the country descend in pleasant undulation towards the valley of the savannah the appearance of augusta strike I very agreeably as i reach it on a most delightful afternoon which seem to I more like June than march i be delighted to see turf again regular greensward of sweet grass and clover such as you see in may in the northern state and do not meet on the coast in the southern state the city lie on a broad rich plain on the savannah river with woody declivity to the north and west i have see several thing here since my arrival which interested I much and if i can command time i will speak of they in another letter letter xliv southern cotton mill barnwell district south carolina _ march _ 31 1849 i promise to say something more of augusta if i have time before depart from cuba and i find that i have a few moment to spare for a hasty letter the people of augusta boast of the beauty of they place and not without some reason the street be broad and in some part overshadow with row of fine tree the bank of the river on which it stand be high and firm and slope half cover with forest of a pleasant aspect overlook it from the west and from the carolina side to the south stretch a broad champaign country on which be some of the finest plantation of georgium i visit one of these consist of ten thousand acre keep throughout in as perfect order as a small farm at the north though large enough for a german principality but what interested I most be a visit to a cotton mill in the neighborhood -- a sample of a class of manufacture establishment where the poor white people of this state and of south carolina find occupation it be a large manufactory and the machinery be in as perfect order as in any of the mill at the north here say a gentleman who accompany we as we enter the long apartment in the second story you will see a sample of the brunette of the piny wood the girl of various age who be employ at the spindle have for the most part a sallow sickly complexion and in many of they face i remark that look of mingled distrust and dejection which often accompany the condition of extreme hopeless poverty these poor girl say one of we party think themselves extremely fortunate to be employ here and accept work gladly they come from the most barren part of carolina and georgium where they family live wretchedly often upon unwholesome food and as idly as wretchedly for hitherto there have be no manual occupation provide for they from which they do not shrink as disgraceful on account of its be the occupation of slave in these factory negro be not employ as operative and this give the calling of the factory girl a certain dignity you would be surprise to see the change which a short time effect in these poor people they come barefooted dirty and in rag they be scour put into shoe and stocking set at work and send regularly to the sunday-school where they be teach what none of they have be teach before -- to read and write in a short time they become expert at they work they lose they sullen shyness and they physiognomy become comparatively open and cheerful they family be relieve from the temptation to theft and other shameful course which accompany the condition of poverty without occupation they have a good deal of the poke-easy manner of the piny wood about they yet say one of we party a georgian it be true i perceive that they have not yet acquire all that alacrity and quickness in they work which you see in the work-people of the new england mill in one of the upper story i see a girl of a clearer complexion than the rest with two long curl swing behind each ear as she step about with the air of a duchess that girl be from the north say we conductor at first we place a expert operative from the north in each story of the building as a instructor and pattern to the rest i have since learn that some attempt be make at first to induce the poor white people to work side by side with the black in these mill these utterly fail and the question then become with the proprietor whether they should employ black only or whites only whether they should give these poor people a occupation which while it tend to elevate they condition secure a more expert class of work-people than the negro could be expect to become or whether they should rely upon the less intelligent and more negligent service of slave they decide at length upon banish the labor of black from they mill at graniteville in south carolina about ten mile from the savannah river a neat little manufacturing village have lately be build up where the family of the _ cracker _ as they be call reclaim from they idle life in the wood be settle and white labor only be employ the enterprise be say to be in a most prosperous condition only coarse cloth be make in these mill -- strong thick fabric suitable for negro shirting -- and the demand for this kind of goods i be tell be greater than the supply every yard make in this manufactory at augusta be take off as soon as it leave the loom i fall in with a northern man in the course of the day who tell I that these mill have drive the northern manufacturer of coarse cotton out of the southern market the building be erect here more cheaply he continue there be far less expense in fuel and the wages of the workpeople be less at first the boy and girl of the cracker family be engage for little more than they board they wages be now better but they be still low i be about to go to the north and i shall do my best to persuade some of my friend who have be almost ruin by this southern competition to come to augusta and set up cotton mill there be water-power at augusta sufficient to turn the machinery of many large establishment a canal from the savannah river bring in a large volume of water which pass from level to level and might be make to turn the spindle and drive the loom of a populous manufacturing town such it will become if any faith be to be place in present indication and a considerable manufacturing population will be settle at this place draw from the half-wild inhabitant of the most barren part of the southern state i look upon the introduction of manufacture at the south as a event of the most favorable promise for that part of the country since it both condense a class of population too thinly scatter to have the benefit of the institution of civilized life of education and religion -- and restore one branch of labor at least to its proper dignity in a region where manual labor have be the badge of servitude and dependence one of the pleasantest spot in the neighborhood of augusta be somerville a sandy eminence cover with wood the shade of which be carefully cherish and in the midst of which be numerous cottage and country seat closely embower in tree with pleasant path lead to they from the highway here the evening in summer be not so oppressively hot as in the town below and dense as the shade be the air be dry and elastic hither many family retire during the hot season and many reside here the year round we drive through it as the sun be set and call at the dwelling of several of the hospitable inhabitant the next morning the railway train bring we to barnwell district in south carolina where i write this i intend to send you some note of the agricultural change which i have observe in this part of south carolina since i be last here but i have hardly time to do it the culture of wheat have be introduce many planter now raise enough for they own consumption the sugar cane be also plant and quantity of sugar and molasses be often make sufficient to supply the plantation on which it be cultivate spinning-wheel and loom have come into use and a strong and durable cotton cloth be weave by the negro woman for the wear of the slave all this show a desire to make the most of the recource of the country and to protect the planter against the embarrassment which often arise from the fluctuate price of the great staple of the south -- cotton but i have no time to dwell upon this subject to-morrow i sail for cuba letter xlv the florida coast -- key west havana _ April _ 7 1849 it be a most agreeable voyage which i make in the steamer isabel to this port the wind in we favor the whole distance fine bright weather the temperature pass gradually from what we have it in new york at the end of may to what it be in the middle of June the isabel be a noble sea-boat of great strength not so well ventilate as the tennessee in which we come to savannah with spacious and comfortable cabin and i be sorry to say rather dirty state-room we stop off savannah near the close of the first day of we voyage to leave some of we passenger and take in other and on the second which be also the second of the month we be run rapidly down the florida coast with the trade-wind fresh on we beam sweep before it a long swell from the east in which we vessel rock too much for the stomach of most of the passenger the next day the sea be smoother we have change we direction somewhat and be go before the wind the florida reef full in sight with they long streak of white surf beyond which along the line of the shore lay a belt of water of bright translucent green and in front the wave wear a amethystine tint we sit the greater part of the day under a awning a long line with a baited hook at the end be let down into the water from the stern of we vessel and after be drag there a hour or two it be seize by a king-fish which be immediately haul on board it be a elegantly shaped fish weigh nearly twenty pound with a long head and scale shine with blue and purple it be serve up for dinner and its flavor much commend by the amateur the water around we be full of sail gleam in the sunshine they belong say we charleston pilot to the wrecker who live at key west every morning they come out and cruise among the reef to discover if there be any vessel wreck or in distress -- the night bring they back to the harbor on they island you reader know i presume that at key west be a town contain nearly three thousand inhabitant who subsist solely by the occupation of relieve vessel in distress navigate this dangerous coast and bring in such as be wreck the population of course increase with the commerce of the country and every vessel that sail from we port to the gulf of mexico or come from the gulf to the north every addition to the intercourse of the atlantic port with mobile new orlean the west indy or central america add to they chance of gain these people neither plant nor sow they isle be a low barren spot surround by a beach of white sand form of disintegrated porous limestone and a covering of the same sand spread thinly over the rock form its soil it be a scandal say the pilot that this coast be not better light a few light-house would make its navigation much safer and they would be build if florida have any man in congress to represent the matter properly to the government i have long be familiar with this coast -- sixty time at least i have make the voyage from charleston to havana and i be sure that there be no such dangerous navigation on the coast of the united state in go to havana or to new orlean or to other port on the gulf commander of vessel try to avoid the current of the gulf-stream which would carry they to the north and they therefore shave the florida coast and keep near the reef which you see yonder they often strike the reef inadvertently or be drive against they by storm in return northward the navigation be safer we give a good offing to the reef and strike out into the gulf-stream the current of which carry we in the direction of we voyage a little before nine o'clock we have enter the little harbor of key west and be moor in its still water it be a bright moonlight evening and we ramble two or three hour about the town and the island the hull of a dismasted vessel lay close by we landing-place it have no name on bow or stern and have just be find abandon at sea and bring in by the wrecker its cargo consist of logwood have be take out and lay in pile on the wharf this town have principally grow up since the florida war the habitation have a comfortable appearance some of they be quite neat but the sterility of the place be attest by the want of garden in some of the inclosure before the house however there be tropical shrub in flower and here the cocoanut-tree be grow and other tree of the palm kind which rustle with a sharp dry sound in the fresh wind from the sea they be the first palm i have see grow in the open air and they give a tropical aspect to the place we fall in with a man who have live thirteen year at key west he tell we that its three thousand inhabitant have four place of worship -- a episcopal a catholic a methodist and a baptist church and the drinking-house which we see open with such a elaborate display of bottle and decanter be not resort to by the people of the place but be the haunt of english and american sailor whom the disaster or the regular voyage of they vessel have bring hither he give we a account of the hurricane of September 1846 which overflow and lay waste the island here where we stand say he the water be four foot deep at least i save my family in a boat and carry they to a higher part of the island two house which i own be sweep away by the flood and i be ruin most of the house be unroofed by the wind every vessel belong to the place be lose dismasted hulk be float about and nobody know to whom they belong and dead body of man and woman lay scatter along the beach it be the worst hurricane ever know at key west before it come we use to have a hurricane regularly once in two year but we have have none since a bell be ring about this time and we ask the reason it be to signify that the negro must be at they home answer the man we inquire if there be many black in the place till lately he reply there be about eighty but since the united state government have begin to build the fort yonder they number have increase several broken-down planter who have no employment for they slave have send they to key west to be employ by the government we do not want they here and wish that the government would leave they on the hand of they master on the fourth morning when we go on deck the coast of cuba a ridge of dim hill be in sight and we vessel be roll in the unsteady wave of the gulf stream which here beat against the northern shore of the island it be a hot morning as the morning in this climate always be till the periodical breeze spring up about ten o'clock and refresh all the island that lie in the embrace of the gulf in a short time the cream-colored wall of the moro the strong castle which guard the entrance to the harbor of havana appear rise from the water we pass close to the cliff on which it be build be hail in english a gun be fire we steamer dart through a narrow entrance into the harbor and anchor in the midst of what appear a still inland lake the city of havana have a cheerful appearance see from the harbor its massive house build for the most part of the porous rock of the island be cover with stucco generally of a white or cream color but often stain sky-blue or bright yellow above these rise the dark tower and dome of the church apparently build of a more durable material and look more venerable for the gay color of the dwelling amidst which they stand the extensive fortification of cabañas crown the height on that side of the harbor which lie opposite to the town and south of the city a green fertile valley in which stand scatter palm-tree stretch towards the pleasant village of cerro we lay idly in the stream for two hour till the authority of the port could find time to visit we they arrive at last and without come on board subject the captain to a long question and search the newspaper he bring for intelligence relate to the health of the port from which he sail at last they give we leave to land without undergo a quarantine and withdraw take with they we passport we go on shore and after three hour further delay get we baggage through the custom-house letter xlvi havana havana _ April _ 10 1849 i find that it require a greater effort of resolution to sit down to the writing of a long letter in this soft climate than in the country i have leave i feel a temptation to sit idly and let the grateful wind from the sea come in at the broad window flow around I or read or talk as i happen to have a book or a companion that there be something in a tropical climate which indispose one to vigorous exertion i can well believe from what i experience in myself and what i see around I the lady do not seem to take the least exercise except a occasional drive on the paseo or public park they never walk out and when they be shop which be no less the vocation of they sex here than in other civilized country they never descend from they _ volante _ but the goods be bring out by the obsequious shopkeeper and the lady make she choice and discuss the price as she sit in she carriage yet the woman of cuba show no token of delicate health freshness of color do not belong to a latitude so near the equator but they have plump figure placid unwrinkled countenance a well-developed bust and eye the brilliant languor of which be not the languor of illness the girl as well as the young man have rather narrow shoulder but as they advance in life the chest in the woman particularly seem to expand from year to year till it attain a amplitude by no means common in we country i fully believe that this effect and they general health in spite of the inaction in which they pass they life be owe to the free circulation of air through they apartment for in cuba the woman as well as the man may be say to live in the open air they know nothing of close room in all the island and nothing of foul air and to this i have no doubt quite as much as to the mildness of the temperature the friendly effect of its climate upon invalid from the north be to be ascribe they ceiling be extremely lofty and the wide window extend from the top of the room to the floor and guard by long perpendicular bar of iron be without glass and when close be generally only close with blind which while they break the force of the wind when it be too strong do not exclude the air since i have be on the island i may be say to have breakfast and dine and sup and sleep in the open air in a atmosphere which be never in repose except for a short time in the morning after sunrise at other time a breeze be always stir in the day-time bringing in the air from the ocean and at night draw it out again to the sea in walk through the street of the town in cuba i have be entertain by the glimpse i have through the ample window of what be go on in the parlor sometimes a curtain hanging before they allow I only a sight of the small hand which clasp the bar of the grate and the dusky face and dark eye peep into the street and scanning the passer by at other time the whole room be see with its furniture and its female form sit in languid posture court the breeze as it enter from without in the evening as i pass along the narrow sidewalk of the narrow street i have be startle at find myself almost in the midst of a merry party gather about the window of a brilliantly light room and chatter the soft spanish of the island in voice that sound strangely near to I i have speak of they languid posture : they love to recline on sofa they house be fill with rocking-chair import from the united state they be fond of sit in chair tilted against the wall as we sometimes do at home indeed they go beyond we in this respect for in cuba they have invent a kind of chair which by lower the back and raise the knee place the sitter precisely in the posture he would take if he sit in a chair lean backward against a wall it be a luxurious attitude i must own and i do not wonder that it be a favorite with lazy people for it relieve one of all the trouble of keep the body upright it be the woman who form the large majority of the worshiper in the church i land here in passion week and the next day be holy Thursday when not a vehicle on wheel of any sort be allow to be see in the street and the lady contrary to they custom during the rest of the year be oblige to resort to the church on foot negro servant of both sex be see pass to and fro carry mat on which they mistress be to kneel in the morning service all the white female population young and old be dress in black with black lace veil in the afternoon three wooden or waxen image of the size of life represent christ in the different stage of he passion be place in the spacious church of st catharine which be so throng that i find it difficult to enter near the door be a figure of the savior sink under the weight of he cross and the worshiper be kneel to kiss he foot aged negro man and woman half-naked negro child lady richly attire little girl in parisian dress with lustrous black eye and a profusion of ringlet cast themselves down before the image and press they lip to its foot in a passion of devotion mother lead up they little one and show they how to perform this act of adoration i see matron and young woman rise from it with they eye red with tear the next day which be good Friday about twilight a long procession come trail slowly through the street under my window bear a image of the dead christ lie upon a cloth of gold it be accompany by a body of soldiery hold they musket reverse and a band play plaintive tune the crowd uncover they head as it pass on Saturday morning at ten o'clock the solemnity of holy week be over the bell ring a merry peal hundred of volante and dray which have stand ready harnessed rush into the street the city become suddenly noisy with the rattle of wheel and the tramp of horse the shop which have be shut for the last two day be open and the lady in white or light-colored muslin be proceed in they volante to purchase at the shop they costume for the easter festivity i pass the evening on the _ plaza de armas _ a public square in front of the governor 's house plant with palm and other tree pave with broad flag and border with a row of bench it be crowd with people in they best dress the lady mostly in white and without bonnet for the bonnet in this country be only worn while travel chair have be place for they in a double row around the edge of the square and a row of volante surround the square in each of which sit two or more lady the ample fold of they muslin dress flow out on each side over the step of the carriage the governor 's band play various air martial and civic with great beauty of execution the music continue for two hour and the throng with only occasional interval of conversation seem to give themselves up wholly to the enjoyment of listen to it it be a bright moonlight night so bright that one might almost see to read and the temperature the finest i can conceive a gentle breeze rustling among the palm overhead i be surprise at see around I so many fair brow and snowy neck it be the moonlight say i to myself or perhaps it be the effect of the white dress for the complexion of these lady seem to differ several shades from those which i see yesterday at the church a female acquaintance have since give I another solution of the matter the reason she say of the difference you perceive be this that during the ceremony of holy week they take off the _ cascarillum _ from they face and appear in they natural complexion i ask the meaning of the word _ cascarillum _ which i do not remember to have hear before it be the favorite cosmetic of the island and be make of egg-shell finely pulverize they often fairly plaster they face with it i have see a dark-skinned lady as white almost as marble at a ball they will sometimes at a morning call or a evening party withdraw to repair the _ cascarillum _ on they face i do not vouch for this tale but tell it as it be tell to I perhaps after all it be the moonlight which have produce this transformation though i have notice something of the same improvement of complexion just before sunset on the paseo isabel a public park without the city wall plant with row of tree where every afternoon the gentry of havana drive backward and forward in they volante with each a glitter harness and a liveried negro bestride in large jack-boot the single horse which draw the vehicle i have also the same afternoon visit the receptacle into which the population of the city be sweep when the game of life be play out -- the campo santo as it be call or public cemetery of havana go out of the city at the gate nearest the sea i pass through a street of the wretchedest house i have see the ocean be roar at my right on the coral rock which form the coast the dingy habitation be soon leave behind and i see the wave push forward by a fresh wind fling they spray almost into the road i next enter a short avenue of tree and in a few minute the volante stop at the gate of the cemetery in a little inclosure before the entrance a few starvling flower of europe be cultivate but the wild plant of the country flourish luxuriantly on the rich soil within a thick wall surround the cemetery in which be row of opening for coffin one above the other where the more opulent of the dead be entomb the coffin be thrust in endwise and the opening close with a marble slab bear a inscription most of these niche be already occupy but in the earth below by far the greater part of those who die at havana be bury without a monument or a grave which they be allow to hold a longer time than be necessary for they body to be consume in the quicklime which be throw upon they every day fresh trench be dig in which they body be throw generally without coffin two of these one near each wall of the cemetery be wait for the funeral i see where the spade have divide the bone of those who be bury there last and throw up the broken fragment mingle with mass of lime lock of hair and bit of clothing without the wall be a receptacle in which the skull and other larger bone dark with the mould of the grave be heap two or three person be walk about the cemetery when we first enter but it be now at length the cool of the day and the funeral begin to arrive they bring in first a rude black coffin broadest at the extremity which contain the head and place it at the end of one of the trench hurriedly produce a hammer and nail to fasten the lid before let it down when it be find that the box be too shallow at the narrower extremity the lid be remove for a moment and show the figure of a old man in a threadbare black coat white pantaloons and boot the negro who bear it beat out the bottom with the hammer so as to allow the lid to be fasten over the foot it be then nail down firmly with coarse nail the coffin be swing into the trench and the earth shovel upon it a middle-aged man wrho seem to be some relative of the dead lead up a little boy close to the grave and watch the process of fill it they speak to each other and smile stand till the pit be fill to the surface and the bearer have depart and then retire in they turn this be one of the more respectable class of funeral commonly the dead be pile without coffin one above the other in the trench the funeral now multiply the corpse of a little child be bring in uncoffined and another a young man who i be tell have cut he throat for love be bear towards one of the niche in the wall i hear loud voice which seem to proceed from the eastern side of the cemetery and which i think at first might be the recitation of a funeral service but no funeral service be say at these grave and after a time i perceive that they come from the window of a long building which overlook one side of the burial ground it be a mad-house the inmate exasperate at the spectacle before they be gesticulate from the window -- the woman scream and the man shout but no attention be pay to they uproar a lady however a stranger to the island who visit the campo santo that afternoon be so affect by the sight and sound of the place that she be bear out weep and almost in convulsion as we leave the place we find a crowd of volante about the gate a pompous bier with rich black hanging draw up a little beyond we meet one of another kind -- a long box with glass side and end in which lay the corpse of a woman dress in white with a black veil throw over the face the next day the festivity which be to indemnify the people for the austerity of lend and of passion week begin the cock-pit be open during the day and mask ball be give in the evening at the theater you know probably that cock-fighting be the principal diversion of the island have entirely supplant the national spectacle of bull-baiting cuba in fact seem to I a great poultry-yard i hear the crowing of cock in all quarter for the game-cock be the noisiest and most boastful of bird and be perpetually utter he note of defiance in the village i see the veteran of the pit a strong-legged race with they comb crop smooth to the head the feather pluck from every part of the body except they wing and the tail dock like that of a coach horse pick up they food in the lane among the chicken one old cripple i remember to have see in the little town of guine stiff with wound receive in combat who have probably get a furlough for life and who while limp among he female companion maintain a sort of strut in he gait and now and then stop to crow defiance to the world the peasant breed game-cock and bring they to market amateur in the town train they for they private amusement dealer in game-cock be as common as horse-jocky with we and every village have its cock-pit i go on Monday to the _ valla de gallos _ situate in that part of havana which lie without the wall here in a spacious inclosure be two amphitheatre of bench roof but without wall with a circular area in the midst each be crowd with people who be look at a cock-fight and half of whom seem vociferate with all they might i mount one of the outer bench and see one of the bird lay dead by the other in a few minute then be hear the chink of gold and silver piece as the betters step into the area and pay they wager the slay bird be carry out and throw on the ground and the victor take into the hand of the owner crow loudly in celebration of he victory two other bird be bring in and the cry of those who offer wager be hear on all side they cease at last and the cock be put down to begin the combat they fight warily at first but at length begin to strike in earnest the blood flow and the bystander be hear to vociferate _ ahí están pelezando _ -lrb- 4 -rrb- -- _ mata mata mata _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- gesticulate at the same time with great violence and new wager be lay as the interest of the combat increase in ten minute one of the bird be dispatch for the combat never end till one of they have he death-wound in the mean time several other combat have begin in smaller pit which lay within the same inclosure but be not surround with circle of bench i look upon the throng engage in this brutal sport with eager gesture and loud cry and could not help think how soon this noisy crowd would lie in heap in the pit of the campo santo in the evening be a mask ball in the tacon theater a spacious building one of the largest of its kind in the world the pit floor over with the whole depth of the stage open to the back wall of the edifice furnish a ball-room of immense size people in grotesque mask in hood or fancy dress be mingle with a throng clothe in the ordinary costume and spanish dance be perform to the music of a numerous band a well-dressed crowd fill the first and second tier of box the creole smoke everywhere and seem astonish when the soldier who stand at the door order he to throw away he light segar before enter once upon the floor however he light another segar in defiance of the prohibition the spanish dance with they graceful movement resemble the undulation of the sea in its gentlest mood be nowhere more gracefully perform than in cuba by the young woman bear on the island i could not help think however as i look on that gay crowd on the quaint masker and the dancer whose flexible limb seem sway to and fro by the breath of the music that all this be soon to end at the campo santo and i ask myself how many of all this crowd would be huddle uncoffined when they sport be over into the foul trench of the public cemetery letter xlvii scenery of cuba -- coffee plantation matanza _ April 16 1849 _ my expectation of the scenery of the island of cuba and of the magnificence of its vegetation have not be quite fulfil this place be but sixty mile to the east of havana but the railway which bring you hither take you over a sweep of a hundred and thirty mile through one of the most fertile district in the interior of the island i make a excursion from havana to san antonio de los baños a pleasant little town at nine league distance in a southeast direction from the capital in what be call the vuelta abajo i have also just return from a visit to some fine sugar estate to the southeast of matanza so that i may claim to have see something of the face of the country of which i speak at this season the hill about havana and the pasture everywhere have a arid look a russet hue like sandy field with we when scorch by a long drought on like we meadow in winter this however be the dry season and when i be tell that but two shower of rain have fall since October i could only wonder that so much vegetation be leave and that the verbena and other herbage which clothe the ground should yet retain as i perceive they do when i see they nearer a unextinguished life i have therefore the disadvantage of see cuba not only in the dry season but near the close of a uncommonly dry season next month the rainy season commence when the whole island i be tell even the barrenest part flush into a deep verdure creep plant climb over all the rock and ascend the tree and the mighty palm put out they new foliage shade however be the great luxury of a warm climate and why the people of cuba do not surround they habitation in the country in the village and in the environs of the large town with a dense umbrage of tree i confess i do not exactly understand in they rich soil and in they perpetually genial climate tree grow with great rapidity and they have many noble one both for size and foliage the royal palm with its tall straight columnar trunk of a whitish hue only uplift a corinthian capital of leaf and cast but a narrow shadow but it mingle finely with other tree and plant in avenue form a colonnade nobler than any of the portico to the ancient egyptian temple there be no thicker foliage or fresher green than that of the mango which daily drop its abundant fruit for several month in the year and the mamey and the sapote fruit-tree also be in leaf during the whole of the dry season even the indian fig which clasp and kill the largest tree of the forest and at last take they place a stately tree with a stout trunk of its own have its unfading leaf of vivid green it be impossible to avoid a expression of impatience that these tree have not be form into group embower the dwelling and into grove through which the beam of the sun here so fierce at noonday could not reach the ground beneath there be in fact nothing of ornamental cultivation in cuba except of the most formal kind some private garden there be carefully keep but all of the stiffest pattern there be nothing which bring out the larger vegetation of the region in that grandeur and magnificence which might belong to it in the quinta del obispo or bishop 's garden which be open to the public you find shade which you find nowhere else but the tree be plant in straight alley and the water-rose a species of water-lily of immense size fragrant and pink-colored grow in a square tank feed by a straight canal with side of hew stone let I say however that when i ask for tree i be refer to the hurricane which have recently ravage the island one of these sweep over cuba in 1844 uproot the palm and the orange grove and lay prostrate the avenue of tree on the coffee plantation the paseo isabel a public promenade between the wall of havana and the street of the new town be formerly over-canopied with lofty and spread tree which this tempest level to the ground it have now be plant with row of young tree which yield a meager shade in 1846 come another hurricane still more terrific destroy much of the beauty which the first have spare of late year also such of the orange-tree as be not uproot or have recently be plant have be attack by the insect which a few year since be so destructive to the same tree in florida the effect upon the tree resemble that of a blight the leaf grow sere and the branch die you may imagine therefore that i be somewhat disappointed not to find the air as it be at this season in the south of italy fragrant with the odor of orange and lemon blossom orange be scarce and not so fine at this moment in havana and matanza as in the fruit-shop of new york i hear however that there be portion of the island which be spare by these hurricane and that there be other where the ravages of the insect in the orange grove have nearly cease as i have be tell be also the case in florida i have mention my excursion to san antonio i go thither by railway in a car build at newark draw by a engine make in new york and work by a american engineer for some distance we pass through field of the sweet-potato which here never require a second planting and propagate itself perpetually in the soil patch of maize low grove of banana with they dark stem and of plantain with they green one and large tract produce the pineapple grow in row like carrot then come plantation of the sugar-cane with its sedge-like blade of pale-green then extensive tract of pasturage with scatter shrub and tall dead weed the growth of the last summer and a thin herbage bitten close to the soil here and there be a abandon coffee-plantation where cattle be browz among the half-perished shrub and broken row of tree and the neglect hedge of the wild pine _ piña raton _ as the cuban call it be interrupt with broad gap sometimes we pass the cottage of the _ montero _ or peasant build often of palm-leaf the wall form of the broad sheath of the leaf fasten to post of bamboo and the roof thatch with the long plume-like leaf itself the door be sometimes hang with a kind of curtain to exclude the sun which the dusky complexioned woman and child put aside to gaze at we as we pass these dwelling be often picturesque in they appearance with a grove of plantain behind a thicket of bamboo by its side wave its willow-like spray in the wind a pair of mango-tree near hang with fruit just ripening and reddish blossom just open and a cocoa-tree or two lift high above the rest its immense feathery leaf and its cluster of green nut we now and then meet the _ montero _ themselves scud along on they little horse in that pace which we call a rack they dress be a panama hat a shirt wear over a pair of pantaloons a pair of rough cowskin shoe one of which be arm with a spur and a sword lash to the left side by a belt of cotton cloth they be man of manly bearing of thin make but often of a good figure with well-spread shoulder which however have a stoop in they contract i suppose by ride always with a short stirrup forest too we pass you doubtless suppose that a forest in a soil and climate like this must be a dense growth of tree with colossal stem and leafy summit a forest in cuba -- all that i have see be such -- be a thicket of shrub and creep plant through which one would suppose that even the wild cat of the country would find it impossible to make they way above this impassable jungle rise here and there the palm or the gigantic ceyba or cotton-tree but more often tree of far less beauty thinly scatter and with few branch dispose without symmetry and at this season often leafless we reach san antonio at nine o'clock in the morning and go to the inn of la punta where we breakfast on rice and fresh egg and a dish of meat so highly flavor with garlic that it be impossible to distinguish to what animal it belong adjoining the inn be a cockpit with cell for the bird surround the inclosure in which they be crow lustily two or three person seem to have nothing to do but to tend they and one in particular with a gray beard a grave aspect and a solid gait go about the work with a deliberation and solemnity which to I who have lately see the hurry burial at the campo santo in havana be highly edify a man be train a game-cock in the pit he be give it lesson in the virtue of perseverance he hold another cock before it which he be teach it to pursue and striking it occasionally over the head to provoke it with the wing of the bird in he hand he make it run after he about the area for half a hour together i have hear much of the beauty of the coffee estate of cuba and in the neighborhood of san antonio be some which have be repute very fine one a young man in a check blue and white shirt wear like a frock over check pantaloons with a spur on one heel offer to procure we a _ volante _ and we engage he he bring we one with two horse a negro postillion sit on one and the shaft of the vehicle bear by the other we set off pass through field guard by stiff-leaved hedge of the ratoon-pine over way so bad that if the motion of the volante be not the easiest in the world we should have take a unpleasant jolting the land of cuba fit for cultivation be divide into red and black we be in the midst of the red land consist of a fine earth of a deep brick color rest on a bed of soft porous chalky limestone in the dry season the surface be easily disperse into dust and stain you clothes of a dull red a drive of four mile through a country full of palm and cocoanut tree bring we to the gate of a coffee plantation which we friend in the check shirt by whom we be accompany open for we we pass up to the house through what have be a avenue of palm but be now two row of tree at very unequal distance with here and there a sickly orange-tree on each side grow the coffee shrub hang with flower of snowy white but unpruned and full of dry and leafless twig in every direction be rank of tree prize for ornament or for they fruit and shrub among which be magnificent oleander load with flower plant in such a manner as to break the force of the wind and partially to shelter the plant from the too fierce ray of the sun the coffee estate be in fact a kind of forest with the tree and shrub arrange in straight line the _ mayoral _ or steward of the estate a handsome cuban with white tooth a pleasant smile and a distinct utterance of he native language receive we with great courtesy and offer we _ cigarillo _ though he never use tobacco and spirit of cane though he never drink he wear a sword and carry a large flexible whip double for convenience in the hand he show we the coffee plant the broad platform with smooth surface of cement and raise border where the berry be dry in the sun and the mill where the negro be at work separate the kernel from the pulp in which it be inclose these coffee estate say he be already ruin and the planter be abandon they as fast as they can in four year more there will not be a single coffee plantation on the island they can not afford to raise coffee for the price they get in the market i inquire the reason it be reply he the extreme dryness of the season when the plant be in flower if we have rain at this time of the year we be sure of a good crop if it do not rain the harvest be small and the failure of rain be so common a circumstance that we must leave the cultivation of coffee to the people of st domingo and brazil i ask if the plantation could not be convert into a sugar estate not this he answer it have be cultivate too long the land be originally rich but it be exhaust -- tire out be the expression he use -- we may cultivate maize or rice for the dry culture of rice succeed well here or we may abandon it to grazing at present we keep a few negro here just to gather the berry which ripen without take any trouble to preserve the plant or replace those which die i could easily believe from what i see on this estate that there must be a great deal of beauty of vegetation in a well-kept coffee plantation but the formal pattern in which it be dispose the straight alley and row of tree the square and parallelogram show I that there be no beauty of arrangement we fall in before we return to we inn with the proprietor a delicate-looking person with thin white hand who have be educate at boston and speak english as if he have never live anywhere else he manners compare with those of he steward be exceedingly frosty and forbid and when we tell he of the civility which have be show we he look seem to say he wish it have be otherwise return to we inn we dine and as the sun grow low we stroll out to look at the town it be situate on a clear little stream over which several bathing-house be build they post stand in the midst of the current above the town it flow between rocky bank border with shrub many of they in flower below the town after wind a little way it enter a cavern yawning in the limestone rock immediately over which a huge ceyba rise and stretch its leafy arm in mid-heaven down this open the river throw itself and be never see again this be not a singular instance in cuba the island be full of cavern and opening in the rock and i be tell that many of the stream find subterranean passage to the sea there be a well at the inn of la punta in which a roaring of water be constantly hear it be the sound of a subterranean stream rush along a passage in the rock and the well be a opening into its roof in pass through the town i be strike with the neat attire of those who inhabit the humblest dwelling at the door of one of the cottage i see a group of child of different age all quite pretty with oval face and glitter black eye in clean fresh dress which one would think could scarcely have be keep a moment without be soil in that dwelling with its mud floor the people of cuba be spare in they ablutions the man do not wash they face and hand till nearly mid-day for fear of spasm and of the woman i be tell that many do not wash at all content themselves with rub they cheek and neck with a little aguardiente but the passion for clean linen and among the man for clean white pantaloons be universal the _ montero _ himself on a holiday or any public occasion will sport a shirt of the finest linen smoothly iron and stiffly starch throughout from the collar downward the next day at half-past eleven we leave we inn which be also what we call in the united state a country store where the clerk who have just perform they ablutions and comb they hair be make segar behind the counter from the tobacco of the vuelta abajo and return by the railway to havana we procure travel licens at the cost of four dollar and a half each for it be the pleasure of the government to levy this tax on stranger who travel and early the follow morning take the train for matanza letter xlviii matanza -- valley of yumurus lo guine _ April _ 18 1849 in the long circuit of railway which lead from havana to matanzas i saw nothing remarkably different from what i observe on my excursion to san antonio there be the same smooth country of great apparent fertility sometimes vary with gentle undulation and sometimes rise in the distance into hill cover with thicket we sweep by dark-green field plant with the yuca a esculent root of which the cassava bread be make pale-green field of the cane brown tract of pasturage partly form of abandon coffee estate where the palm and scatter fruit-tree be yet standing and forest of shrub and twine plant grow for the most part among rock some of these rocky tract have a peculiar appearance they consist of rough projection of rock a foot or two in height of irregular shape and full of hole they be call _ diente de perro _ or dog 's tooth here the tree and creeper find opening fill with soil by which they be nourish we pass two or three country cemetery where that foulest of bird the turkey-vulture be see sit on the white stuccoed wall or hover on he ragged wing in circle over they in pass over the neighborhood of the town in which i be now write i find myself on the black land of the island here the rich dark earth of the plain lie on a bed of chalk as white as snow as be apparent where the earth have be excavate to a little depth on each side of the railway to form the causey on which it run stream of clear water divert from a river to the left traverse the plain with a swift current almost even with the surface of the soil which they keep in perpetual freshness as we approach matanza we see more extensive tract of cane clothing the broad slope with they dense blade as if the coarse sedge of a river have be transplant to the upland at length the bay of matanza open before we a long tract of water stretch to the northeast into which several river empty themselves the town lay at the southwestern extremity sheltered by hill where the san juan and the yumurus pour themselves into the brine it be a small but prosperous town with a considerable trade as be indicate by the vessel at anchor in the harbor as we pass along the harbor i remark a extensive healthy-looking orchard of plantain grow on one of those tract which they call _ diente de perro _ i could see nothing but the jagged tooth of whitish rock and the green swell stem of the plantain from ten to fifteen foot in height and as large as a man 's leg or larger the stalk of the plantain be juicy and herbaceous and of so yield a texture that with a sickle you might entirely sever the largest of they at a single stroke how such a multitude of succulent plant could find nourishment on what seem to the eye little else than barren rock i could not imagine the day after arrive at matanzas we make a excursion on horseback to the summit of the hill immediately overlook the town call the cumbre light hardy horse of the country be bring we with high pommel to the saddle which be also raise behind in a manner make it difficult to throw the rider from he seat a negro fit a spur to my right heel and mount by the short stirrup i cross the river yumurus with my companion and begin to climb the cumbre they boast at matanza of the perpetual coolness of temperature enjoy upon the broad summit of this hill where many of the opulent merchant of the town have they country house to which the mosquito and the intermittent that infest the town below never come and where as one of they tell I you may play at billiards in August without any inconvenient perspiration from the cumbre you behold the entire extent of the harbor the town lie below you with its thicket of mast and its dusty _ paseo _ where row of the cuba pine stand root in the red soil on the opposite shore you eye be attract to a chasm between high rock where the river canimar come forth through bank of romantic beauty -- so they be describe to I -- and mingle with the sea but the view to the west be much finer there lay the valley of the yumurus and a sight of it be worth a voyage to the island in regard to this my expectation suffer no disappointment before I lay a deep valley surround on all side by hill and mountain with the little river yumurus twine at the bottom smooth round hillock rise from the side next to I cover with cluster of palm and the steep of the southeastern corner of the valley be clothe with a wood of intense green where i could almost see the leaf glisten in the sunshine the broad field below be wave with cane and maize and cottage of the _ montero _ be scatter among they each with its tuft of bamboo and its little grove of plantain in some part the cliff almost seem to impend over the valley but to the west in a soft golden haze rise summit behind summit and over they all loftiest and most remote tower the mountain call the _ pan de matanzas _ we stop for a few moment at a country seat on the top of the cumbre where this beautiful view lay ever before the eye round it in a garden be cultivate the most showy plant of the tropics but my attention be attract to a little plantation of damask rose bloom profusely they be scentless the climate which supply the orange blossom with intense odor exhaust the fragrance of the rose at nightfall -- the night fall suddenly in this latitude -- we be again at we hotel we pass we Sunday on a sugar estate at the hospitable mansion of a planter from the united state about fifteen mile from matanza the house stand on a eminence once embower in tree which the hurricane have level overlook a broad valley where palm be scatter in every direction for the estate have formerly be a coffee plantation in the huge building contain the machinery and other apparatus for make sugar which stand at the foot of the eminence the power of steam which have be toiling all the week be now at rest as the hour of sunset approach a smoke be see rise from its chimney presently pufi of vapor issue from the engine its motion begin to be hear and the negro man and woman be summon to begin the work of the week some feed the fire under the boiler with coal other be see rush to the mill with they arm full of the stalk of the cane freshly cut which they take from a huge pile near the building other light fire under a row of huge cauldron with the dry stalk of cane from which the juice have be crush by the mill it be a spectacle of activity such as i have not see in cuba the sound of the engine be hear all night for the work of grind the cane once begin proceeds day and night with the exception of sunday and some other holiday i be early next morning at the mill a current of cane juice be flow from the mill in a long trunk to a vat in which it be clarify with lime it be then make to pass successively from one seething cauldron to another as it obtain a thicker consistence by boil the negro with huge ladle turn on pivot sweep it from cauldron to cauldron and finally pass it into a trunk which convey it to shallow tank in another apartment where it cool into sugar from these another set of workman scoop it up in moist mass carry it in bucket up a low flight of stair and pour it into row of hogshead pierce with hole at the bottom these be place over a large tank into which the moisture drip from the hogshead be collect and form molasses this be the method of make the sugar call muscovado it be drain a few day and then the railway take it to matanza or to havana we visit afterward a plantation in the neighborhood in which clayed sugar be make we host furnish we with horse to make the excursion and we take a wind road over hill and valley by plantation and forest till we stop at the gate of a extensive pasture-ground a old negro whose hut be at hand open it for we and bow low as we pass a ride of half a mile further bring we in sight of the cane-field of the plantation call saratoga belong to the house of drake & company of havana and repute one of the finest of the island it have a different aspect from any plantation we have see tree and shrub there be none but the cane except where they have be newly crop for the mill clothe the slope and hollow with they light-green blade like the herbage of a prairie we be kindly receive by the administrator of the estate a intelligent biscayan who show we the whole process of make clayed sugar it do not differ from that of make the muscovado so far as concern the grind and boil when however the sugar be nearly cool it be pour into iron vessel of conical shape with the point downward at which be a open the top of the sugar be then cover with a sort of black thick mud which they call clay and which be several time renew as it become dry the moisture from the clay pass through the sugar carry with it the cruder portion which form molasses in a few day the drain be complete we see the work-people of the saratoga estate prepare for the market the sugar thus cleanse if we may apply the word to such a process with a rude iron blade they cleft the large loaf of sugar just take from the mould into three part call first second and third quality accord to they whiteness these be dry in the sun on separate platform of wood with a raise edge the woman stand and walk over the fragment with they bare dirty foot and beat they smaller with wooden mallet and club the sugar of the first quality be then scrape up and put into box that of the second and third be moister be handle a third time and carry into the drying-room where it be expose to the heat of a stove and when sufficiently dry be box up for market like the other the sight of these process be not of a nature to make one think with much satisfaction of clayed sugar as a ingredient of food but the inhabitant of the island be superior to such prejudice and use it with as little scruple as they who do not know in what manner it be make in the afternoon we return to the dwelling of we american host and take the train at _ caoba _ or mahogany tree -- so call from the former growth of that tree on the spot -- we be at matanza a hour afterward the next morning the train bring we to this little town situate half-way between matanza and havana but a considerable distance to the south of either letter xlix negro in cuba -- indian slave havana _ April _ 22 1849 the other day when we be at guine we hear that a negro be to suffer death early the next morning by

with a long peak which fall backward on he shoulder he be the murderer he hand be tie together by the wrist in one of they he hold a crucifix the rope by which they be fasten be knot around he waist and the end of it be hold by another athletic negro dress in blue cotton with white facing who walk behind he on the left of the criminal walk a officer of justice on he right a ecclesiastic slender and stoop in a black gown and a black cap the top of which be form into a sort of coronet exhort the criminal in a loud voice and with many gesticulation to repent and trust in the mercy of god when they reach the platform the negro be make to place himself on he knee before it the priest continue he exhortation and now and then clap he in a encouraging manner on the shoulder i see the man shake he head once or twice and then kiss the crucifix in the mean time a multitude of all age and both sex take possession of the place from which the spectacle could be best see a stone-fence such as be common in we country form of loose stone take from the surface of the ground uphold a long row of spectator a well-dressed couple a gentleman in white pantaloons and a lady elegantly attire with a black lace veil and a parasol bring they two child and two color servant take they station by my side -- the elder child find a place on the top of the fence and the younger about four year of age be lift in the arm of one of the servant that it might have the full benefit of the spectacle the criminal be then raise from the ground and go up the platform take the seat ready for he the priest here renew he exhortation and at length turn to the audience say in a loud voice i believe in god almighty and in jesus christ he only son and it grieve I to the heart to have offend they these word i suppose be mean as the confession of the criminal to be repeat after the priest but i hear no response from he lip again and again the priest repeat they the third time with a louder voice than ever the signal be then give to the executioner the iron collar be adjust to the neck of the victim and fasten under the chin the athletic negro in blue standing behind the post take the handle of the screw and turn it deliberately after a few turn the criminal give a sudden shrug of the shoulder another turn of the screw and a shudder run over he whole frame he eye roll wildly he hand still tie with the rope be convulsively jerk upward and then drop back to they place motionless forever the priest advance and turn the peak of the white cap over the face to hide it from the sight of the multitude i have never see and never intend to see a execution but the strangeness of this manner of inflict death and the desire to witness the behavior of a assembly of the people of cuba on such a occasion have overcome my previous determination the horror of the spectacle now cause I to regret that i make one of a crowd draw to look at it by a idle curiosity the negro in blue then step forward and feel the limb of the dead man one by one to ascertain whether life be wholly extinct and then return to the screw give it two or three turn more as if to make he work sure in the mean time my attention be attract by a sound like that of a light buffet and a whimper voice near I i look and two man be stand by I with a little white boy at they side and a black boy of nearly the same age before they hold he hat in he hand and cry they be endeavor to direct he attention to what they consider the wholesome spectacle before he _ mira mira no te hardá daño _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- say the man but the boy steadily refuse to look in that direction though he be evidently terrify by some threat of punishment and he eye fill with tear find he obstinate they desist from they purpose and i be quite edify to see the little fellow continue to look away from the spectacle which attract all other eye but he the white boy now come forward touch the hat of the little black and goodnaturedly say _ pontelo pontelo _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- make he put it on he head the crowd now begin to disperse and in twenty minute the place be nearly solitary except the sentinel pacing backward and forward two hour afterward the sentinel be pacing there yet and the dead man in he white dress and iron collar be still in he seat on the platform it be generally the native of africa by whom these murder be commit the negro bear in the country be of a more yielding temper they have better learn the art of avoid punishment and submit to it more patiently when inflict have understand from they birth that it be one of the condition of they existence the whip be always in sight nothing can be do without it say a englishman to I who have live eleven year on the island you can not make the negro work by the mild method which be use by slaveholder in the united state the black there be far more intelligent and more easily govern by moral means african the living witness of the present existence of the slave-trade be see everywhere at every step you meet black whose cheek be scar with parallel slash with which they be mark in the african slave-market and who can not even speak the mutilate spanish current in the mouth of the cuba negro one day i stand upon the quay at matanza and see the slave unload the large lighter which bring goods from the spanish ship lie in the harbor -- cask of wine jar of oil bag of nut barrel of flour the man be naked to the hip they only garment be a pair of trowser i admire they ample chest they massive shoulder the full and muscular proportion of they arm and the ease with which they shift the heavy article from place to place or carry they on they head some of these be african i say to a gentleman who reside on the island they be all african he answer african to a man the negro bear in cuba be of a lighter make when i be at guine i go out to look at a sugar estate in the neighborhood where the mill be turn by water which a long aqueduct from one of the stream that traverse the plain convey over arch of stone so broad and massive that i could not help thinking of the aqueduct of rome a gang of black woman be stand in the _ secadero _ or drying-place among the lump of clayed sugar beat they small with mallet before they walk to and fro the major-domo with a cutlass by he side and a whip in he hand i ask he how a planter could increase he stock of slave there be no difficulty he reply slave be still bring to the island from africa the other day five hundred be land on the sea-shore to the south of this for you must know señor that we be but three or four league from the coast be it do openly i inquire _ publicamente _ señor _ publicamente _ -lrb- 8 -rrb- they be land on the sugar estate of _ el pastor _ and one hundred and seven more die on the passage from africa do the government know of it he shrug he shoulder of course the government know it say he every body else know it the truth be that the slave-trade be now fully revive the government conniving at it make a profit on the slave import from africa and screening from the pursuit of the english the pirate who bring they there could scarcely be any arrangement of coast more favorable for smuggling slave into a country than the island and long peninsula and many channel of the southern shore of cuba here the mangrove thicket send down root into the brine from they long branch that stretch over the water form dense screen on each side of the passage from the main ocean to the inland and render it easy for the slaver and he boat to lurk undiscovered by the english man-of-war during the comparative cessation of the slave-trade a few year since the negro i have be tell be much better treat than before they rise in value and when they die it be find not easy to supply they place they be therefore make much of and every thing be do which it be think would tend to preserve they health and maintain they in bodily vigor if the slave-trade should make they cheap again they life of course will be of less consequence to they owner and they will be subject again to be overtask as it have be say they be before there be certainly great temptation to wear they out in the sugar mill which be keep in motion day and night during half the year namely through the dry season if this be not the healthiest employment in the world say a overseer to I on one of the sugar estate it would kill we all who be engage in it both black and white perhaps you may not know that more than half of the island of cuba have never be reduce to tillage immense tract of the rich black or red mould of the island accumulate on the coral rock be yet wait the hand of the planter to be convert into profitable sugar estate there be a demand therefore for laborer on the part of those who wish to become planter and this demand be supply not only from the coast of africa but from the american continent and southwestern asia in one of the afternoon of holy week i see amid the crowd on the _ plaza de armas _ in havana several man of low stature of a deep-olive complexion beardless with high cheek-bone and straight black hair dress in white pantaloons of cotton and shirt of the same material wear over they they be indian native of yucatan who have be take prisoner of war by the whites of the country and sell to white man in cuba under a pretended contract to serve for a certain number of year i afterward learn that the dealer in this sort of merchandise be also bring in the native of asia chinese they call they here though i doubt whether they belong to that nation and dispose of they service to the planter there be six hundred of these people i have be tell in this city yesterday appear in the havana papers a ordinance concern the indian and asiatic import into the country under a contract to labor it direct how much indian corn how many plantain how much jerked-pork and rice they shall receive daily and how many lash the master may inflict for misbehavior twelve stripe with the cowskin he may administer for the smaller offens and twenty-four for transgression of more importance but if any more become necessary he must apply to a magistrate for permission to lay they on such be the manner in which the government of cuba sanction the barbarity of make slave of the freeborn man of yucatan the ordinance however betray great concern for the salvation of the soul of those whom it thus deliver over to the lash of the slave-driver it speak of the indian from america as christian already but while it allow the slave import from asia to be flog it direct that they shall be carefully instruct in the doctrine of we holy religion yet the policy of the government favor emancipation the law of cuba permit any slave to purchase he freedom on pay a price fix by three person one appoint by he master and two by a magistrate he may also if he please compel he master to sell he a certain portion of he time which he may employ to earn the means of purchase he entire freedom it be owe to this i suppose that the number of free black be so large in the island and it be manifest that if the slave-trade could be check and these law remain unaltered the negro would gradually emancipate themselves -- all at least who would be worth keep as servant the population of cuba be now about a million and a quarter rather more than half of whom be color person and one out of every four of the color population be free the mulatto emancipate themselves as a matter of course and some of they become rich by the occupation they follow the prejudice of color be by no means so strong here as in the united state five or six year since the negro be shout and bet in the cockpit with the whites but since the mulatto insurrection as it be call in 1843 the law forbid they presence at such amusement i be tell there be little difficulty in smuggling people of mixed blood by the help of legal form into the white race and if they be rich into good society provide they hair be not frizzle you hear something say now and then in the united state concern the annexation of cuba to we confederacy you may be curious perhaps to know what they say of it here a european who have long reside in the island give I this account : the creole no doubt would be very glad to see cuba annex to the united state and many of they ardently desire it it would relieve they from many great burden they now bear open they commerce to the world rid they of a tyrannical government and allow they to manage they own affair in they own way but spain derive from the possession of cuba advantage too great to be relinquish she extract from cuba a revenue of twelve million of dollar she government send its needy nobility and all for whom it would provide to fill lucrative office in cuba -- the priest the military officer the civil authority every man who fill a judicial post or hold a clerkship be from old spain the spanish government dare not give up cuba if it be incline nor will the people of cuba make any effort to emancipate themselves by take up arm the struggle with the power of spain would be bloody and uncertain even if the white population be unite but the mutual distrust with which the planter and the peasantry regard each other would make the issue of such a enterprise still more doubtful at present it would not be safe for a cuba planter to speak publicly of annexation to the united state he would run the risk of be imprison or exile of course if cuba be to be annex to the united state the slave trade with africa would cease to be carry on as now though its perfect suppression might be find difficult negro would be import in large number from the united state and planter would emigrate with they institution of education would be introduce commerce and religion would both be make free and the character of the islander would be elevate by the responsibility which a free government would throw upon they the planter however would doubtless adopt regulation insure the perpetuity of slavery they would unquestionably as soon as they be allow to frame ordinance for the island take away the facility which the present law give the slave for effect he own emancipation letter l english exhibition of work of art london _ July _ 7 1849 i have just be to visit a gallery of drawing in water-color now open for exhibition the english may be almost say to have create this branch of art till within a few year delineation in water-color on draw paper have be so feeble and meager as to be hold in little esteem but the english artist have show that as much though in a somewhat different way may be do on drawing-paper as on canvas that as high a degree of expression may be reach as much strength give to the coloring and as much boldness to the light and shadow in the collection of which i speak be about four hundred drawing not before exhibit those which appear to I the most remarkable though not in the highest department of art be still-life piece by hunt it seem to I impossible to carry pictorial illusion to a higher pitch than he have attain a sprig of hawthorn flower freshly pluck lie before you and you be half-tempted to take it up and inhale its fragrance those speckled egg in the bird 's nest you be sure you might if you pleased take into you hand that tuft of ivy leave and bud be so complete a optical deception that you can hardly believe that it have not be attach by some process to the paper on which you see it a servant girl in a calico gown with a broom by the same artist and a young woman standing at a window at which the light be streaming in be as fine in they way and as perfect imitation of every-day nature as you see in the work of the best flemish painter it be to landscape however that the artist in water-color have principally devote they attention there be several very fine one in the collection by copley field the foreground draw with much strength the distant object softly blend with the atmosphere as in nature and a surprising depth and transparency give to the sky alfr fripp and george fripp have also produce some very fine landscape -- mill water in foam or sleeping in pellucid pool and the darkness of the tempest in contrast with gleam of sunshine oakley have some spirited group of gipsy and country people and there be several of a similar kind by taylor who design and execute with great force one of the earliest of the new school of artist in water-color be prout whose drawing be principally architectural and who have show how admirably suit this new style of art be to the delineation of the rich carving of gothic church most of the finer piece i observe be marked ` sell ' they bring price vary from thirty to fifty guinea there be a exhibition now open of the painting of etty who stand high in the world of art as a historical painter the society of the art -- i believe that be its name -- every year get up a exhibition of the work of some eminent painter with the proceeds of which it buy one of he picture and place it in the national gallery this be a very effectual plan of form in time a various and valuable collection of the work of british artist the greatest work of etty be the series represent the death of holoferne by the hand of judith it consist of three painting the first of which show judith in prayer before the execution of she attempt in the next and the finest she be see standing by the conch of the heathen warrior with the sword raise to heaven to which she turn she eye as if implore supernatural assistance and in the third she appear issue from the tent bear the head of the ravager of she country which she conceal from the armed attendant who stand on guard at the entrance and exhibit to she astonished handmaid who have be wait the result the subject be a old one but etty have treat it in a new way and give it a moral interest which the old painter seem not to have think of in the delineation of the naked human figure etty be allow to surpass all the english living artist and he manner of painting flesh be think to be next to that of ruben he reputation for these quality have influence he choice of subject in a remarkable manner the wall of the exhibition be cover writh venus and eve cupid and psyche and nymph innocent of drapery recline on couch or admire they own beauty reflect in clear fountain i almost think myself in the midst of a collection make for the grand seignior the annual exhibition of the royal academy be now open its general character be mediocrity unrelieved by any work of extraordinary or striking merit there be some clever landscape by the younger danby and one by the father which be by no means among he happiest -- a dark picture which in half a dozen year will be one mass of black paint cooper almost equal to paul potter as a cattle painter contribute some good piece of that kind and one of they in which the cattle be from he pencil and the landscape from that of lee appear to I the finest thing in the collection there be however a picture by leslie which he friend insist be the best in the exhibition it represent the chaplain of the duke leave the table in a rage after a harangue by don quixote in praise of knight-errantry the suppress mirth of the duke and duchess the sly look of the servant the stormy anger of the ecclesiastic and the serene gravity of the knight be well express but there be a stiffness in some of the figure which make they look as if copy from the wooden model in the artist 's study and a raw and crude appearance in the handle so that you be remind of the brush every time you look at the painting to do leslie justice however he painting ripen wonderfully and seem to acquire a finish with year if one wish to form a idea of the vast number of indifferent painting which be annually produce in england he should visit as i do another exhibition a large gallery light from above in which each artist most of they of the younger or obscurer class take a certain number of foot on the wall and exhibit just what he please every man be he own hanging committee and if he picture be not place in the most advantageous position it be he own fault here acre of canvas be exhibit most of which be spoil of course though here and there a good picture be to be see and other which give promise of future merit enough of picture the principal subject of political discussion since i have be in england have be the expediency of allow jew to sit in parliament you have see by what a large majority baron rothschild have be again return from the city of london after he resignation in spite of the zealous opposition of the conservative it be allow i think on all hand that the majority of the nation be in favor of allow jew to hold seat in parliament but the other side urge the inconsistency of maintain a christian church as a state institution and admit the enemy of christianity to a share in its administration public opinion however be so strongly against political disability on account of religious faith that with the aid of the ministry it will no doubt triumph and we shall see another class of adversary of the establishment make war upon it in the house of common nor will it be at all surprising if after a little while we hear of jewish baron earl and marquis in the house of peer rothschild himself may become the founder of a noble line opulent beyond the proudest of they all the protectionist party here be labor to persuade the people that the government have commit a great error in grant such liberal condition to the trade of other nation to the prejudice of british industry they do not however seem to make much impression on the public mind the necessaries of life be obtain at a cheaper rate than formerly and that satisfy the people peel have be make a speech in parliament on the free-trade question which i often hear refer to as a very able argument for the free-trade policy neither on this question nor on that of the jewish disability do the opposition seem to have the country with they letter li a visit to the shetland isle aberdeen _ July _ 19 1849 two day ago i be in the orkney the day before i be in the shetland isle the farthest thule of the roman where i climb the noup of the noss as the famous headland of the island of noss be call from which you look out upon the sea that lie between shetland and norway from wick a considerable fishing town in caithness on the northern coast of scotland a steamer name the queen depart once a week in the summer month for kirkwall in the orkney and lerwick in shetland we go on board of she about ten o'clock on the 14th of July the herr fishery have just begin and the artificial port of wick construct with massive wall of stone be crowd with fishing vessel which have return that morning from the labor of the night for in the herr fishery it be only in the night that the net be spread and draw many of the vessel have land they cargo in other the fisherman be busily disengage the herring from the black net and throw they in heap and now and then a boat later than the rest be enter from the sea the green height all around the bay be cover with group of woman sit or walk dress for the most part in cap and white short gown wait for the arrival of the boat man by they husband and brother or belong to the family of those who have come to seek occupation as fisherman i have see two or three of the principal street of wick that morning swarm with strap fellow in blue highland bonnet with blue jacket and pantaloons and coarse blue flannel shirt a shopkeeper standing at he door instruct I who they be they be man of the celtic race he say -- the term celtic have grow to be quite fashionable i find when apply to the highlander they come from the hebride and other part of western scotland to get employment in the herr fishery these people have travel perhaps three hundred mile most of they on foot to be employ six or seven week for which they will receive about six pound wages those whom you see be not the best of they class the more enterprising and industrious have boat of they own and carry on the fishery on they own account we find the queen a strong steamboat with a good cabin and convenient state-room but dirty and smell of fish from stem to stern it have seem to I that the further north i go the more dirt i find we captain be a old aberdeen seaman with a stoop in he shoulder and look as if he be continually watch for land a occupation for which the foggy climate of these latitudes give he full scope we leave wick between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon and glide over a calm sea with a cloudless sky above we and a thin haze on the surface of the water the haze thicken to a fog which grow more and more dense and finally close overhead after about three hour sail the captain begin to grow uneasy and be see walk about on the bridge between the wheel-houses anxiously peer into the mist on the look-out for the coast of the orkney at length he give up the search and stop the engine the passenger amuse themselves with fishing several coal-fish a large fish of slender shape be catch and one fine cod be haul up by a gentleman who unite in he person as he give I to understand the two capacity of portrait-painter and preacher of the gospel and who hold that the universal church of christendom have go sadly astray from the true primitive doctrine in regard to the time when the millennium be to take place the fog clear away in the evening we steamer be again in motion : we land at kirkwall in the middle of the night and when i go on deck the next morning we be smoothly pass the shore of fair isle -- high and steep rock impend over the water with a covering of green turf before they be out of sight we see the shetland coast the dark rock of sumburgh head and behind it half shroud in mist the promontory of fitfiel head -- fitful head as it be call by scott in he novel of the pirate beyond to the east black rocky promontory come in sight one after the other beetle over the sea at ten o'clock we be pass through a channel between the island lead to lerwick the capital of shetland on the principal island bear the name of mainland field yellow with flower among which stand here and there a cottage slope softly down to the water and beyond they rise the bare declivity and summit of the hill dark with heath with here and there still darker spot of a almost inky hue where peat have be cut for fuel not a tree not a shrub be to be see and the greater part of the soil appear never to have be reduce to cultivation about one o'clock we cast anchor before lerwick a fishing village build on the shore of bressay sound which here form one of the finest harbor in the world it have two passage to the sea so that when the wind blow a storm on one side of the island the shetlander in he boat pass out in the other direction and find himself in comparatively smooth water it be Sunday and the man who land we at the quay and take we baggage to we lodging say as he leave we -- it be the sabbath and i 'll no tak ' my pay now but i 'll call the morrow my name be jim sinclair pilot and if ye 'll be want to go anywhere i 'll be glad to tak ' ye in my boat in a few minute we be snugly establish at we lodgings there be no inn throughout all the shetland island which contain about thirty thousand inhabitant but if any of my friend should have occasion to visit lerwick i can cheerfully recommend to they the comfortable lodging-house of mr walker who keep a little shop in the principal street not far from queen 's lane we make haste to get ready for church and sally out to find the place of worship frequent by we landlady which be not a difficult matter the little town of lerwick consist of two-story house build mostly of unhewn stone rough-cast with steep roof and a chimney at each end they be arrange along a wind street parallel with the shore and along narrow lane run upward to the top of the hill the main street be flag with smooth stone like the street in venice for no vehicle run on wheel in the shetland island we go up queen 's lane and soon find the building occupy by the free church of scotland until a temple of fairer proportion on which the mason be now at work on the top of the hill shall be complete for they reception it be crowd with attentive worshiper one of whom obligingly come forward and find a seat for we the minister mr frazer have begin the evening service and be at prayer when i enter he be speak of we father the devil but the prayer be follow by a earnest practical discourse though somewhat crude in the composition and remind I of a expression i once hear use by a distinguished scotchman who complain that the clergy of he country in compose they sermon too often mak ' rough wark of it i look about among these descendant of the norwegian but could not see any thing singular in they physiognomy and but for the harsh accent of the preacher i might almost have think myself in the midst of a country congregation in the united state they be mostly of a light complexion with a appearance of health and strength though of a sparer make than the people of the more southern british isle after the service be over we return to we lodgings by a way which lead to the top of the hill and make the circuit of the little town the path lead into the interior of the island be full of people return homeward the woman in they best attire a few in silk with wind-tanned face we see they disappear one after another in the hollow or over the dark bare hill-top with a population of less than three thousand soul lerwick have four place of worship -- a church of the establishment a free church a church for the seceder and one for the methodist the road we take command a fine view of the harbor surround and sheltered by hill within it lay a numerous group of idle fishing-vessel with one great steamer in the midst and more formidable in appearance a dutch man-of-war send to protect the dutch fishery with the flag of holland fly at the mast-head above the town on tall pole be float the flag of four or five different nation to mark the habitation of they consul on the side opposite to the harbor lay the small fresh-water lake of cleikimin with the remains of a pictish castle in the midst one of those circular building of unhewn uncemented stone skillfully lay form apartment and gallery of such small dimension as to lead sir walter scott to infer that the pict be a people of a stature considerably below the ordinary standard of the human race a deep sabbath silence reign over the scene except the sound of the wind which here never cease to blow from one quarter or another as it sweep the herbage and beat against the stone wall surround the field the ground under we foot be thick with daisy and the blossom of the crow-foot and other flower for in the brief summer of these island nature which have no grove to embellish make amends by prank the ground particularly in the uncultivated part with a great profusion and variety of flower the next morning we be row by two of jim sinclair 's boy to the island of bressay and one of they act as we guide to the remarkable precipice call the noup of the noss we ascend its smooth slope and pasture and pass through one or two hamlet where we observe the construction of the dwelling of the zetland peasantry they be build of unhewn stone with roof of turf hold down by rope of straw neatly twist the floor be of earth the cow pony and pig live under the same roof with the family and the manure pond a receptacle for refuse and filth be close to the door a little higher up we come upon the uncultivated grounds abandon to heath and only use to supply fuel by the cutting of peat here and there woman be busy pile the square piece of peat in stack that they might dry in the wind we carry home these pit in a basket on we showlder when they be dry say one of they to I but those who can afford to keep a pony make he do this work for they in the hollow of this part of the island we see several fresh-water pond which be enlarged with dyke and make to turn grist mill we peep into one or two of these mill little stone building in which we could hardly stand upright inclose two small stone turn by a perpendicular shaft in which be half a dozen cog the paddle be fix below and there strike by the water turn the upper stone a steep descent bring we to the little strait border with rock which divide brassey from the island call the noss a strong south wind be drive in the billow from the sea with noise and foam but they be break and check by a bar of rock in the middle of the strait and we cross to the north of it in smooth water the ferryman tell we that when the wind be northerly he cross to the south of the bar as we climb the hill of the noss the mist begin to drift thinly around we from the sea and flock of sea-bird rise scream from the ground at we approach at length we stand upon the brink of a precipice of fearful height from which we have a full view of the still higher precipice of the neighbor summit a wall of rock be before we six hundred foot in height descend almost perpendicularly to the sea which roar and foam at its base among huge mass of rock and plunge into great cavern hollow out by the beating of the surge for century midway on the rock and above the reach of the spray be thousand of sea-bird sit in rank on the numerous shelf or alighting or take wing and scream as they fly a cloud of they be constantly in the air in front of the rock and over we head here they make they nest and rear they young but not entirely safe from the pursuit of the zetlander who cause himself to be let down by a rope from the summit and plunder they nest the face of the rock above the portion which be the haunt of the bird be fairly tapestried with herbage and flower which the perpetual moisture of the atmosphere keep always fresh -- daisy nod in the wind and the crimson phlox seem to set the cliff on flame yellow buttercup and a variety of other plant in bloom of which i do not know the name magnificent as this spectacle be we be not satisfy without climb to the summit as we pass upward we see where the rabbit have make they burrow in the elastic peat-like soil close to the very edge of the precipice we now find ourselves involve in the cold stream of mist which the strong sea-wind be drift over we they be in fact the lower skirt of the cloud at time they would clear away and give we a prospect of the green island summit around we with they bold headland the wind strait between and the black rock stand out in the sea when we arrive at the summit we could hardly stand against the wind but it be almost more difficult to muster courage to look down that dizzy depth over which the zetlander suspend themselves with rope in quest of the egg of the sea-fowl my friend capture a young gull on the summit of the noup the bird have rise at he approach and essay to fly towards the sea but the strength of the wind drive he back to the land he rise again but could not sustain a long flight and come to the ground again be catch after a spirited chase amidst a wild clamor of of the sea-fowl over we head not far from the noup be the holm or as it be sometimes call the cradle or basket of the noss it be a perpendicular mass of rock two or three hundred foot high with a broad flat summit richly cover with grass and be separate from the island by a narrow chasm through which the sea flow two strong rope be stretch from the main island to the top of the holm and on these be sling the cradle or basket a sort of open box make of deal board in which the shepherd pass with they sheep to the top of the holm we find the cradle strongly secure by lock and key to the stake on the side of the noss in order no doubt to prevent any person from cross for he own amusement as we descend the smooth pasture of the noss we fall in with a herd of pony of a size somewhat larger than be common on the island i ask we guide a lad of fourteen year of age what be the average price of a sheltie he answer deserve to be write in letter of gold -- it be jist as they be bug a ' smal ' from the ferryman at the strait below i get more specific information they vary in price from three to ten pound but the latter sum be only pay for the finest of these animal in the respects of shape and color it be not a little remarkable that the same cause which in shetland have make the horse the smallest of pony have almost equally reduce the size of the cow the sheep also -- a pretty creature i might call it -- from the fine wool of which the shetland woman knot the thin web know by the name of shetland shawl be much smaller than any breed i have ever see whether the cause be the perpetual chilliness of the atmosphere or the insufficiency of nourishment -- for though the long zetland winter be temperate and snow never lie long on the ground there be scarce any growth of herbage in that season -- i will not undertake to say but the people of the island ascribe it to the insufficiency of nourishment it be at all event remarkable that the tradition of the country should ascribe to the pict the early inhabitant of shetland the same dwarfish stature and that the numerous remains of they habitation which still exist should seem to confirm the tradition the race which at present possess the shetland be however of what the french call a advantageous stature and well limb if it be the want of a proper and genial warmth which prevent the due growth of the domestic animal it be a want to which the zetlander be not subject they hill afford the man apparently inexhaustible supply of peat which cost the poorest man nothing but the trouble of cut it and bring it home and they cottage i be tell be always well warm in winter in cross the narrow strait which separate the noss from bressay i observe on the bressay side overlook the water a round hillock of very regular shape in which the green turf be intermix with stone that say the ferryman be what we call a pictish castle i mind when it be open it be full of room so that ye could go over every part of it i climb the hillock and find by inspect several opening which have be make by the peasantry to take away the stone that below the turf it be a regular work of pictish masonry but the spiral gallery which these opening reveal have be completely choke up in take away the material of which they be build although plenty of stone may be find everywhere in the island there seem to be a disposition to plunder these remarkable remains for the sake of building cottage or make those inclosure for they cabbage which the islander call _ crub _ they have be pull down the pictish castle on the little island in the fresh-water loch call cleikimin near lerwick describe with such minuteness by scott in he journal till very few trace of its original construction be leave if the inclosing of land for pasturage and cultivation proceeds as it have begin these curious monument of a race which have long perish will disappear now that we be out of hearing of the cry of the sea-bird we be regale with more agreeable sound we have set out as we climb the island of bressay amid a perfect chorus of lark answer each other in the sky and sometimes apparently from the cloud and now we hear they again overhead pour out they sweet note so fast and so ceaselessly that it seem as if the little creature imagine they have more to utter than they have time to utter it in in no part of the british island have i see the lark so numerous or so merry as in the shetland we wait awhile at the wharf by the minister 's house in bressay for jim sinclair who at length appear in he boat to convey we to lerwick he be a noisy fallow say we good landlady and truly we find he voluble enough but quite amusing as he row we to town he give we a sample of he historical knowledge talking of sir walter raleigh and the settlement of north america and tell we that he greatest pleasure be to read historical book in the long winter night he child he say could all read and write we dine on a leg of shetland mutton with a tart make of the only fruit of the island as a scotchman call it the stalk of the rhubarb plant and go on board of we steamer about six o'clock in the afternoon it be matter of some regret to we that we be oblige to leave shetland so soon two or three day more might have be pleasantly pass among its grand precipice its wind strait its remains of a remote and rude antiquity its little horse little cow and little sheep its sea-fowl its lark its flower and its hardy and active people there be a amusing novelty also in go to bed as we do by daylight for at this season of the year the daylight be never out of the sky and the flush of early sunset only pass along the horizon from the northwest to the northeast where it brighten into sunrise the zetlander i be tell by a scotch clergyman who have live among they forty year be naturally shrewd and quick of apprehension as to they moral he add if ye stay among they any time ye 'll be able to judge for yourself so on the point of moral i be in the dark more attention i hear be pay to the education of they child than formerly and all have the opportunity of learn to read and write in the parochial school they agriculture be still very rude they be very unwilling to adopt the instrument of husbandry use in england but on the whole they be make some progress a shetland gentleman who as he remark to I have have the advantage of see some other country besides he own complain that the peasantry be spend too much of they earnings for tea tobacco and spirit last winter a terrible famine come upon the island they fishery have be unproductive and the potato crop have be cut off by the blight the communication with scotland by steamboat have cease as it always do in winter and it be long before the suffering of the shetlander be know in great britain but as soon as the intelligence be receive contribution be make and the poor creature be relieve they climate inhospitable as it seem be healthy and they live to a good old age a native of the island a baronet who have a great white house on a bare field in sight of lerwick and be a passenger on board the steamer in which we make we passage to the island remark that if it be not the healthiest climate in the world the extremely dirty habit of the peasantry would engender disease which however be not the case it be probably the effect of the saline particle in the air he add he opinion seem to be that the dirt be salt by the sea-wind and preserve from further decomposition i be somewhat amuse in hear he boast of the climate of shetland in winter have you never observe say he turn to the old scotch clergyman of whom i have already speak how much larger the proportion of sunny day be in we island than at the south i have never observe it be the dry answer of the minister the people of shetland speak a kind of scottish but not with the scottish accent four hundred year ago when the island be transfer from norway to the british crown they language be norse but that tongue although some of its word have be preserve in the present dialect have become extinct i have hear say a intelligent shetlander to I that there be yet perhaps half a dozen person in one of we remotest neighborhood who be able to speak it but i never meet with one who could in return from lerwick to the orkney we have a sample of the weather which be often encounter in these latitudes the wind blow a gale in the night and we steamer be toss about on the wave like a egg-shell much to the discomfort of the passenger we have on board a cargo of pony the smallest of which be from the shetland some of they not much larger than sheep and nearly as shaggy the other of larger size have be bring from the faro isle in the morning when the gale have blow itself to rest i go on deck and see one of the faro island pony which have give out during the night stretch dead upon the deck i inquire if the body be to be commit to the deep it be to be skin first be the answer we stop at kirkwall in the orkney long enough to allow we to look at the old cathedral of st magnus build early in the twelfth century -- a venerable pile in perfect preservation and the finest specimen of the architecture once call saxon then norman and lately romanesque that i have ever see the round arch be everywhere use except in two or three window of later addition the nave be narrow and the central groined arch be lofty so that a idea of vast extent be give though the cathedral be small compare with the great minster in england the work of complete certain part of the building which be leave unfinished be now go on at the expense of the government all the old flooring and the pew which make it a parish church have be take away and the original proportion and symmetry of the building be see as they ought to be the general effect of the building be wonderfully grand and solemn on we return to scotland we stop for a few hour at wick it be late in the afternoon and the fisherman in they vessel be go out of the harbor to they nightly toil vessel after vessel each man with four stout rower come out of the port -- and after rowing a short distance raise they sail and steer for the open sea till all the water from the land to the horizon be full of they i count they hundred after hundred till i grow tired of the task a sail of ten or twelve hour bring we to aberdeen with its old cathedral encumber by pew and wooden partition and its old college the tower of which be surmount by a cluster of fly buttress form into the resemblance of a crown this letter you perceive be date at aberdeen it be begin there but i have write portion of it at different time since i leave that city and i beg that you will imagine it to be of the latest date it be now long enough i fear to tire you reader and i therefore lay down my pen letter lii europe under the bayonet pari _ September _ 13 1849 whoever should visit the principal country of europe at the present moment might take they for conquer province hold in subjection by they victorious master at the point of the sword such be the aspect which france present when i come to pari a few week since the city be then in what be call by a convenient fiction a state of siege soldier fill the street be post in every public square and at every corner be see march before the church the cornice of which bear the inscription of liberty equality and fraternity keep they brethren quiet by the bayonet i have since make a journey to bavarium and switzerland and on return i find the siege raise and these demonstration of fraternity less formal but the show and the menace of military force be scarcely less apparent those who maintain that france be not fit for liberty need not afflict themseve with the idea that there be at present more liberty in france than she people know how to enjoy on my journey i find the city along the rhine crowd with soldier the sound of the drum be hear among the hill cover with vine woman be trundle loaded wheel-barrow and carry pannier like ass to earn the tax which be extort to support the man who stalk about in uniform i enter heidelberg with anticipation of pleasure they be dash in a moment the city be in a state of siege occupy by prussian troops which have be send to take the part of the grand duke of baden against he people i could hardly believe that this be the same peaceful and friendly city which i have know in better time every other man in the street be a soldier the beautiful walk about the old castle be full of soldier in the evening they be reel through the street this invention say a german who have be a member of the diet of the confederation lately break up this invention of declare a city which have unconditionally submit to be still in a state of siege be but a device to practice the most unbounded oppression any man who be suspect or fear or dislike or suppose not to approve of the proceedings of the victorious party be arrest and imprison at pleasure he may be guiltless of any offense which could be make a pretext for condemn he but he trial be arbitrarily postpone and when at last he be release he have suffer the penalty of a long confinement and be teach how dangerous it be to become obnoxious to the government from heidelberg thus transform i be glad to take my departure as soon as possible we way from that city to heilbronn be through a most charming country along the valley of the neckar here be low hill and valley rich with harvest a road embower in fruit-tree the branch of which be prop with stake to prevent they from break with they load and grove lie pleasantly in the morning sunshine where raven be croak bird of worse omen than these be abroad straggle group and sometimes entire company of soldier on they way from one part of the duchy to another while in the field woman prematurely old with labor be wield the hoe and the mattock and the younger and stronger of they sex be swing the scythe in all the village through which we pass in the very smallest troops be post and man in military uniform be stand at the door or look from the window of every inn and beer-house at heilbronn we take the railway for stuttgart the capital of wurtemberg there be a considerable proportion of man in military trappings among the passenger but at one of the station they come upon we like a cloud and we enter stuttgart with a little army that city too look as if in a state of siege so numerous be the soldiery though the vine-covered hill among which it be situate could have give they a better occupation the railway beyond stuttgart wound through a deep valley and end at geisslingen a ancient swabian town in a gorge of the mountain with tall old house not one of which i might safely affirm have be build within the last two hundred year from this place to ulm on the danube the road be fairly line with soldier walk or rest by the wayside or closely pack in the peasant ' wagon which they have hire to carry they short distance at ulm we be oblige to content ourselves with straiten accommodation the hotel be occupy by the gentry in epaulette i hope to see fewer of this class at the capital of bavarium but it be not so they be everywhere place in sight as if to keep the people in awe these fellow say a german to I be always too numerous but in ordinary time they be keep in the capital and barracks and the nuisance be out of sight now however the occasion be suppose to make they presence necessary in the midst of the people and they swarm everywhere another it be we host of the goldener hirsch say to my friend i think i shall emigrate to america i be tire of live under the bayonet i be in munich when the news arrive of the surrender of the hungarian troops under görgey and the fall of the hungarian republic all along my journey i have observe token of the intense interest which the german people take in the result of the struggle between austrium and the magyar and of the warmth of they hope in favor of the latter the intelligence be receive with the deepest sorrow so perish say a bavarian the last hope of european liberty we journey to switzerland lead we through the southern part of bavarium among the old town which form a part of ancient swabium the country here in some respects resemble new england here be broad wood large orchard of the apple and pear and scatter farm-house -- of a different architecture it be true from that of the yankee and somewhat resemble with they far-projecting eaves those of switzerland yet there be a further difference -- everywhere man be see under arm and woman at the plough so weary have i grow of the perpetual sight of the military uniform that i long to escape into switzerland where i hope to see less of it and it be with great delight that i find myself at lindau a border town of bavarium on the bodensee or lake of constance on the shore of which the boundary of four sovereignty meet a steamer take we across the lake from a wharf cover with soldier to roorschach in switzerland where not a soldier be to be see nobody ask for we passport nobody require we to submit we baggage to search i could almost have kneel and kiss the shore of the hospitable republic and really it be beautiful enough for such a demonstration of affection for nothing could be lovelier than the declivity of that shore with its wood and orchard and grassy meadow and green hollow run upward to the mountain-top all fresh with a shower which have just pass and now glitter in the sunshine and intersperse with large swiss house bear quaintly-carved gallery and broad overhang roof while to the east rise the glorious summit of the alp mingle with the cloud in three or four hour we have climb up to st gall -- st gallen the german call it -- situate in a high valley among steep green hill which send down spur of woodland to the meadow below in walk out to look at the town we hear a brisk and continue discharge of musketry and proceeding in the direction of the sound come to a large field evidently set apart as a parade-ground on which several hundred youth be practice the art of war in a sham fight and keep up a spirited fire at each other with blank cartridge on inquiry we be tell that these be the boy of the school of st gall from twelve to sixteen year of age with whom military exercise be a part of they education i be still therefore among soldier but of a different class from those of whom i have see so much here it be the people who be arm for self-protection there it be a body of mercenary arm to keep the people in subjection another day 's journey bring we to the picturesque town of zurich and the next morning about four o'clock i be awaken by the roll of drum under my window look out i see a regiment of boy of a tender age in a uniform of brown linen with little light musket on they shoulder and miniature knapsack on they back completely equip and furnish for war lead on by they little officer in regular military order march and wheeling to the sound of martial music with all the precision of veteran in switzerland arm be in every man 's hand he be educate to be a soldier and teach that the liberty of he country depend on he skill and valor the worst effect perhaps of this military education be that the swiss when other means of subsistence be not easily find become military adventurer and sell they service to the first purchaser meantime nobody be regard as properly fit for he duty as a member of the state who be not skilled in the use of arm target-shooting _ freischiessen _ be the national amusement of switzerland and have be so ever since the day of tell occasion of target-shooting be prescribe and superintend by the public authority they be practice it at the stately city of berne when we visit it they be practice it at various other place as we pass every town be provide with a public shooting-ground near its gate it be at one of the most remarkable of these town it be at freiburg catholic freiburg full of catholic seminary and convent in the church of which you may hear the shrill voice of the nun chant matins themselves unseen it be at freiburg grandly seat on the craggy bank of she river flow in deep gulf span by the loftiest and longest chain-bridge in the world that i see another evidence of the fact that switzerland be the only place on the continent where freedom be understand or allow to have a existence a proclamation of the authority of the canton be paste on the wall and gate ordain the 16th of September as a day of religious thanksgiving after recount the motive of gratitude to providence after speaking of the abundance of the harvest the health enjoy throughout switzerland at the threshold of which the cholera have a second time be stay the subsidence of political animosity and the quiet enjoyment of the benefit of the new constitution upon which the country have enter the proclamation mention as a special reason of gratitude to almighty god that switzerland in this day of revolution have be enable to offer among she mountain a safe and unmolested asylum to the thousand of fugitive who have suffer defeat in the battle of freedom i could not help contrast this with the cruel treatment show by france to the political refugee from baden and other part of germany a few day before it have be announce that the french government require of these poor fellow that they should either enlist at once in the regiment destine for service in algier or immediately leave the country -- offer they the alternative of military slavery or banishment from the country in which they have hope to find a shelter i have speak of the practice of switzerland in regard to passport a example which it do not suit the purpose the french politician to follow here and all over the continent the passport system be as strictly and vexatiously enforce as ever it be remarkable that none of the reformer occupy in the late remodelling of european institution seem to have think of abolish this invention of despotism -- this restraint upon the liberty of pass from place to place which make europe one great prison if the people have be accustom to perfect freedom in this respect though but a short time it might have be find difficult at least in france to reimpose the old restraint the truth be however that france be not quite so free at present as she be under loui philippe the only advantage of she present condition be that the constitution place in the hand of the people the means of peaceably perfect they liberty whenever they be enlighten enough to claim they on my way from geneva to lyon i sit in _ banquette _ of the diligence among the plebeian the conversation happen to turn on politics and the expression of hatred against the present government of france which break from the conductor the coachman and the two passenger by my side be probably significant of the feeling which prevail among the people the only law now say one be the law of the sabre the soldier and the _ gen d'arme _ have every thing they own way now say another but by and by they will be glad to hide in the sewer the other be no less emphatic in they expression of anger and detestation the expedition to rome be unpopular throughout france more especially so in the southern part of the republic where the intercourse with rome have be more frequent and the sympathy with she people be stronger i have never say a american friend who have reside some time in paris hear a single frenchman defend it it be unpopular even among the troops send on the expedition as be acknowledge by the government journal themselves to propitiate public opinion the government have change its course and after make war upon the roman to establish the pontifical throne now tell the pope that he must submit to place the government in the hand of the laity this change of policy have occasion a good deal of surprise and a infinite deal of discussion whatever may be its consequence there be one consequence which it can not have that of recover to the president and he ministry the popularity they have lose letter liii volterra -lrb- this letter be casually omit from its proper place near the beginning of the volume -rrb- rome _ April _ 15 1835 towards the end of march i go from pisa to volterra this you know be a very ancient city one of the stronghold of etrurium when rome be in its cradle and in more modern time in the age of italian republic large enough to form a independent community of considerable importance it be now a decayed town contain about four thousand inhabitant some of whom be family of the poor and proud nobility common enough over all italy who be say to quarrel with each other more fiercely in volterra than almost anywhere else it be the old feud of the montague and the capulet on a humbler scale and the dispute of the volterra nobility be the more violent and implacable for be hereditary poor creature too proud to engage in business too indolent for literature exclude from political employment by the nature of the government there be nothing leave for they but to starve intrigue and quarrel you may judge how miserably poor they be when you be tell they can not afford even to cultivate the favorite art of modern italy the art best suit to the genius of a soft and effeminate people there be i be tell but one pianoforte in the whole town and that be own by a florentine lady who have recently come to reside here for several mile before reach volterra we attention be fix by the extraordinary aspect of the country through which we be pass the road gradually ascend and we find ourselves among deep ravine and steep high broken bank principally of clay barren and in most place wholly bare of herbage a scene of complete desolation be it not for a cottage here and there perch upon the height a few sheep attend by a boy and a dog grazing on the brink of one of the precipice or a solitary patch of bright green wheat in some spot where the rain have not yet carry away the vegetable mould imagine to yourself a elevated country like the highland of pennsylvanium or the western part of massachusett imagine vast bed of loam and clay in place of the ledge of rock and then fancy the whole region to be tear by water-spout and torrent into gulley too profound to be pass with sharp ridge between -- strip of its tree and its grass -- and you will have some idea of the country near volterra i could not help fancy while i look at it that as the earth grow old the rib of rock which once uphold the mountain have become change into the bare heap of earth which i see about I that time and the element have destroy the cohesion of the particle of which they be form and that now the rain be sweep they down to the mediterranean to fill its bed and cause its water to encroach upon the land it be impossible for I to prevent the apprehension from pass through my mind that such might be the fate of other quarter of the globe in age yet to come that they rock must crumble and they mountain be level until the water shall again cover the face of the earth unless new mountain shall be throw up by eruption of internal fire they tell I in volterra that this frightful region have once be productive and under cultivation but that after a plague which four or five hundred year since have depopulate the country it be abandon and neglect and the rain have reduce it to its present state in the midst of this desolate tract which be however here and there intersperse with fertile spot rise the mountain on which volterra be situate where the inhabitant breathe a pure and keen atmosphere almost perpetually cool and only die of pleurisy and apoplexy while below on the bank of the cecina which in full sigjit wind its way to the sea they die of fever one of the ravine of which i have speak -- the _ balza _ they call it at volterra -- have plough a deep chasm on the north side of this mountain and be every year rapidly approach the city on its summit i stand on its edge and look down a bank of soft red earth five hundred foot in height a few rod in front of I i see where a road have cross the spot in which the gulf now yawn the track of the last year 's carriage be see reach to the edge on both side the ruin of a convent be close at hand the inmate of which two or three year since have be remove by the government to the town for safety these will soon be undermine by the advance chasm together with a fine piece of old etruscan wall once inclose the city build of enormous uncemented parallelogram of stone and look as if it might be the work of the giant who live before the flood a neighbor church will next fall into the gulf which finally if means be not take to prevent its progress will reach and sap the present wall of the city swallow up what time have so long spare a few hundred crown say a inhabitant of volterra to I would stop all this mischief a wall at the bottom of the chasm and a heap of branch of tree or other rubbish to check the fall of the earth be all that would be necessary i ask why these means be not use because he reply those to whom the charge of these matter belong will not take the trouble somebody must devise a plan for the purpose and somebody must take upon himself the labor of see it execute they find it easier to put it off the antiquity of volterra consist of a etruscan burial-ground in which the tomb still remain piece of the old and incredibly massive etruscan wall include a far larger circuit than the present city two etruscan gate of immemorial antiquity older doubtless than any thing at rome build of enormous stone one of they serve even yet as a entrance to the town and a multitude of cinerary vessel mostly of alabaster sculpture with numerous figure in _ alto relievo _ these figure be sometimes allegorical representation and sometimes embody the fable of the greek mythology among they be some in the most perfect style of grecian art the subject of which be take from the poem of homer group represent the besieger of troy and its defender or ulyss with he companion and he ship i gaze with exceed delight on these work of forget artist who have the verse of homer by heart -- work just draw from the tomb where they have be bury for thousand of year and look as if fresh from the chisel we have letter to the commandant of the fortress a ancient-looking stronghold build by the medicus family over which we be conduct by he adjutant a courteous gentleman with a red nose who walk as if keep time to military music from the summit of the tower we have a extensive and most remarkable prospect it be the 19th day of march and below we the side of the mountain scoop into irregular dell be cover with fruit-tree just break into leaf and flower beyond stretch the region of barrenness i have already describe to the west of which lay the green pasture of the maremma the air of which in summer be deadly and still further west be spread the water of the mediterranean out of which be see rise the mountain of corsica to the north and northeast be the appenine cap with snow embosome the fertile lower valley of the arno with the city of pisa and leghorn in sight to the south we trace the winding of the cecina and see ascend into the air the smoke of a hot-water lake agitate perpetually with the escape of gas which we be tell be visit by dante and from which he draw image for he description of hell some frenchman have now convert it into a borax manufactory the natural heat of the water serve to extract the salt the fortress be use as a prison for person guilty of offens against the state on the top of the tower we pass four prisoner of state well-dressed young man who appear to have be entertaining themselves with music have guitar and other instrument in they hand they salute the adjutant as he go by they who in return take off he hat they have be condemn for a conspiracy against the government the commandant give we a hospitable reception in show we the fortress he congratulate we that we have no occasion for such engine of government in america we go to he house in the evening where we see he wife a handsome young lady whom he have lately bring from florence the very lady of the pianoforte whom i have already mention and the mother of two young child whose ruddy cheek and chubby figure do credit to the wholesome air of volterra the commandant make tea for we in tumbler and the lady give we music the tea be so strong a decoction that i seem to hear the music all night and have no need of be wake from sleep when we _ vetturino _ at a early hour the next morning come to take we on we journey to sienna the end
