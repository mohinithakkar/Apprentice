under very different circumstance in welding slowly and gradually the scatter fragment of the british empire into a organic whole which must from the very nature of its geographical situation have a constitution as different from that of the british isle as the constitution of the british isle be different from that of the american state but all three spring from one root all three be carry out

these ancient inn of court which be the home and source of law for american and englishman alike in contemplate the edifice rear by the father of the american constitution we take pride in remember

herein print -rrb- _ author 's introduction _ this book be a result of three lecture which be deliver in the hall of gray 's inn london on June 13 15 and 19 1922 respectively under the auspices and on the invitation of the university of london the invitation originate with the university of manchester which through its then vice-chancellor dr ramsay muir two year ago graciously invite I to visit manchester and explain american political institution to the undergraduate subsequently i be greatly honor when the university of cambridge edinburgh and london join in the invitation unfortunately for I -- for i greatly value the privilege of explain the institution of my country to the undergraduate of these great university -- my political duty make it impossible for I to visit england prior to June 1 about which time the supreme court of the united state in which my official duty largely preoccupy my time adjourn for the summer any date after June 1 be inconvenient to the first three university but it be my good fortune that the university of london be able to carry out the plan and that it have the cordial co-operation of that venerable inn of court gray 's inn one of the noblest nursery of legal training thus i be privileged to address at once a academic and a professional audience i come to england for this purpose as a labor of love i have no anticipation of success for i fear that the interest in the subject-matter of my lecture would be very slight my surprise and gratification increase on the occasion of each lecture as the audience grow in number and distinction many lead jurist and statesman take more than a mere complimentary interest and some of they although press with social and public duty honor I with they attendance at all three lecture how can i adequately express my appreciation of the great honor thus do I by the earl of balfor the lord chancellor lord justice atkin the vice-chancellor of the university of london and many other leader in academic and legal circle -- not to forget the chief justice of the united state who pay I the great compliment of attend the last lecture to one and nil of my auditor my heartfelt thanks i also must not fail to acknowledge the generous space give in the british press to these lecture and the even more generous allusion to they in the editorial column a especial acknowledgment be due to viscount burnham and _ the daily telegraph _ for they generous interest in this book the good cause of anglo-american friendship have no better friend than lord burnham this experience have convince I that now more than ever before there be in england a deep interest in american institution and they history this be as it should be for -- for better or worse -- england and america will play together a great part in the future history of the world in double harness they be destine to pull the heavy load of the world 's problem therefore these yoke-fellow in equity must know each other better and what be more _ pull together _ as i be revise the proof of these lecture in beautiful chamonix the prospectus of the scottish-american association reach I in which its honorary secretary and my good friend dr charle sarolea take occasion to make the follow suggestion to he british compatriot : to remove those cause of estrangement to avoid a fateful catastrophe in other word to bring about a cordial understanding _ with _ america the first condition must be a understanding _ of _ america such a understanding or even the atmosphere in which such a understanding may grow have still to be create it be indeed pass strange that in these day of cheap book and free education america should be almost a ' _ terra incognita _ ' that we should know next to nothing of american history of the american constitution of american practical politics of the american mentality we scarcely read american newspaper or american book even such master of classical prose as franci parkman perhaps the greatest historian who have use the english language as he vehicle be almost unknown to the average reader we student do not visit american university as they use before the war to visit german university the consequence be that again and again we be run the risk of perpetrate the most grotesque error of judgment of commit the most serious political blunder in defiance of american public opinion the success of my gray 's inn lecture convince I that dr sarolea underestimate the interest in america and its history in england however the episode which be treat in these lecture be as he say _ terra incognita _ not only in england but even in the united state it be amazing how little be know in america of the fact give in my second lecture the american student after rejoice in the victory at yorktown and the end of the war of independence generally skip about eight year to 1789 mid he interest in the history of he own country recommence with the inauguration of president washington student of history in both country thus miss one of the most interesting and instructive chapter of american history and indeed of any history i have venture to add to my gray 's inn lecture another address which i deliver as the annual address at the session of the american bar association in cincinnatus ohio on August 31 1921 i do so because it have a direct bearing on the decay of the spirit of constitutionalism both in america and elsewhere it discuss a great _ malaise _ of we age for which i fear no write constitution however wise be a adequate remedy it be publish in condensed form in the issue of the _ fortnightly _ for October 1921 and a acknowledgment be due to its courteous editor for permission to republish it i have forborne in these lecture to make more than a pass reference to the league of nation and the great conference which frame it tempting as the obvious analogy be the reader who study the appendix will see that the covenant of the league more nearly resemble the article of confederation than the constitution of 1787 i only mention the subject to suggest that the reader of these lecture will better understand why the american people take the write obligation of the league so seriously and literally we have be train for nearly a century and a half to measure the validity and obligation of law and executive act in court of justice and to apply the plain import of the constitution we constant inquiry be be it so nominate in that compact in europe and especially england constitutionalism be largely a spirit of great objective and ideal therefore while in these nation the literal obligation of article x xi xv and xvi of the covenant of the league be not take rigidly we in america pursuant to we life-long habit of constitutionalism interpret these clause as we do those of we constitution and we ask ourselves be we ready to promise to do that which these article literally import join for example in a commercial social and even military war against any nation that be deem a aggressor however remote the cause of the war may be to we be we prepare to say that in the event of a war or threaten danger of war the supreme council of the league may take any action it deem wise and effectual to maintain peace this be a very serious committal other nation may not take it so literally but with we life-long adherence to a write constitution as a solemn contractual obligation we do this be say in no spirit of hostility to the league but only to explain the american point of view since i deliver these lecture i take a short trip to the continent and while sojourn in geneva make a visit to the office of the league all i there see greatly interested I and i could have nothing but a feeling of admiration for the effective and useful administrative work which the league be do the man who frame the covenant of the league try to do under more difficult but not dissimilar condition what the framer of the american constitution do in 1787 in both case the aim be high the great purpose meritorious those american who for the reason state be not in sympathy with the structural form and political objective of the league be not lack in sympathy for its admirable administrative work in co-ordinate the activity of civilized nation for the common good in any study of a world constitution the example of those who frame the american constitution can be study with profit jame m beck _ chamonix _ July 14 1922 _ contents _ preface by the earl of balfor introduction by sir john simon author 's introduction first lecture : the genesis of the constitution second lecture : the formulation of the constitution third lecture : the political philosophy of the constitution the revolt against authority _ i the genesis of the constitution of the united state _ i trust i need not offer this audience gather in the noble hall of this historic inn -- of old purpuleus britain 's ornament -- any apology for challenge its attention in this and two succeed address to the genesis formulation and the fundamental political philosophy of the constitution of the united state the occasion give I peculiar satisfaction not only in the opportunity to thank my fellow bencher of the inn for they graciousness in grant the use of this noble hall for this purpose but also because the delivery of these address now enable I to be for the moment in fact as in honorary title a bencher or reader of this time-honoured society if i need any justification for address which i be graciously invite to deliver under the auspices of the university of london a honor which i also gratefully acknowledge it would lie in the fact that we be to consider one of the supremely great achievement of the english-speaking race it be in that aspect that i shall treat my theme for as a philosophical or juristic discussion of the american constitution my address will be neither as deep as a well nor as wide as a church door my auditor will bear in mind that i must limit each address to the duration of a hour and that i can not go deeply or exhaustively into a subject that have challenge the admiring comment and profound consideration of the intellectual world for nearly a century and a half if england and america be to act together in the coming time -- and the destiny of the world be to a very large extent in they keep then they must know each other better and to this end they must take a greater interest in each other 's history and political institution my principal purpose in these lecture be to deepen the interest of this great nation in one of the very greatest and far-reaching achievement of we common race american have never lack interest in english history for however broad the stream of we national life how could we ignore its chief source but be there in england a equal interest in the history of america whose origin and development constitute one of the most dramatic and significant drama ever play upon the stage of this wide and universal theater of man it be true that thackeray in he _ virginian _ give we in fiction the finest picture of we colonial life and the late and deeply lament lord bryce write one of the best commentary upon we institution in _ the american commonwealth _ in more recent year two of the most moving portrait of we hamilton and lincoln be due to you mr oliver and lord charnwood we gratefully recognize this and yet how many educate englishman have study that little known chapter of we history which give to the progress of mankind a contribution to political science which you gladstone praise as the greatest ever strike off at a give time by the brain and purpose of man if peace have she victory no less renown would than war this achievement may well justify you study and awaken you admiration for as i have already say and can not too strongly emphasize it be the work of the english-speaking race of man who shortly before they enter upon this great work of constructive statecraft be citizen of you empire the condition of colonial development have profoundly stimulate in these english pioneer the sense and genius for constitutionalism in he speech on conciliation with america of march 22 1775 edmund burke show he characteristically philosophic comprehension of this powerful constitutional conscience of the then american subject of the empire after state that in no other country in the world be law so generally study and refer to the fact that as many copy of blackstone 's commentary have be sell in america as in england he add : this study render man acute inquisitive dexterous prompt in attack ready in defense full of resource in other country the people more simple and of a less mercurial cast judge of a ill principle in government only by a actual grievance here they anticipate the evil and judge of the pressure of the grievance by the badness of the principle moreover these hardy pioneer be the privileged heir of the great political tradition of england while the constitution of the united state be very much more than a adaptation of the british constitution yet its underlying spirit be that of the english speaking race and the common law behind the framer of the constitution as they enter upon they momentous task be the mighty shades of simon de montfort coke sandy bacon eliot hampden lilburne milton shaftesbury and locke could there be a better illustration of sir frederick pollock 's noble tribute to the genius of the common law : remember that we lady the common law be not a task-mistress but a bountiful sovereign whose service be freedom the destiny of the english-speaking world be bind up with she fortune and migration and its conquest be justify by she work another reason make the consideration of the subject not only interesting but opportune these be the time that try man 's soul it be a time of sift when man of all nation in civilization in these critical day be again test the value even of those political institution which have the sanction of the past society be in a state of flux everywhere the foundation of governmental structure seem to be settle -- let we hope and pray upon a _ surer _ foundation -- and when the seismic convulsion of the world war be take into account it be not surprising that this be so while the storm be not yet past and the wave have not wholly subside it be natural that everywhere thoughtful man as true mariner be take they reckoning to know where they be and whether the frail bark of human institution be still sufficiently seaworthy to keep afloat moreover the patent evidence of weakness in the international organization that we call civilization the imperative need of end the spirit of moral anarchy and the urgent necessity of rebuild the shatter ruin of the social edifice on surer foundation by the integration of the nation if possible into some new form of world organization give peculiar interest in these terrible day to the manner in which the american people solve a similar problem more than a century ago then as now a world war have end then as now half the world be prostrate by the wound of fratricidal strife as washington say : the whole world be in a uproar and he add that the task be to steer safely between scyllum and charybdi the problem then as now be not only to make the world safe for democracy but to make democracy for which there be no alternative safe for the world the thirteen colony in 1787 while small and relatively unimportant be however a little world in themselves and relatively to they number and resource this problem which they confront and solve differ in degree but not in kind from that which now confront civilization impoverished in resource exhaust by the loss of the flower of they youth demoralize by the reaction from feverish strife the force of disintegration have set in in the united state between 1783 and 1787 law and order have almost perish and the provisional government have be reduce to impotence a few wise and noble spirit true faithful and great heart lead a despondent people out of the slough of despond till they foot be again on firm ground and they face turn towards the delectable mountain of peace justice and liberty let it be emphasize that they do this not by seek more power but by impose restraint upon themselves that spirit of self-restraint be the essence of the american constitution so endure be they achievement that to-day the constitution of the united state be the oldest comprehensive written form of government now exist in the world few if any form of government have better withstand the mad spirit of innovation or more effectively prove they merit by the arduous greatness of thing do for this reason as the nation of the world be now try in a cosmic form and under similar condition to do that which the founder of the american republic in 1787 do in a microcosmic form a short narration of that earlier achievement may not be unprofitable in this day and generation when we be blindly grope towards some common basis for international co-ordination one of england 's greatest prime minister william pitt shortly after the adoption of the constitution prophetically say that it would be the admiration of the future age and the pattern for future constitution building time have verify he prediction for constitution making have be since the american constitution be adopt a continuous industry the american constitution have be the classic model for the federated state lieber estimate that three hundred and fifty constitution be make in the first sixty year of the nineteenth century and in the constituent state of the american union one hundred and three new constitution be promulgate in the first century of the united state have you a copy of the french constitution be ask of a bookseller during the second french empire and the characteristically witty gallic reply be : we do not deal in periodical literature constitution as governmental panacea have come and go but it can be say of the american constitution paraphrase the noble tribute of dr johnson to the immortal fame of shakespeare that the stream of time which have wash away the dissoluble fabric of many other paper constitution have leave almost untouched its adamantine strength except the first ten amendment which be virtually a part of the original charter only nine other have be adopt in more than one hundred and thirty year a constitution while primarily for the distribution of governmental power be in its last analysis a formal expression of adherence to that which in modern time have be call the higher law and which in ancient time be call natural law the jurisprudence of every nation have with more or less clearness recognize the existence of certain primal and fundamental law which be superior to the law statute or convention of live generation the original use of the term be to import the superiority of the imperial edict to the law of the comitium all nation have recognize this higher law to a greater or less extent if we turn to the writings of the most intellectual race in ancient time and possibly in recorded history -- the greek -- we shall see the higher law vindicate with incomparable power in the moral philosophy of its three greatest dramatist aeschylus sophocle and euripide how be it better express than by antigone when she be ask whether she have transgress the law of the state and reply : yes for that law be not from zeus nor do justice dweller with the god below establish it among man nor deem i that thy decree -- mere mortal that thou art -- could override those unwritten and unfailing mandate which be not of to-day or yesterday but ever live and no one know they birthtide five century later the greatest of the roman lawyer and orator cicero speak in the same term of a higher law which be never write and which we be never teach which we never team by reading but which be draw by nature herself the roman jurist give it express recognition they always recognize the distinction between _ jus civile _ or the law of the state and the _ jus naturale _ or the law of nature they nobly conceive that human society be a single unit and that it be govern by a law that be both antecedent and paramount to the law of rome thus the idea of a higher law transcend the power of a living generation and therefore eternal as justice itself -- become lodge in we system of jurisprudence nor be the common law want in a recognition of a higher law that would curb the power of king or parliament for its earlier master include four chief justice -lrb- coke hobart holt and popham -rrb- support the doctrine as lay down by coke that the judiciary have the power to nullify a law if it be against common right and reason -- -lrb- _ bonham 's case _ 8 coke report 114 -rrb- this view as to the limitation of government and the denial of its omnipotence be powerfully accentuate in america by the very condition of its colonization the good yeoman of england who journey to america go in the spirit of the noble and intrepid kent when turn he back upon king lear 's temporary injustice he say that he would shape he old course in a country new be it strange that the early colonist as they brave the hardship and peril of a dangerous voyage only to be confront in the wilderness by disease famine and massacre should fall back for they own government upon these primal verity of human society and claim not only they inherit rights as englishman but also the peculiar privilege of pioneer in a unconquered wilderness this spirit of constitutionalism in america which culminate in the constitution of the united state have its institutional origin in the spacious day of queen elizabeth that wonderful age which give to the world not only shakespeare spenser and jonson but also drake frobisher and raleigh be the anglo-saxon reaction to the renaissance the spirit of man have a new birth and be break away from the too rigid bond of ancient custom and authority among the notable but little known leader of that time be sir edwin sandy the lead spirit of the london -lrb- or virginium -rrb- company he be a liberal when to be such be a extra hazardous risk he be the son of a liberal for he father a great prelate have be send to the tower for preach in defense of lady jane gray the son sir edwin be the foe of monopoly and in the same parliament that impeach the great genius of this inn franci bacon sandy advocate the then novel proposition that accuse prisoner should have the right to be represent by counsel to which the strange objection be make that it would subvert the administration of justice as early as 1613 he have boldly declare in parliament that even the king 's authority rest upon the clear understanding that there be reciprocal condition which neither ruler nor subject could violate with impunity he might not too fancifully be call the father of american constitutionalism for he cause a constitution -- possibly the first time that that word be ever apply to a comprehensive scheme of government -- to be draft for the little colony of virginium in 1609 and amplify in 1612 speaking in this venerable hall whose very wall eloquently remind we of the mighty genius of franci bacon it be interesting to recall that these two charter of government which be the beginning of constitutionalism in america and therefore the germ of the constitution of the united state be put in legal form for royal approval by lord bacon himself thus the immortal treasurer of this inn be directly link with the development of constitutional freedom in america bacon become a member of the council for the virginium company in 1609 he deep interest in it be attest in the dedication to he by william strachey in 1618 of the latter 's _ historie of travaile into virginia brittanium _ in he speech in the house of common on January 30 1621 bacon see a vision of the future and predict the growth of america when he say : this kingdom now first in he majesty 's time have get a lot or portion in the new world by the plantation of virginium and the summer island and certainly it be with the kingdom on earth as it be in the kingdom of heaven sometimes a grain of mustard seed prove a great tree truly the mustard seed of virginium do become a great tree in the american commonwealth one of bacon 's nephew also of the inn of court nathaniel bacon become the first liberal leader in the colony and lead the first revolt against colonial misrule he be probably of gray 's inn for it be difficult to imagine a bacon study in any inn than the one to which the great bacon have give so much loving care due to these charter on July 30 1619 the little remnant of colonist whom disease and famine have leave untouched be summon to meet in the church at jamestown to form the first parliamentary assembly in america the first-born of the fruitful mother of parliament it be due to sandy not only that the first permanent english settlement in the western world be plant at jamestown in 1607 but that a later group of adventurer -- for such they call themselves -- destine to be more famous be drive by chance of wind and wave to land on the coast of massachusett thus be establish not only the beginning of england 's colonial empire -- still one of the most beneficent force in the world -- but also the principle of local self-government which in the western world be destine to develop the american commonwealth the compact sign in the cabin of the _ mayflower _ while not in strictness a constitution like the virginium charter be yet destine to be a landmark of history sandy suffer for he conviction for the party of reaction convinced king jame that virginia be a nest of sedition and the arbitrary ruler in the reorganization of the london company give a pointed admonition by say : choose the devil if you will but not sir edwin sandy in 1621 he be commit to the tower and only release after the house of common have make a vigorous protest against he incarceration he successor as treasurer of the london company be shakespeare 's patron the earl of southampton and it be not a fanciful conjecture to assume that when the news of the disaster which befall one of the fleet of the london company on the island of bermuda reach england it inspire shakespeare to write he incomparable sea idyl _ the tempest _ if so this lovely drama be shakespeare 's unconscious apostrophe to america for in ariel -- seek to be free -- can be symbolize she awakening spirit while prospero with he thaumaturgic achievement suggest a constructive genius which in a little more than a century have make one of the least of the nation to-day one of the greatest bacon sandy southampton and the liberal leader of the house of common have implant in the idea of the colonist the spirit of constitutionalism which be destine to influence profoundly the whole development of the american colony and finally to culminate in the constitution of the united state the later struggle in the long parliament the fall of charle i and more especially the deposition of jame ii the accession of william of orange and the substitution for the stuart claim of divine right that of the supremacy of the people in parliament naturally have they reaction in the western world in intensify the spirit of constitutionalism in the grow american commonwealth the colonial history be therefore increasingly mark by a spirit of individualism a natural partiality for local rule and a tenacious adherence to they special privilege whether grant to crown colony like new hampshire new york new jersey virginium the two carolina and georgium or proprietary government like maryland delaware and pennsylvanium or charter government such as massachusett rhode island and connecticut in the three colony last name formal corporate charter be grant by the crown which in themselves be constitution in embryo and the colonist thus acquire write rights as to the government of they internal affair upon the maintenance of which they jealously insist thus arise the spirit in america which treat constitutional rights not so much as special privilege grant by plenary sovereignty but as contractual obligation which could be enforce in the court against the sovereign all this develop in the colonist a powerful sense of constitutional morality and its pertinency to my present theme lie in the fact that when each of the thirteen colony become at the conclusion of the war of independence a separate and independent nation they be more concern in establish a central government to limit its authority and to maintain local self-government than they be to give to the new-born nation the power which it need they carry they constitutionalism to extreme which nearly make a strong and efficient central government a impossibility nothing be less desire by they than a unified government it be destine to be wring from they hard necessity the constitution be the reflex action of two oppose tendency the one the imperative need of a efficient central government and the other the passionate attachment to local self-rule co-operation between the colony have be a matter of long discussion and earnest debate and primarily result from the necessity of defense against a common foe the french in canada and the indian of the forest in 1643 four of the new england colony unite in a league to defend themselves in 1693 william penn make the first suggestion for a union of all the colony in 1734 a council be hold at albany at the instance of the crown to provide the means for the defense against france in canada and it be then that franklin submit the first concrete form for a union of the colony into a permanent alliance it be in advance of the time for conservative as it be it be unfortunately oppose both by the crown and the colony themselves the time be not ripe for any such union and the reason be apparent the colony differ very much in the character of they population in the nature of they economic interest and in they political antecedent they be not wholly of the english race many nation in europe have already contribute to the population for example new york be partly dutch and in pennsylvanium there be a considerable element of the swede german and swiss moreover the colonist be as widely separate from each other measure by the facility of locomotion as be the most remote nation of the world to-day only a few man ever find occasion to leave they colony to journey to another and most man never leave from birth to death the community in which they live outside of the few scattered community in the different colony there be a almost unbroken wilderness with few wagon road and in place only a bridle path the only method of communication be the letter and still fewer newspaper which be carry by post rider often through a almost trackless wilderness obviously a work government could not easily be constitute between people of different religion race and economic interest who for the most part never meet each other face to face and with whom frequent communication be impossible the difference between the colony and the mother-country with respect to internal taxation slowly develop into a issue of constitutionalism rather than of legislative policy as in england the immediate question affect the power of the crown to give to the custom inspector the power to make general search and seizure to enforce the navigation law in 1761 jame oti of massachusett make a fateful speech before the colonial legislature in which assert the illegality of the search warrant on the ground that they violate the constitutional rights of englishman to protection in they own home he assert that act of parliament which violate the sanctity of the home be void and that more specifically they violate the charter grant to massachusett assert the doctrine which at that time be the doctrine of the english common law as state by coke and three other chief justice he say : to say the parliament be absolute and arbitrary be a contradiction the parliament can not make two and two five omnipotency can not do it parliament be in all case to declare what be for the good of the whole but it be not the declaration of parliament that make it so : there must be in every instance a higher authority viz god should a act of parliament be against any of he natural law which be immutably true they declaration would be contrary to eternal truth equity and justice and consequently void and so it would be adjudge by the parliament itself when convince of they mistake it be a curious fact that in the reaction from the tyranny of the stuart you country abandon this principle of the common law by substitute for the omnipotence of the crown the omnipotence of parliament while in my country the somewhat vague and unworkable principle of the common law which give the judiciary the power to invalidate a act of the legislature when against natural reason and justice be develop into the great principle without which institution in a heterogeneous and widely scatter democracy would be unworkable namely that the power of government be strictly define and that neither the executive the legislative nor the judicial department of the government can go beyond the precise limit establish by the fundamental law like the common law the constitution be thus the result of a slow evolution mr gladstone in he oft-quoted remark give a erroneous impression when he say : as the british constitution be the most subtle organism which have proceed from progressive history so the american constitution be the most wonderful work ever strike off at a give time by the brain and purpose of man this assume that the constitution spring like minerva armed _ cap-à-pie _ from the brain of the american people whereas it be as much the result of a slow laborious and painful evolution as be the british constitution probably gladstone so understand the development of the american constitution and recognize that its framing be only the culmination of a evolution of many year when the constitutional struggle between the colony and the parliament become acute the necessity of a union for a common defense become imperative as early as July 1773 franklin recommend the convene of a general congress so that the colony would act together he suggestion be introduce in the virginium house of burgess in may 1774 and as a result there meet in philadelphium on September 5 of that year the first continental congress style by themselves : the delegate appoint by the good people of these colony nothing be further from they purpose than to form a central government or to separate from england this congress only meet as a conference of representative of the colony to defend what they conceive to be they constitutional rights before the second continental congress meet in the following year the accidental clash at lexington and concord have take place and as the congress again re-convene a momentous change have take place which be in fact the beginning of the american commonwealth the congress become by force of circumstance a provisional government and as such it might well have claim plenary power to meet a immediate exigency so indisposed be they to separate from england or to substitute for its rule that of a new government that the continental congress when it then involuntarily take over the government of america fail to exercise any adequate power it remain simply a conference without real power each colony have one vote and the rule of unanimity prevail even its decision be largely advisory for they amount to little more than recommendation to the constituent state as to what measure should be take each colony comply with the recommendation in its discretion and in its own way notwithstanding this fatal lack of authority the continental congress then actually engage in civil war create a army and through its committee enter into negotiation with foreign nation to support the former it issue paper money with the disastrous result that could be readily anticipate while it have a preside officer it have no executive and the new nation which be hardly conscious of its own birth have no judiciary have this _ de facto _ government assume the plenary power which provisional government must under similar circumstance necessarily assume it would have be better for the cause of the colonist for want of a efficient central government the civil administration of the infant nation be mark by a weakness and incapacity that defeat washington 's plan and nearly break he spirit washington 's little army be the victim of the gross incapacity of a impotent government the soldier come and go not as the general command but as the various colony permit the tragedy of valley forge when the little army nearly starve to death and literally the soldier could be track over the snow by they bleeding unshod foot be not due to lack of clothing and provision but to the gross incapacity of a headless government that if it have have the wisdom to act lack the authority the situation be one of chaos the colony recruit they own contingent pay such tax as they please which grow increasingly less and the congress have no coercive power to enforce its policy either with reference to internal or external affair this situation be so clearly recognize that immediately after the declaration of independence on July 4 1776 the draft of a constitution be propose to give the central government more effective power but although the necessity be manifest and most urgent the so-called article of confederation which be then draft in 1776 be never finally adopt by the requisite number of state until march 1781 when the war be nearly over as the result prove they mark only a very small advance over the exist _ de facto _ government for the constituent state be still too jealous of each other and too hostile to the creation of a central government to form a truly effective government the founder of the republic could only learn from they error but it be they great merit that they have the ability to profit in the stern school of experience of which franklin have say that it be a dear school but fool will learn in no other the founder of the republic be not fool and while they do not as gladstone seem to intimate have the inspired wisdom to develop a wonderful constitution by sheer intuition unaided by experience they do have the ability to make of they very error the stepping-stone to a higher destiny by the article of confederation which as state become effective in 1781 the conduct of foreign affair be vest in the new government which be also give the power to create admiralty court regulate coinage maintain a army and navy borrow money and emit bill of credit but the great limitation be that in all other respects the constituent state retain absolute power especially with reference to commerce and taxation all that the central government could do be to requisition the state to furnish food supplies and the state be then leave to impose the tax and if necessary to enforce they payment in they own way with the inevitable result that they vie with each other in the struggle to evade they the confederation have no direct power over the citizen of the several state moreover the congress could not levy any tax or indeed pass any measure unless nine out of the thirteen state agree and the constitution could not be amend except by unanimous vote while the congress could select a preside officer to serve for one year yet he have no real executive authority during the recess of the congress a committee of thirteen consist of one delegate from each state have _ ad interim _ power but not greater than the congress which they represent such a government would have be fatal to any people and so it nearly prove to be to the infant nation two circumstance save they from the consequence of such incapacity : one be the invaluable aid of france and the other the personality of george washington of this great leader one of the noblest that ever live in the tide of time it be only necessary to quote the fine tribute pay to he by the greatest of the victorian novelist in he _ virginian _ : what a constancy what a magnanimity what a surprising persistence against fortune washington the chief of a nation in arm do battle with distract party calm in the midst of conspiracy serene against the open foe before he and the darker enemy at he back washington inspiring order and spirit into troops hungry and in rag sting by ingratitude but betray no anger and every ready to forgive in defeat invincible magnanimous in conquest and never so sublime as on that day when he lay down he victorious sword and seek he noble retirement -- here indeed be a character to admire and revere a life without a stain a fame without a flaw a year after the article of confederation have be adopt the war come to a end by a preliminary treaty on November 30 1782 now follow the least known chapter in american history it be a period of travail of which the constitution of the united state and the present american nation be bear the government slowly succumb from its own weakness to its inevitable death only the shred and patch of authority be leave gradually the union fall apart of the continental congress only fifteen member represent seven colony remain to transact the affair of the new nation the army which previously to the termination of the war have dissolve by the hundred be now unpaid and in a stale of revolt measure after measure be propose in congress to raise money to pay the interest on the bond indebtedness which be in arrears and to provide fund for the most necessary expense but these fail in congress for the want of the necessary nine vote or if enact the state treat the requisition with indifference the currency of the united state have fall almost as low as the austrian krone and man derisively plaster the wall of they house with the worthless paper of the continental congress adequate authority no longer remain to carry out the term of the treaty with england and france and they be nullify by the failure of the infant nation to comply with its own obligation and the consequent refusal of the other contracting party to comply with theirs the government make a call upon the state to raise $ 8000000 for the most vital need but only $ 400000 be actually receive then congress ask the state to vest in it the power to levy a tax of five per cent on import for a limited period but after wait two year for the action of the state less than nine concur the state be then ask to pledge they own internal revenue for twenty-five year to meet the national indebtedness but this could only be do by unanimous consent and while twelve state concur rhode island refuse and the measure be defeat it be again the infinite folly of the _ liberum veto _ which prior to the great partition condemn poland to chronic anarchy the impotence of the new government which be still sit in philadelphium can be measure by the fact that on June 9 1783 word come that eighty soldier be on they way to philadelphium to demand relief they stack they arm in front of the state house where the congress be then sit and refuse to disband when request by col alexander hamilton as the representative of the congress to do so when congress appeal to the government of pennsylvanium for protection it be advise that the pennsylvanium militia be likewise insubordinate the congress then hastily flee by night and become a fugitive the impotence of the confederation can be measure by the fact that in the last fourteen month of its existence its receipt be less than $ 400000 while the interest on the foreign debt alone be over $ 2400000 and the interest on the internal debt be five-fold greater in the absence of any government and in the period of general prostration it be not unnatural that the spirit of bolshevism grow with alarming rapidity it even permeate the officer of the army in march 1783 a anonymous communication be send to washington 's officer to meet in secret conference to take some action possibly to overthrow the government a copy fall into washington 's hand and while he forbid the assemblage of the officer under the anonymous call he himself direct the officer to assemble he unexpectedly appear at the meeting and be no speaker he have reduce he appeal to write as he adjust he spectacles to read it he pathetically say : i have not only grown gray but blind in you service he then make a touching appeal to they not to increase by example the spreading spirit of revolt the very sight of they old commander turn the heart of the revolting element and the officer remain loyal to they noble leader where the spirit of disaffection be thus find in high place it naturally prevail more widely among the mass who have be drive to frenzy by they suffering this culminate in a revolt in massachusett under the leadership of a old soldier name shay and it spread with such rapidity that not only do one-fifth of the people join in attempt to overthrow the remnant of established authority in massachusett but it rapidly spread to other state the office of government and the courthouse be seize the collection of debt be forbid and private property be forcibly appropriate to meet the common need chaos have come again it fill washington 's heart with disgust and despair after surrender he commission to the pitiful remnant of the government he have retire to mount vernon and for a time decline to act further as the leader of he people thus in October 1785 he write jame warren of massachusett : the war as you have very justly observe have terminate most advantageously for america and a fair field be present to we view but i confess to you freely my dear sir that i do not think we possess wisdom or justice enough to cultivate it properly illiberality jealousy and local policy mix too much in all we public council for good government of the union in a word the confederation appear to I to be little more than a shadow without the substance and congress a nugatory body they ordinance be little attend to by such policy as this the wheel of government be clog and we brightest prospects and that high expectation which be entertain of we by the wonder world be turn into astonishment and from the high ground on which we stand we be descend into the vale of confusion and darkness again he write to george mason : i have see without despondency even for a moment the hour which america have style its gloomy one but i have behold no day since the commencement of hostility that i think we liberty in such imminent danger as at present indeed we be verge so fast to destruction that i be feel that sense to which i have be a stranger until within these three month again in 1786 he write : i think often of we situation and view it with concern from the high ground we stand upon from the plain path which invite we footstep to be so fall so lose be mortifying but everything of virtue have in a degree take its departure from we land what gracious god be man that there should be such inconsistency and perfidiousness in he conduct it be but the other day that we be shed we blood to obtain the constitution under which we now live and now we be unsheathe we sword to overturn they the thing be so unaccountable that i hardly know how to realize it or to persuade myself that i be not under a illusion of a dream it be however the darkest hour before the dawn and again it be washington who become he country 's savior in 1785 some commissioner from the state of virginium and maryland visit mount vernon to pay they respects to the well-loved commander after confer with he upon the chaos of the time they decide to issue a call for a general conference of the representative of the state to be hold on September 11 1786 at annapoli maryland to discuss how far the state themselves could agree on common regulation of commerce at the appoint time the delegate assemble from virginia pennsylvanium delaware new york and new jersey and finding themselves too few in number to achieve the great objective the convention contented itself by issue another call draft by alexander hamilton then under thirty year of age to all the state to send delegate to a convention to be hold in philadelphium on the second Monday in may 1787 to take into consideration the situation of the united state to devise such further provision as should appear to they necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigency of the union the die congress tardily approve of this suggestion but finally on January 21 1787 grudgingly adopt a resolution that -- it be expedient that on the second Monday in may next a convention of delegate who shall have be appoint by the several state be hold at philadelphium _ for the sole and express purpose of revise the article of confederation _ and report to congress and the several legislature such alteration and provision therein as shall _ when agree to in congress _ and conform to by the state render the federal constitution adequate to the exigency of the government and the preservation of the union it will be note by the italicized portion of the resolution that this impotent body thus vainly attempt to cling to the shadow of its vanish authority by state that the propose constitutional convention should merely revise the worthless article of confederation and that such amendment should not have validity until adopt by congress as well as by the people of the several state how this mandate be disregard and how the convention be form and proceed to create a new government with a new constitution and how it achieve its mighty work will be the subject of the next lecture anticipate the masterly ability with which a seemingly impotent and die nation pluck from the nettle of danger the flower of safety let I conclude this first address by quote the word of de tocqueville in he remarkable work _ democracy in america _ where he say : the federal government condemn to impotence by its constitution and no longer sustain by the presence of common danger be already on the verge of destruction when it officially proclaim its inability to conduct the government and appeal to the constituent authority of the nation it be a novelty in the history of a society to see a calm and scrutinize eye turn upon itself when apprise by the legislature that the wheel of government be stop to see it carefully examine the extent of the field and patiently wait for two year until a remedy be discover which it voluntarily adopt without have ever wring a tear or a drop of blood from mankind _ ii the great convention _ now follow a notable and yet little known scene in the drama of history it reveal a people who without shed a drop of blood calmly and deliberately abolish one government substitute another and erect it upon foundation which have hitherto prove endure even the superstructure slowly erect upon these foundation have suffer little change in the most changing period of the world 's history and until recently its addition few in number have vary little from the plan of the original architect the constitution be to-day not a ruin parthenon but rather as one of those gothic masterpiece against which the storm of passionate strife have beat in vain the foundation be lay at a time when disorder be rampant and anarchy widely prevalent as i have already show in my first lecture credit be go business paralyse lawlessness triumphant and not only between class and class but between state and state there be acute controversy and a alarming disunity of spirit to weld thirteen jealous and discordant state demoralize by a exhausting war into a unify and efficient nation against they will be a seemingly impossible task frederick the so-called great have say that a federal union of widely scatter community be impossible its final accomplishment have blind the world to the essential difficulty of the problem the time be may 25 1787 the place the state house in philadelphium a little town of not more than 20000 people and at that time as remote measure by the facility of communication to the centre of civilization as be now vladivostok the _ dramati persona _ in this drama though few in number be however worthy of the task seventy-two have originally be offer or give credentials for each state be permit to send as many delegate as it pleased inasmuch as the state be to vote in the convention as unit of these the greatest actual attendance be fifty-five and at the end of the convention a saving remnant of only thirty-nine remain to finish a work which be to immortalize its participant while this notable group of man contain a few merchant financier farmer doctor educator and soldier of the remainder at least thirty-one be lawyer and of these many have be justice of the local court and executive officer of the commonwealth four have study in the inner temple at least five in the middle temple one at oxford under the tuition of blackstone and two in scottish university few of they be inexperienced in public affair for of the original fifty-five member thirty-nine have be member of the first or second continental congress and eight have already help to frame the constitution of they respective state at least twenty-two be college graduate of whom nine be graduate of princeton three of yale two of harvard four of william and mary and one each from the university of oxford columbium glasgow and edinburgh a few already enjoy world-wide fame notably doctor franklin possibly the most versatile genius of the eighteenth century and universally know and honor as a scientist philosopher and diplomat and george washington whose fame even at that day have fill the world with the noble purity of he character it be a convention of comparatively young man the average age be little above forty franklin be the oldest member be then eighty-one dayton the youngest be twenty-seven with the exception of franklin and washington most of the potential personality in the convention be under forty thus jame madison who contribute so largely to the plan that he be sometimes call the father of the constitution be thirty-six charle pinckney who unaid submit the first concrete draft of the constitution be only twenty-nine and alexander hamilton who be destine to take a lead part in secure its ratification by he powerful oratory and he very able commentary in the federalist papers be only thirty above all they be a group of gentleman of substance and honor who could debate for four month during the depressing weather of a hot summer without lose they temper except momentarily -- and this despite vital difference -- and who show that genius for toleration and reconciliation of conflict view inspire by a common fidelity to a great objective that be the highest mark of statesmanship they represent the spirit of representative government at its best in avoid the cowardice of time-server and the low cunning of demagogue all apparently be inspire by a fine spirit of self-effacement selfish ambition be conspicuously absent they differ at time heatedly but always as gentleman of candor and honor the very secrecy of they deliberation of which i shall presently speak be ample proof how indifferent they be to popular applause and the _ civium ardor prava jubentium _ the convention have be slow in assemble ample notice have be give that it would convene on may 13 1787 but when that day arrive a mere handful of the delegate less than a quorum have assemble the virginia delegation six in number and form probably the ablest delegation from any state arrive in time and fail to find a quorum then assemble employ the period of wait in submit to the pennsylvanium delegation the outline of a plan for the new constitution the plan be largely the work of jame madison and how long it have be in preparation can not be definitely state it be clear that four year before a philadelphium merchant one peletiah webster have publish a brochure propose a scheme of dual sovereignty under which the citizen would owe a double allegiance -- one to the constituent state within the sphere of they reserved power and one to a federated government within the sphere of its delegated power league of state have often exist but a league which within a prescribe sphere would have direct authority over the citizen of the constituent state without however abolish the authority of such state as to they reserved sphere of power be a novel theory how far the virginium project have be influence by webster 's suggestion be not clear but it be certain that before the convention meet pennsylvanium and virginium two of the most powerful state be commit to it the suggestion be a radical one for the state with few exception be chiefly insistent upon the preservation of they sovereignty and while they be willing to amend the article of confederation by give fuller authority to the central government such as it be the suggestion of subordinate the state to a new sovereign power whose authority within circumscribed limit be to be supreme be oppose to all they convention and tradition washington however have warmly welcome the creation of a strong central government and he correspondence with the lead man of the colony for some year previously have be burden with argument to convince they that a mere league of state would not suffice to create a stable nation to george washington soldier and statesman be due above all man the ideal of a federated union for without he influence -- that of a noble and unselfish leader -- the great result would probably never have be secure while still wait for the convention to meet and while discuss what be expedient and practicable when they do meet washington one day say to a group of delegate who be consider the acute nature of the crisis : it be too probable that no plan that we propose will be adopt perhaps another dreadful conflict be to be sustain if to please the people we offer what we ourselves disapprove how can we afterwards defend we work let we raise a standard to which the wise and just can repair the event be in the hand of god noble word fit to be write in letter of gold over the portal of every legislature of the world and it be in this spirit that the convention finally convene on may 25th 1787 when the delegate from nine state have assemble washington be unanimously elect the preside officer of the convention it begin by adopt rule of order and the most significant of these be the provision for secrecy no copy should be take of any entry on the journal or even permission give to inspect it without leave of the convention and nothing speak in the house be print or otherwise publish or communicate without leave the yea and nay should not be record the rule of secrecy be enlarged by a unwritten understanding that even when the convention have adjourn no disclosure should be make of its proceedings during the life of its member when after nearly four month the convention adjourn the secret have be keep and no one know even the concrete result of its deliberation until the constitution itself and nothing else be offer to the approval of the people the high-way upon which the state house front be cover with earth to deaden the noise of traffic and sentry be post at every means of ingress and egress to prevent any intrusion upon the privacy of the convention the member be not photograph daily for the pictorial press nor do any cinema register they entrance into the simple colonial hall where they be to meet notwithstanding this limitation -- for no present-day conference or assembly can proceed with its labor until its member be photograph for the curiosity of the public -- these simple-minded gentleman -- less intent upon they appearance than they task -- be to accomplish a work of endure importance the extreme care which be take to preserve this secrecy inviolate and its purpose be indicate in a incident hand down by tradition one of the member drop a copy of a proposition then before the convention for consideration and it be find by another of the delegate and hand to general washington at the conclusion of the session washington arise and sternly reprimand the member for he carelessness by say : i must entreat gentleman to be more careful lest we transaction get into the newspaper and disturb the public repose by premature speculation i know not whose paper it be but there it be -lrb- _ throw it down on the table _ -rrb- let he who own it take it he then bow pick up he hat and leave the room with such evidence of annoyance that like school-child no delegate be willing to admit the ownership of the paper the thought suggest itself : how different the result at versaille and genoa might have be have there be the same reasonable provision for discussion and action uninfluenced by too premature public comment of the day in these day when representative government have degenerate into government by a fleeting public opinion the price we pay for such government by for and of the press be too often the inability of representative to do what they deem wise and just at the close of the convention its record be commit into the keep of washington with instruction to retain the journal and other papers subject to order of congress if ever form under the constitution even the journal consist of little more than daily memorandum from which the minute ought to have be but never be make and these fragmentary record of the proceedings of a convention which have be in continuous session for nearly four month be never publish until the year 1819 or thirty-two year after the close of the convention thus the american people know nothing of they greatest convention until a generation later and then only a few bone of the mastodon be exhibit to they curious gaze the member of the convention keep its secret inviolate for many year with few exception the great secret of the convention die with they only one jame madison leave a comprehensive statement of the more formal proceedings with this notable exception only a few anecdote hand down by tradition escape oblivion the first of the number to break the pledge of secrecy be robert yate chief justice of new york who in 1821 publish he recollection but as he have leave the convention a few month after it begin he note cease with the 5th of July the world would thus have be for ever ignorant of the detail of one of the most remarkable convention in the annals of mankind have it not be that one of the ablest of they number jame madison regularly attend the session and keep note from day to day of the debate while he be not a stenographer he have a gift for condense a speech and fairly represent its substance he jealously guard he journal of the convention until he death its very existence be know to few he die in 1836 and four year later the government purchase the manuscript from he widow then for the first time the curtain be measurably raise upon the proceedings of a convention which have create as we now know one of the greatest nation in history fifty-three year after the close of the convention and when nearly every one of its participant be dead madison 's journal be first publish when be a great secret better keep grateful as posterity must be for this inestimable gift of great human enterprise yet even madison 's careful journal fill one with the deepest regret that this wonderful debate which last for nearly four month between man of no ordinary ability could not have be preserve to the world two or three of the speech which madison give in he journal be complete for when doctor franklin speak he reduce he remark to write and give a copy to madison but of the other speech only a fragrant remain thus that admirable crichton alexander hamilton address the convention in a speech that last five hour in which he state he philosophy of government but of that only a short condensation and possibly not even a accurate fragment remain without this extraordinary provision for secrecy which be so oppose to modern democratic convention and which so little resemble the famous point as to open covenant openly arrive at the convention could not have accomplish its great work for these wise man realize that a statesman can not act wisely under the observation of a gallery and especially when the gallery compel he by the pressure of public opinion to work as it direct i recognize that public opinion -- often temporarily uninformed but in the end generally right -- do often save the democracy of the world from the selfish end of self-seeking and misguided leadership but give noble and wise representative they work best when least influence by the fleeting passion of the day it be evident that if the framer of the constitution have meet as similar convention have within recent year meet at versaille and genoa with the world as they gallery and with the representative of the press as a integral part of the conference they would have accomplish nothing the probability be that the convention would not have last a month if they immediate purpose have be to placate current opinion it may be doubt whether such a convention if call to-day either in you country or mine could achieve like result for in this day of unlimited publicity when man divide not as individual but in powerful and organized group a constitutional convention would i fear prove a witch ' cauldron of class legislation and demagoguery be it not possible that modern democracy be in danger of strangulation by its present-day method and ideal again the word of washington suggest themselves : if to please the people we offer what we ourselves disapprove how can we afterwards defend we work let we raise a standard to which the wise and just can repair work with a sad sincerity and with despair in they heart this little band of man work a work of surpass importance and if they do not receive the immediate plaudit of the living generation they shades can at least solace themselves with the reflection that posterity have acclaimed they work as one of the greatest political achievement of man the rule of order and the nature of the proceedings thus determine the convention open by a address by mr randolph of virginium in which he submit in the form of fifteen point -- nearly the number of the fatal fourteen -- the outline for a new government he himself in he open speech summarize the proposition by candidly confess that they be not intend for a federal government -lrb- thereby mean a mere league of state -rrb- but a strong consolidated union upon this radical change the convention be to argue earnestly and at time bitterly for many a weary day the plan provide for a national legislature of which the lower branch should be elect by the people and the upper branch by the lower branch upon the nomination of the legislature of the state this legislature should enjoy all the legislative rights give to the federation and there follow the sweeping grant that it could legislate in all case to which the separate state be incompetent or in which the harmony of the united state may be interrupt by the exercise of individual legislation with power to negative all law pass by the several state contravene in the opinion of the national legislature the article of the union a national executive be propose together with a national judiciary and these two body be give authority to examine every act of the national legislature before it shall operate and every act of a particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final this mark a immense advance over the article of confederation under which there be no national executive or judiciary and under which the legislature have no direct power over the citizen of the state and could only impose duty upon the state themselves by the concurrence of nine of the thirteen hardly have mr randolph submit the so-called virginia plan when charle pinckney of south carolina a young man of twenty-nine year of age with the courage of youth submit to the house a draft of the future federal government curiously enough it do not differ in principle from the virginium plan but be more specific and concrete in state the power which the federal government should exercise and many of its provision be embody in the final draft indeed pinckney 's plan be the future constitution of the united state in embryo and when it be read and contrast with the document which have so justly win the acclaim of man throughout the world it be amazing that so young a man should have anticipate and reduce to a concrete and effective form many of the most novel feature of the federal government as the only copy of pinckney 's plan be furnished year afterwards to madison for he journal it be possible that some of its wisdom be of the _ post factum _ variety have receive the two plan the convention then go on may 30 into a committee of the whole to consider the fifteen proposition in the virginium plan _ seriatim _ they wisely conclude to determine abstract idea first and concrete form later apparently for the time be little attention be pay to pinckney 's plan and this may have be due to the hostile attitude of the older member of the convention to the presumption of he youth then ensue a very remarkable debate on the immediate proposition and the principle of government which underlie they which last for two week on June 13 the committee rise even the fragment of this debate which may well have be one of the most notable in history indicate the care with which the member have study government of ancient and modern time there be many point of difference but chief of they which nearly result in the collapse of the convention be the inevitable difficulty which always arise in the formation of a league of state or a association of nation between the great and the little state the five larger state have a population that be nearly twice as great as the remain eight state thus virginia 's population be nearly ten-fold as great as georgium moreover the state differ greatly in they material wealth and power nevertheless all of they enter the convention as independent sovereign nation and the smaller nation contend that the equality in suffrage and political power which prevail in the convention -lrb- in which each state large or small vote as a unit -rrb- should and must be preserve in the future government to this the larger state be quite unwilling to yield and when the committee rise they report in substance the virginium plan with the proviso that representation in the propose double-chambered congress should be accord to some equitable ratio of representation on June 15 the small state present they draft which be afterwards know as the new jersey plan because it be introduce by mr patterson of that state it only contemplate a amendment to the exist constitution and a amplification of the power of the impotent confederation its chief advance over the exist government be that it provide for a federal executive and a federal judiciary but otherwise the government remain a mere league of state in which the central government could generally act only by the vote of nine state and in which they power be exhaust when they request the state to enforce the decree its chief advance over the article of confederation in addition to the creation of a executive be a assertion that the act of congress shall be the supreme law of the respective state and that the judiciary of the several state shall be bind thereby in they decision and that if any state or any body of man in any state shall oppose or prevent the carry into execution of such act or treaty the federal executive shall be authorize to call forth the power of the confederated state to enforce and compel obedience to such act or a observance of such treaty while this be some advance toward a truly national government it yet leave the national executive dependent upon the constituent state for if they fail to respond to the call above state the national government have no direct power over they citizen the new jersey plan precipitate a crisis and thereafter and for many day the argument proceed only to increase in bitterness on June 18 alexander hamilton who agree with no one else address the convention for the first time he speak for five hour and review exhaustively the virginium and new jersey plan and possibly the pinckney draft even the fragment of the speech as take in long-hand by madison show that it be a masterly argument he state he belief that the british government be the best in the world and that he doubt much whether anything short of it would do in america he praise the british constitution quote monsieur necker as say that it be the only government in the world which unite government strength with individual security he analyze and explain you constitution as it then be and advocate a elective monarchy in form though not in name it be true that he call the executive a governor and not a king but the governor so-called be to serve for life and be give not only a negative on all law about to be pass but even the execution of all duly enact law be in he discretion the governor with the consent of the senate be to make war conclude all treaty make all appointment pardon all offence with the full power through he negative of say what law should be pass and which enforce hamilton 's governor would have be not dissimilar to loui xiv and could have say with he _ l'état c'est moi _ the senate also serve for life and the only concession which hamilton make to democracy be a elective house of representative thinly veil he plan contemplate a elective king with greater power than those of george iii a imitation house of lord and a popular house of common with a limited tenure hamilton 's plan be never take seriously and so far as the record show be never afterwards consider he admirer have give great praise to he work in the federal convention he real contribution lay in the fact that when the constitution be finally draft and offer to the people while he regard it as a wretched makeshift to use he own expression yet he be broad and patriotic enough to surrender he own view and advocate the adoption of the constitution in so do he fight a valorous fight secure the acquiescence of the state of new york and without its ratification the constitution would never have be adopt hamilton later think better of the constitution and its successful beginning be due in large measure to he genius for constructive administration as the debate proceed the crisis precipitate by the seemingly insoluble difference between the great and little state become more acute the smaller state contend that the convention be transgress its power and they demand that the credentials of the various member be read in this there be technical accuracy for the delegate have be appoint to revise the article of confederation and not to adopt a new constitution a majority of the convention however insist upon the convention proceeding with the consideration of a new constitution and they view prevail it speak well for the honor of the delegate that although they difference become so acute as to lead at time to bitter expression neither side divulge they to the outside public the smaller state could easily have end the convention by a appeal to public opinion which be not then prepare for a consolidated union but they be loyal enough to fight out they quarrel within the wall of the convention hall at time the debate become bitter in the extreme jame wilson a delegate of pennsylvanium and a scotchman by birth and education turn to the representative of the little state passionately say : will you abandon a country to which you be bind by so many strong and enduring tie should the event happen it will neither stagger my sentiment nor duty if the minority of the people refuse to coalesce with the majority on just and proper principle if a separation must take place it could never happen on better grounds he refer to the demand of the larger state that representation should be proportion to the population to this bedford of delaware as heatedly reply we have be tell with a dictatorial air that this be the last moment for a fair trial in favor of good government it will be the last indeed if the proposition report by the committee go forth to the people the large state dare not dissolve the convention if they do the small one will find some foreign ally of more honor and good faith who will take they by the hand and do they justice finally the smaller state give they ultimatum to the larger state that unless representation in both branch of the proposed legislature should be on the basis of equality -- each state whether large or small have one vote -- they would forthwith leave the convention a eye-witness say that at that moment washington who be in the chair give old doctor franklin a significant look franklin arise and move a adjournment for forty-eight hour with the understanding that the delegate should confer with those with whom they disagree rather than with those with whom they agree a recess be take and when the convention re-convene on July 2 a vote be take as to equality of representation in the senate and result in a tie vote it be then decide to appoint a committee of eleven one from each state to consider the question and this committee report three day later on July 5 in favor of proportionate representation in the house and equal representation in the senate this suggestion which finally save the situation be due to that wise old utilitarian philosopher franklin again a vehement and passionate debate follow vague reference be make to the sword as the only method of solve the difference on July 9 the committee again report maintain the principle of they recommendation while modify its detail and the debate then turn upon the question to what extent the negro slave should count in estimate population for the purpose of proportionate representation in the lower house various suggestion be make to base representation upon wealth or taxation and not upon population for several day the debate last during very heated weather but on the night of July 12 the temperature drop and with it the emotional temperature of the delegate some day previous namely June 28 when the debate be become so bitter that it seem unlikely that the convention could continue doctor franklin erroneously suppose by many to be a atheist make the follow solemn and beautiful appeal to they better nature he say : the small progress we have make after four or five week ' close attendance and continual reasoning with each other -- we different sentiment on almost every question several of the last producing as many no as aye be methink a melancholy proof of the imperfection of the human understanding we indeed seem to feel we own want of political wisdom since we have be run about in search of it we have go back to ancient history for model of government and examine the different form of those republic which have be form with the seed of they own dissolution now no longer exist and we have view modern state all around europe but find none of they constitution suitable to we circumstance in this situation of this assembly groping as it be in the dark to find political truth and scarce able to distinguish it when present to we how have it happen sir that we have not hitherto once think of humbly apply to the father of light to illuminate we understanding and have we now forget that powerful friend or do we imagine that we no longer need he assistance i have live sir a long time and the longer i live the more convincing proof i see of this truth : that _ god govern in the affair of man _ and if a sparrow can not fall to the ground without he notice be it probable that a empire can rise without he aid we have be assure sir in the sacred writings that ` except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it ' i firmly believe this and i also believe that without he concur aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builder of babel we shall be divide by we little partial local interest we project will be confound and we ourselves shall become a reproach and byword down to future age and what be worse mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establish government by human wisdom and leave it to chance war and conquest i therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayer implore the assistance of heaven and its blessing on we deliberation be hold in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business and that one or more of the clergy of this city be request to officiate in that service it may surprise my audience to know the sequel the resolution be vote down partly on the ground that if it become know to the public that the convention have finally resort to prayer it might cause undue alarm but also because the convention be by that time so low in fund that as one of the member say it do not have enough money to pay a clergyman he fee for the service i suspect that they controlling reason be they indisposition to break they self-imposed rule of secrecy by contact with the outer world until they work be complete perhaps they think that god help those who help themselves on July 16 the compromise be finally adopt of recognize the claim of the larger state to proportionate representation in the house of representative and recognize the claim of the smaller state by accord to they equal representation in the senate this great result be not effect without the first break in the convention for the delegate from new york leave in disgust and never return with the exception of hamilton who occasionally attend subsequent session such be the great concession that be make to secure the constitution and the only respect in which the constitution to-day can not be amend be that by express provision the equality of representation in the senate shall never be disturbed thus it be that to-day some state which have less population than some of the ward in the city of new york have as many vote in the senate as the great state of new york it be unquestionably a palpable negation of majority rule for as no measure can become a law without the concurrence of the senate -- now numbering ninety-six senator -- a combination of the little state whoso aggregate population be not a fifth of the american people can defeat the will of the remain four-fifth pennsylvanium and new york with nearly one-sixth of the entire population of the united state have only four vote in ninety-six vote in the senate fortunately political alignment have rarely be between the greater and the smaller state exclusively they equality in the senate be a big price to pay for the union but as the event have show not too great the convention next turn its attention to the executive and the manner of its selection and upon this point there be the widest contrariety of view but fortunately without the acute feeling that the relative power of the state have occasion then the judiciary article be take up and there be much earnest discussion as to whether the new constitution should embody the french idea of give to the judiciary in conjunction with the executive a revisory power over legislation three time the convention vote upon this dangerous proposition and on one occasion it be only defeat by a single vote fortunately the good sense of the convention reject a proposition that have cause in france constant conflict between the executive and the judiciary by substitute the right of the president to veto congressional legislation with the right of congress by a two-third vote of each house to override the veto and secondly by a implied power in the judiciary to annul congressional or state legislation not on the grounds of policy but on the sole ground of inconsistency with the paramount law of the constitution in this adjustment the influence of montesquieu be evident these and many practical detail have result in a expansion of the fifteen proposal of the virginium plan to twenty-three have thus determine the general principle that should guide they in they labor the convention on July 26 appoint a committee on detail to embody these proposition in the formal draft of a constitution and adjourn until August 6 to await its report that report when finally complete covered seven folio page and be find to consist of a preamble and twenty-three article embody forty-three section the draft do not slavishly follow the virginium proposition for the committee embody some valuable suggestion which have occur to they in they deliberation nevertheless it substantially put the virginium plan into a workable plan which prove to be the constitution of the united state in embryo when the committee on detail have make its report on August 6 the convention proceed for over a month to debate it with the most minute care every day for five week for five hour each day the member study and debate with meticulous care every sentence of the propose constitution time do not suffice even for the barest statement of the many interesting question which be thus discuss but they nearly run the whole gamut of constitutional government many fanciful idea be suggest but with unvarying good sense they be reject some of the result be under the circumstance curious for example although it be a convention of comparatively young man and although the convention could have take into account the many successful young man in public life in europe -- as for example william pitt -- they put a disqualification upon age by provide that a representative must be twenty-five year of age a senator thirty year of age and a president thirty-five year of age when it be suggest that young man could learn by admission to public life the sententious reply be make that while they could they ought not to have they education at the public expense the debate proceed however in better temper and almost the only question that again give rise to passionate argument be that of slavery the extreme southern state declare that they would never accept the new plan except the right to import slave be untouched this question be finally compromise by agree that the importation of slave should end after the year 1808 it however leave the slave population then exist in a state of bondage and for this necessary compromise the nation seventy-five year later be to pay dearly by one of the most destructive civil war in the annals of mankind August be now draw to a close the convention have be in session for more than three month of its work the public know nothing and this notwithstanding the acute interest which the american people not merely face the peril of anarchy but actually suffer from it must have take in the convention its vital importance be not under-estimated while its builder like all master builder do build better than they know yet it can not be say that they under-estimate the importance of they labor as one of they number gouveneur morri say : the whole human race will be affect by the proceedings of this convention after it adjourn one of its greatest participant jame wilson of pennsylvanium say : after the lapse of six thousand year since the creation of the world america now present the first instance of a people assemble to say deliberately and calmly and to decide leisurely and peaceably on the form of government by which they will bind themselves and they posterity in the absence of any authentic information the rumor spread through the colony that the convention be about to reconstitute a monarchy by invite the second son of george iii the bishop of osnaburg to be king of the united state and these rumor become so persistent as to evoke from the silent convention a semi-official denial there be some reason to believe that a minority of the convention do see in the restoration of a constitutional monarchy the only solution of the problem on September 8 the committee have finally consider and after modification approve the draft of the committee on detail and a new committee be thereupon appoint to revise the style of and arrange the article that have be agree to by the house this committee be one of exceptional strength there be dr william samuel johnson a graduate of oxford and a friend of he great namesake samuel johnson alexander hamilton gouveneur morri a brilliant mind with a unusual gift for lucid expression jame madison a true scholar in politics and rufus king a orator who in the inflated language of the day be rank among the luminary of the present age the convention then adjourn to await the final revision of the draft by the committee on style on September 12 the committee report while it be not certain it be believe that its work be largely that of gouveneur morri September 13 the print copy of the report of the committee on style be ready and three more day be spend by the convention in carefully compare each article and section of this final draft on September 15 the work of draft the constitution be regard as end and it be adopt and order to be engross for sign it may be interesting at this point to give the result of they labor as measure in word and if the framer of the constitution deserve the plaudit of posterity in no other respect they do in the remarkable self-restraint which those result reveal the convention have be in session for 81 continuous day probably they have consume over 300 hour in debate if they debate have be fully report they would probably have fill at least fifty volume and yet the net result of they labor consist of about 4000 word 89 sentence and about 140 distinct provision as the late lord bryce speaking in this age of unbridled expression both oral and print so well have say : the constitution of the united state include the amendment may be read aloud in twenty-three minute it be about half as long as saint paul 's epistle to the corinthian and one-fourth as long as the irish land act of 1881 history know few instrument which in so few word lay down equally momentous rule on a vast range of matter of the highest importance and complexity even include the nineteen amendment the constitution after one hundred and thirty-five year of development do not exceed 7000 word what admirable self-restraint possibly single opinion of the supreme court could be cite which be as long as the whole document of which they be interpret a single phrase this do not argue that the constitution be a obscure document for it would be difficult to cite any political document in the annals of mankind that be so simple and lucid in expression there be nothing johnsonese about its style every word be a word of plain speech the ordinary meaning of which even the man in the street know no tautology be to be find and no attempt at ornate expression it be a model of simplicity and as it flow through the reach of history it will always excite the admiration of those who love clarity and not rhetorical excess one can say of it as horace say of he favorite spring : _ o fon bandusiae splendidior vitro dulce digne mero non sine floribus _ if i be ask why if this be true it have require many lengthy opinion of the supreme court in the 256 volume of its report to interpret its mean the answer be that as with the simple saying of the great galilean whose word have likewise be the subject of unending commentary the question be not one of clarity but of adaptation of the meaning to the ever-changing condition of human life moreover as with the saying of the master or the unequalled verse of shakespeare question of construction be more due to the commentator than to the text itself on September 17 the convention meet for the last time the document be engross and lay before the member for signature of the fifty-five member who have attend only thirty-nine remain of those a number be unwilling to sign as individual while the member have not be unconscious of the magnitude of they labor they be quite insensible of the magnitude of they achievement few there be of the convention who be enthusiastic about this result indeed as the document be ready for signature it become a grave question whether the remnant which remain have sufficient faith in they own work to subscribe they name and if they fail to do so its adoption by the people would have be impossible it be then that doctor franklin render one of the last and greatest service of he life with ingratiating wit and with all the impressiveness that he distinguished career inspire franklin thus speak : i confess that there be several part of this constitution which i do not at present approve but i be not sure i shall never approve they for have live long i have experience many instance of be oblige by better information or fuller consideration to change opinion even on important subject which i once think right but find to be otherwise it be therefore that the older i grow the more apt i be to doubt my own judgment and to pay more respect to the judgment of other most man indeed as well as most sect in religion think themselves in possession of all truth and that wherever other differ from they it be so far error steele a protestant in a dedication tell the pope that the only difference between we church in they opinion of the certainty of they doctrine be the church of rome be infallible and the church of england be never in the wrong but though many private person think almost as highly of they own infallibility as of that of they sect few express it so naturally as a certain french lady who in a dispute with she sister say : ' i do not know how it happen sister but i meet with nobody but myself that be always in the right ' -- _ il n ' y a que moi qui a toujor raison _ in these sentiment sir i agree to this constitution with all its fault if they be such because i think a general government necessary for we and there be no form of government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administer and i believe further that this be likely to be well administer for a course of year and can only end in despotism as other form have do before it when the people shall become so corrupt as to need despotic government be incapable of any other i doubt too whether any other convention we can obtain may be able to make a better constitution for when you assemble a number of man to have the advantage of they joint wisdom you inevitably assemble with those man all they prejudice they passion they error of opinion they local interest and they selfish view from such a assembly can a perfect production be expect it therefore astonish I sir to find this system approach so near to perfection as it do thus i consent sir to this constitution because i expect no better and because i be not sure that it be not the best the opinion i have have of its error i sacrifice to the public good i have never whisper a syllable of they abroad within these wall they be bear and here they shall die if every one of we in return to we constituent be to report the objection he have have to it and endeavor to gain partisan in support of they we might prevent its be generally receive and thereby lose all the salutary effect and great advantage result naturally in we favor among foreign nation as well as among ourselves from we real or apparent unanimity on the whole sir i can not help express a wish that every member of the convention who may still have objection to it would with I on this occasion doubt a little of he own infallibility -- and to make manifest we unanimity put he name to this instrument truly this spirit of doctor franklin could be profitably invoke in this day and generation when nation be so intolerant of the idea of other nation as the member move by franklin 's humorous and yet moving appeal come forward to subscribe they name franklin draw the attention of some of the member to the fact that on the back of the president 's chair be the half disk of a sun and with he love of metaphor he say that painter have often find it difficult to distinguish in they art a rise from a setting sun he then prophetically add : i have often and often in the course of the session and the vicissitude of my hope and fear in its issue look at that behind the president without be able to tell whether it be rise or set but now at length i have the happiness to know that it be a rise and not a set sun time have verify the genial doctor 's prediction the career of the new nation thus form have hitherto be a rise and not a set sun he have in he sixty year of conspicuously useful citizenship -- and perhaps no nation ever have a more untiring and unselfish servant -- do more than any american to develop the american commonwealth but like mose he be destine to see the promised land only from afar for the new government have hardly be inaugurate before franklin die as full of year as honor prophetic as be he vision he could never have anticipate the reality of to-day for this nation thus deliberately form in the light of reason and without blood or passion be to-day by common consent one of the greatest and i trust i may add one of the noblest republic of all time _ iii the political philosophy of the constitution _ in my last address i leave doctor franklin predict to the discourage remnant of the constitutional convention that the nation then form would be a rise sun in the constellation of the nation the sun however be destine to rise through a bank of dark and murky cloud for the constitution could not take effect until it be ratify by nine of the thirteen state and when it be submit to the people who select state convention for the purpose of ratify or reject the propose plan of government a bitter controversy at once ensue between two political party then in process of formation one call the constitution ratify without controversy in the remain ten the struggle be long and arduous and nearly a year pass before the requisite nine state give they assent two of the state refuse to become part of the new nation even after it begin and three year pass before the thirteen state be re-unite under the constitution it could not have be ratify have there not be a assurance that there would be immediate amendment to provide a bill of rights to safeguard the individual thus come into existence the first ten amendment to the constitution with they perpetual guaranty of the fundamental rights of religion freedom of speech and of the press the right of assemblage the immunity from unreasonable search and seizure the right of trial by jury and similar guarantee of fundamental individual rights distrustful as the american people be of the new constitution they yet have the political sagacity to prefer its imperfection whatever they imagine they to be to the mad spirit of innovation and in order that the great instrument should not through the excess of party passion or the temporary caprice of fleeting generation speedily become a mere scrap of paper they very wisely provide that no amendment should in the future be make unless it be propose by at least two-third of the senate and the house of representative and ratify by three-fourth of the state through they legislature or through special convention this be only one of many striking negation of the principle of majority rule as a result of this provision if we count the first ten amendment as virtually part of the original document only nine amendment have be adopt in 185 year and of these except the amendment which end slavery as the result of the civil war only the last three pass in recent year partly through the relaxing influence of the world war mark a serious departure from the basic principle of the constitution this stability be the more remarkable when we recall the profound and revolutionary change that have take place in the social life of man since the constitution be adopt it be frame at the very end of the pastoral-agricultural age of humanity the industrial revolution which have more profoundly affected man in the last century and a half than all the change which have theretofore take place in the life of man since the cave-dweller be only then begin measure in term of mechanical power man when the constitution be form be lilliputian as compare with the brobdingnagian of we day when man outfly the eagle outswim the fish and by he conquest and utilization of the invisible force of nature have become the superman and yet the constitution of 1787 be in most of its essential principle still the constitution of 1922 this surely mark it as a marvel in statecraft and can only be explain by the fact that the constitution be develop by a people who as child brave and free of the great mother-tongue have a real genius for self-government and its essential element the spirit of self-restraint while it be true that the _ text _ of the instrument have suffer almost as little change as the nicene creed yet it would be manifest error to suggest that in its development by practical application the constitution have not undergo great change the first and greatest of all its expounder chief justice marshall say in one of he greatest opinion that the constitution be -- intend to endure for age to come and consequently to be _ adapt _ to the various crisis of human affair to have prescribe the means by which government should in all future time execute its power would have be to change entirely the character of the instrument and to give it the property of a legal code it would have be a unwise attempt to provide by immutable rule for exigency which if foresee at all must have be foresee dimly and can best be provide for as they occur in this great purpose of enumerate rather than define the power of government its framer be supremely wise while it be marvellously sagacious in what it provide it be wise to the point of inspiration in what it leave unprovided nothing be more admirable than the self-restraint of man who venture upon a untried experiment and after debate for four month upon the principle of government be content to embody they conclusion in not more than four thousand word to this we owe the elasticity of the instrument its vitality be due to the fact that by usage judicial interpretation and when necessary formal amendment it can be thus adapt to the ever-accelerating change of the most progressive age in history and that a people have administer the constitution who in the process of such adaptation have generally show the same spirit of conservative self-restraint as do the man who frame it the constitution be neither on the one hand a gibraltar rock which wholly resist the ceaseless wash of time or circumstance nor be it on the other hand a sandy beach which be slowly destroy by the erosion of the wave it be rather to be liken to a float dock which while firmly attach to its mooring and not therefore the caprice of the wave yet rise and fall with the tide of time and circumstance while in its practical adaptation to this complex age the man who frame it if they could revisit the glimpse of the moon would as little recognize they own handiwork as they own nation yet they would still be able to find in successful operation the essential principle which they embody in the document more than a century ago its success be also due to the fact that its framer be little influence by the spirit of doctrinarianism they be not empiricist but very practical man this be the more remarkable because they work in a period of a emotional fermentation of human think the long-repressed intellect of man have break into a violent eruption like that of a seemingly extinct volcano from the middle of the eighteenth century until the end of the french revolution the mass everywhere be influence by the emotional and at time hysterical abstraction of the french encyclopedist and that these have influence think in the american colony be readily show in the preamble of the declaration of independence with its unqualified assertion of the equality of man and the absolute right of self-determination the declaration seek in its noble idealism to make the world safe for democracy but the constitution attempt the greater task of make democracy safe for the world by induce a people to impose upon themselves salutary restraint upon majority rule fortunately the framer of the constitution have learn a rude and terrible lesson in the anarchy that have follow the war of independence they be not so much concerned about the rights of man as about he duty and they great purpose be to substitute for the visionary idealism of a rampant individualism the authority of law of the hysteria of that time which be about to culminate in the french revolution there be no trace in the constitution they be less concerned about rousseau 's social contract than to restore law and order hard reality and not generous and impossible abstraction interested they they have suffer grievously for more than ten year from misrule and have a distaste for mere phrase-making of which they have have a satiety for the constitution in which there be not a waste word be as cold and dry a document as a problem in mathematics or a manual of parliamentary law its mandate have the simplicity and directness of the ten commandment and like the decalogue it consist more of what shall not be do than what shall be do in this freedom from empiricism and sturdy adherence to the reality of life it can be profitably commend to all nation which may attempt a similar task while the constitution apparently only deal with the practical and essential detail of government yet underlie these simply but wonderfully phrased delegation of power be a broad and accurate political philosophy which go far to state the law and the prophet of free government these essential principle of the constitution may be briefly summarize as follow : 1 _ the first be representative government _ nothing be more striking in the debate of the convention than the distrust of its member with few exception of what they call democracy by this term they mean the power of the people to legislate directly and without the intervention of choose representative they believe that the utmost concession that could be safely make to democracy be the power to select suitable man to legislate for the common good and nothing be more striking in the constitution than the care with which they seek to remove the power of legislation from the _ direct _ action of the people nowhere in the instrument be there a suggestion of the initiative or referendum even a amendment to the constitution could not be directly propose by the people in the exercise of they residual power or adopt by they as previously say it could only be propose by two-third of the house and the senate and then could only become effective if ratify by three-fourth of the state act not by a popular vote but through they choose representative either in they legislature or special convention thus they deny the power of a majority to alter even the form of government moreover they give to the president the power to nullify law pass by a majority of the house and senate by he simple veto and yet fearful of a unqualified power of the president in this respect they provide that the veto itself should be veto if two-third of the senate and house concur in such action moreover the great limitation of the constitution which forbid the majority or even the whole body of the house and senate to pass law either for want of authority or because they impair fundamental rights of individual be as emphatic a negation of a absolute democracy as can be find in any form of government measure by present-day convention of democracy the constitution be a undemocratic document the framer believe in representative government to which they give the name republicanism as the antithesis to democracy the member of the senate be to be select by state legislature and the president himself be as originally plan to be select by a electoral college similar to the college of cardinal the debate be full of utterance which explain this attitude of mind mr gerry say : the evil we experience flow from the excess of democracy the people be the dupe of pretended patriot mr randolph the author of the virginium plan observe that the general object of the constitution be to provide a cure for the evil under which the united state labor that in trace these evil to they origin every man have find it in the tribulation and folly of democracy that some check therefore be to be seek for against this tendency of we government alexander hamilton remark on June 18 that -- the member most tenacious of republicanism be as loud as any in declaim against the evil of democracy he add : give all the power to the many and they will oppress the few give all the power to the few and they will oppress the many both ought therefore to have the power that each may defend itself against the other perhaps the attitude of the member be thus best express by jame madison in the 10th of the federalist papers : a pure democracy by which i mean a state consist of a small number of citizen who assemble and administer the government in person can admit of no cure for the mischief of faction such democracy have ever be spectacles of turbulence and contention and have often be find incompatible with the personal security and rights of property and have generally be as short in they life as they have be violent in they death undoubtedly the framer of the constitution in thus limit popular rule do not take sufficient account of the genius of a english-speaking people a few of they number recognize this franklin a self-made man believe in democracy and doubt the efficacy of the constitution unless it be like a pyramid broad-based upon the will of the people colonel mason of virginium who be also of the jeffersonian school of political philosophy say : notwithstanding the oppression and injustice experience among we from democracy the genius of the people be in favor of it and the genius of the people must be consult in this they be true prophet for the american people have refuse to limit democracy as narrowly and rigidly as the framer of the constitution clearly intend the most notable illustration of this be the selection of the president it be never contemplate that the people should directly select the president but that a choose body of elector should with careful deliberation make this momentous choice while in form the system persist to this day from the very begin the elector simply vote as the people who select they desire it should here be note that thoma jefferson the great democrat and draftsman of the declaration of independence be not a member of the convention during its session he be in france he be instrumental in secure the first ten amendment and the subsequent adaptation of the constitution to meet the democratic instinct of the american people be largely due to he great leadership moreover the spirit of representative government have greatly change since the constitution be adopt the ideal of the earlier time be that so nobly express by edmund burke in he address to the elector of bristol for the framer believe that a representative hold a judicial position of the most sacred character and that he should vote as he judgment and conscience dictate without respect to the wish of he constituent to-day and notably in the last half century the contrary belief due largely to jefferson 's political ideal have so influence american politics that the representative of the people either in the legislature or the executive department of the government be consider by the mass as only the mouthpiece of the people who select they and to ignore they wish be regard as virtually a betrayal of a trust and the negation of democracy for this change in attitude there have be much justification for in my country as elsewhere the people do not always select they best man as representative and with the imperfection of human nature there have be so much of ignorance and at time venality that the instinct of the people be to take the conduct of affair into they own hand on the other hand this change of attitude have lead in many instance to government by organize minority for with the division of the mass into political party it be easy for a organize minority to hold the balance of power and thus impress its will upon majority time may yet vindicate the theory of the framer that the limit of democracy be the selection of true and try representative 2 _ the second and most novel principle of the constitution be its dual form of government _ this do constitute a unique contribution to the science of politics this be early recognize by de tocqueville one of the most acute student of the constitution who say that it be base upon a wholly novel theory which may be consider a great discovery in modern political science previous to the constitution it have not be think possible to divide sovereignty or at least to have two different sovereignty move as planet in the same orbit therefore all previous federated government have be base upon the plan that a league could only effect its will through the constituent state and that the citizen in these state owe no direct allegiance to the league but only to the state of which they be member the constitution however develop the idea of a dual citizenship while the people remain citizen of they respective state in the sphere of government which be reserve to the state yet they directly become citizen of the central government and as such cease to be citizen of the several state in the sphere of government delegate to the central power and this allegiance be enforce by the direct action of the central government on the citizen as individual thus have be develop one of the most intricately complex governmental system in the world at the time of the adoption of the constitution this division of jurisdiction be quite feasible for geographically the various state be widely separated and the lack of economic contact make it easy for each government to function without serious conflict the framer however do not sufficiently reckon with the mechanical change in society that be then begin they do not anticipate and could not have anticipate the centripetal influence of steam and electricity which have weave the american people into a indissoluble unit for commercial and many other purpose as a result many law of the federal government in they incidence in this complex age directly impinge upon rights of the state government and _ vice versa _ and the practical application of the constitution have require a very subtle adaptation of a form of government which be enact in a primitive age to a form of government of a complex age take for example the power over commerce accord to the constitution the federal government have plenary power over foreign commerce and commerce _ between _ the state but the power over commerce _ within _ a state be reserve to state government this presuppose the power of government to divide commerce into two water-tight compartment or at least to regard the two sphere of power as parallel line that would never meet whereas with the come of the railroad steamship and the telegraph commerce have become so unify that the parallel line have become line of interlace zigzag to adapt the commerce clause of the constitution to these changed condition have require in the highest degree the constructive genius of the supreme court of the united state and in a series of very remarkable decision which be contain in 256 volume of the official report that great tribunal have try to draw a line between inter-state and domestic commerce as nearly to the original plan of the framer as it be possible but obviously there have be so much adaptation to make this possible that if washington franklin madison and hamilton could revisit the nation they create they would not recognize they own handiwork for the same reason the dual system of government have be profoundly modify by the great elemental force of we mechanical age so that the scale which try to hold in nice equipoise the federal government on the one hand and the state on the other have be greatly disturbed originally the state be the powerful political entity and the central government a mere agent for certain specific purpose but in the development of the constitution the nation have naturally become of overshadow importance while the state have relatively steadily diminish in power and prestige these inevitable tendency in american politics be call centralization and while for nearly a century a great political party bitterly contest its steady progress due to the centripetal influence above indicate yet the contest be long since abandon as a hopeless one and the struggle to-day be rather to keep so far as possible the inevitable tendency measurably in check nevertheless it would be erroneous to suggest that the dual system of government be a failure it still endure in provide a large measure of authority to the state in they purely domestic concern and in a country that extend from the atlantic to the pacific and from the lake to the gulf whose northern border be not very far from the arctic circle and whose southern border be not many degree from the equator there be such difference in the habit convention and ideal of the people that without this dual form of government the constitution would long since have break down it be not too much to say that the success with which the framer of the constitution reconcile national supremacy and efficiency with local self-government be one of the great achievement in the history of mankind 3 _ the third principle be the guaranty of individual liberty through constitutional limitation _ this marked another great contribution of america to the science of government in all previous government build the state be regard as a sovereign which could grant to individual or class out of its plenary power certain privilege or exemption which be call liberty thus the liberty which the baron wring from king john at runnymede be virtually exemption from the power of government we father do not believe in the sovereignty of the state in the sense of absolute power nor do they believe in the sovereignty of the people in that sense the word sovereignty will not be find in the constitution or the declaration of independence they believe that each individual as a responsible moral being have certain inalienable rights which neither the state nor the people could rightfully take from he this conception of individualism enforce in court of law against executive and legislature be wholly new and be the distinguish characteristic of american constitutionalism as to such reserve rights guarantee by constitutional limitation and largely by the first ten amendment to the constitution a man by virtue of he inherent and god-given dignity as a human soul have rights such as freedom of the press liberty of speech property rights and religious freedom which even one hundred million of people can not rightfully take from he without amend the constitution the framer do not believe that the oil of anoint that be suppose to sanctify the monarch and give he infallibility have fall upon the multitudinous tongue of the people to give it either infallibility or omnipotence they believe in individualism they be animated by a sleepless jealousy of governmental power they believe that the greater such power the greater the danger of its abuse they feel that the individual could generally best work out he own salvation and that he constant prayer to government be that of diogene to alexander : keep out of my sunlight the worth and dignity of the human soul the free competition of man and man the nobility of labor the right to work free from the tyranny of state or class this be they gospel socialism be to they abhorrent this theory of government give a new dignity to manhood it say to the state : there be a limit to you power thus far and no further and here shall thy proud wave be stay 4 _ closely ally to this doctrine of limited governmental power even by a majority be the fourth principle of a independent judiciary _ it be the balance wheel of the constitution and to function it must be beyond the possibility of attack and destruction my country be found upon the rock of property rights and the sanctity of contract both the nation and the several state be forbid to impair the obligation of contract or take away life liberty or property without due process of law the guarantee be as old as magna charta for due process of law be but a paraphrase of the law of the land without which no freeman could be deprive of he liberty or possession due process of law mean that there be certain fundamental principle of liberty not define or even enumerate in the constitution but have they sanction in the free and enlighten conscience of just man and that no man can be deprive of life liberty or property except in conformity with these fundamental decency of liberty to protect these even against the will of a majority however large the judiciary be give unprecedented power it throw about the individual the solemn circle of the law it make the judiciary the final conscience of the nation you nation cherish the same primal verity of liberty but with you the people in parliament be the final judge we however be not content that a majority of the legislature shall override inviolable individual rights about which the judiciary be empower to throw the solemn circle of the law this August power have win the admiration of the world and by many be regard as a novel contribution to the science of government the idea however be not wholly novel as previously show four chief justice of england have declare that a act of parliament if against common right and reason could be treat as null and void while in france the power of the judiciary to refuse efficacy to a law unless sanction by the judiciary have be the cause of a long struggle for at least three century between the french monarch and the court of france however in england the doctrine of the common law yield to the later doctrine of the omnipotence of parliament while in france the revisory power of the judiciary be terminate by the french revolution the united state however embody it in its form of government and thus make the judiciary and especially the supreme court the balance wheel of the constitution without such power the constitution could never have last for neither executive officer nor legislature be good judge of the extent of they own power nothing more strikingly show the spirit of unity which the constitution bring into be than the unbroken success with which the supreme court have discharge this difficult and most delicate duty the president be the commander-in-chief of the army and the navy and can call they to he aid the legislature have almost unlimited power through its control of the public purse the state have they power reinforce by armed force and some of they be as great in population and resource as many of the nation of europe the supreme court however have only one officer to execute its decree call the united state marshal and yet without sword or purse and with only a high sheriff to enforce its mandate when the supreme court say to a president or to a congress or to the authority of a great -- and in some respects sovereign -- state that they must do this or must refrain from do that the mandate be at once obey here indeed be the american ideal of a government of law and not of man most strikingly realize and if the american constitution as formulate and develop have do nothing else than to establish in this manner the supremacy of law even as against the overwhelming sentiment of the people it would have justify the well-known encomium of mr gladstone it must be add however that in one respect this function of the judiciary have have a unfortunate effect in lessen rather than develop in the people the sense of constitutional morality in you country the power of parliament be omnipotent and yet in its legislation it voluntarily observe these great fundamental decency of liberty which in the american constitution be protect by formal guarantee this can only be true because either you representative in parliament have a deep sense of constitutional morality or that the constituency which select they have so much sense of constitutional justice that they representative dare not disregard these fundamental decency of liberty in the united state however the confidence that the supreme court will itself protect these guaranty of liberty have lead to a diminution of the sense of constitutional morality both in the people and they representative it abate the vigilance which be say to be ever the price of liberty law be pass which transgress the limitation of the constitution without adequate discussion as to they unconstitutional character for the reason that the determination of this fact be erroneously suppose to be the exclusive function of the judiciary the judiciary contrary to the common supposition have no plenary power to nullify unconstitutional law it can only do so when there be a irreconcilable and indubitable repugnancy between a law and the constitution but obviously law can be pass from motive that be anti-constitutional and there be a wide sphere of political discretion in which many act can be do which while politically anti-constitutional be not juridically unconstitutional for this reason the undue dependence upon the judiciary to nullify every law which either in form necessary operation or motive transgress the constitution have so far lessen the vigilance of the people to protect they own constitution as to lead to its serious impairment 5 _ the fifth fundamental principle be a system of governmental check and balance _ the founder of the republic be not enamoured of power as they view human history the worst evil of government be due to excessive concentration of power which like othello 's jealousy make the meat it feed on this system of check and balance again illustrate that the constitution be the great negation of unrestrained democracy the framer believe that a people be best govern that be least govern therefore they purpose be not so much to promote efficiency in legislation as to put a brake upon precipitate action time do not suffice to state the intricate system of check and balance whereby the legislature act as a check upon the executive and the executive upon the legislature and the supreme court upon both when the republic be small and its public affair be few this system of check and balance work admirably but to-day when the nation be one of the greatest in the world and its public affair be of the most important and complicated character and often require speedy action it may be question whether the system be not now a undue brake upon governmental efficiency and do _ not _ require some modification to ensure efficiency indeed it be a serious question with many thoughtful american whether the growth of the united state have not put a excessive strain upon its governmental machinery this system be in part due to the confident belief of the framer of the constitution in the montesquieu doctrine of the division of government into three independent department -- legislative executive and judicial but experience have show how difficult it be to apply this doctrine in its literal rigidity one result of the doctrine be the mistaken attempt to keep the legislative and the executive as far apart as possible the cabinet system of parliamentary government be not adopt while the president can appear before congress and express he view he cabinet be without such right in practice the gulf be bridge by constant contact between the cabinet and the committee of congress but this do not wholly secure speedy and efficient co-operation between the two department as i speak a movement be in progress with the sanction of president harding to permit member of he cabinet to appear in congress and thus defend directly and in person the policy of the executive this separation of the two department which cause so much friction have be emphasize by one feature of the constitution which again mark its distrust of democracy namely the fix tenure of office the constitution do not intend that public official should rise or fall with the fleeting caprice of a constituency it prefer to give the president and the member of congress a fixed term of office and however unpopular they might become temporarily they should have the right and the opportunity to proceed even with unpopular policy and thus challenge the final verdict of the people if a parliamentary form of government immediately responsive to current opinion as register in election be the great desideratum then the fix tenure of office be the vulnerable achilles-heel of we form of government in other country the executive can not survive a vote of want of confidence by the legislature in america the president who be merely the executive of the legislative will continue for he prescribed term though he may have wholly lose the confidence of the representative of the people in congress while this make for stability in administration and keep the ship of state on a even keel yet it also lead to the fatalism of we democracy and often the native hue of its resolution be thus sickly o'er with the pale cast of thought take a striking instance i be confident that after the sinking of the _ lusitanium _ the united state would have enter the world war if president wilson 's tenure of power have then depend upon a vote of confidence 6 _ the sixth fundamental principle be the joint power of the senate and the executive over the foreign relation of the government _ i need not dwell at length upon this unique feature of we constitutional system for since the versaille treaty the world have become well acquaint with we peculiar system under which treaty be make and war be declare or terminate nothing except the principle of local rule be of deeper concern to the framer of the constitution when it be frame it be the accept principle of all other nation that the control of the foreign relation of the government be the exclusive prerogative of the executive in you country the only limitation upon that power be the control of parliament over the purse of the nation and some of the great struggle in you history related to the attempt of the crown to exact money to carry on the war without a parliament grant the framer be unwilling to lodge any such power in the executive however great he power in other respects this be primarily due to the conception of the state that then prevail while they have create a central government for certain specify purpose they yet regard themselves as sovereign nation and they representative in the senate be in a sense they ambassador they be as little inclined to permit the president of the united state to make treaty or declare war at will in they behalf as the european nation would be to-day to vest a similar authority in the league of nation it be therefore first propose that the power to make treaty and appoint diplomatic representative should be vest exclusively in the senate but as that body be not always in session this plan be so far modify as to give the president who be always act the power to _ negotiate _ treaty with the advice and consent of the senate as to make war the framer be not willing to entrust the power even to the president and the senator and it be therefore expressly provide that only congress could take this momentous step here again the theory of the constitution be necessarily somewhat modify in practical administration for under the power of nominating diplomatic representative negotiate treaty and in general of execute the law of the nation the principle be soon evolve that the conduct of foreign affair be primarily the function of the president with the limitation that the senate must concur in diplomatic appointment and in the validity of treaty and that only both house of congress could jointly declare war this cumbrous system necessarily require that the president in conduct the foreign relation of the government should keep in touch with the senate and such be the accept procedure throughout the history of the nation until president wilson see fit to ignore the senate even when the senate have indicate its dissent in advance to some of he policy at the versaille conference i suppose that since that conference no part of we constitutional system have cause more adverse comment in europe than this system it often handicap the united state from take a speedy and effectual part in international negotiation although if the president and the senate be in harmony and collaborate in this joint responsibility there be no necessary reason why this should be so i share the view of many american that this provision of the constitution be wise and salutary especially at this time when the united state have take such a important position in the council of civilization the president be a very powerful executive and he tenure while short be fix generally he be elect by little more than a majority of the people and sometimes through the curious workings of the electoral college system he have be only the choice of a minority of the electorate for these reason the framer of the constitution be unwilling to vest in the president exclusively the immeasurable power of pledge the faith man-power and resource of the nation and of declare war the heterogeneous character of we population especially emphasize the wisdom of this course for it would be difficult if not impossible for a american president to make a offensive and defensive alliance with any nation or declare war against another nation without run counter to the racial interest and passion of a substantial part of the american nation for better or worse the united state have limit but not destroy as the world war show its freedom to antagonize powerful nation from whose people it have draw large number of its own citizenship the domestic harmony of the nation require that before the united state assume treaty obligation or make war such policy shall represent the largely preponderating sentiment of its people and nothing could more effectually secure this end than to require the president before make a treaty to secure the assent of two-third of the senate and a majority of both house of congress before make war while this may lead as it have in recent year to temporary and regrettable embarrassment yet in the long run it be not only better for the united state but it be even to the best interest of other nation for in this way they be safeguard against the possible action of a executive with whom racial instinct might still be very influential in you country where the government of the day be subject to immediate dismissal for want of confidence such power over foreign relation can be safely entrust to a few man but in the united state with its fixed tenure of office a president could pledge the faith and involve he nation in war against the interest and will of the people suppose the president have unlimited power over we foreign relation and that within the next ten year a american whose parent be bear in any european nation be elect on purely domestic issue he could with he assure four year of power bring about a new alignment of nation and shake the political equilibrium of the world the constitution wisely refuse to grant such a power hence the provision for the concurrence of the legislative representative of the nation at all event it constitute a system which as the last presidential election show the american people will not willingly forgo it be true that this system make it difficult for the united state to participate effectively in the main purpose of the league of nation to enforce peace by joint action at geneva but to ask the united state to surrender a vital part of its constitutional system upon which its domestic peace so largely depend in order to promote the league seem to I as unreasonable as it would be to ask you country to abolish the crown to which it be sincerely attach as a vital part of its system as a contribution towards international co-operation you would not surrender such a integral part of you system and therefore it be not reasonable to expect a similar sacrifice on we part even though the meritorious purpose of the league be freely recognize i have thus summarize briefly and most inadequately some of the essential principle of the constitution i have only be able to suggest very impressionistically what they be and the lesson to be draw from they if i be able to deliver a dozen address on the subject in this historic hall and with this indulgent audience i would not scratch even the surface to understand the constitution of the united state you must not only read the text but the thousand of opinion render in the last 130 year by the supreme court in its great task of interpret this wonderful document few document have be the subject of more extended commentary the four thousand word have be meticulously examine through intellectual microscope in judicial opinion textbook and other commentary which be as thick as autumnal leaf that strow the brook in vallombrosa one can say of this document as dr furness in he variorum edition of _ hamlet _ say of the word of that character : no word by he let fall no syllable by he utter but have be catch up and ponder as no word except those of holy writ but what of its future and how long will the constitution wholly resist the wash of time and circumstance lord macaulay once venture the prediction that the constitution would prove unworkable as soon as there be no longer large area of undeveloped land and when the united state become a nation of great city that period of development have arrive in 1880 only 15 per cent of the american population live in the city and the remainder be still on the farm to-day over 52 per cent be crowd in one hundred great city lord macaulay add : i believe america 's fate be only defer by physical cause institution purely democratic will sooner or later destroy liberty or civilization or both the american constitution be all sail and no anchor in this last commentary lord macaulay be clearly mistake as i have show the constitution be not purely democratic it be amazing that so great a mind should have so little understand that more than any other constitution that of america impose powerful restraint on democracy the experience of a century and a quarter have show that while the anchor may at time drag yet it measurably hold the ship of state to its ancient mooring the american constitution still remain in its essential principle and still enjoy not only the confidence but the affection of the great and varied people whom it rule to the latter this remarkable achievement must be attribute rather than to any inherent strength in parchment or red seal for in a democracy the living soul of any constitution must be such belief of the people in its wisdom and justice if it should perish to-morrow it would yet have enjoy a life and growth of which any nation or age might be justly proud moreover it could claim with truth if it finally perish that it have be subject to condition for which it be never intend and that some of its essential principle have be ignore the constitution be something more than a write formulum of government -- it be a great spirit it be a high and noble assertion and indeed vindication of the morality of government it render unto caesar -lrb- the political state -rrb- the thing that be caesar 's but in safeguard the fundamental moral rights of the people it render unto god the thing that be god 's in conclude i can not refrain from again remind you that this consummate work of statecraft be the work of the english-speaking race and that you people can therefore justly share in the pride which it awaken it be not only one of the great achievement of that _ gen aeterna _ but also one of the great monument of human progress it illustrate the possibility of true democracy in its best estate when the moral anarchy out of which it be bear be call to mind it can be truly say that while sown in weakness it be raise in power to the succeed age it will be a flaming beacon and everywhere man who be confront with the acute problem of this complex age can take encouragement from the fact that a small and weak people when confront with similar problem have the strength and will to impose restraint upon themselves by peacefully proclaim in the simple word of the noble preamble to the constitution : we the people of the united state in order to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and we posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united state of america note the word ordain and establish they imply perpetuity they make no provision for the secession of any state even if it deem itself aggrieve by federal action and yet the right to secede be urge for many year but lincoln complete the work of washington franklin madison and hamilton by establish that a government for the people by the people and of the people should not perish from the earth _ iv the revolt against authority _ where there be no vision the people perish : but he that keepeth the law happy be he proverb xxix 18 one of the most quote -- and also mis-quoted -- proverb of the wise solomon say as translate in the authorize version : where there be no vision the people perish what solomon actually say be : where there be no vision the people _ cast off restraint _ the translator thus confuse a effect with a cause what be the vision to which the wise man refer the rest of the proverb which be rarely quote explain : where there be no vision the people cast off restraint : _ but he that keepeth the law happy be he _ the vision then be the authority of law and solomon 's warning be that to which the great and noble founder of pennsylvanium william penn many century later give utterance when he say : that government be free to the people under it where the law rule and the people be a party to those law and all the rest be tyranny oligarchy and confusion it be my present purpose to discuss the moral psychology of the present revolt against the spirit of authority too little consideration have be pay by the legal profession to question of moral psychology these have be leave to metaphysician and ecclesiastic and yet -- to paraphrase the say of the master -- the law be make for man and not man for the law and if the science of the law ignore the study of human nature and attempt to conform man to the law rather than the law to man then its development be a very partial and imperfect one let I first be sure of my premise be there in this day and generation a spirit of lawlessness greater or different than that that have always characterize human society such spirit of revolt against authority have always exist even when the penalty of death be visit upon nearly all offence against life and property blackstone tell we -lrb- book iv chap i -rrb- that in the eighteenth century it be a capital offence to cut down a cherry tree in a orchard -- a drastic penalty which should increase we admiration for george washington 's courage and veracity we be apt to see the past in a golden haze which obscure we vision thus we think of william penn 's holy experiment on the bank of the delaware as the realization of sir thoma more 's dream of utopia and yet pennsylvanium be somewhat intemperately call in 1698 the greatest refuge for pirate and rogue in america and penn himself write about that time that he have hear of no place which be more overrun with wickedness than he city of brotherly love where thing be so openly commit in defiance of law and virtue -- fact so foul that i be forbid by common modesty to relate they concede that lawlessness be not a novel phenomenon be not the present time characterize by a exceptional revolt against the authority of law the statistics of we criminal court show in recent year a unprecedented growth in crime thus in the federal court pend criminal indictment have increase from 9503 in the year 1912 to over 70000 in the year 1921 while this abnormal increase be in part due to sumptuary legislation -- for approximately 30000 case now pend arise under the prohibition statute -- yet eliminate these there yet remain a increase in nine year of over 400 per cent in the comparatively narrow sphere of the federal criminal jurisdiction i have be unable to get the datum from the state court but the growth of crime can be measure by a few illustrative statistics thus the loss from burglary which have be repay by casualty company have grow in amount from $ 886000 in 1914 to over $ 10000000 in 1920 and in a like period embezzlement have increase five-fold it be notorious that the theft from the mail and express company and other carrier have grow to enormous proportion the hold-up of railroad train be now of frequent occurrence and be not confine to the unsettled section of the country not only in the united state but even in europe such crime of violence be of increase frequency and a recent dispatch from berne under date of August 7 1921 state that the famous international express of europe be now run under a military guard the street of we city once reasonably secure from crime of violence have now become the field of operation for the foot-pad and highwayman the day of dick turpin and jack sheppard have return with this serious difference -- that the turpin and sheppard of we day be not dependent upon the horse but have the powerful automobile to facilitate they crime and make sure they escape thus in chicago alone 5000 automobile be steal in a single year once murder be a infrequent and abnormal crime to-day in we large city it be of almost daily occurrence in new york in 1917 there be 236 murder and only 67 conviction in 1918 221 and 77 conviction in chicago in 1919 there be 336 and 44 conviction when the crime wave be at its height a year ago the police authority in more than one american city confess they impotence to impose effective restraint life and property have seemingly become almost as insecure as during the middle age -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : the reader will bear in mind that these word be speak in August 1921 unquestionably the situation have greatly improve during the present year -lrb- 1922 -rrb- -rrb- as to the subtler and more insidious crime against the political state it be enough to say that graft have become a science in city state and nation loss by such misapplication of public fund -- pile pelion on os -- no longer run in the million but the hundred of million we city government be in many instance foul cancer on the body politic and for we to boast of have solve the problem of local self-government be as fatuous as for a strong man to exult in he health when he body be cover with run sore it have be estimate that the annual profit from violation of the prohibition law have reach $ 300000000 man who thus violate these law for sordid gain be not likely to obey other law and the respect for law among all class steadily diminish as we people become familiar with and tolerant to wholesale criminality whether the moral and economic result of prohibition overbalance this rise wave of crime time will tell _ in limine _ let we note the significant fact that this spirit of revolt against authority be not confine to the political state and therefore its cause lie beyond that sphere of human action human life be govern by all manner of man-made law -- law of art of social intercourse of literature music business -- all evolve by custom and impose by the collective will of society here we find the same revolt against tradition and authority in music its fundamental canon have be throw aside and discord have be substitute for harmony as its ideal its culmination -- jazz -- be a musical crime if the form of dancing and music be symptomatic of a age what shall be say of the universal craze to indulge in crude and clumsy dancing to the vile discord of so-called jazz music the cry of the time be : on with the dance let joy be unrefine in the plastic art the law of form and the criterion of beauty have be sweep aside by the futurist cubist vorticist tactilist and other aesthetic bolshevikus in poetry where beauty of rhythm melody of sound and nobility of thought be once regard as the true test we now have in freak form of poetry the exaltation of the grotesque and brutal hundred of poet be feebly echo the barbaric yawp of walt whitman without the redeeming merit of he occasional sublimity of think in commerce the revolt be against the purity of standard and the integrity of business moral who can question that this be pre-eminently the age of the sham and the counterfeit science be prostitute to deceive the public by cloak the increase deterioration in quality of merchandise the blatant medium of advertising have become so mendacious as to defeat its own purpose in the recent deflation in commodity value there be widespread welching among business man who have theretofore be class as reputable of course i recognize that a far greater number keep they contract even when it bring they to the verge of ruin but when in the history of american business be there such a volume of broken faith as in the drastic deflation of 1920 in the greater sphere of social life we find the same revolt against the institution which have the sanction of the past social law which mark the decent restraint of print speech and dress have in recent decade be increasingly disregard the very foundation of the great and primitive institution of mankind -- like the family the church and the state -- have be shake nature itself be defy thus the fundamental difference of sex be disregard by social and political movement which ignore the permanent differentiation of social function ordain by nature all these be but illustration of the general revolt against the authority of the past -- a revolt that can be measure by the change in the fundamental presumption of man with respect to the value of human experience in all former age all that be in the past be presumptively true and the burden be upon he who seek to change it to-day the human mind apparently regard the lesson of the past as presumptively false -- and the burden be upon he who seek to invoke they lest i be accuse of undue pessimism let I cite as a witness one who of all man be probably best equip to express a opinion upon the moral state of the world i refer to the venerable head of that religious organization -lrb- 4 -rrb- which with its trained representative in every part of the world be probably better inform as to its spiritual state than any other organization -lrb- footnote 4 : reference be to the late pope benedict -rrb- speaking last christmas eve in a address to the college of cardinal the venerable pontiff give expression to a estimate of present condition which should have attract far greater attention than it apparently do the pope say that five plague be now afflict humanity the first be the unprecedented challenge to authority the second a equally unprecedented hatred between man and man the third be the abnormal aversion to work the fourth the excessive thirst for pleasure as the great aim of life the fifth a gross materialism which deny the reality of the spiritual in human life the accuracy of this indictment will commend itself to man who like myself be not of pope benedict 's communion i trust that i have already show that the challenge to authority be universal and be not confine to that of the political state even in the narrower confine of the latter the fire of revolution be either violently burn or at least smoulder two of the oldest empire in the world which together have more than half of its population -lrb- china and russium -rrb- be in a welter of anarchy while many lesser nation be in a stage of submerge revolt if the revolt be confine to autocratic government we might see in it merely a reaction against tyranny but even in the most stable of democracy and among the most enlighten people the underground rumbling of revolution may be hear the government of italy have be preserve from overthrow not alone by its constitute authority but by a band of resolute man call the fascistus who have take the law into they own hand as do the vigilance committee in western mining camp to put down worse disorder even england the mother of democracy and the most stable of all government in the maintenance of law have be shake to its very foundation in the last three year when powerful group of man attempt to seize the state by the throat and compel submission to they demand by threaten to starve the community this would be serious enough if it be only the world-old struggle between capital and labor and have only involve the condition of manual toil but the insurrection against the political state in england be more political than it be economic it mark on the part of million of man a portentous decay of belief in representative government and its choose organ -- the ballot box great and powerful group have suddenly discover -- and it may be the most portentous political discovery of the twentieth century -- that the power involve in they control over the necessaries of life as compare with the power of the voting franchise be as a forty-two centimetre cannon to the bow and arrow the end seek to be attain namely the nationalization of the basic industry and even the control of the foreign policy of great britain vindicate the truth of the british prime minister 's statement that these great strike involve something more than a mere struggle over the condition of labor and that they be essentially seditious attempt against the life of the state -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : i be here speak of the condition of 1920 i appreciate the great improvement which seem to I to justify the lincoln-like patience of lloyd george -rrb- nor be they altogether unsuccessful for when the army of lenin and trotsky be at the gate of warsaw in the summer of 1920 the attempt of the government of england and belgium to afford assistance to the embattled pole be paralyse by the labor group of both country who threaten a general strike if those two nation join with france in aid poland to resist a possibly greater menace to western civilization than have occur since attilum and he hun stand on the bank of the marne of greater significance to the welfare of civilization be the complete subversion during the world war of nearly all the international law which have be slowly build up in a thousand year these principle as codify by the two hague convention be immediately sweep aside in the fierce struggle for existence and civilized man with he liquid fire and poison gas and he deliberate attack upon undefended city and they woman and child wage war with the unrelenting ferocity of primitive time surely this fierce war of extermination which cause the loss of three hundred billion dollar in property and thirty million of human life do mark for the time be the twilight of civilization the hand on the dial of time have be put back -- temporarily let we hope and pray -- a thousand year nor will many question the accuracy of the second count in pope benedict 's indictment the war to end war only end in unprecedented hatred between nation and nation class and class and man and man victor and vanquish be involve in a common ruin and if in this deluge of blood which have submerge the world there be a mount ararat upon which the ark of a truer and better peace can find refuge it have not yet appear above the troubled surface of the water still less can one question the closely related third and fourth count in pope benedict 's indictment namely the unprecedented aversion to work when work be most need to reconstruct the foundation of prosperity or the excessive thirst for pleasure which precede accompany and now have follow the most terrible tragedy in the annals of mankind the true spirit of work seem to have vanish from million of man that spirit of which shakespeare make he orlando speak when he say of he true servant adam : o good old man how well in thee appear the constant service of the antique world when service sweat for duty not for meed the _ moral _ of we industrial civilization have be shatter work for work 's sake as the most glorious privilege of human faculty have go both as a ideal and as a potent spirit the conception of work as a degrading servitude to be do with reluctance and grudging inefficiency seem to be the ideal of million of man of all class and in all country the spirit of work be of more than sentimental importance it may be say of it as hamlet say of death : the readiness be all all of we be conscious of the fact that give a love of work and the capacity for it seem almost illimitable -- as witness napoleon with he thousand-man power or shakespeare who in twenty year could write more than twenty masterpiece on the other hand give a aversion to work and the less a man do the less he want to do or be seemingly capable of do the great evil of the world to-day be this aversion to work as the mechanical era diminish the element of physical exertion in work we would have suppose that man would have seek expression for he physical faculty in other way on the contrary the whole history of the mechanical era be a persistent struggle for more pay and less work and to-day it have culminate in world-wide ruin for there be not a nation in civilization which be not now in the throe of economic distress and many of they be on the verge of ruin in my judgment the economic catastrophe of 1921 be far greater than the politico-military catastrophe of 1914 the result of these two tendency measure in the statistics of productive industry be literally appalling thus in 1920 italy accord to statistics of she minister of labor lose 55000000 day of work because of strike alone from July to September many great factory be in the hand of revolutionary communist a full third of these strike have for they end political and not economic purpose in germany the progressive revolt of labor against work be thus measure by competent authority : there be lose in strike in 1917 900000 work day in 1918 4900000 and in 1919 46600000 even in we own favored land the same phenomenon be observable in the state of new york alone for 1920 there be a loss due to strike of over 10000000 work day in all country the loss by such cessation from labor be little as compare with those due to the spirit which in england be call can ' - canny or the shirk of performance of work and of sabotage which mean the deliberate destruction of machinery in operation everywhere the phenomenon have be observe that with the highest wages know in the history of modern time there have be a unmistakable lessen of efficiency and that with a increase in the number of worker there have be a decrease in output thus the transportation company in the united state have seriously make a claim against the united state government for damages to they road amount to $ 750000000 claim to be due to the inefficiency of labor during the period of governmental operation accompany this indisposition to work efficiently have be a mad desire for pleasure such as if it exist in like measure in precede age have not be see within the memory of live man man have dance upon the verge of a social abyss and as previously suggest the dancing have both in form and in accompany music lose its former grace and revert to the primitive form of crude vulgarity which give the spectator the maximum of emotional expression with the minimum of mental effort have not be eclipse by the splendor of a dempsey or a carpentier of the last count in pope benedict 's indictment i shall say but little it be more appropriate for the member of that great and noble profession which be more intimately concern with the spiritual advance of mankind it be enough to say that while the church as a institution continue to exist the belief in the supernatural and even in the spiritual have be supplant in the soul of million of man by a gross and debase materialism if my reader agree with I in my premise then we be not likely to disagree in the conclusion that the cause of these grave symptom be not ephemeral or superficial but must have they origin in some deep-seated and world-wide change in human society if there be to be a remedy we must first diagnose this malady of the human soul for example let we not lay the flattering unction to we soul that this spirit be solely the reaction of the great war the present weariness and lassitude of human spirit and the disappointment and disillusion as to the aftermath of the harvest of blood may have aggravate but they could not cause the symptom of which i speak for the very obvious reason that all these symptom be in existence and apparent to a few discerning man for decade before the war indeed it be possible that the world war far from cause the _ malaise _ of the age be in itself but one of its many symptom undoubtedly there be many contribute cause which have swollen the turbid tide of this world-wide revolution against the spirit of authority thus the multiplicity of law do not tend to develop a law-abiding spirit this fact have often be note thus napoleon on the eve of the 18th brumaire complain that france with a thousand folio of law be a lawless nation unquestionably the political state suffer in authority by the abuse of legislation and especially by the appeal to law to curb evil that be best leave to individual conscience in this age of democracy the average individual be too apt to recognize two constitution -- one the constitution of the state and the second a unwritten constitution to he of higher authority under which he believe that no law be obligatory which he regard as in excess of the true power of government of this latter spirit the widespread violation of the prohibition law be a familiar illustration a race of individualist obey reluctantly when they obey at all any law which they regard as unreasonable or vexatious indeed they be increasingly oppose to any law which affect they selfish interest thus many good woman be involuntary smuggler they deny the authority of the state to impose a tax upon a paquin gown the law 's delay and laxity in administration breed a spirit of contempt and too often invite man to take the law into they own hand these cause be so familiar that they statement be a commonplace proceeding to deeper and less recognize cause some would attribute this spirit of lawlessness to the rampant individualism which begin in the eighteenth century and which have steadily and naturally grow with the advance of democratic institution undoubtedly the excessive emphasis upon the rights of man which mark the political upheaval of the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century have contribute to this malady of the age man talk and still talk loudly of they rights but too rarely of they duty and yet if we be to attribute the malady merely to excessive individualism we would again err in mistake a symptom for a cause to diagnose truly this malady we must look to some cause that be coterminous in time with the disease itself and which have be operative throughout civilization we must seek some widespread change in social condition for man 's essential nature have change but little and the change must therefore be of environment i know of but one such change that be sufficiently widespread and deep-seated to account adequately for this malady of we time begin with the close of the eighteenth century and continue throughout the nineteenth a prodigious transformation have take place in the environment of man which have do more to revolutionize the condition of human life than all the change that have take place in the 500000 precede year which science have attribute to man 's life on the planet up to the period of watt 's discovery of steam vapor as a motive power these condition so far as the principal facility of life be substantially those of the civilization which develop eighty century ago on the bank of the nile and later on the euphrate man have indeed increase he conquest over nature in later century by a few mechanical invention such as gunpowder telescope magnetic needle printing-press spin jenny and hand-loom but the characteristic of all those invention with the exception of gunpowder be that they still remain a subordinate auxiliary to the physical strength and mental skill of man in other word man still dominate the machine and there be still full play for he physical and mental faculty moreover all the invention of precede age from the first fashioning of the flint to the spinning-wheel and the hand-lever press be all conquest of the tangible and visible force of nature with watt 's utilization of steam vapor as a motive power man suddenly pass into a new and portentous chapter of he varied history thenceforth he be to multiply he power a thousandfold by the utilization of the invisible power of nature -- such as vapor and electricity this prodigious change in he power and therefore he environment have proceed with ever-accelerating speed man have suddenly become the superman like the giant of the ancient fable he have storm the very rampart of divine power or like prometheus he have steal fire of omnipotent force from heaven itself for he use he voice can now reach from the atlantic to the pacific and take wing in he aeroplane he can fly in one swift flight from nova scotium to england or he can leave lausanne and rest upon the icy summit of mont blanc -- thus like the herald mercury new-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill -- he can again plunge into the void and thus outfly the eagle themselves in thus acquire from the force of nature almost illimitable power he have minimize the necessity for he own physical exertion or even mental skill the machine now not only act for he but too often _ think _ for he be it surprising that so portentous a change should have fever he brain and disturb he mental equilibrium a new ideal which he proudly call progress obsess he the ideal of quantity and not quality he practical religion become that of acceleration and facilitation -- to do thing more quickly and easily -- and thus to minimize exertion become he great objective less and less he rely upon the initiative of he own brain and muscle and more and more he put he faith in the power of machinery to relieve he of labor the evil of we age be that its value be all false it overrate speed it underrate sureness it overrate the new it underrate the old it overrate automatic efficiency it underrate individual craftsmanship it overrate rights it underrate duty it overrate political institution it underrate individual responsibility we glory in the fact that we can talk a thousand mile but we ignore the greater question whether when we thus out-do stentor we have anything worth say we have now make the serene space of the upper heaven we media to transmit market report and sport news second-rate music and worse oratory and in the meantime the great master of thought homer and shakespeare bach and beethoven remain unbidden on we library shelf what a sordid vanity fair be we modern civilization this incalculable multiplication of power have intoxicate man the lust have obsess he without regard to whether it be constructive or destructive quantity not quality become the great objective man consume the treasure of the earth faster than he produce they deforest its surface and disembowel its hidden wealth as he feverishly multiply the thing he desire even more feverishly he multiply he want to gain these man seek the congested centre of human life while the world as a whole be not over-populated the leading country of civilization be subject to this tremendous pressure europe which at the beginning of the nineteenth century barely number 100000000 people suddenly grow nearly five-fold million leave the farm to gather into the city to exploit they new and seemingly easy conquest over nature in the united state as recently as 1880 only 15 per cent of the people be crowd in the city 85 per cent remain upon the farm and still follow that occupation which of all occupation still preserve in its integrity the dominance of human labor over the machine to-day 52 per cent of the population be in the city and with many of they existence be both feverish and artificial while they have employment many of they do not themselves work but spend they life in watch machine work the result have be a minute subdivision of labor that have deny to many worker the true significance and physical benefit of labor the direct result of this excessive tendency to specialization whereby not only the work but the worker become divide into mere fragment be threefold hobson in he work on john ruskin thus classify they in the first place _ narrowness _ due to the confinement to a single action in which the element of human skill or strength be largely eliminate secondly _ monotony _ in the assimilation of man to a machine whereby seemingly the machine dominate man and not man the machine and thirdly _ irrationality _ in that work become dissociate in the mind of the worker with any complete or satisfying achievement the worker do not see the fruit of he travail and can not therefore be truly satisfy to spend one 's life in open a valve to make a part of a pin be as ruskin point out demoralizing in its tendency the clerk who only operate a add machine have little opportunity for self-expression thus million of man have lose both the opportunity for real physical exertion the incentive to work in the joyous competition of skill and finally the reward of work in the sense of achievement more serious than this however have be the destructive effort of quantity the great object of the mechanical age at the expense of quality take for example the printing-press : no one can question the immense advantage which have flow from the increase facility for transmit idea but may it not be true that the thousandfold increase in such transmission by the rotary press have also tend to muddy the current thought of the time true it be that the printing-press have pile up great treasure of human knowledge which make this age the richest in accessible information i be not speak of knowledge but rather of the current thought of the living generation i gravely question whether it have the same clarity as the brain of the generation which fashion the constitution of the united state we father could not talk over the telephone for three thousand mile but have we surpass they in thought of enduring value washington and franklin could not travel sixty mile a hour in a railroad train or twice that speed in a aeroplane but do it follow that they do not travel to as good purpose as we who scurry to and fro like the ant in a disorder ant-heap unquestionably man of to-day have a thousand idea suggest to he by the newspaper and the library where we ancestor have one but have we the same spirit of calm inquiry and do we co-ordinate the fact we know as wisely as we ancestor do athen in the day of pericle have but thirty thousand people and few mechanical invention but she produce philosopher poet and artist whose work after more than twenty century still remain the despair of the would-be imitator shakespeare have a theater with the ground as its floor and the sky as its ceiling but new york which have fifty theater and annually spend $ 100000000 in the box office of its varied amusement resort have rarely in two century produce a play that have live to-day man have a cinematographic brain a thousand image be impressed daily upon the screen of he consciousness but they be as fleeting as move picture in a cinema theater the american press print every year over 29000000000 issue no one can question its educational possibility for the best of all college be potentially the university of gutenberg if it print only the truth its value would be infinite but who can say in what proportion of this vast volume of print matter be the true and the false the framer of the constitution have few book and fewer newspaper they thought be few and simple but what they lack in quantity they make up in unsurpassed quality before the beginning of the present mechanical age the current of live thought could be liken to a mountain stream which though confine within narrow bank yet have water of transparent clearness may not the current thought of we time be compare with the mighty mississippus in the period of a spring freshet its bank be wide and its current be swift but the turbid stream that flow onward be one of muddy swirl and eddy and overflow its bank to they destruction the great indictment however of the present age of mechanical power be that it have largely destroy the spirit of work the great enigma which it propound to we and which like the riddle of the sphinx we will solve or be destroy be this : _ have the increase in the potential of human power through thermodynamics be accompany by a corresponding increase in the potential of human character _ to this life and death question a great french philosopher le bon write in 1910 reply that the one unmistakable symptom of human life be the increase deterioration in human character and a great physicist have describe the symptom as the progressive enfeeblement of the human will in a famous book _ degeneration _ write at the close of the nineteenth century max nordau as a pathologist explain this tendency by argue that we complex civilization have place too great a strain upon the limited nervous organization of man a great financier the elder jp morgan once say of a exist financial condition that it be suffer from undigested security and paraphrase he be it not possible that man be suffer from undigested achievement and that he salvation must lie in adaptation to a new environment which measure by any standard know to science be a thousandfold greater in this year of grace than it be at the beginning of the nineteenth century no one would be mad enough to urge such a retrogression as the abandonment of labour-saving machinery would involve indeed it would be impossible for in speaking of its evil i freely recognize that not only would civilization perish without its beneficent aid but that every step forward in the history of man have be coincident with and in large part attributable to a new mechanical invention but suppose the development of labour-saving machinery should reach a stage where all human labor be eliminate what would be the effect on man the answer be contain in a experiment which sir john lubbock make with a tribe of ant originally the most voracious and militant of they species yet when deny the opportunity for exercise and free from the necessity of forage for they food in three generation they become anaemic and perish take from man the opportunity of work and the sense of pride in achievement and you have take from he the very life of he existence robert burn could sing as he drive he ploughshare through the field of ayr to-day million who simply watch a automatic infallible machine which require neither strength nor skill do not sing at they work but too many curse the fate which have chained they like ixion to a soulless machine the evil be even greater the specialization of we modern mechanical civilization have cause a submergence of the individual into the group or class man be fast cease to be the unit of human society self-governing group be become the new unit this be true of all class of man the employer as well as the employee the true justification for the american anti-monopoly statute include the sherman anti-trust law lie not so much in the realm of economics as in that of moral with the submergence of the individual whether he be capitalist or wage-earner into a group there have follow the dissipation of moral responsibility a mass morality have be substitute for individual morality and unfortunately group morality generally intensify the vice more than the virtue of man possibly the greatest result of the mechanical age be this spirit of organization its merit be manifold and do not require statement but they have blind we to the demerit of excessive organization we be now begin to see -- slowly but surely -- that a faculty of organization which as such submerge the spirit of individualism be not a unmixed good indeed the moral lesson of the tragedy of germany be the demoralizing influence of organization carry to the _ n_th power no nation be ever more highly organize than this modern state physically intellectually and spiritually it have become a highly develop machine its dominate mechanical spirit so submerge the individual that in 1914 the paradox be observe of a enlighten nation that be seemingly destitute of a conscience what be true of germany however be true -- although in lesser degree -- of all civilized nation in all of they the individual have be submerge in group formation and the effect upon the character of man have be destructive of he nobler self this may explain the paradox of so-called progress it may be liken to a great wheel which from the increase domination of mechanical force develop a ever-accelerating speed until by centrifugal action it go off its bearing in 1914 and cause a unprecedented catastrophe as man slowly pull himself out of that gigantic wreck and recover consciousness he begin to realize that speed be not necessarily progress of all this the nineteenth century in its exultant pride in its conquest of the invisible force be almost blind it not only accept progress as a unmistakable fact -- mistake however acceleration and facilitation for progress -- but in its mad folly believe in a immutable law of progress which work with the blind force of machinery would propel man forward a few man however stand on the mountain range of human observation see the future more clearly than do the mass emerson carlyle ruskin samuel butler and max nordau in the nineteenth century and in we time ferrero all point out the inevitable danger of the excessive mechanization of human society the prophecy be unhappily as little heed as those of cassandra one can see the tragedy of the time as a few see it in compare the first _ locksley hall _ of alfred tennyson write in 1827 with its abide faith in the increase purpose of the age and its roseate prophecy of the golden age when the war-drum would throb no longer and the battle flag be furl in the parliament of man and the federation of the world and the later _ locksley hall _ write sixty year later when the great spiritual poet of we time give utterance to the dark pessimism which flood he soul : go the cry of ` forward forward ' lose within a grow gloom lose or only hear in silence from the silence of a tomb half the marvel of my morning triumph over time and space stale by frequence shrink by usage into commonest commonplace evolution ever climb after some ideal good and reversion ever drag evolution in the mud be it well that while we range with science glory in the time city child soak and blacken soul and sense in city slime be i unduly pessimistic i fear that this be the case with most man who like dante have cross they fiftieth year and find themselves in a dark and sombre wood my reader will probably subject I to the additional reproach that i suggest no remedy there be many palliative for the evil which i have discuss to rekindle in man the love of work for work 's sake and the spirit of discipline which the lose sense of human solidarity once inspire would do much to solve the problem for work be the greatest moral force in the world but i must frankly add that i have neither the time nor the qualification to discuss the solution of this grave problem if we of this generation can only recognize that the evil exist then the situation be not past remedy for man have never yet find himself in a blind alley of negation he be still master of he soul and captain of he fate and to I the most encouraging sign of the time be the persistent evidence of contemporary literature that thoughtful man now recognize that much of we boast progress be as unreal as a rainbow while the temper of the time seem for the moment pessimistic it merely mark the recognition of man of a abyss whose existence he barely suspect but over which he indomitable courage will yet carry he i have faith in the inextinguishable spark of the divine which be in the human soul and which we complex mechanical civilization have not extinguish of this the world war be in itself a proof all the horrible resource of mechanic and chemistry be utilize to coerce the human soul and all prove ineffectual never do man rise to greater height of self-sacrifice or show a greater fidelity even unto death million go to they grave as to they bed for a ideal and when that be possible this pandora 's box of modern civilization which contain all imaginable evil as well as benefit also leave hope behind i be remind of a remark that the great roumanian statesman taku jonescu make during the peace conference at pari when ask he view as to the future of civilization he reply : judge by the light of reason there be but little hope but i have faith in man 's inextinguishable impulse to live happily that can not be affect by any change in man 's environment for even when the cave-man retreat from the advance of the polar cap which once cover europe with arctic desolation he not only defy the element but show even then the love of the sublime by beautify the wall of he icy prison with those mural decoration which be the beginning of art assuredly the man of to-day with the rich heritage of countless age can do no less he have but to diagnose the evil and he will then in some way meet it but what can man-made law do in this warfare against the blind force of nature it be easy to exaggerate the value of all political institution for they be generally on the surface of human life and do not reach down to the deep under-current of human nature but the law can do something to protect the soul of man from destruction by the soulless machine it can defend the spirit of individualism it must champion the human soul in its god-given right to exercise freely the faculty of mind and body we must defend the right to work against those who would either destroy or degrade it we must defend the right of every man not only to join with other in protect he interest whether he be a brain worker or a hand worker -- for without the right of combination the individual would often be the victim of giant force -- but we must vindicate the equal right of a individual if he so will to depend upon he own strength the tendency of group morality to standardize man -- and thus reduce all man to the dead level of a average mediocrity -- be one that the law should combat its protection should be give to those of superior skill and diligence who ask the due reward of such superiority any other course to use the fine phrase of thoma jefferson in he first inaugural be to take from the mouth of labor the bread it have earn of this spirit one of the noblest expression be the constitution of the united state that magna charta have not wholly escape the destructive tendency of a mechanical age it be frame at the very end of the pastoral-agricultural age and at a time when the spirit of individualism be in full flower the hardy pioneer who with they axis make straight the pathway of a advance civilization be sturdy man who need not be undervalue to we of the mechanical age the prairie schooner which meet the elemental force of nature with the proud challenge : pike 's peak or bust produce as fine a type of manhood as the age which travel either in mr ford 's fliver or the more luxurious rolls-royce the constitution be frame in the period that mark the passing of the primitive age and the dawn of the day of the machine watt have recently discover the potency of steam vapor as a motive power but its only use at first be for pump water out of the mine when the framer of the constitution meet in high convention in philadelphium in the summer of 1787 a connecticut yankee john fitch be then also work in philadelphium upon he steamboat but twenty year be to pass before the prow of the _ clermont _ be to part the water of the hudson and nearly a half century before transportation be to be revolutionize by the utilization of watt 's invention in the locomotive of the wonder of the steamship the railroad the telegraphic cable the wireless the gasoline engine and a thousand other mechanical miracle the framer of the american constitution do not even dream the greatest and noblest purpose of the constitution be not alone to hold in nicest equipose the relative power of the nation and the state but also to maintain in the scale of justice a true equilibrium between the rights of government and the rights of a individual it do not believe that the state be omnipotent or infallible and yet it proclaim its authority within wise and just limit it defend the integrity of the human soul in other government these fundamental decency of liberty rest upon the conscience of the legislature under the american constitution they be part of the fundamental law and as such enforceable by judge swear to defend the integrity of the individual as fully as the integrity of the state when do a nobler vision inspire man in the political annals of mankind without that vision to restrain each succeed generation of american from the tempting excess of political power the american commonwealth with its great heterogeneous democracy would probably perish that vision still remain as a ideal with the american people and still lead they to ever-higher achievement for in all the mad change of a frenzied hour they have not yet lose faith in or love for the constitution of the father that vision will remain with they as long and no longer as there be in they heart a conscious and willing acquiescence in its wisdom and justice obviously it can have no inherent vigor to perpetuate itself if it cease to be of the spirit of the people then the yellow parchment whereon it be inscribe can avail nothing when that parchment be last take from the safe in the state department the ink in which it have be engross nearly 134 year ago be find to have fade all who believe in constitutional government must hope that this be not a portentous symbol the american people must write the compact not with ink upon parchment but with letter of live light -- to use webster 's phrase -- upon they heart again the solemn warning of the wise man of old recur to we : where there be no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy be he end of the project gutenberg ebook of the constitution of the united state by jame m beck
