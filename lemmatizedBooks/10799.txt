after great importunity she be attend by the two nymph they both topt they part keep they eye within bound make moral reflection now-and - then o jack what devil be woman when all test be get over and we have completely ruin they the coach carry we to hampstead to highgate to muswell-hill back to hampstead to the upper-flask : there in compliment to the nymph my beloved consent to alight and take a little repast then home early by kentish-town delightfully easy she and so respectful and oblige i all the way and as we walk out upon the heath to view the variegated prospects which that agreeable elevation afford that she promise to take now-and-then a little excursion with I i think miss howe i think say i to myself every now-and-then as we walk that thy wicked device be supercede but let I give thee a few particulars of we conversation in the circumrotation we take while in the coach -- she have receive a letter from miss howe yesterday i presume she make no answer how happy should i think myself to be admit into they correspondence i would joyfully make a exchange of communication so though i hope not to succeed by she consent -lrb- and little do she think i have so happily in part succeed without it -rrb- i think it not amiss to urge for it for several reason : among other that i might account to she for my constant employment at my pen in order to take off she jealousy that she be the subject of thy correspondence and mine : and that i might justify my secrecy and uncommunicativeness by she own i proceed therefore -- that i love familiar-letter-writing as i have more than once tell she above all the species of writing : it be write from the heart -lrb- without the fetter prescribe by method or study -rrb- as the very word cor-respondence imply not the heart only the soul be in it nothing of body when friend write to friend the mind impel sovereignly the vassal-finger it be in short friendship record friendship give under hand and seal demonstrate that the party be under no apprehension of change from time or accident when they so liberally give testimony which would always be ready on failure or infidelity to be turn against they -- for my own part it be the principal diversion i have in she absence but for this innocent amusement the distance she so frequently keep I at would have be intolerable sally know my drift and say she have have the honor to see two or three of my letter and of mr belford 's and she think they the most entertaining that she have ever read my friend belford i say have a happy talent in the letter-writing way and upon all subject i expect my beloved would have be inquisitive after we subject : but -lrb- lie perdue as i saw -rrb- not a word say she so i touch upon this article myself we topic be various and diffuse : sometimes upon literary article -lrb- she be very attentive upon this -rrb- sometimes upon the public entertainment sometimes amusing each other with the fruit of the different correspondency we hold with person abroad with whom we have contract friendship sometimes upon the foible and perfection of we particular friend sometimes upon we own present and future hope sometimes aim at humor and raillery upon each other -- it might indeed appear to savor of vanity to suppose my letter would entertain a lady of she delicacy and judgment : but yet i could not but say that perhaps she would be far from think so hardly of I as sometimes she have seem to do if she be to see the letter which generally pass between mr belford and I -lrb- i hope jack thou hast more manners than to give I the lie though but in thy heart -rrb- she then speak : after decline my compliment in such a manner as only a person can do who deserve it she say for she part she have always think I a man of sense -lrb- a man of sense jack what a niggardly praise -rrb- -- and should therefore hope that when i write it exceed even my speech : for that it be impossible be the letter write in as easy and familiar a style as they would but that they must have that advantage from sit down to write they which prompt speech could not always have she should think it very strange therefore if my letter be barren of sentiment and as strange if i give myself liberty upon premeditation which could have no excuse at all but from a thoughtlessness which itself want excuse -- but if mr belford 's letter and mine be upon subject so general and some of they equally -lrb- she presume -rrb- instructive and entertaining she could not but say that she should be glad to see any of they and particularly those which miss martin have see and praise this be put close i look at she to see if i could discover any tincture of jealousy in this hint that miss martin have see what i have not show to she but she do not look it : so i only say i should be very proud to show she not only those but all that pass between mr belford and I but i must remind she that she know the condition no indeed with a sweet lip pout out as saucy as pretty imply a lovely scorn that yet can only be lovely in youth so bloom and beauty so divinely distinguish how i long to see such a motion again she mouth only can give it but i be mad with love -- yet eternal will be the distance at the rate i go on : now fire now ice my soul be continually upon the hiss as i may say in vain however be the trial to quench -- what after all be unquenchable pr ` ythee belford forgive my nonsense and my vulcan-like metaphor -- do i not tell thee not that i be sick of love but that i be mad with it why bring i such a angel into such a house into such company -- and why do i not stop my ear to the siren who know my aversion to wedlock be perpetually touch that string i be not willing to be answer so easily : i be sure that what pass between two such young lady -lrb- friend so dear -rrb- might be see by every body : i have more reason than any body to wish to see the letter that pass between she and miss howe because i be sure they must be full of admirable instruction and one of the dear correspondent have deign to wish my entire reformation she look at I as if she would look I through : i think i feel eye - beam after eye-beam penetrate my shiver rein -- but she be silent nor need she eye the assistance of speech nevertheless a little recover myself i hope that nothing unhappy have befall either miss howe or she mother the letter of yesterday send by a particular hand : she open it with great emotion -- seem to have expect it sooner -- be the reason for my apprehension we be then at muswell-hill : a pretty country within the eye to polly be the remark instead of reply to I but i be not so to be answer -- i should expect some charming subject and character from two such pen : i hope every thing go on well between mr hickman and miss howe she mother 's heart i say be set upon that match : mr hickman be not without he merit : he be what the lady call a sober man : but i must need say that i think miss howe deserve a husband of a very different cast this i suppose would have engage she into a subject from which i could have wiredrawn something : -- for hickman be one of she favorite -- why i can not divine except for the sake of opposition of character to that of thy honest friend but she cut I short by a look of disapprobation and another cool remark upon a distant view and how far off miss horton do you think that clump of tree may be point out of the coach -- so i have do here endeth all i have to write concern we conversation on this we agreeable airing we have both be write ever since we come home i be to be favor with she company for a hour before she retire to rest all that obsequious love can suggest in order to engage she tenderest sentiment for I against tomorrow 's

persuade myself to be ill i be a better mimic at this rate than i wish to be but every nerve and fiber of I be always ready to contribute its aid whether by health or by ailment to carry a resolved-on roguery into execution dorca have transcribe for I the whole letter of miss howe date Sunday may 14 \* of which before i have only extract she find no other letter add to that parcel : but this and

that those who treat the professor of the art of healing contemptuously too generally treat higher institution in the same manner i be really very uneasy for i have i doubt expose myself to he and to the woman below they indeed will excuse I as they think we marry but if he be not generous i shall have cause to regret this surprise which -lrb- as i have reason to think myself unaccountably treat

it be call be allow to be a excuse for we most unreasonable folly and to lay level all the fence that a careful education have surround we by what be mean by the doctrine of subdue we passion -- but o my dearest friend be i not guilty of a punishable fault be i to love this man of error and have not my own heart deceive I when i think it do not and what must be that love that have not some degree of purity for its object i be afraid of recollect some passage in my cousin morden 's letter \*\*\* -- and yet why fly i from subject that duly consider might tend to correct and purify my heart i

occasion for this i make no scruple to attend you elsewhere if i be troublesome here i be tell i have a warm young gentleman to deal with : but as i know my intention and that my commission be a amicable one i be the less concerned about that i be twice you age mr lovelace i dare say : but i do assure you that if either my message or my manner give you offence i can suspend the one or the other for a day or for ever as you like and so sir any time before eight tomorrow morning you will let I know you further command -- and be go to tell I where he might be find captain tomlinson say i you answer well i love a man of spirit have you not be in the army i have sir but have turn my sword into a ploughshare as the scripture have it -- -lrb- there be a clever fellow jack -- he be a good

charmer -- ` tis well she say there be some man who have wisdom in they anger well captain that be reproof for reproof so we be upon a footing and now give I the pleasure of hear the import of you commission sir you must first allow I to repeat my question : be you really and bonâ fide marry to miss clarissa harlowe or be you not yet marry bluntly put captain but if i answer that i be what then why then sir i shall say that you be a man of honor that i hope i be whether you say it or not captain tomlinson sir i will be very frank in all i have to say on this subject -- mr john harlowe have lately find out that you and he niece be both in the same lodgings that you have be long so and that the lady be at the play with you yesterday be se ` nnight and he hope that you be actually marry he have indeed hear that you be but as he know you enterprising temper and that you have declare that you disdain a relation to they family he be willing by I to have you marriage confirm from you own mouth before he take the step he be incline to take in he niece 's favor you will allow I to say mr lovelace that he will not be satisfy with a answer that admit of the least doubt let I tell you captain tomlinson that it be a high degree of vileness for any man to suppose -- sir -- mr lovelace -- do not put yourself into a passion the lady 's relation be jealous of the honor of they family they have prejudice to overcome as well as you -- advantage may have be take -- and the lady at the time not to blame this lady sir could give no such advantage : and if she have what must the man be captain tomlinson who could have take they -- do you know the lady sir i never have the honor to see she but once and that be at a church and should not know she again not know she again sir -- i think there be not a man living who have once see she and would not know she among a thousand i remember sir that i think i never see a finer woman in my life but mr lovelace i believe you will allow that it be better that she relation should have wrong you than you the lady i hope sir you will permit I to repeat my question enter dorca in a hurry a gentleman this minute sir desire to speak with you honor -- -lrb- my lady sir -- aside -rrb- could the dear creature put dorca upon tell this fib yet want to save I one desire the gentleman to walk into one of the parlor i will wait upon he presently -lrb- exit dorca the dear creature i doubt not want to instruct I how to answer the captain 's home put i know how i intend to answer it -- plumb thou may ` st be sure -- but dorcas 's message stagger I and yet i be upon one of my master-stroke -- which be to take advantage of the captain 's inquiry and to make she own she marriage before he as she have do to the people below and if she have be bring to that to induce she for she uncle 's satisfaction to write he a letter of gratitude which of course must have be sign clarissa lovelace i be loth therefore thou may ` st believe to attend she sudden command : and yet afraid of push matter beyond recovery with she i think proper to lead he from the question to account for himself and for mr harlowe 's come to the knowledge of where we be and for other particulars which i know would engage she attention and which might possibly convince she of the necessity there be for she to acquiesce in the affirmative i be dispose to give and this for she own sake for what as i ask she afterwards be it to I whether i be ever reconcile to she family -- a family jack which i must for ever despise you think captain that i have answer doubtfully to the question you put you may think so and you must know that i have a good deal of pride and only that you be a gentleman and seem in this affair to be govern by generous motive or i should ill brook be interrogate as to my honor to a lady so dear to I -- but before i answer more directly to the point pray satisfy I in a question or two that i shall put to you with all my heart sir ask I what question you please i will answer they with sincerity and candor you say mr harlowe have find out that we be at a play together : and that we be both in the same lodgings -- how pray come he at he knowledge -- for let I tell you that i have for certain consideration -lrb- not respect myself i will assure you -rrb- condescend that we abode should be keep secret and this have be so strictly observe that even miss howe though she and my beloved correspond know not directly where to send to we why sir the person who see you at the play be a tenant of mr john harlowe he watch all you motion when the play be do he follow you coach to you lodgings and early the next day Sunday he take horse and acquaint he landlord with what he have observe lovel how oddly thing come about -- but do any other of the harlowe know where we be capt it be a absolute secret to every other person of the family and so it be intend to be keep : as also that mr john harlowe be willing to enter into treaty with you by I if he niece be actually marry for perhaps he be aware that he shall have difficulty enough with some people to bring about the desirable reconciliation although he could give they this assurance i doubt it not captain -- to jame harlowe be all the family folly owe fine fool -lrb- heroically stalk about -rrb- to be govern by one to whom malice and not genius give the busy liveliness that distinguish he from a natural -- but how long pray sir have mr john harlowe be in this pacific disposition i will tell you mr lovelace and the occasion and be very explicit upon it and upon all that concern you to know of I and of the commission i have undertake to execute and this the rather as when you have hear I out you will be satisfy that i be not a officious man in this my present address to you i be all attention captain tomlinson and so i doubt not be my beloved capt ` you must know sir that i have not be many month in mr john harlowe 's neighborhood i remove from northamptonshire partly for the sake of better manage one of two executorship which i could not avoid engage in -lrb- the affair of which frequently call I to town and be part of my present business -rrb- and partly for the sake of occupy a neglect farm which have lately fall into my hand but though a acquaintance of no longer standing and that commence on the bowling - green -lrb- uncle john be a great bowler belford -rrb- -lrb- upon my decision of a point to every one 's satisfaction which be appeal to I by all the gentleman and which might have be attend with bad consequence -rrb- no two brother have a more cordial esteem for each other you know mr lovelace that there be a consent as i may call it in some mind which will unite they stronger together in a few hour than year can do with other whom yet we see not with disgust ' lovel very true captain capt ` it be on the foot of this avowed friendship on both side that on Monday the 15th as i very well remember mr harlowe invite himself home with I and when there he acquaint I with the whole of the unhappy affair that have make they all so uneasy till then i know it only by report for intimate as we be i forbore to speak of what be so near he heart till he begin first and then he tell I that he have have a application make to he two or three day before by a gentleman whom he name \* to induce he not only to be reconcile himself to he niece but to forward for she a general reconciliation \* see vol iv letter xxiii and xxix ' a like application he tell I have be make to he sister harlowe by a good woman whom every body respect who have intimate that he niece if encourage would again put herself into the protection of she friend and leave you : but if not that she must unavoidably be you 's ' i hope mr lovelace i make no mischief -- you look concerned -- you sigh sir proceed captain tomlinson pray proceed -- and i sigh still more profoundly capt ` they all think it extremely particular that a lady should decline marriage with a man she have so lately go away with ' pray captain -- pray mr tomlinson -- no more of this subject my beloved be a angel in every thing unblamable whatever fault there have be have be theirs and mine what you would further say be that the unforgiving family reject she application they do she and i have a misunderstand the fall out of lover -- you know captain -- we have be happier ever since capt ` well sir but mr john harlowe could not but better consider the matter afterwards and he desire my advice how to act in it he tell I that no father ever love a daughter as he love this niece of he whom indeed he use to call he daughter-niece he say she have really be unkindly treat by she brother and sister : and as you alliance sir be far from be a discredit to they family he would do he endeavor to reconcile all party if he could be sure that ye be actually man and wife ' lovel and what pray captain be you advice capt ' i give it as my opinion that if he niece be unworthily treat and in distress -lrb- as he apprehend from the application to he -rrb- he would soon hear of she again : but that it be likely that this application be make without expect it would succeed and as a salvo only to herself for marry without they consent and the rather think i so as he have tell I that it come from a young lady she friend and not in a direct way from herself which young lady be no favorite of the family and therefore would hardly have be employ have success be expect ' lovel very well captain tomlinson -- pray proceed capt ` here the matter rest till last Sunday evening when mr john harlowe come to I with the man who have see you and you lady -lrb- as i presume she be -rrb- at the play and who have assure he that you both lodge in the same house -- and then the application have be so lately make which imply that you be not then marry he be so uneasy for he niece 's honor that i advise he to dispatch to town some one in whom he could confide to make proper inquiry ' lovel very well captain -- and be such a person employ on such a errand by she uncle capt ' a trusty and discreet person be accordingly send and last Tuesday i think it be -lrb- for he return to we on the Wednesday -rrb- he make the inquiry among the neighbor first ' -lrb- the very inquiry jack that give we all so much uneasiness \* -rrb- ` but find that none of they could give any satisfactory account the lady 's woman be come at who declare that you be actually marry but the inquirist keep himself on the reserve as to he employer the girl refuse to tell the day or to give he other particulars ' \* see vol iv letter l lovel you give a very clear account of every thing captain tomlinson pray proceed capt ` the gentleman return and on he report mr harlowe have still doubt and be willing to proceed on some grounds in so important a point beseech I -lrb- as my affair call I frequently to town -rrb- to undertake this matter you mr tomlinson he be please to say have child of you own : you know the world : you know what i drive at : you will proceed i be sure with understanding and spirit : and whatever you be satisfy with shall satisfy I ' enter dorca again in a hurry sir the gentleman be impatient i will attend he presently the captain then account for he not call in person when he have reason to think we here he say he have business of consequence a few mile out of town whither he think he must have go yesterday and have be oblige to put off he little journey till this day and understanding that we be within not know whether he should have such another opportunity he be willing to try he good fortune before he set out and this make he come boot and spur as i see he he drop a hint in commendation of the people of the house but it be in such a way as to give no room to suspect that he think it necessary to inquire after the character of person who make so genteel a appearance as he observe they do and here let I remark that my beloved might collect another circumstance in favor of the people below have she doubt they character from the silence of she uncle 's inquirist on Tuesday among the neighbor capt ` and now sir that i believe i have satisfy you in every thing relate to my commission i hope you will permit I to repeat my question -- which be -- ' enter dorca again out of breath sir the gentleman will step up to you -lrb- my lady be impatient she wonder at you honor 's delay aside -rrb- excuse I captain for one moment i have staid my full time mr lovelace what may result from my question and you answer whatever it shall be may take we up time -- and you be engage will you permit I to attend you in the morning before i set out on my return you will then breakfast with I captain it must be early if i do i must reach my own house to-morrow night or i shall make the best of wife unhappy and i have two or three place to call at in my way it shall be by seven o'clock if you please captain we be early folk and this i will tell you that if ever i be reconcile to a family so implacable as i have always find the harlowe to be it must be by the mediation of so cool and so moderate a gentleman as yourself and so with the highest civility on both side we part but for the private satisfaction of so good a man i leave he out of doubt that we be man and wife though i do not directly aver it letter vi mr lovelace to john belford esq Sunday night this captain tomlinson be one of the happiest as well as one of the best man in the world what would i give to stand as high in my beloved 's opinion as he do but yet i be as good a man as he be i to tell my own story and have equal credit give to it but the devil should have have he before i have see he on the account he come upon have i think i should not have answer my principal end in it i hint to thee in my last what that be but to the particulars of the conference between my fair-one and I on she hasty message which i be loth to come to because she have have a half triumph over I in it after i have attend the captain down to the very passage i return to the dining-room and put on a joyful air on my beloved 's entrance into it -- o my dearest creature say i let I congratulate you on a prospect so agreeable to you wish and i snatch she hand and smother it with kiss i be go on when interrupt I you see mr lovelace say she how you have embarrass yourself by you obliquity you see that you have not be able to return a direct answer to a plain and honest question though upon it depend all the happiness on the prospect of which you congratulate I you know my best love what my prudent and i will say my kind motive be for give out that we be marry you see that i have take no advantage of it and that no inconvenience have follow it you see that you uncle want only to be assure from ourselves that it be so -- not another word on this subject mr lovelace i will not only risk but i will forfeit the reconciliation so near my heart rather than i will go on to countenance a story so untrue my dearest soul -- would you have I appear -- i would have you appear sir as you be i be resolve that i will appear to my uncle 's friend and to my uncle as i be for one week my dearest life can not you for one week -- only till the settlement -- not for one hour with my own consent you do not know sir how much i have be afflict that i have appear to the people below what i be not but my uncle sir shall never have it to upbraid I nor will i to upbraid myself that i have wilfully pass upon he in false light what my dear would you have I say to the captain to-morrow morning i have give he room to think -- then put he right mr lovelace tell the truth tell he what you please of the favor of you relation to I : tell he what you will about the settlement : and if when draw you will submit they to he perusal and approbation it will show he how much you be in earnest my dearest life -- do you think that he would disapprove of the term i have offer no then may i be accurse if i willingly submit to be trample under foot by my enemy and may i mr lovelace never be happy in this life if i submit to the pass upon my uncle harlowe a wilful and premeditated falshood for truth i have too long labor under the affliction which the rejection of all my friend have give I to purchase my reconciliation with they now at so dear a price as this of my veracity the woman below my dear -- what be the woman below to I -- i want not to establish myself with they need they know all that pass between my relation and you and I neither be they any thing to I madam only that when for the sake of prevent the fatal mischief which might have attend you brother 's project i have make they think we marry i would not appear to they in a light which you yourself think so shocking by my soul madam i have rather die than contradict myself so flagrantly after i have relate to they so many circumstance of we marriage well sir the woman may believe what they please that i have give countenance to what you tell they be my error the many circumstance which you own one untruth have draw you in to relate be a justification of my refusal in the present case do not you see madam that you uncle wish to find that we be marry may not the ceremony be privately over before he mediation can take place urge this point no further mr lovelace if you will not tell the truth i will to-morrow morning -lrb- if i see captain tomlinson -rrb- tell it myself indeed i will will you madam consent that thing pass as before with the people below this mediation of tomlinson may come to nothing you brother 's scheme may be pursue the rather that now he will know -lrb- perhaps from you uncle -rrb- that you be not under a legal protection -- you will at least consent that thing pass here as before -- to permit this be to go on in a error mr lovelace but as the occasion for so do -lrb- if there can be in you opinion a occasion that will warrant a untruth -rrb- will as i presume soon be over i shall the less dispute that point with you but a new error i will not be guilty of if i can avoid it can i do you think madam have any dishonourable view in the step i suppose you would not scruple to take towards a reconciliation with you own family not for my own sake you know do i wish you to take it for what be it to I if i be never reconcile to you family i want no favor from they i hope mr lovelace there be no occasion in we present not disagreeable situation to answer such a question and let I say that i shall think my prospects still more agreeable if to-morrow morning you will not only own the very truth but give my uncle 's friend such a account of the step you have take and be take as may keep up my uncle 's favourable intention towards I this you may do under what restriction of secrecy you please captain tomlinson be a prudent man a promoter of family-peace you find and i dare say may be make a friend i see there be no help i see that the inflexible harlowe spirit be all up in she -- a little witch -- a little -- forgive I love for call she name and so i say with a air we have have too many misunderstanding madam for I to wish for new one : i will obey you without reserve have i not think i should have oblige you by the other method -lrb- especially as the ceremony might have be over before any thing could have operate from you uncle 's intention and of consequence no untruth persist in -rrb- i would not have propose it but think not my beloved creature that you shall enjoy without condition this triumph over my judgment and then clasp my arm about she i give she avert cheek -lrb- she charming lip design -rrb- a fervent kiss -- and you forgiveness of this sweet freedom -lrb- bow -rrb- be that condition she be not mortally offend and now must i make out the rest as well as i can but this i will tell thee that although she triumph have not diminish my love for she yet it have stimulate I more than ever to revenge as thou wilt be apt to call it but victory or conquest be the more proper word there be a pleasure ` tis true in subdue one of these watchful beauty but by my soul belford man of we cast take twenty time the pain to be rogue than it would cost they to be honest and dearly with the sweat of we brow and to the puzzlement of we brain -lrb- to say nothing of the hazard we run -rrb- do we earn we purchase and ought not therefore to be grudge we success when we meet with it -- especially as when we have obtain we end satiety soon follow and leave we little or nothing to show for it but this indeed may be say of all worldly delight -- and be not that a grave reflection from I i be willing to write up to the time although i have not carry my principal point i shall make something turn out in my favor from captain tomlinson 's errand but let I give thee this caution that thou do not pretend to judge of my device by part but have patience till thou seest the whole but once more i swear that i will not be out-norris 'd by a pair of novice and yet i be very apprehensive at time of the consequence of miss howe 's smuggling scheme my conscience i should think ought not to reproach I for a contrivance which be justify by the contrivance of two such girl as these : one of whom -lrb- the more excellent of the two -rrb- i have always with she own approbation as i imagine propose for my imitation but here jack be the thing that conclude I and case my heart with adamant : i find by miss howe 's letter that it be owe to she that i have make no greater progress with my bloom fair-one she love I the ipecacuanha contrivance convince I that she love I where there be love there must be confidence or a desire of have reason to confide generosity found on my suppose generosity have take hold of she heart shall i not now see -lrb- since i must forever be unhappy if i marry she and leave any trial unessayed -rrb- what i can make of she love and she newly-raised confidence -- will it not be to my glory to succeed and to she 's and to the honor of she sex if i can not -- where then will be the hurt to either to make the trial and can not i as i have often say reward she when i will by marriage ` tis late or rather early for the day begin to dawn upon I i be plaguy heavy perhaps i need not to have tell thee that but will only indulge a doze in my chair for a hour then shake myself wash and refresh at my time of life with such a constitution as i be bless with that be all that be wanted good night to I -- it can not be broad day till i be awake -- aw-w-w-whaugh -- pox of this yawning be not thy uncle dead yet what be come to mine that he write not to my last -- hunting after more wisdom of nation i suppose -- yaw-yaw-yawning again -- pen begone letter vii mr lovelace to john belford esq Monday may 29 now have i establish myself for ever in my charmer 's heart the captain come at seven as promise and ready equip for he journey my beloved choose not to give we she company till we first conversation be over -- ashamed i suppose to be present at that part of it which be to restore she to she virgin state by my confession after she wifehood have be report to she uncle but she take she cue nevertheless and listen to all that pass the modestest woman jack must think and think deeply sometimes i wonder whether they ever blush at those thing by themselves at which they have so charming a knack of blush in company if not and if blush be a sign of grace or modesty have not the sex as great a command over they blush as they be say to have over they tear this reflection would lead I a great way into female mind be i dispose to pursue it i tell the captain that i would prevent he question and accordingly -lrb- after i have enjoin the strictest secrecy that no advantage might be give to jame harlowe and which he have answer for as well on mr harlowe 's part as he own -rrb- i acknowledge nakedly and fairly the whole truth -- to wit ` that we be not yet marry i give he hint of the cause of procrastination some of they owe to unhappy misunderstanding : but chiefly to the lady 's desire of previous reconciliation with she friend and to a delicacy that have no example ' less nice lady than this jack love to have delay wilful and study delay imputed to they in these case -- yet be indelicate in they affect delicacy : for do they not thereby tacitly confess that they expect to be the greatest estgainer in wedlock and that there be self-denial in the pride they take in delay ' i tell he the reason of we pass to the people below as marry -- yet as under a vow of restriction as to consummation which have keep we both to the height one of forbear the other of vigilant punctilio even to the denial of those innocent freedom which betroth lover never scruple to allow and to take ' i then communicate to he a copy of my proposal of settlement the substance of she write answer the contents of my letter of invitation to lord m to be she nuptial-father and of my lord 's generous reply but say that have apprehension of delay from he infirmity and my beloved choosing by all means -lrb- and that from principle of unrequited duty -rrb- a private solemnization i have write to excuse he lordship 's presence and expect a answer every hour ` the settlement i tell he be actually draw by counsellor william of whose eminence he must have hear -- ' he have ` and of the truth of this he might satisfy himself before he go out of town ` when these be draw approve and engross nothing i say but signing and the nomination of my happy day would be want i have a pride i declare in do the highest justice to so beloved a creature of my own voluntary motion and without the intervention of a family from whom i have receive the greatest insult and this be we present situation i be contented that mr john harlowe should suspend he reconciliatory purpose till we marriage be actually solemnize ' the captain be highly delighted with all i say : yet own that as he dear friend mr harlowe have express himself greatly pleased to hear that we be actually marry he could have wish it have be so but nevertheless he doubt not that all would be well he see my reason he say and approve of they for make the gentlewoman below -lrb- whom again he understand to be good sort of people -rrb- believe that the ceremony have pass which so well account for what the lady 's maid have tell mr harlowe 's friend mr jame harlowe he say have certainly end to answer in keep open the breach and as certainly have form a design to get he sister out of my hand wherefore it as much import he worthy friend to keep this treaty as secret as it do I at least till he have form he party and take he measure ill will and passion be dreadful misrepresenter it be amazing to he that animosity could be carry so high against a man capable of view so pacific and so honorable and who have show such a command of he temper in this whole transaction as i have do generosity indeed in every case where love of stratagem and intrigue -lrb- i would excuse he -rrb- be not concern be a part of my character he be proceed when breakfast be ready in come the empress of my heart irradiate all around she as with a glory -- a benignity and graciousness in she aspect that though natural to it have be long banish from it next to prostration lowly bow the captain o how the sweet creature smile she approbation of he reverence from one beget reverence from another man be more of monkey in imitation than they think themselves -- involuntarily in a manner i bent my knee -- my dearest life -- and make a very fine speech on present the captain to she no title myself to she lip or cheek ` tis well he attempt not either he be indeed ready to worship she -- could only touch she charming hand i have tell the captain my dear creature -- and then i briefly repeat -lrb- as if i have suppose she have not hear it -rrb- all i have tell he he be astonish that any body could be displeased one moment with such a angel he undertake she cause as the highest degree of merit to himself never i must need say do a angel so much look the angel all placid serene smile self-assured : a more lovely flush than usual heighten she natural grace and add charm even to radiance to she charming complexion after we have seat ourselves the agreeable subject be renew as we take we chocolate how happy should she be in she uncle 's restore favor the captain engage for it -- no more delay he hope on she part let the happy day be but once over all would then be right but be it improper to ask for copy of my proposal and of she answer in order to show they to he dear friend she uncle as mr lovelace pleased -- o that the dear creature would always say so it must be in strict confidence then i say but would it not be better to show she uncle the draught of the settlement when draw and will you be so good as to allow of this mr lovelace there belford we be once the quarrelsome but now we be the polite lover indeed my dear creature i will if you desire it and if captain tomlinson will engage that mr harlowe shall keep they absolutely a secret that i may not be subject to the cavil and controul of any other of a family that have use I so very ill now indeed sir you be very oblige dost think jack that my face do not now also shine i hold out my hand -lrb- first consecrate it with a kiss -rrb- for she be she condescend to give it I i press it to my lip : you know not captain tomlinson -lrb- with a air -rrb- all storm overblown what a happy man -- charming couple -lrb- he hand lift up -rrb- how will my good friend rejoice o that he be present you know not madam how dear you still be to you uncle harlowe i be still unhappy ever to have disoblige he not too much of that however fairest think i the captain repeat he resolution of service and that in so acceptable a manner that the dear creature wish that neither he nor any of he might ever want a friend of equal benevolence nor any of this she say for the captain bring it in that he have five child live by one of the best wife and mother whose excellent management make he as happy as if he eight hundred pound a year -lrb- which be all he have to boast of -rrb- be two thousand without economy the oracular lady say no estate be large enough with it the least be not too small lie still tease villain lie still -- i be only speak to my conscience jack and let I ask you mr lovelace say the captain yet not so much from doubt as that i may proceed upon sure grounds -- you be willing to co-operate with my dear friend in a general reconciliation let I tell you mr tomlinson that if it can be distinguish that my readiness to make up with a family of whose generosity i have not have reason to think highly be entirely owe to the value i have for this angel of a woman i will not only co-operate with mr john harlowe as you ask but i will meet with mr jame harlowe senior and he lady all the way and furthermore to make the son jame and he sister arabellum quite easy i will absolutely disclaim any further interest whether living or die in any of the three brother ' estate content myself with what my beloved 's grandfather have bequeath to she : for i have reason to be abundantly satisfy with my own circumstance and prospects -- enough reward be she not to bring a shilling in dowry in a woman who have a merit superior to all the goods of fortune -- true as the gospel belford -- why have not this scene a real foundation the dear creature by she eye express she gratitude before she lip could utter it o mr lovelace say she -- you have infinitely -- and there she stopt the captain run over in my praise he be really affect o that i have not such a mixture of revenge and pride in my love think i -- but -lrb- my old plea -rrb- can not i make she amends at any time and be not she virtue now in the height of its probation -- would she lay aside like the friend of my uncontending rosebud all thought of defiance -- would she throw herself upon my mercy and try I but one fortnight in the life of honor -- what then -- i can not say what then -- do not despise I jack for my inconsistency -- in no two letter perhaps agree with myself -- who expect consistency in man of we character -- but i be mad with love -- fire by revenge -- puzzle with my own device -- my invention be my curse -- my pride my punishment -- draw five or six way at once can she possibly be so unhappy as i -- o why why be this woman so divinely excellent -- yet how know i that she be what have be she trial have i have the courage to make a single one upon she person though a thousand upon she temper -- enow i hope to make she afraid of ever more disobliging I more -- \*\*\* i must banish reflection or i be a lose man for these two hour past have i hate myself for my own contrivance and this not only from what i have relate to thee but for what i have further to relate but i have now once more steel my heart my vengeance be uppermost for i have be reperus some of miss howe 's virulence the contempt they have both hold I in i can not bear the happiest breakfast-time my beloved own that she have ever know since she have leave she father 's house -lrb- she might have let this alone -rrb- the captain renew all he protestation of service he would write I word how he dear friend receive the account he should give he of the happy situation of we affair and what he think of the settlement as soon as i should send he the draught so kindly promise and we part with great profession of mutual esteem my beloved put up vow for the success of he generous mediation when i return from attend the captain down stair which i do to the outward door my beloved meet I as i enter the dining-room complacency reign in every lovely feature ` you see I already ' say she ` another creature you know not mr lovelace how near my heart this hoped-for reconciliation be i be now willing to banish every disagreeable remembrance you know not sir how much you have oblige I and o mr lovelace how happy i shall be when my heart be lighten from the all-sinking weight of a father 's curse when my dear mamma -- you do not know sir half the excellency of my dear mamma and what a kind heart she have when it be leave to follow its own impulse -- when this bless mamma shall once more fold I to she indulgent bosom when i shall again have uncle and aunt and a brother and sister all strive who shall show most kindness and favor to the poor outcast then no more a outcast -- and you mr lovelace to behold all this with welcome -- what though a little cold at first when they come to know you better and to see you oftener no fresh cause of disgust occur and you as i hope have enter upon a new course all will be warmer and warmer love on both side till every one will perhaps wonder how they come to set themselves against you ' then dry she tear with she handkerchief after a few moment pause on a sudden as if recollect that she have be lead by she joy to a expression of it which she have not intend i should see she retire to she chamber with precipitation leave I almost as unable to stand it as herself in short i be -- i want word to say how i be -- my nose have be make to tingle before my eye have before be make to glisten by this soul-moving beauty but so very much affect i never be -- for try to check my sensibility it be too strong for I and i even sob -- yes by my soul i audibly sob and be force to turn from she before she have well finish she affect speech i want methink now i have own the odd sensation to describe it to thee -- the thing be so strange to I -- something choke as it be in my throat -- i know not how -- yet i must need say though i be out of countenance upon the recollection that there be something very pretty in it and i wish i could know it again that i might have a more perfect idea of it and be better able to describe it to thee but this effect of she joy on such a occasion give I a high notion of what that virtue must be -lrb- what other name can i call it -rrb- which in a mind so capable of delicate transport should be able to make so charming a creature in she very bloom all frost and snow to every advance of love from the man she hate not this must be all from education too -- must it not belford can education have stronger force in a woman 's heart than nature -- sure it can not but if it can how entirely right be parent to cultivate they daughter ' mind and to inspire they with notion of reserve and distance to we sex : and indeed to make they think highly of they own for pride be a excellent substitute let I tell thee where virtue shine not out as the sun in its own unborrowed lustre letter viii mr lovelace to john belford esq and now it be time to confess -lrb- and yet i know that thy conjecture be aforehand with my exposition -rrb- that this captain tomlinson who be so great a favorite with my charmer and who take so much delight in healing breach and reconcile difference be neither a greater man nor a less than honest patrick m ` donald attend by a discard footman of he own finding out thou knowest what a various-lifed rascal he be and to what better hope bear and educate but that ingenious knack of forgery for which he be expel the dublin-university and a detection since in evidenceship have be he ruin for these have throw he from one country to another and at last into the way of life which would make he a fit husband for miss howe 's townsend with she contraband he be thou knowest admirably qualify for any enterprize that require adroitness and solemnity and can there after all be a higher piece of justice than to keep one smuggler in readiness to play against another ` well but lovelace -lrb- methink thou questionest -rrb- how camest thou to venture upon such a contrivance as this when as thou hast tell I the lady use to be a month at a time at this uncle 's and must therefore in all probability know that there be not a captain tomlinson in all the neighborhood at least no one of the name so intimate with he as this man pretend to be ' this objection jack be so natural a one that i could not help observe to my charmer that she must surely have hear she uncle speak of this gentleman no she say she never have besides she have not be at she uncle harlowe 's for near ten month -lrb- this i have hear from she before -rrb- : and there be several gentleman who use the same green whom she know not we be all very ready thou knowest to believe what she like and what be the reason thinkest thou that she have not be of so long a time at this uncle 's -- why this old sinner who imagine himself entitle to call I to account for my freedom with the sex have lately fall into familiarity as it be suspect with he housekeeper who assume air upon it -- a cursed delude sex -- in youth middle age or dotage they take we all in dost thou not see however that this housekeeper know nothing nor be to know any thing of the treaty of reconciliation design to be set on foot and therefore the uncle always come to the captain the captain go not to the uncle and this i surmise to the lady and then it be a natural suggestion that the captain be the rather apply to as he be a stranger to the rest of the family -- need i tell thee the meaning of all this but this intrigue of the antient be a piece of private history the truth of which my beloved care not to own and indeed affect to disbelieve : as she do also some puisny gallantry of she foolish brother which by way of recrimination i have hint at without name my informant in they family ` well but methink thou questionest again be it not probable that miss howe will make inquiry after such a man as tomlinson -- and when she can not -- ' i know what thou wouldst say -- but i have no doubt that wilson will be so good if i desire it as to give into my own hand any letter that may be bring by collin to he house for a week to come and now i hope thou art satisfied i will conclude with a short story ` two neighbour sovereign be at war together about some pitiful chuck-farthing thing or other no matter what for the least trifle will set prince and child at loggerheads they army have be draw up in battalia some day and the news of a decisive action be expect every hour to arrive at each court at last issue be join a bloody battle be fight and a fellow who have be a spectator of it arrive with the news of a complete victory at the capital of one of the prince some time before the appoint courier the bell be set a ringing bonfire and illuminations be make and the people go to bed intoxicate with joy and good liquor but the next day all be reverse : the victorious enemy pursue he advantage be expect every hour at the gate of the almost defenceless capital the first reporter be hereupon seek for and find and be question plead a great deal of merit in that he have in so dismal a situation take such a space of time from the distress of he fellow-citizen and give it to festivity as be the hour between the false good news and the real bad ' do thou belford make the application this i know that i have give greater joy to my beloved than she have think would so soon fall to she share and as the human life be properly say to be chequerwork no doubt but a person of she prudence will make the best of it and set off so much good against so much bad in order to strike as just a balance as possible -lrb- the lady in three several letter acquaint she friend with the most material passage and conversation contain in those of mr lovelace 's precede these be she word on relate what the commission of the pretended tomlinson be after the apprehension that he distant inquiry have give she : -rrb- at last my dear all these doubt and fear be clear up and banish and in they place a delightful prospect be open to I for it come happily out -lrb- but at present it must be a absolute secret for reason which i shall mention in the sequel -rrb- that the gentleman be send by my uncle harlowe -lrb- i think he could not be angry with I for ever -rrb- : all owe to the conversation that pass between you good mr hickman and he for although mr hickman 's application be too harshly reject at the time my uncle could not but think better of it afterwards and of the argument that worthy gentleman use in my favor who upon a passionate repulse would despair of have a reasonable request grant -- who would not by gentleness and condescension endeavor to leave favourable impression upon a angry mind which when it come cooly to reflect may induce it to work itself into a condescending temper to request a favor as i have often say be one thing to challenge it as we due be another and what right have a petitioner to be angry at a repulse if he have not a right to demand what he sue for as a debt -lrb- she describe captain tomlinson on he breakfast-visit to be a grave good sort of man and in another place a genteel man of great gravity and a good aspect she believe upward of fifty year of age ' i like he say she as soon as i see he ' as she project be now she say more favourable than heretofore she wish that she hope of mr lovelace 's so-often-promised reformation be better ground than she be afraid they can be -rrb- we have both be extremely puzzle my dear say she to reconcile some part of mr lovelace 's character with other part of it : he good with he bad such of the former in particular as he generosity to he tenant he bounty to the innkeeper 's daughter he readiness to put I upon do kind thing by my good norton and other a strange mixture in he mind as i have tell he for he be certainly -lrb- as i have reason to say look back upon he past behavior to I in twenty instance -rrb- a hard-hearted man -- indeed my dear i have think more than once that he have rather see I in tear than give I reason to be please with he my cousin morden say that free liver be remorseless \* and so they must be in the very nature of thing \* see vol iv letter xix see also mr lovelace 's own confession of the delight he take in a woman 's tear in different part of he letter mr lovelace be a proud man we have both long ago observe that he be and i be truly afraid that he very generosity be more owe to he pride and he vanity that that philanthropy -lrb- shall i call it -rrb- which distinguish a beneficent mind money he value not but as a mean to support he pride and he independence and it be easy as i have often think for a person to part with a secondary appetite when by so do he can promote or gratify a first i be afraid my dear that there must have be some fault in he education he natural bias be not perhaps -lrb- as he power be likely to be large -rrb- to do good and beneficent action but not i doubt from proper motive if he have he generosity would not have stopt at pride but would have strike into humanity and then would he not have contented himself with do praiseworthy thing by fit and start or as if rely on the doctrine of merit he hope by a good action to atone for a bad one \* but he would have be uniformly noble and do the good for its own sake \* that the lady judge rightly of he in this place see vol i letter xxxiv where give the motive for he generosity to he rosebud he say -- ` as i make it my rule whenever i have commit a very capital enormity to do some good by way of atonement and as i believe i be a pretty deal indebted on that score i intend to join a hundred pound to johnny 's aunt 's hundred pound to make one innocent couple happy ' -- besides which motive he have a further view in answer in that instance of he generosity as may be see in vol ii letter xxvi xxvii xxviii see also the note vol ii pp 170 171 to show the consistence of he action as they now appear with he view and principle as he lay they down in he first letter it may be not amiss to refer the reader to he letter vol i no xxxiv xxxv see also vol i letter xxx -- and letter xl for clarissa 's early opinion of mr lovelace -- whence the coldness and indifference to he which he so repeatedly accuse she of will be account for more to she glory than to he honor o my dear what a lot have i draw pride this poor man 's virtue and revenge he other predominate quality -- this one consolation however remain : -- he be not a infidel and unbeliever : have he be a infidel there would have be no room at all for hope of he -lrb- but pride himself as he do in he fertile invention -rrb- he would have be utterly abandon irreclaimable and a savage -lrb- when she come to relate those occasion which mr lovelace in he narrative acknowledge himself to be affect by she thus express herself : -rrb- he endeavor as once before to conceal he emotion but why my dear should these man -lrb- for mr lovelace be not singular in this -rrb- think themselves above give these beautiful proof of a feeling heart be it in my power again to choose or to refuse i would reject the man with contempt who seek to suppress or offer to deny the power of be visibly affect upon proper occasion as either a savage-hearted creature or as one who be so ignorant of the principal glory of the human nature as to place he pride in a barbarous insensibility these line translate from juvenal by mr tate i have be often pleased with : compassion proper to mankind appear : which nature witness would when she lend we tear of tender sentiment we only give these proof : to weep be we prerogative : to show by pity look and melting eye how with a suff ` ring friend we sympathise who can all sense of other ill escape be but a brute at best in human shape it can not but yield I some pleasure hardly as i have sometimes think of the people of the house that such a good man as captain tomlinson have speak well of they upon inquiry and here i stop a minute my dear to receive in fancy you kind congratulation my next i hope will confirm my present and open still more agreeable prospects mean time be assure that there can not possibly any good fortune befal I which i shall look upon with equal delight to that i have in you

and each in he or she best attire to worship the god that make they nor could it be a hardship upon a man liberally educate to make one on so solemn a occasion and to hear the harangue of a man of letter -lrb- though far from be the principal part of the service as it be too generally look upon to be -rrb- whose study have take a different turn from he own he must always have something new to say \* see vol iv letter v \*\* ibid she shake she head and repeat the word new : but look as if willing to be satisfy for the present with this answer to be sure jack she mean to do great despight to he satanic majesty in she hope of reform I no wonder therefore if he exert himself to prevent she and to be revenge but how come this in -- i be ever of party against myself -- one day i fancy i shall hate myself on recollect what i be about at this instant but i must stay till then we must all of we do something to repent of the reconciliation-prospect be enlarged upon if she uncle harlowe will but pave the way to it and if it can be bring about she shall be happy -- happy with a sigh as it be now possible she can be she will not forbear jack i tell she that i have hear from pritchard just before we set out on we airing and expect he in town to-morrow from lord m to take my direction i speak with gratitude of my lord 's kindness to I and with pleasure of lady sarah 's lady betty 's and

greater malady generally swallow up the less she may have a grief on this occasion that may diminish the other grief and make it tolerable ' i have a gentle reprimand for this light turn on so heavy a evil -- ` for what be the loss of beauty to the loss of a good husband ' -- excellent creature she hope -lrb- and she pleasure upon those hope -rrb- that miss howe 's mother would be reconcile to she be also mention good mr howe be she word for a woman so covetous and so remorseless in she covetousness that no one else will call she good but this dear creature have such a extension in she love as to be capable of value the most insignificant animal related to those whom she respect love I and love my dog i have hear lord m say -- who know but that i may in time in compliment to myself bring she to think well of thee jack but what be i about be i not all this time arraign my own heart -- i know i be by the remorse i feel in it while my pen bear testimony to she excellence but yet i must add -lrb- for no selfish consideration shall hinder I from do justice to this admirable creature -rrb- that in this conversation she demonstrate so much prudent knowledge in every thing that relate to that part of the domestic management which fall under the care of a mistress of a family that i believe she have no equal of she year in the world but indeed i know not the subject on which she do not talk with admirable distinction insomuch that could i but get over my prejudice against matrimony and resolve to walk in the dull beaten path of my ancestor i should be the happiest of man -- and if i can not i may be ten time more to be pity than she my heart my heart belford be not to be trust -- i break off to re-peruse some of miss howe 's virulence \*\*\* curse letter these of miss howe jack -- do thou turn back to those of mine where i take notice of they -- i proceed -- upon the whole my charmer be all gentleness all ease all serenity throughout this sweet excursion nor have she reason to be otherwise : for it be the first time that i have the honor of she company alone i be resolve to encourage she by my respectfulness to repeat the favor on we return i find the counsellor 's clerk wait for I with a draught of the marriage-settlement they be draw with only the necessary variation from those make for my mother the original of which -lrb- now return by the counsellor -rrb- as well as the new draught i have put into my beloved 's hand these settlement of my mother make the lawyer 's work easy nor can she have a better precedent the great lord s have settle they at the request of my mother 's relation all the difference my charmer 's be 100l per annum more than my mother 's i offer to read to she the old deed while she look over the draught for she have refuse she presence at the examination with the clerk : but this she also decline i suppose she do not care to hear of so many child first second third fourth fifth sixth and seventh son and as many daughter to be beget upon the body of the say clarissa harlowe charming matrimonial recitativo -- though it be always say lawfully beget too -- as if a man could beget child unlawfully upon the body of he own wife -- but thinkest thou not that these arch rogue the lawyer hereby intimate that a man may have child by he wife before marriage -- this must be what they mean why will these sly fellow put a honest man in mind of such roguery -- but hence as in numberless other instance we see that law and gospel be two very different thing dorca in we absence try to get at the wainscot-box in the dark closet but it can not be do without violence and to run a risk of consequence now for mere curiosity-sake would be inexcusable mr sinclair and the nymph be all of opinion that i be now so much a favorite and have such a visible share in she confidence and even in she affection that i may do what i will and plead for excuse violence of passion which they will have it make violence of action pardonable with they sex as well as allow extenuation with the unconcerned of both sex and they all offer they help hand why not they say : have she not pass for my wife before they all -- and be she not in a fine way of be reconcile to she friend -- and be not the want of that reconciliation the pretence for postpone the consummation they again urge I since it be so difficult to make night my friend to a attempt in the day they remind I that the situation of they house be such that no noise can be hear out of it and ridicule I for make it necessary for a lady to be undressed it be not always so with I poor old man sally tell I saucily fling she handkerchief in my face letter x mr lovelace to john belford esq Friday June 2 notwithstanding my studied-for politeness and complaisance for some day past and though i have want courage to throw the mask quite aside yet i have make the dear creature more than once look about she by the warm though decent expression of my passion i have bring she to own that i be more than indifferent with she : but as to love which i press she to acknowledge what need of acknowledgment of that sort when a woman consent to marry -- and once repulse I with displeasure the proof of true love i be vow for she be respect not freedom and offer to defend myself she tell I that all the conception she have be able to form of a faulty passion be that it must demonstrate itself as mine seek to do i endeavor to justify my passion by lay over-delicacy at she door over-delicacy she say be not my fault if it be she 's she must plainly tell I that i appear to she incapable of distinguish what be the requisite of a pure mind perhaps have the libertine presumption to imagine that there be no difference in heart nor any but what proceed from difference of education and custom between the pure and impure -- and yet custom alone as she observe if i do so think would make a second nature as well in good as in bad habit \*\*\* i have just now be call to account for some innocent liberty which i think myself entitle to take before the woman as they suppose we to be marry and now within view of consummation i take the lecture very hardly and with impatience wish for the happy day and hour when i might call she all my own and meet with no check from a niceness that have no example she look at I with a bashful kind of contempt i think it contempt and require the reason for it not be conscious of offence as i tell she this be not the first time mr lovelace say she that i have have cause to be displeased with you when you perhaps have not think yourself exceptionable -- but sir let I tell you that the married state in my eye be a state of purity and -lrb- i think she tell I -rrb- not of licentiousness so at least i understand she marriage-purity jack -- very comical ` faith -- yet sweet dear half the female world ready to run away with a rake because he be a rake and for no other reason nay every other reason against they choice of such a one but have not you and i belford see young wife who would be think modest and when maid be fantastically shy permit freedom in public from they uxorious husband which have show that both of they have forget what belong either to prudence or decency while every modest eye have sink under the shameless effrontery and every modest face be cover with blush for those who could not blush i once upon such a occasion propose to a circle of a dozen thus scandalize to withdraw since they must need see that as well the lady as the gentleman want to be in private this motion have its effect upon the amorous pair and i be applaud for the check give to they licentiousness but upon another occasion of this sort i act a little more in character for i ventured to make a attempt upon a bride which i should not have have the courage to make have not the unblushing passiveness with which she receive she fond husband 's public toying -lrb- look round she with triumph rather than with shame upon every lady present -rrb- incite my curiosity to know if the same complacency might not be show to a private friend ` tis true i be in honor oblige to keep the secret but i never see the turtle bill afterwards but i think of number two to the same female and in my heart thank the fond husband for the lesson he have teach he wife from what i have say thou wilt see that i approve of my beloved 's exception to public love that i hope be all the charming icicle mean by marriage-purity but to return from the whole of what i have mention to have pass between my beloved and I thou wilt gather that i have not be a mere dangler a hickman in the pass day though not absolutely active and a lovelace the dear creature now consider herself as my wife-elect the unsaddened heart no longer prudish will not now i hope give the sable turn to every address of the man she dislike not and yet she must keep up so much reserve as will justify past inflexibility ` many and many a pretty soul would yield be she not afraid that the man she favor would think the worse of she for it ' that be also a part of the rake 's creed but should she resent ever so strongly she can not now break with I since if she do there will be

she twice indeed with rapture which once she call rude do i salute she and each time resent the freedom do she retire though to do she justice she favor I again with she presence at my first entreaty

down -rrb- be extremely surprised and even grieve -lrb- as he fear he would be -rrb- to hear that we be not marry the world he say who know my character would be very censorious be it own that we have live so long together unmarried in the same lodgings although we marriage be now to be ever so publicly celebrated ` he nephew jame he be sure would make a great handle of it against any motion that might be make towards a reconciliation and with the greater success as there be not a family in the kingdom more jealous of they honor than theirs ' this be true of the harlowe jack : they have be call the proud harlowe : and i have ever find that all young honor be supercilious and touchy but seest thou not how right i be in my endeavor to persuade my fair - one to allow she uncle 's friend to think we marry especially as he come prepare to believe it and as she uncle hope it be so -- but nothing on earth be so perverse as a woman when she be set upon carry a point and have a meek man or one who love he peace to deal with my beloved be vex she pull out she handkerchief : but be more inclined to blame I than herself have you keep you word mr lovelace and leave I when we come to town -- and there she stopt for she know that it be she own fault that we be not marry before we leave the country and how could i leave she afterwards while she brother be plot to carry she off by violence nor have this brother yet give over he machination for as the captain proceed ` mr john harlowe own to he -lrb- but in confidence -rrb- that he nephew be at this time busy in endeavor to find out where we be be assure -lrb- as i be not to be hear of at any of my relation or at my usual lodgings -rrb- that we be together and that we be not marry be plain as he will have it from mr hickman 's application so lately make to she uncle and which be second by mr norton to she mother and she brother can not bear that i should enjoy such a triumph unmolested ' a profound sigh and the handkerchief again lift to the eye but do not the sweet soul deserve this turn upon she for feloniously resolve to rob I of herself have the application make by hickman succeed i read on to the following effect : ` why -lrb- ask mr harlowe -rrb- be it say to he other inquire friend that we be marry and that by he niece 's woman who ought to know who could give convincing reason no doubt ' -- here again she weep take a turn across the room then return -- read on say she -- will you my dearest life read it yourself i will take the letter with I by-and-by -- i can not see to read it just now wipe she eye -- read on -- let I hear it all -- that i may know you sentiment upon this letter as well as give my own ` the captain then tell uncle john the reason that induce I to give out that we be marry and the condition on which my beloved be bring to countenance it which have keep we at the most punctilious distance ` but still mr harlowe object my character and go away dissatisfied and the captain be also so much concerned that he care not to write what the result of he first conference be ` but in the next which be hold on receipt of the draught at the captain 's house -lrb- as the former be for the greater secrecy -rrb- when the old gentleman have read they and have the captain 's opinion he be much better pleased and yet he declare that it would not be easy to persuade any other person of he family to believe so favourably of the matter as he be now willing to believe be they to know that we have live so long together unmarried ` and then the captain say he dear friend make a proposal : -- it be this -- that we should marry out of hand but as privately as possible as indeed he find we intend -lrb- for he could have no objection to the draught -rrb- -- but yet he expect to have present one trusty friend of he own for he better satisfaction ' -- here i stopt with a design to be angry -- but she desire I to read on i obeyed ' -- but that it should pass to every one living except to that trusty person to himself and to the captain that we be marry from the time that we have live together in one house and that this time should be make to agree with that of mr hickman 's application to he from miss howe ' this my dearest life say i be a very considerate proposal we have nothing to do but to caution the people below properly on this head i do not think you uncle harlowe capable of hit upon such a charming expedient as this but you see how much he heart be in the reconciliation this be the return i meet with -- you have always as a mark of you politeness let I know how meanly you think of every one in my family yet thou wilt think belford that i could forgive she for the reproach ` the captain do not know say he how this proposal will be relish by we but for he part he think it a expedient that will obviate many difficulty and may possibly put a end to mr jame harlowe 's further design : and on this account he have by the uncle 's advice already declare to two several person by whose mean it may come to that young gentleman 's that he -lrb- captain tomlinson -rrb- have very great reason to believe that we be marry soon after mr hickman 's application be reject ` and this mr lovelace -lrb- say the captain -rrb- will enable you to pay a compliment to the family that will not be unsuitable to the generosity of some of the declaration you be please to make to the lady before I -lrb- and which mr john harlowe may make some advantage of in favor of a reconciliation -rrb- in that you be entitle to make the demand ' a excellent contriver surely she must think this worthy mr tomlinson to be but the captain add ` that if either the lady or i disapprove of he report of we marriage he will retract it nevertheless he must tell I that mr john harlowe be very much set upon this way of proceed as the only one in he opinion capable of be improve into a general reconciliation but if we do acquiesce in it he beseech my fair-one not to suspend my day that he may be authorize in what he say as to the truth of the main fact -lrb- how conscientious this good man -rrb- nor must it be expect he say that she uncle will take one step towards the wished-for reconciliation till the solemnity be actually over ' he add ` that he shall be very soon in town on other affair and then propose to attend we and give we a more particular account of all that have pass or shall further pass between mr harlowe and he ' well my dearest life what say you to you uncle 's expedient shall i write to the captain and acquaint he that we have no objection to it she be silent for a few minute at last with a sigh see mr lovelace say she what you have bring I to by tread after you in such crooked path -- see what disgrace i have incur -- indeed you have not act like a wise man my beloved creature do you not remember how earnestly i besought the honor of you hand before we come to town -- have i be then favor -- well well sir there have be much amiss somewhere that be all i will say at present and since what be past can not be recall my uncle must be obey i think charmingly dutiful -- i have nothing then to do that i might not be behind-hand with the worthy captain and she uncle but to press for the day this i fervently do but -lrb- as i might have expect -rrb- she repeat she former answer to wit that when the settlement be complete when the license be actually obtain it would be time enough to name the day : and o mr lovelace say she turn from I with a grace inimitably tender she handkerchief at she eye what a happiness if my dear uncle could be prevail upon to be personally a father on this occasion to the poor fatherless girl what be the matter with I -- whence this dew-drop -- a tear -- as i hope to be save it be a tear jack -- very ready methink -- only on recite -- but she lovely image be before I in the very attitude she speak the word -- and indeed at the time she speak they these line of shakespeare come into my head : thy heart be big get thee apart and weep passion i see be catch : -- for my eye see those bead of sorrow stand in thine begin to water -- i withdraw and write to the captain to the following effect -- ' i desire that he would be so good as to acquaint he dear friend that we entirely acquiesce with what he have propose and have already properly caution the gentlewoman of the house and they servant as well as we own : and to tell he that if he would in person give I the blessing of he dear niece 's hand it would crown the wish of both in this case i consent that he own day as i presume it would be a short one should be ours : that by this mean the secret would be with fewer person : that i myself as well as he think the ceremony could not be too privately perform and this not only for the sake of the wise end he have propose to answer by it but because i would not have lord m think himself slight since that nobleman as i have tell he -lrb- the captain -rrb- have once intend to be we nuptial-father and actually make the offer but that we have decline to accept of it and that for no other reason than to avoid a public wedding which he beloved niece would not come into while she be in disgrace with she friend but that if he choose not to do we this honor i wish that captain tomlinson might be the trusty person whom he would have be present on the happy occasion ' i show this letter to my fair-one she be not displeased with it so jack we can not now move too fast as to settlement and license : the day be she uncle 's day or captain tomlinson 's perhaps as shall best suit the occasion miss howe 's smuggling scheme be now surely provide against in all event but i will not by anticipation make thee a judge of all the benefit that may flow from this my elaborate contrivance why will these girl put I upon my master-stroke and now for a little mine which i be get ready to spring the first that i have spring and at the rate i go on -lrb- now a resolution and now a remorse -rrb- perhaps the last that i shall attempt to spring a little mine i call it but it may be attend with great effect i shall not however absolutely depend upon the success of it have much more effectual one in reserve and yet great engine be often move by small spring a little spark fall by accident into a powder-magazine have do more execution in a siege than a hundred cannon come the worst the hymeneal torch and a white sheet must be my amende honorable as the french have it letter xiii mr belford to robert lovelace esq Tuesday June 6 unsuccessful as hitherto my application to you have be i can not for the heart of I forbear write once more in behalf of this admirable woman : and yet be unable to account for the zeal which impel I to take she part with a earnestness so sincere but all she merit thou acknowledgest all thy own vileness thou confessest and even gloriest in it : what hope then of move so harden a man -- yet as it be not too late and thou art nevertheless upon the crisis i be resolve to try what another letter will do it be but my writing in vain if it do no good and if thou wilt let I prevail i knowthou wilt hereafter think I richly entitle to thy thanks to argue with thee would be folly the case can not require it i will only entreat thee therefore that thou wilt not let such a excellence lose the reward of she vigilant virtue i believe there never be libertine so vile but purpose at some future period of they life to set about reform : and let I beg of thee that thou wilt in this great article make thy future repentance as easy as some time hence thou wilt wish thou hadst make it if thou proceedest i have no doubt that this affair will end tragically one way or another it must such a woman must interest both god and man in she cause but what i most apprehend be that with she own hand in resentment of the perpetrate outrage she -lrb- like another lucretium -rrb- will assert the purity of she heart : or if she piety preserve she from this violence that waste grief will soon put a period to she day and in either case will not the remembrance of thy ever-during guilt and transitory triumph be a torment of torment to thee ` tis a seriously sad thing after all that so fine a creature should have fall into such vile and remorseless hand : for from thy cradle as i have hear thee own thou ever delightedst to sport with and torment the animal whether bird or beast that thou lovedst and hadst a power over how different be the case of this fine woman from that of any other whom thou hast seduce -- i need not mention to thee nor insist upon the striking difference : justice gratitude thy interest thy vow all engaging thee and thou certainly love she as far as thou art capable of love above all she sex she not to be draw aside by art or to be make to suffer from credulity nor for want of wit and discernment -lrb- that will be another cut reflection to so fine a mind as she 's : -rrb- the contention between you only unequal as it be between naked innocence and armed guilt in every thing else as thou ownest she talent greatly superior to thine -- what a fate will she 's be if thou art not at last overcome by thy reiterate remorse at first indeed when i be admit into she presence \* -lrb- and till i observe she meaning air and hear she speak -rrb- i suppose that she have no very uncommon judgment to boast of : for i make as i thought but just allowance for she blossoming youth and for that loveliness of person and for that ease and elegance in she dress which i imagine must have take up half she time and study to cultivate and yet i have be prepare by thee to entertain a very high opinion of she sense and she reading she choice of this gay fellow upon such hazardous term -lrb- think i -rrb- be a confirmation that she wit want that maturity which only year and experience can give it she knowledge -lrb- argue i to myself -rrb- must be all theory and the complaisance ever consort with a age so green and so gay will make so inexperienced a lady at least forbear to show herself disgust at freedom of discourse in which those present of she own sex and some of ours -lrb- so learn so well read and so travel -rrb- allow themselves \* see vol iv letter vii in this presumption i run on and have the advantage as i conceit of all the company but you and be desirous to appear in she eye a mighty clever fellow i think i show away when i say any foolish thing that have more sound than sense in they and when i make silly jest which attract the smile of thy sinclair and the specious partington : and that miss harlowe do not smile too i thought be owe to she youth or affectation or to a mixture of both perhaps to a greater command of she feature -- little dream i that i be incur she contempt all the time but when as i say i hear she speak which she do not till she have fathom we all when i hear she sentiment on two or three subject and take notice of the search eye dart into the very inmost cell of we frothy brain by my faith it make I look about I and i begin to recollect and be ashamed of all i have say before in short be resolve to sit silent till every one have talk round to keep my folly in countenance and then i raise the subject that she could join in and which she do join in so much to the confusion and surprise of every one of we -- for even thou lovelace so note for smart wit repartee and a vein of raillery that delighteth all who come near thee sattest in palpable darkness and lookedst about thee as well as we one instance only of this shall i remind thee of we talk of wit and of it and aim at it bandy it like a ball from one to another and rest it chiefly with thee who be always proud enough and vain enough of the attribute and then more especially as thou hadst assemble we as far as i know principally to show the lady thy superiority over we and we thy triumph over she and then tourville -lrb- who be always satisfy with wit at second-hand wit upon memory : other man 's wit -rrb- repeat some verse as applicable to the subject which two of we applaud though full of double entendre thou see the lady 's serious air on one of those repetition appliedst thyself to she desire she notion of wit : a quality thou saidst which every one prize whether flow from himself or find in another then it be that she take all we attention it be a quality much talk of she say but she believe very little understand at least if she might be so free as to give she judgment of it from what have pass in the present conversation she must say that wit with man be one thing with woman another this startle we all : -- how the woman look -- how they purse they mouth a broad smile the moment before upon each from the verse they have hear repeat so well understand as we see by they look while i besought she to let we know for we instruction what wit with woman : for such i be sure it ought to be with man cowley she say have define it prettily by negative thou desiredst she to repeat he definition she do and with so much graceful ease and beauty and propriety of accent as would have make bad poetry delightful a thousand diff ` rent shape it bear comely in thousand shape appear ` tis not a tale ` tis not a jest admir would with laughter at a feast nor florid talk which must this title gain : the proof of wit for ever must remain much less can that have any place at which a virgin hide she face such dross the fire must purge away : -- ` tis just the author blush there where the reader must here she stopt look round upon she upon we all with conscious superiority as i think lord how we stare thou attemptedst to give we thy definition of wit that thou mightest have something to say and not seem to be surprise into silent modesty but as if she care not to trust thee with the subject refer to the same author as for he more positive decision she thus with the same harmony of voice and accent emphatically decide upon it wit like a luxurious vine unless to virtue 's prop it join firm and erect tow ` rd heaven bind tho ' it with beauteous leaf and pleasant fruit be crown would it lie deform would and rot on the ground if thou recollectest this part of the conversation and how like fool we look at one another how much it put we out of conceit with ourselves and make we fear she when we find we conversation thus exclude from the very character which we vanity have make we think unquestionably ours and if thou profitest properly by the recollection thou wilt be of my mind that there be not so much wit in wickedness as we have flatter ourselves there be and after all i have be of opinion ever since that conversation that the wit of all the rake and libertine down to little johnny hartop the punster consist mostly in say bold and shocking thing with such courage as shall make the modest blush the impudent laugh and the ignorant stare and why dost thou think i mention these thing so mal-a-propos as it may seem -- only let I tell thee as a instance -lrb- among many that might be give from the same evening 's conversation -rrb- of this fine woman 's superiority in those talent which ennoble nature and dignify she sex -- evidence not only to each of we as we offend but to the flippant partington and the grosser but egregiously hypocritical sinclair in the correct eye the discourage blush in which be mix as much displeasure as modesty and sometimes as the occasion call for it -lrb- for we be some of we harden above the sense of feeling delicate reproof -rrb- by the sovereign contempt mingle with a disdainful kind of pity that show at once she own conscious worth and we despicable worthlessness o lovelace what then be the triumph even in my eye and what be it still upon reflection of true jest laugh impertinence and a obscenity so shameful even to the guilty that they can not hint at it but under a double meaning then as thou hast somewhere observe \* all she corrective avow by she eye not poorly like the generality of she sex affect ignorance of meaning too obvious to be conceal but so resent as to show each impudent laugher the offence give to and take by a purity that have mistake its way when it fall into such company \* see vol iv letter xlviii such be the woman such be the angel whom thou hast betray into thy power and wouldst deceive and ruin -- sweet creature do she but know how she be surround -lrb- as i then think as well as now think -rrb- and what be intend how much sooner would death be she choice than so dreadful a situation -- ` and how effectually would she story be it generally known warn all the sex against throw themselves into the power of ours let we vow oath and protestation be what they will ' but let I beg of thee once more my dear lovelace if thou hast any regard for thine own honor for the honor of thy family for thy future peace or for my opinion of thee -lrb- who yet pretend not to be so much move by principle as by that dazzling merit which ought still more to attract thee -rrb- to be prevail upon -- to be -- to be humane that be all -- only that thou wouldst not disgrace we common humanity harden as thou art i know that they be the abandon people in the house who keep thee up to a resolution against she o that the sagacious fair-one -lrb- with so much innocent charity in she own heart -rrb- have not so resolutely hold those woman at distance -- that as she board there she have oftener table with they specious as they be in a week 's time she would have see through they they could not have be always so guard as they be when they see she but seldom and when they prepare themselves to see she and she would have flee they house as a place infected and yet perhaps with so determine a enterprizer this discovery might have accelerate she ruin i know that thou art nice in thy love but be there not hundred of woman who though not utterly abandon would be take with thee for mere personal regard make a toy if thou wilt of principle with respect to such of the sex as regard it as a toy but rob not a angel of those purity which in she own opinion constitute the difference between angelic and brutal quality with regard to the passion itself the less of soul in either man or woman the more sensual be they thou lovelace hast a soul though a corrupted one and art more intent -lrb- as thou even gloriest -rrb- upon the preparative stratagem that upon the end of conquer see we not the natural bent of idiot and the craze the very appetite be body and when we ourselves be most fool and craze then be we most eager in these pursuit see what fool this passion make the wisest man what sniveller what dotard when they suffer themselves to be run away with by it -- a unpermanent passion since if -lrb- ashamed of its more proper name -rrb- we must call it love love gratify be love satisfied -- and where consent on one side add to the obligation on the other what then but remorse can follow a forcible attempt do not even chaste lover choose to be alone in they courtship preparation ashamed to have even a child to witness to they foolish action and more foolish expression be this deified passion in its greatest altitude fit to stand the day do not the lover when mutual consent await they will retire to covert and to darkness to complete they wish and shall such a sneak passion as this which can be so easily gratify by viler object be permit to debase the noblest be not the delay of thy vile purpose owe more to the awe which she majestic virtue have inspire thee with than to thy want of adroitness in villany -lrb- i must write my free sentiment in this case for have i not see the angel -rrb- i should be ready to censure some of thy contrivance and pretence to suspend the expected day as trite stale and -lrb- to I who know thy intention -rrb- poor and too often resort to as nothing come of they to be glory in particularly that of mennell the vapourish lady and the ready-furnished house she must have think so too at time and in she heart despise thee for they or love thee -lrb- ungrateful as thou art -rrb- to she misfortune as well as entertain hope against probability but this would afford another warn to the sex be they to know she story ` as it would show they what poor pretence they must seem to be satisfy with if once they put themselves into the power of a design man ' if trial only be thy end as once be thy pretence \* enough surely hast thou try this paragon of virtue and vigilance but i know thee too well to expect at the time that thou wouldest stop there ` man of we cast put no other bind to they view upon any of the sex than what want of power compel they to put ' i know that from one advantage gain thou wouldest proceed to attempt another thy habitual aversion to wedlock too well i know and indeed thou avowest thy hope to bring she to cohabitation in that very letter in which thou pretendest trial to be thy principal view \*\* \* see vol iii letter xviii \*\* ibid see also letter xvi and xvii of that volume but do not even thy own frequent and involuntary remorse when thou hast time place company and every other circumstance to favor thee in thy wicked design convince thee that there can be no room for a hope so presumptuous -- why then since thou wouldest choose to marry she rather than lose she wilt thou make she hate thee for ever but if thou darest to meditate personal trial and art sincere in thy resolution to reward she as she behave in it let I beseech thee to remove she from this vile house that will be to give she and thy conscience fair play so entirely now do the sweet deluded excellence depend upon she suppose happier prospects that thou needest not to fear that she will fly from thee or that she will wish to have recourse to that scheme of miss howe which have put thee upon what thou callest thy master-strokes but whatever be thy determination on this head and if i write not in time but that thou hast actually pull off the mask let it not be one of the device if thou wouldest avoid the curse of every heart and hereafter of thy own to give she no not for one hour -lrb- be she resentment ever so great -rrb- into the power of that villanous woman who have if possible less remorse than thyself and whose trade it be to break the resist spirit and utterly to ruin the heart unpractised in evil -- o lovelace lovelace how many dreadful story could this horrid woman tell the sex and shall that of a clarissa swell the guilty list but this i might have spare of this devil as thou art thou canst not be capable thou couldst not enjoy a triumph so disgraceful to thy wicked pride as well as to humanity shouldest thou think that the melancholy spectacle hourly before I have make I more serious than usual perhaps thou wilt not be mistaken but nothing more be to be infer from hence -lrb- be i even to return to my former course -rrb- but that whenever the time of cool reflection come whether bring on by we own disaster or by those of other we shall undoubtedly if capable of thought and if we have time for it think in the same manner we neither of we be such fool as to disbelieve a futurity or to think whatever be we practice that we come hither by chance and for no end but to do all the mischief we have it in we power to do nor be i ashamed to own that in the prayer which my poor uncle make I read to he in the absence of a very good clergyman who regularly attend he i do not forget to put in a word or two for myself if lovelace thou laughest at I thy ridicule will be more conformable to thy action than to thy belief -- devil believe and tremble canst thou be more abandon than they and here let I add with regard to my poor old man that i often wish thee present but for one half hour in a day to see the dregs of a gay life run off in the most excruciating torture that the cholic the stone and the surgeon 's knife can unitedly inflict and to hear he bewail the dissoluteness of he past life in the bitterest anguish of a spirit every hour expect to be call to its last account -- yet by all he confession he have not to accuse himself in sixty-seven year of life of half the very vile enormity which you and i have commit in the last seven only i conclude with recommend to you serious consideration all i have write as proceed from the heart and soul of you assure friend john belford letter xiv mr lovelace to john belford esq Tuesday afternoon June 6 difficulty still to be get over in procure this plaguy license i ever hate and ever shall hate these spiritual lawyer and they court and now jack if i have not secure victory i have a retreat but hold -- thy servant with a letter -- \*\*\* a confound long one though not a narrative one -- once more in behalf of this lady -- lie thee down oddity what canst thou write that can have force upon I at this crisis -- and have i not as i go along make thee to say all that be necessary for thee to say \*\*\* yet once more i will take thee up trite stale poor -lrb- sayest thou -rrb- be some of my contrivance that of the widow particularly -- i have no patience with thee have not that contrivance its effect at that time for a procrastination and have i not then reason to fear that the lady would find enough to make she dislike this house and be it not right -lrb- intend what i intend -rrb- to lead she on from time to time with a notion that a house of she own would be ready for she soon in order to induce she to continue here till it be trite stale and poor -- thou art a silly fellow and no judge when thou sayest this have i not like a blockhead reveal to thee as i go along the secret purpose of my heart but have keep all in till the event have explain my mystery i would have defy thee to have be able any more than the lady to have guess at what be to befall she till it have actually come to pass nor doubt i in this case that instead of presume to reflect upon she for credulity as loving I to she misfortune and for hope against probability thou wouldest have be readier by far to censure she for nicety and over-scrupulousness and let I tell thee that have she love I as i wish she to love I she could not possibly have be so very apprehensive of my design nor so ready to be influence by miss howe 's precaution as she have always be although my general character make not for I with she but in thy opinion i suffer for that simplicity in my contrivance which be they principal excellence no machinery make i necessary no unnatural flight aim i at all pure nature take advantage of nature as nature tend and so simple my device that when they be know thou even thou imaginest thou couldest have think of the same and indeed thou seemest to own that the slight thou puttest upon they be owe to my let thee into they before-hand -- undistingushing as well as ungrateful as thou art yet after all i would not have thee think that i do not know my weak place i have formerly tell thee that it be difficult for the ablest general to say what he will do or what he can do when he be oblige to regulate he motion by those of a watchful enemy \* if thou givest due weight to this consideration thou wilt not wonder that i should make many march and countermarch some of which may appear to a slight observer unnecessary \* see vol iii letter xxxix but let I cursorily enter into debate with thee on this subject now i be within sight of my journey 's end abundance of impertinent thing thou tellest I in this letter some of which thou hadst from myself other that i know before all that thou sayest in this charming creature 's praise be short of what i have say and write on the inexhaustible subject she virtue she resistance which be she merit be my stimulative have i not tell thee so twenty time over devil as these girl between they call I what of devil be i but in my contrivance i be not more a devil than other in the end i aim at for when i have carry my point it be still but one seduction and i have perhaps be spare the guilt of many seduction in the time what of uncommon would there be in this case but for she watchfulness -- as well as i love intrigue and stratagem dost think that i have not rather have gain my end with less trouble and less guilt the man let I tell thee who be as wicked as he can be be a worse man than i be let I ask any rake in england if resolve to carry he point he would have be so long about it or have have so much compunction as i have have be every rake nay be every man to sit down as i do and write all that enter into he head or into he heart and to accuse himself with equal freedom and truth what a army of miscreant should i have to keep I in countenance it be a maxim with some that if they be leave alone with a woman and make not a attempt upon she she will think herself affront -- be not such man as these worse than i be what a opinion must they have of the whole sex let I defend the sex i so dearly love if these elder brethren of ours think they have general reason for they assertion they must have keep very bad company or must judge of woman 's heart by they own she must be a abandon woman who will not shrink as a snail into its shell at a gross and sudden attempt a modest woman must be naturally cold reserve and shy she can not be so much and so soon affect as libertine be apt to imagine she must at least have some confidence in the honor and silence of a man before desire can possibly put forth in she to encourage and meet he flame for my own part i have be always decent in the company of woman till i be sure of they nor have i ever offer a great offence till i have find little one pass over and that they shun I not when they know my character my divine clarissa have puzzle I and beat I out of my play : at one time i hope to overcome by intimidate she at another by love by the amorous see-saw as i have call it \* and i have only now to join surprise to the other two and see what can be do by all three \* see vol iii letter xvi and whose property i pray thee shall i invade if i pursue my scheme of love and vengeance have not those who have a right to she renounce that right have they not wilfully expose she to danger yet must know that such a woman would be consider as lawful prize by as many as could have the opportunity to attempt she -- and have they not thus cruelly expose she be she not a single woman and need i tell thee jack that man of we cast the best of they -lrb- the worst stick at nothing -rrb- think it a great grace and favor do to the married man if they leave they they wife to themselves and compound for they sister daughter ward and niece shocking as these principle must be to a reflect mind yet such thou knowest be the principle of thousand -lrb- who would not act so generously as i have act by almost all of the sex over whom i have obtain a power -rrb- and as often carry into practice as they opportunity or courage will permit -- such therefore have no right to blame I thou repeatedly pleadest she suffering from she family but i have too often answer this plea to need to say any more now than that she have not suffer for my sake for have she not be make the victim of the malice of she rapacious brother and envious sister who only wait for a occasion to ruin she with she other relation and take this as the first to drive she out of the house and as it happen into my arm -- thou knowest how much against she inclination as for she own sin how many have the dear creature to answer for to love and to I -- twenty time and twenty time twenty have she not tell I that she refuse not the odious solme in favor to I and as often have she not offer to renounce I for the single life if the implacable would have receive she on that condition -- of what repetition do thy weak pity make I guilty to look a litter farther back : canst thou forget what my suffering be from this haughty beauty in the whole time of my attendance upon she proud motion in the purlieus of harlowe-place and at the little white hart at neale as we call it -- do i not threaten vengeance upon she then -lrb- and have i not reason -rrb- for disappointing I of a promise interview o jack what a night have i in the bleak coppice adjoining to she father 's paddock my linen and wig frozen my limb absolutely numb my finger only sensible of so much warmth as enable I to hold a pen and that obtain by rub the skin off and by beat with my hand my shiver side kneel on the hoar moss on one knee write on the other if the stiff scrawl could be call write my foot by the time i have do seem to have take root and actually unable to support I for some minute -- love and rage then keep my heart in motion -lrb- and only love and rage could do it -rrb- or how much more than i do suffer must i have suffer i tell thee at my melancholy return what be the contents of the letter i write \* and i show thee afterwards she tyrannical answer to it \*\* thou then jack lovedst thy friend and pitiedst thy poor suffering lovelace even the affronted god of love approve then of my threaten vengeance against the fair promiser though of the night of my suffering he be become a advocate for she \* see vol ii letter xx \*\* ibid nay be it not he himself that bring to I my adorable nemesis and both together put I upon this very vow ` that i would never rest till i have draw in this goddess-daughter of the harlowe to cohabit with I and that in the face of all they proud family ' nor canst thou forget this vow at this instant i have thee before I as then thou sorrowfully lookedst thy strong feature glowing with compassion for I thy lip twisted thy forehead furrowed thy whole face draw out from the stupid round into the ghastly oval every muscle contribute its power to complete the aspect grievous and not one word couldst thou utter but aman to my vow and what of distinguish love or favor or confidence have i have from she since to make I forego this vow i renew it not indeed afterwards and actually for a long season be willing to forget it till repetition of the same fault revive the remembrance of the former and now add to those the contents of some of miss howe 's virulent letter so lately come at what canst thou say for the rebel consistent with thy loyalty to thy friend every man to he genius and constitution hannibal be call the father of warlike stratagem have hannibal be a private man and turn he plot head against the other sex or have i be a general and turn mine against such of my fellow-creature of my own as i think myself entitle to consider as my enemy because they be bear and live in a different climate hannibal would have do less mischief lovelace more -- that would have be the difference not a sovereign on earth if he be not a good man and if he be of a warlike temper but must do a thousand time more mischief than i and why because he have it in he power to do more a honest man perhaps thou ` lt say will not wish to have it in he power to do hurt he ought not let I tell he : for if he have it a thousand to one but it make he both wanton and wicked in what then be i so singularly vile in my contrivance thou wilt say -lrb- for thou art my echo -rrb- if not in my propose end of they how difficult do every man find it as well as i to forego a predominant passion i have three passion that sway I by turn all imperial one -- love revenge ambition or a desire of conquest as to this particular contrivance of tomlinson and the uncle which perhaps thou wilt think a black one that have be spare have not these innocent lady put I upon find a husband for they mr townsend : that device therefore be but a preventive one thinkest thou that i could bear to be outwit and may not this very contrivance save a world of mischief for dost thou think i would have tamely give up the lady to townsend 's tar what meanest thou except to overthrow thy own plea when thou sayest that man of we cast know no other bind to they wickedness but want of power yet knowest this lady to be in mine enough sayest thou have i try this paragon of virtue not so for i have not try she at all -- all i have be do be but preparation to a trial but thou art concern for the means that i may have recourse to in the trial and for my veracity silly fellow -- do ever any man thinkest thou deceive a woman but at the expense of he veracity how otherwise can he be say to deceive as to the means thou dost not imagine that i expect a direct consent my main hope be but in a yield reluctance without which i will be swear whatever rape have be attempt none ever be commit one person to one person and good queen bess of england have she be live and appeal to would have declare herself of my mind it would not be amiss for the sex to know what we opinion be upon this subject i love to warn they i wish no man to succeed with they but myself i tell thee once that though a rake i be not a rake 's friend \* \* see vol iii letter xviii thou sayest that i ever hate wedlock and true thou sayest and yet as true when thou tellest I that i would rather marry than lose this lady and will she detest I for ever thinkest thou if i try she and succeed not -- take care -- take care jack -- seest thou not that thou warnest I that i do not try without resolve to conquer i must add that i have for some time be convince that i have do wrong to scribble to thee so freely as i have do -lrb- and the more so if i make the lady legally mine -rrb- for have not every letter i have write to thee be a bill of indictment against myself i may partly curse my vanity for it and i think i will refrain for the future for thou art really very impertinent a good man i own might urge many of the thing thou urgest but by my soul they come very awkwardly from thee and thou must be sensible that i can answer every tittle of what you writest upon the foot of the maxim we have long hold and pursue -- by the specimen above thou wilt see that i can and pr ` ythee tell I jack what but this that follow would have be the epitome of mine and my beloved 's story after ten year ' cohabitation have i never write to thee upon the subject and have i not be my own accuser ` robert lovelace a notorious woman-eater make he address in a honorable way to miss clarissa harlowe a young lady of the highest merit -- fortune on both side out of the question ` after encouragement give he be insult by she violent brother who think it he interest to discountenance the match and who at last challenging he be oblige to take he worthless life at he hand ` the family as much enraged as if he have take the life he give insult he personally and find out a odious lover for the young lady ` to avoid a forced marriage she be prevail upon to take a step which throw she into mr lovelace 's protection ` yet disclaim any passion for he she repeatedly offer to renounce he for ever if on that condition she relation will receive she and free she from the address of the man she hate ` mr lovelace a man of strong passion and as some say of great pride think himself under very little obligation to she on this account and not be naturally fond of marriage and have so much reason to hate she relation endeavor to prevail upon she to live with he what he call the life of honor and at last by stratagem art and contrivance prevail ` he resolve never to marry any other woman : take a pride to have she call by he name : a church-rite all the difference between they : treat she with deserve tenderness nobody question they marriage but those proud relation of she 's whom he wish to question it every year a charming boy fortune to support the increase family with splendor a tender father always a warm friend a generous landlord and a punctual paymaster now-and-then however perhaps indulge with a new object in order to bring he back with greater delight to he charming clarissa -- he only fault love of the sex -- which nevertheless the woman say will cure itself -- defensible thus far that he break no contract by he roving ' -- and what be there so very greatly amiss as the world go in all this let I aver that there be thousand and ten thousand who have worse story to tell than this would appear to be have i not interested thee in the progress to my great end and besides thou knowest that the character i give myself to joseph leman as to my treatment of my mistress be pretty near the truth \* \* see vol iii letter xlviii be i to be as much in earnest in my defense as thou art warm in my arraignment i could convince thee by other argument observation and comparison -lrb- be not all human good and evil comparative -rrb- that though from my ingenuous temper -lrb- write only to thee who art master of every secret of my heart -rrb- i be so ready to accuse myself in my narration yet i have something to say for myself to myself as i go along though no one else perhaps that be not a rake would allow any weight to it -- and this caution might i give to thousand who would stoop for a stone to throw at I : ` see that you own predominant passion whatever they be hurry you not into as much wickedness as mine do I see if ye happen to be better than i in some thing that ye be not worse in other and in point too that may be of more extensive bad consequence than that of seduce a girl -lrb- and take care of she afterwards -rrb- who from she cradle be arm with caution against the delusion of man ' and yet i be not so partial to my own folly as to think lightly of this fault when i allow myself to think another grave thing i will add now my hand be in : ` so dearly do i love the sex that have i find that a character for virtue have be generally necessary to recommend I to they i should have have a much greater regard to my moral as to the sex than i have have ' to sum all up -- i be sufficiently apprize that man of worthy and honest heart who never allow themselves in premeditated evil and who take into the account the excellency of this fine creature will and must not only condemn but abhor I be they to know as much of I as thou dost but methinks i would be glad to escape the censure of those man and of those woman too who have never know what capital trial and temptation be of those who have no genius for enterprise of those who want rather courage than will and most particularly of those who have only keep they secret better than i have keep or wish to keep mine be those exception to take place perhaps jack i should have ten to acquit to one that should condemn I have i not often say that human nature be a rogue \*\*\* i threaten above to refrain write to thee but take it not to heart jack -- i must write on and can not help it letter xv mr lovelace to john belford esq Wednesday night eleven o'clock faith jack thou hadst half undo I with thy nonsense though i would not own it on my yesterday 's letter : my conscience of thy party before -- but i think i be my own man again so near to execution my plot so near spring my mine all agree upon between the woman and I or i believe thou hadst overthrow I i have time for a few line preparative to what be to happen in a hour or two and i love to write to the moment we have be extremely happy how many agreeable day have we know together -- what may the next two hour produce when i part with my charmer -lrb- which i do with infinite reluctance half a hour ago -rrb- it be upon she promise that she would not sit up to write or read for so engaging be the conversation to I -lrb- and indeed my behavior throughout the whole of it be confessedly agreeable to she -rrb- that i insist if she do not directly retire to rest that she should add another happy hour to the former to have sit up write or read half the night as she sometimes do would have frustrate my view as thou wilt observe when my little plot unravel \*\*\* what -- what -- what now -- bound villain wouldst thou choke I -- i be speak to my heart jack -- it be then at my throat -- and what be all this for -- these shy woman how when a man think himself near the mark do they tempest he \*\*\* be all ready dorca have my beloved keep she word with I -- whether be these billowy heaving owe more to love or to fear i can not tell for the soul of I of which i have most if i can but take she before she apprehension before she eloquence be awake -- limb why thus convulse -- knee till now so firmly knit why thus relax why beat you thus together will not these tremble finger which twice have refuse to direct the pen fail I in the arduous moment once again why and for what all these convulsion this project be not to end in matrimony surely but the consequence must be greater than i have think of till this moment -- my beloved 's destiny or my own may depend upon the issue of the two next hour i will recede i think -- \*\*\* soft o virgin saint and safe as soft be thy slumber i will now once more turn to my friend belford 's letter thou shalt have fair play my charmer i will reperuse what thy advocate have to say for thee weak argument will do in the frame i be in -- but what what be the matter -- what a double -- but the uproar abate -- what a double coward be i -- or be it that i be take in a cowardly minute for hero have they fit of fear coward they brave moment and virtuous woman all but my clarissa they moment critical -- but thus coolly enjoy the reflection in a hurricane -- again the confusion be renew -- what where -- how come it be my beloved safe -- o wake not too roughly my beloved letter xvi mr lovelace to john belford esq Thursday morning five o'clock -lrb- June 8 -rrb- now be my reformation secure for i never shall love any other woman oh she be all variety she must ever be new to I imagination can not form much less can the pencil paint nor can the soul of painting poetry describe a angel so exquisitely so elegantly lovely -- but i will not by anticipation pacify thy impatience although the subject be too hallowed for profane contemplation yet shalt thou have the whole before thee as it pass : and this not from a spirit wantoning in description upon so rich a subject but with a design to put a bind to thy roving thought it will be iniquity greater than a lovelace be ever guilty of to carry they farther than i shall acknowledge thus then connect my last with the present i lead to it do thou not by the conclusion of my former perceive the consternation i be in just as i be about to reperuse thy letter in order to prevail upon myself to recede from my purpose of awake in terror my slumbering charmer and what dost think be the matter i 'll tell thee -- at a little after two when the whole house be still or seem to be so and as it prove my clarissa in bed and fast asleep i also in a manner undressed -lrb- as indeed i be for a hour before -rrb- and in my gown and slipper though to oblige thee write on -- i be alarm by a trample noise over head and a confused buz of mixed voice some louder than other like scolding and little short of scream while i be wonder what could be the matter down stair run dorca and at my door in a accent rather frightedly and hoarsely inward than shrilly clamorous she cry out fire fire and this the more alarmed I as she seem to endeavor to cry out louder but could not my pen -lrb- its last scrawl a benediction on my beloved -rrb- drop from my finger and up start i and make but three step to the door open it cry out where where almost as much terrify as the wench while she more than half undrest she petticoat in she hand unable to speak distinctly point up stair i be there in a moment and find all owe to the carelessness of mr sinclair 's cook-maid who have sit up to read the simple history of dorastus and faunium when she should have be in bed have set fire to a old pair of calico window-curtain she have have the presence of mind in she fright to tear down the half - burnt vallen as well as curtain and have get they though blaze into the chimney by the time i come up so that i have the satisfaction to find the danger happily over mean time dorca after she have direct I up stair not know the worst be over and expect every minute the house would be in a blaze out of tender regard for she lady -lrb- i shall for ever love the wench for it -rrb- run to she door and rap loudly at it in a recovered voice cry out with a shrillness equal to she love fire fire the house be on fire -- rise madam -- this instant rise -- if you would not be burn in you bed no sooner have she make this dreadful out-cry but i hear she lady 's door with hasty violence unbar unbolt unlock and open and my charmer 's voice sound like that of one go into a fit thou mayest believe that i be greatly affect i tremble with concern for she and hasten down faster than the alarm of fire have make I run up in order to satisfy she that all the danger be over when i have fly down to she chamber-door there i beheld the most charming creature in the world support herself on the arm of the gasp dorca sigh tremble and ready to faint with nothing on but a under petticoat she lovely bosom half open and she foot just slip into she shoe as soon as she see I she pant and struggle to speak but could only say o mr lovelace and down be ready to sink i clasp she in my arm with a ardor she never feel before : my dearest life fear nothing : i have be up -- the danger be over -- the fire be get under -- and how foolish devil -lrb- to dorca -rrb- could you thus by you hideous yell alarm and frighten my angel o jack how she sweet bosom as i clasped she to mine heave and pant i could even distinguish she dear heart flutter flutter against mine and for a few minute i fear she would go into fit lest the half-lifeless charmer should catch cold in this undress i lift she to she bed and sit down by she upon the side of it endeavor with the utmost tenderness as well of action as expression to dissipate she terror but what do i get by this my generous care of she and my successful endeavor to bring she to herself -- nothing -lrb- ungrateful as she be -rrb- but the most passionate exclamation : for we have both already forget the occasion dreadful as it be which have throw she into my arm : i from the joy of encircle the almost disrobed body of the loveliest of she sex she from the greater terror that arise from find herself in my arm and both seat on the bed from which she have be so lately fright and now belford reflect upon the distance at which the watchful charmer have hitherto keep I : reflect upon my love and upon my suffering for she : reflect upon she vigilance and how long i have lay in wait to elude it the awe i have stand in because of she frozen virtue and over-niceness and that i never before be so happy with she and then think how ungovernable must be my transport in those happy moment -- and yet in my own account i be both decent and generous but far from be affect as i wish by a address so fervent -lrb- although from a man from whom she have so lately own a regard and with whom but a hour or two before she have part with so much satisfaction -rrb- i never see a bitterer or more move grief when she come fully to herself she appeal to heaven against my treachery as she call it while i by the most solemn vow plead my own equal fright and the reality of the danger that have alarm we both she conjure I in the most solemn and affect manner by turn threaten and soothing to quit she apartment and permit she to hide herself from the light and from every human eye i besought she pardon yet could not avoid offend and repeatedly vow that the next morning 's sun should witness we espousal but take i suppose all my protestation of this kind as a indication that i intend to proceed to the last extremity she would hear nothing that i say but redouble she struggle to get from I in broken accent and exclamation the most vehement she protest that she would not survive what she call a treatment so disgraceful and villanous and look all wildly round she as if for some instrument of mischief she espy a pair of sharp-pointed scissors on a chair by the bed-side and endeavor to catch they up with design to make she word good on the spot see she desperation i begged she to be pacify that she would hear I speak but one word declare that i intend no dishonor to she : and have seize the scissors i throw they into the chimney and she still insist vehemently upon my distance i permit she to take the chair but o the sweet discomposure -- she bared shoulder and arm so inimitably fair and lovely : she spread hand cross over she charming neck yet not half conceal its glossy beauty : the scanty coat as she rise from I give the whole of she admirable shape and fine - turn would limb : she eye run over yet seem to threaten future vengeance : and at last she lip utter what every indignant look and glowing feature portend : exclaim as if i have do the worst i could do and vow never to forgive I wilt thou wonder if i resume the incense the already too-much-provoked fair-one i do and clasp she once more to my bosom : but consider the delicacy of she frame she force be amazing and show how much in earnest she be in she resentment for it be with the utmost difficulty that i be able to hold she : nor could i prevent she slide through my arm to fall upon she knee : which she do at my foot : and there in the anguish of she soul she streaming eye lift up to my face with supplicate softness hand fold dishevelled hair for she night head-dress have fall off in she struggle she charming tress fall down in naturally shine ringlet as if officious to conceal the dazzling beauty of she neck and shoulder she lovely bosom too heave with sigh and broken sob as if to aid she quivering lip in plead for she -- in this manner but when she grief give way to she speech in word pronounce with that emphatical propriety which distinguish this admirable creature in she elocution from all the woman i ever hear speak do she implore my compassion and my honor ` consider I dear lovelace ' -lrb- dear be she charming word -rrb- ` on my knee i beg you to consider I as a poor creature who have no protector but you who have no defense but you honor : by that honor by you humanity by all you have vow i conjure you not to make I abhor myself not to make I vile in my own eye '

keep that part of she promise which engage she to see I in the morning as if nothing have happen she would give the world i fancy to have the first interview over -- she have not best reproach I -- yet not to reproach I -- what a charming puzzle -- let she break she word with I at she peril fly I she can not -- no appeal lie from my tribunal -- what friend have she in the world if my compassion exert not itself in she favor -- and then the worthy captain tomlinson and she uncle harlowe will be able to make all up for I be my next offence what it may as to thy apprehension of she commit any

door and find it take up to tell she that i hope a answer to it before i go out she reply be verbal tell he that i care not whither he go nor what he do -- and this re-urged by dorca be all she have to say to I i look through the key-hole at my go by she door and see she on she knee at she bed 's foot she head and bosom on the bed she arm extend -lrb- sweet creature how i adore she -rrb- and in a

mowbray and mallory by whose aid i be to get the license i take papers out of my pocket to divert myself and thy last popt officiously the first into my hand i give it the honor of a re-perusal and this revive the subject with I with which i have resolve not to trust myself i remember that the dear creature in she torn answer to my proposal say condescension be not meanness she better know how to make this out than any mortal breathing condescension indeed imply dignity : and dignity ever be there in she condescension yet such a dignity as give grace to the condescension for there be no pride no insult no apparent superiority indicate by it -- this miss howe confirm to be a part of she general character \* \* see vol iv letter xxiii i can tell she how she might behave to make I she own for ever she know she can not fly I she know she must see I sooner or later the sooner the more gracious -- i would allow she to resent -lrb- not because the liberty i take with she require resentment be she not a clarissa but as it become she particular niceness to resent -rrb- : but would she show more love than abhorrence of I in she resentment would she seem if it be but to seem to believe the fire no device and all that follow merely accidental and descend upon it to tender expostulation and upbraid for the advantage i would have take of she surprise and would she at last be satisfy -lrb- as well she may -rrb- that it be attend with no further consequence and place some generous confidence in my honor -lrb- power love to be trust jack -rrb- i think i would put a end to all she trial and pay she my vow at the altar yet to have take such bold step as with tomlinson and she uncle -- to have make such a progress -- o belford belford how i have puzzle myself as well as she -- this curse aversion to wedlock how it have entangled I -- what contradiction have it make I guilty of how please to myself to look back upon the happy day i give she though mine would doubtless have be unmixedly so could i have determine to lay aside my contrivance and to be as sincere all the time as she deserve that i should be if i find this humor hold but till to-morrow morning -lrb- and it have now last two full hour and i seem methink to have pleasure in encourage it -rrb- i will make thee a visit i think or get thee to come to I and then will i -- consult thee upon it but she will not trust I she will not confide in my honor doubt in this case be defiance she love I not well enough to forgive I generously she be so greatly above I how can i forgive she for a merit so mortifying to my pride she think she know she have tell I that she be above I these word be still in my ear ` be go lovelace -- my soul be above thee man -- thou hast a proud heart to contend with -- my soul be above thee man ' \* miss howe think she above I too thou even thou my friend my intimate friend and companion art of the same opinion then i fear she as much as i love she -- how shall my pride bear these reflection my wife -lrb- as i have often say because it so often recur to my thought -rrb- to be so much my superior -- myself to be consider but as the second person in my own family -- canst thou teach I to bear such a reflection as this -- to tell I of my acquisition in she and that she with all she excellency will be mine in full property be a mistake -- it can not be so -- for shall i not be she 's and not my own -- will not every act of she duty -lrb- as i can not deserve it -rrb- be a condescension and a triumph over I -- and must i owe it merely to she goodness that she do not despise I -- to have she condescend to bear with my folly -- to wind I with a eye of pity -- a daughter of the harlowe thus to excel the last and as i have heretofore say not the meanest of the lovelace \*\* -- forbid it \* see vol iv letter xlvii \*\* see vol iii letter xviii yet forbid it not -- for do i not now -- do i not every moment -- see she before I all over charm and elegance and purity as in the struggle of the past midnight and in these struggle heart voice eye hand and sentiment so greatly so gloriously consistent with the character she have sustain from she cradle to the present hour but what advantage do i give thee yet have i not always do she justice why then thy tease impertinence however i forgive thee jack -- since -lrb- so much generous love be i capable of -rrb- i have rather all the world should condemn I than that she character should suffer the least impeachment the dear creature herself once tell I that there be a strange mixture in my mind \* i have be call devil and beelzebub between the two proud beauty : i must indeed be a beelzebub if i have not some tolerable quality \* see vol iii letter xxxiii but as miss howe say the suffering time of this excellent creature be she shine time \* hitherto she have do nothing but shine \* see vol iv letter xxiii she call I villain belford within these few hour and what be the sum of the present argument but that have i not be a villain in she sense of the word she have not be such a angel o jack jack this midnight attempt have make I mad have utterly undo I how can the dear creature say i have make she vile in she own eye when she behavior under such a surprise and she resentment under such circumstance have so greatly exalt she in mine whence however this strange rhapsody -- be it owe to my be here that i be not at sinclair 's but if there be infection in that house how have my beloved escape it but no more in this strain -- i will see what she behavior will be on my return -- yet already do i begin to apprehend some little sinking some little retrogradation : for i have just now a doubt arise whether for she own sake i should wish she to forgive I lightly or with difficulty \*\*\* i be in a way to come at the wished-for license i have now give every thing between my beloved and I a full consideration and my puzzle be over what have bring I to a speedier determination be that i think i have find out what she mean by the week 's distance at which she intend to hold I it be that she may have time to write to miss howe to put in motion that curse scheme of she 's and to take measure upon it which shall enable she to abandon and renounce I for ever now jack if i obtain not admission to she presence on my return but be refuse with haughtiness if she week be insist upon -lrb- such prospects before she -rrb- i shall be confirm in my conjecture and it will be plain to I that weak at best be that love which could give place to punctilio at a time when that all-reconciling ceremony as she must think wait she command : -- then will i recollect all she perverseness then will i re-peruse miss howe 's letter and the transcript from other of they give way to my aversion to the life of shackle : and then shall she be mine in my own way but after all i be in hope that she will have better consider of every thing by the evening that she threat of a week 's distance be throw out in the heat of passion and that she will allow that i have as much cause to quarrel with she for breach of she word as she have with I for breach of the peace these line of rowe have get into my head and i shall repeat they very devoutly all the way the chairman shall poppet I towards she by-and-by teach I some power the happy art of speech to dress my purpose up in gracious

should know it and i instantly cause a trusty friend to make what inquiry he could about tomlinson >> -rrb- i have thought to have do it before i have this intelligence : but not imagine it to be needful and little thinking that you could be in such a house and as you be please with you change prospects i >> -rrb- forbore and the rather forbore as the matter be so lay that mr hodge be suppose to know nothing of the project treaty of accommodation but on the contrary that it be design to be a secret to she and to every body but immediate party and it be mrs hodge that i have pro- pose to sound by a second hand >> -rrb- now my dear it be certain without apply to that too-much-favoured housekeeper that there be not such a man within ten mile of you uncle -- very true -- one tomkin there be about four mile off but he be a day-labourer : and one thompson about five mile distant the other way but he be a parish schoolmaster poor and about seventy >> -rrb- a man think but of # 800 a year can not come from one country to settle in another but every body in both must know it and talk of it >> -rrb- mr hodge may yet be sound at a distance if you will you uncle be a old man old man imagine themselves under obligation to they para - >> -rrb- mour if younger than themselves and seldom keep any thing from they knowledge but if we suppose he to make secret of this design treaty it be impossible before that treaty be think of but she must have see he at least have hear you uncle speak praisefully of a man he be say to be so intimate with let he have be ever so little a while in

be so much puzzle by what occur on both side of the que - >> -rrb- tion that i can not but abhor the devilish wretch whose invention and contrivance be for ever em - ploy a inquisitive head as mine be without afford the means of absolute detection but this be what i be ready to conjecture that tomlinson specious as he be be a machine of love - >> -rrb- lace and that he be employ for some end which have not yet be answer this be certain that not only tomlinson but mennell who i think attend you more than once at this vile house must know it to be a vile house what can you then think of tomlinson 's declar - ing himself in favor of it upon inquiry lovelace too must know it to be so if not before he bring you to it soon after >> -rrb- perhaps the company he find there may be the most probable way of accounting for he bearing with the house and for he strange suspension of marriage when it be in he power to call such a angel of a woman he -- >> -rrb- o my dear the man be a villain -- the greatest of villain in every light -- i be convince that he be -- and this doleman must be another of he implement >> -rrb- there be so many wretch who think that to be no sin which be one of the

that such design he have have if he still hold they or not i can have no doubt now that i know the house he have bring you to to be a vile one this be a clue that have lead I to account for all he behavior to you ever since you have be in he hand allow I a brief retrospection of it all we both know that pride revenge and a delight to tread in unbeaten path be principal ingredient in the

own family too that he >> -rrb- prefer he pride to he interest he be a declare marriage-hater a notorious intriguer full of he invention and glory in they : he never could draw you into declaration of

for the coldness and indifference of you behavior to he >> -rrb- the prevention of mischief be you first main view in the correspondence he draw you into he ought not then to have wonder that you declare you preference of the single life to any matrimonial engagement he know that this be always you >> -rrb- preference and that before he trick you away so artfully what be he conduct to you afterwards that you should of a sudden change it thus be you whole behavior regular con - sistent and dutiful to those to whom by birth you owe duty and neither prudish coquettish nor tyrannical to he

that you know of you own heart though not all of it that i find out that love have pretty early gain footing in it and this you yourself would have discover sooner than you >> -rrb- do have not he alarming he unpolite he rough conduct keep it under >> -rrb- i know by experience that love be a fire that be not to be play with without burn one 's finger : i know it to be a dangerous thing for two single person of different sex to enter into familiarity and correspondence with each other : since as to the latter must not a person be capable of premedus - tated art who can sit down to write and not write from the heart -- and a woman to write she heart to a man practice in deceit or even to a man of some character what advantage do it give he over she >> -rrb- as this man 's vanity have make he imagine that no woman could be proof against love when he address be honorable no wonder that he struggle like a lion hold in toil against a passion that he think not return and how could you at first show a return in love to so fierce a spirit and who have seduce you away by vile artifice but to the approval of those artifice >> -rrb- hence perhaps it be not difficult to believe that it become possible for such a wretch as this to give way to he old prejudice against marriage and to that revenge which have always be a first passion with he this be the only way i think to account for he horrid view in bring you to a vile house and now may not all the rest be naturally account for -- he delay -- he teasing way -- he bring you to bear with he lodging in the same house -- he make you

bring the little fury up though she could procure no other conveyance than she higgler 's pannier one for herself the other for she maid she know whither to come now many a little villain have i punish for know more than i would have she know and that by add to she knowledge and experience what thinkest thou belford if by get hither this virago and give cause for a lamentable letter from she to the fair fugitive i should be able to recover she would she not visit that friend in she distress thinkest thou whose intended visit to she in she 's bring she into the condition from which she herself have so perfidiously escape let I enjoy the thought shall i send this letter -- thou seest i have leave room if i fail in the exact imitation of so charming a hand to avoid too strict a scrutiny do they not both deserve it of I seest thou now how the rave girl threaten she mother ought she not to be punish and can i be a worse devil or villain or monster that she call I in the long letter i enclose -lrb- and have call I in she former letter -rrb- be i to punish they both as my vengeance urge I to punish they and when i have execute that my vengeance how charmingly satisfy may they both go down into the country and keep house together and have a much better reason than they pride could give they for live the single life they have both seem so fond of i will set about transcribe it this moment i think i can resolve afterwards yet what have poor hickman do to deserve this of I -- but gloriously would it punish the mother -lrb- as well as daughter -rrb- for all she sordid avarice and for she undutifulness to honest mr howe whose heart she actually break i be on tiptoe jack to enter upon this project be not one country as good to I as another if i should be oblige to take another tour upon it \*\*\* but i will not venture hickman be a good man they tell I i love a good man i hope one of these day to be a good man myself besides i have hear within this week something of this honest fellow that show he have a soul when i think if he have one that it lay a little of the deepest to emerge to notice except on very extraordinary occasion and that then it presently sink again into its cellulum adiposa -- the man be a plump man -- didst ever see he jack but the principal reason that withhold I -lrb- for ` tis a tempting project -rrb- be for fear of be utterly blow up if i should not be quick enough with my letter or if miss howe should deliberate on set out to try she mother 's consent first in which time a letter from my frighted beauty might reach she for i have no doubt wherever she have refuge but she first work be to write to she vixen friend i will therefore go on patiently and take my revenge upon the little fury at my leisure but in

naturally a confound sharp winter air and if a little cold water be throw into the path no wonder that it be instantly frozen and that the poor honest traveller find it next to impossible to keep he

before from under she parent ' wing -rrb- have she not be arm by a virago who be formerly very near show that she could better advise than practice but this i believe i have say more than once before i be loth to reproach myself now the cruel creature have escape I for what would that do but add to my torment since evil self-caused and avoidable admit not of palliation or comfort and yet if thou tellest I that all she strength be owe to my weakness and that i have be a cursed coward in this whole affair why then jack i may blush and be vex but by my soul i can not contradict thee but this belford i hope -- that if i can turn the poison of the enclosed letter into wholesome ailment that be to say if i can make use of it to my advantage i shall have thy free consent to do it i be always careful to open cover cautiously and to preserve seal entire i will draw out from this cursed letter a alphabet nor be nick rowe ever half so diligent to learn spanish at the quixote recommendation of a certain peer as i will be to gain the mastery of this vixen 's hand letter xxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Thursday evening June 8 after my last so full of other hope the contents of this will surprise you o my dearest friend the man have at last prove himself to be a villain it be with the utmost difficulty last night that i preserved myself from the vilest dishonor he extort from I a promise of forgiveness and that i would see he next day as if nothing have happen : but if it be possible to escape from a wretch who as i have too much reason to believe form a plot to fire the house to frighten I almost naked into he arm how could i see he next day i have escape -- heaven be praise that i have -- and now have no other concern than that i fly from the only hope that could have make such a husband tolerable to I the reconciliation with my friend so agreeably undertake by my uncle all my present hope be to find some reputable family or person of my own sex who be oblige to go beyond sea or who live abroad i care not whether but if i might choose in some one of we american colony -- never to be hear of more by my relation whom i have so grievously offend nor let you generous heart be move at what i write if i can escape the dreadfullest part of my father 's malediction -lrb- for the temporary part be already in a manner fulfil which make I tremble in apprehension of the other -rrb- i shall think the wreck of my worldly fortune a happy composition neither be there need of the renewal of you so-often-tendered goodness to I : for i have with I ring and other valuable that be send I with my clothes which will turn into money to answer all i can want till providence shall be please to put I into some want to help myself if for my further punishment my life be to be lengthen beyond my wish impute not this scheme my beloved friend either to dejection on one hand or to that romantic turn on the other which we have suppose generally to obtain with we sex from fifteen to twenty-two : for be pleased to consider my unhappy situation in the light in which it really must appear to every considerate person who know it in the first place the man who have endeavor to make I he property will hunt I as a stray : and he know he may do so with impunity for whom have i to protect I from he then as to my estate the envied estate which have be the original cause of all my misfortune it shall never be mine upon litigate term what be there in be enable to boast that i be worth more than i can use or wish to use and if my power be circumscribe i shall not have that to answer for which i should have if i do not use it as i ought : which very few do i shall have no husband of whose interest i ought to be so regardful as to prevent I do more than justice to other that i may not do less for he if therefore my father will be pleased -lrb- as i shall presume in proper time to propose to he -rrb- to pay two annuity out of it one to my dear mr norton which may make she easy for the remainder of she life as she be now grow into year the other of 50 # per annum to the same good woman for the use of my poor as i have the vanity to call a certain set of people concern whom she know all my mind that so as few as possible may suffer by the consequence of my error god bless they and give they heart 's ease and content with the rest other reason for my take the step i have hint at be these this wicked man know i have no friend in the world but you : you neighborhood therefore would be the first he would seek for I in be you to think it possible for I to be conceal in it : and in this case you might be subject to inconveniency greater even than those which you have already sustain on my account from my cousin morden be he to come i could not hope protection since by he letter to I it be evident that my brother have engage he in he party : nor would i by any means subject so worthy a man to danger as might be the case from the violence of this ungovernable spirit these thing consider what better method can i take than to go abroad to some one of the english colony where nobody but yourself shall know any thing of I nor you let I tell you presently nor till i be fix and -lrb- if it please god -rrb- in a course of live tolerably to my mind for it be no small part of my concern that my indiscretion have lay so heavy a tax upon you my dear friend to whom once i hope to give more pleasure than pain i be at present at one mr moore 's at hampstead my heart misgave I at come to this village because i have be here with he more than once : but the coach hither be so ready a conveniency that i know not what to do better then i shall stay here no longer than till i can receive you answer to this : in which you will be please to let I know if i can not be hide accord to you former contrivance -lrb- happy have i give into it at the time -rrb- by mr townsend 's assistance till the heat of he search be over the deptford road i imagine will be the right direction to hear of a passage and to get safely aboard o why be the great fiend of all unchained and permit to assume so specious a form and yet allow to conceal he foot and he talon till with the one he be ready to trample upon my honor and to strike the other into my heart -- and what have i do that he should be let loose particularly upon I forgive I this murmur question the effect of my impatience my guilty impatience i doubt : for as i have escape with my honor and nothing but my worldly prospects and my pride my ambition and my vanity have suffer in this wretch of my hopefuller fortune may i not still be more happy than i deserve to be and be it not in my own power still by the divine favor to secure the greatest stake of all and who know but that this very path into which my inconsideration have throw I strew as it be with brier and thorn which tear in piece my gaudier trappings may not be the right path to lead I into the great road to my future happiness which might have be endanger by evil communication and after all be there not still more deserving person than i who never fail in any capital point of duty than have be more humble than myself and some too by the error of parent and relation by the trick and baseness of guardian and trustee and in which they own rashness or folly have no part i will then endeavor to make the best of my present lot and join with I my best my only friend in pray that my punishment may end here and that my present affliction may be sanctify to I this letter will enable you to account for a line or two which i send to wilson 's to be carry to you only for a feint to get he servant out of the way he seem to be leave as i think for a spy upon I but he return too soon i be force to write a few line for he to carry to he master to a tavern near doctor common with the same view : and this happily answer my end i write early in the morning a bitter letter to the wretch which i leave for he obvious enough and i suppose he have it by this time i keep no copy of it i shall recollect the contents and give you the particulars of all at more leisure i be sure you will approve of my escape -- the rather as the people of the house must be very vile : for they and that dorca too do hear I -lrb- i know they do -rrb- cry out for help : if the fire have be other than a villanous plot -lrb- although in the morning to blind they i pretend to think it otherwise -rrb- they would have be alarm as much as i and have run in hear I scream to comfort I suppose my terror be the fire to relieve I suppose it be any thing else but the vile dorca go away as soon as she see the wretch throw he arm about I -- bless I my dear i have only my slipper and a under-petticoat on i be fright out of my bed by she cry of fire and that i should be burn to ash in a moment -- and she to go away and never to return nor any body else and yet i hear woman 's voice in the next room indeed i do -- a evident contrivance of they all : -- god be praise i be out of they house my terror be not yet over : i can hardly think myself safe : every well - dress man i see from my window whether on horseback or on foot i think to be he i know you will expedite a answer a man and horse will be procure I to-morrow early to carry this to be sure you can not return a answer by the same man because you must see mr townsend first : nevertheless i shall wait with impatience till you can have no friend but you to apply to and be such a stranger to this part of the world that i know not which way to turn myself whither to go nor what to do -- what a dreadful hand have i make of it mr moore at whose house i be be a widow and of good character : and of this one of she neighbor of whom i buy a handkerchief purposely to make inquiry before i would venture inform I i will not set my foot out of door till i have you direction : and i be the more secure have dropt word to the people of the house where the coach set I down as if i expect a chariot to meet I in my way to hendon a village a little distance from this and when i leave they house i walk backward and forward upon the hill at first not know what to do and afterwards to be certain that i be not watch before i ventured to inquire after a lodging you will direct for I my dear by the name of mr harriot luca have i not make my escape when i do i be resolve to attempt it again and again he be go to the common for a license as he write I word for i refuse to see he notwithstanding the promise he extort from I how hard how next to impossible my dear to avoid many lesser deviation when we be betray into a capital one for fear i should not get away at my first effort i have apprize he that i would not set eye upon he under a week in order to gain myself time for it in different way and be i so to have be watch as to have make it necessary i would after such a instance of the connivance of the woman of the house have run out into the street and throw myself into the next house i could have enter or claim protection from the first person i have meet -- woman to desert the cause of a poor creature of they own sex in such a situation what must they be -- then such poor guilty sort of figure do they make in the morning after he be go out -- so earnest to get I up stair and to convince I by the scorch window-board and burnt curtain and vallen that the fire be real -- that -lrb- although i seem to believe all they would have I believe -rrb- i be more and more resolve to get out of they house at all adventure when i begin i think to write but a few line but be my subject what it will i know not how to conclude when i write to you it be always so : it be not therefore owe peculiarly to that most interesting and unhappy situation which

my dear juggler 's letter to I the other inner letter send by will Thursday June 8 mr lovelace do not give I cause to dread you return if you would not that i should hate you for ever send I half a line by the bearer to assure I that you will not attempt to see I for a week to come i can not look you in the face without equal confusion and indignation the oblige I in this be but a poor atonement for you last night 's vile behavior you may pass this time in a journey to lord m 's and i can not doubt if the lady of you family be as favourable to I as you have assure I they be but that you will have interest enough to prevail with one of they to oblige I with they company after you baseness of last night you will not wonder that i insist upon this proof of you future honor if captain tomlinson come mean time i can hear what he have to say and send you a account of it but in less than a week if you see I it must be owe to a fresh act of violence of which you know not the consequence send I the request line if ever you expect to have the forgiveness confirm the promise of which you extort from the unhappy cl h \*\*\* now belford what canst thou say in behalf of this sweet rogue of a lady what canst thou say for she ` tis apparent that she be fully determine upon a elopement when she write it and thus would she make I of party against myself by draw I in to give she a week 's time to complete it and more wicked still send I upon a fool 's errand to bring up one of my cousin -- when we come to have the satisfaction of find she go off and I expose for ever -- what punishment can be bad enough for such a little villain of a lady but mind moreover how plausibly she account by this billet -lrb- suppose she should not find a opportunity of elope before i return -rrb- for the resolution of not see I for a week and for the bread and butter expedient -- so childish as we think it the chariot be not come and if it be it be yet too soon for every thing but my impatience and as i have already take all my measure and can think of nothing but my triumph i will resume she violent letter in order to strengthen my resolution against she i be before in too gloomy a way to proceed with it but now the subject be all alive to I and my gayer fancy like the sunbeam will irradiate it and turn the solemn deep-green into a brighter verdure when i have call upon my charmer to explain some part of she letter and to atone for other i will send it or a copy of it to thee suffice it at present to tell thee in the first place that she be determine never to be my wife -- to be sure there ought to be no compulsion in so material a case compulsion be she parent ' fault which i have censure so severely that i shall hardly be guilty of the same i be therefore glad i know she mind as to this essential point i have ruin she she say -- now that be a fib take it she own way -- if i have she would not perhaps have run away from I she be throw upon the wide world now i own that hampstead-heath afford very pretty and very extensive prospects but ` tis not the wide world neither and suppose that to be she grievance i hope soon to restore she to a narrower i be the enemy of she soul as well as of she honor -- confoundedly severe nevertheless another fib -- for i love she soul very well but think no more of it in this case than of my own she be to be throw upon stranger -- and be not that she own fault -- much against my will i be sure she be cast from a state of independency into one of obligation she never be in a state of independency nor be it fit a woman should of any age or in any state of life and as to the state of obligation there be no such thing as living without be beholden to somebody mutual obligation be the very essence and soul of the social and commercial life : -- why should she be exempt from it i be sure the person she rave at desire not such a exemption have be long dependent upon she and would rejoice to owe further obligation to she than he can boast of hitherto she talk of she father 's curse -- but have i not repay he for it a hundred fold in the same coin but why must the fault of other people be lay at my door have i not enow of my own but the grey-eyed dawn begin to peep -- let I sum up all in short then the dear creature 's letter be a collection of invective not very new to I : though the occasion for they no doubt be new to she a little sprinkling of the romantic and contradictory run through it she love and she hate she encourage I to pursue she by tell I i safely may and yet she beg i will not she apprehend poverty and want yet resolve to give away she estate to gratify whom -- why in short those who have be the cause of she misfortune and finally though she resolve never to be mine yet

expose herself to great danger by they for that there be rake every where -- -lrb- lovelace in every corner jack -rrb- and many about that town who would leave nothing unattempted to get into she

in weather so warm slouch and muffle up she withdraw shut the door without any emotion but it be not so with I for thou canst not imagine how my heart dance to my mouth at the very glimpse of she so that i be afraid the thump thump thump villain which have so lately thump as much to no purpose would have choke I i like the lodging well and the more as she say the third room be still handsomer i

also whether for board or not only please to take this for earnest put a guinea into she hand -- and one thing i will say my poor wife love money but be not a ill-natured woman she be a great fortune to I : but as the real estate go away at she death i would fain preserve she for that reason as well as for the love i bear she as a honest man but if she make too close a bargain with you tell I and unknown to she i will make it up this be my constant way : she love to have she pen ` orth and i would not have she vexed or make uneasy on any account she say i be a very considerate gentleman and upon the condition i have mention she be content to leave the term to my lady but madam can not a body just peep into the other apartment that i may be more particular to my wife in the furniture of it the lady desire to be private sir -- but -- and be go to ask she leave i catch hold of she arm -- however stay stay madam : it may not be proper if the lady love to be private do not let I intrude upon the lady -- no intrusion sir i dare say : the lady be good-humoured she will be so kind as to step down into the parlor i dare say as she stay so little a while i be sure she will not wish to stand in my way no madam that be true if she be good-humoured as you say -- have she be with you long madam she come but yesterday sir -- i believe i just now see the glimpse of she she seem to be a elderly lady no sir you be mistaken she be a young lady and one of the handsomest i ever see cot so i beg she pardon not but that i should have like she the better be she to stay longer if she have be elderly i have a strange taste madam you 'll say but i really for my wife 's sake love every elderly woman indeed i ever think age be to be reverence which make I -lrb- take the fortune into the scale too that i own -rrb- make my address to my present dear very good of you sir to respect age : we all hope to live to be old right madam -- but you say the lady be beautiful now you must know that though i choose to converse with the elderly yet i love to see a beautiful young woman just as i love to see fine flower in a garden there be no cast a eye upon she be there without she notice for in this dress and thus muffle up about my jaw i should not care to be see any more than she let she love privacy as much as she will i will go and ask if i may show a gentleman the apartment sir and as you be a married gentleman and not over young she 'll perhaps make the less scruple then like I she love elderly folk best perhaps but it may be she have suffer by young one i fancy she have sir or be afraid she shall she desire to be very private and if by description inquire after to be deny thou art a true woman goody moore think i good lack -- good lack -- what may be she story then i pray she be pretty reserve in she story : but to tell you my thought i believe love be in the case : she be always in tear and do not much care for company nay madam it become not I to dive into lady ' secret i want not to pry into other people 's affair but pray how do she employ herself -- yet she come but yesterday so you can not tell write continually sir these woman jack when you ask they question by way of information do not care to be ignorant of any thing nay excuse I madam i be very far from be a inquisitive man but if she case be difficult and not merely love as she be a friend of you 's i would give she my advice then you be a lawyer sir -- why indeed madam i be some time at the bar but i have long leave practice yet be much consult by my friend in difficult point in a pauper case i frequently give money but never take any from the richest you be a very good gentleman then sir ay madam we can not live always here and we ought to do what good we can -- but i hate to appear officious if the lady stay any time and think fit upon better acquaintance to let I into she case it may be a happy day for she if i find it a just one for you must know that when i be at the bar i never be such a sad fellow as to undertake for the sake of a paltry fee to make white black and black white : for what would that have be but to endeavor to establish iniquity by quirk while i rob the innocent you be a excellent gentleman sir : i wish -lrb- and then she sigh -rrb- i have have the happiness to know there be such a lawyer in the world and to have be acquaint with he come come mr moore i think you name be it may not be too late -- when you and i be better acquaint i may help you perhaps -- but mention nothing of this to the lady : for as i say i hate to appear officious this prohibition i know if goody moore answer the specimen she have give of she womanhood would make she take the first opportunity to tell be it to be necessary to my purpose that she should i appear upon the whole so indifferent about see the room or the lady that the good woman be the more eager i should see both and the rather as i to stimulate she declare that there be more require in my eye to merit the character of a handsome woman than most people think necessary and that i have never see six truly lovely woman in my life to be brief she go in and after a little while come out again the lady sir be retire to she closet so you may go in and look at the room then how my heart begin again to play its pug 's trick i hobble in and stump about and like it very much and be sure my wife would i begged excuse for sit down and ask who be the minister of the place if he be a good preacher who preach at the chapel and if he be a good preacher and a good liver too madam -- i must inquire after that : for i love but i must need say that the clergy should practice what they preach very right sir but that be not so often the case as be to be wish more 's the pity madam but i have a great veneration for the clergy in general it be more a satire upon human nature than upon the cloth if we suppose those who have the best opportunity to do good less perfect than other people for my part i do not love professional any more than national reflection -- but i keep the lady in she closet my gout make I rude then up from my seat stump i -- what do you call these window-curtain madam stuff-damask sir it look mighty well truly i like it better than silk it be warmer to be sure and much fitter for lodgings in the country especially for people in year the bed be in a pretty state it be neat and clean sir : that be all we pretend to ay mighty well -- very well -- a silk camblet i think -- very well truly -- i be sure my wife will like it but we would not turn the lady out of she lodgings for the world the other two apartment will do for we at present then stump towards the closet over the door of which hang a picture -- what picture be that -- oh i see a st cecilium a common print sir pretty well pretty well it be after a italian master -- i would not for the world turn the lady out of she apartment we can make shift with the other two repeat i louder still : but yet mumblingly hoarse : for i have as great regard to uniformity in accent as to my word o belford to be so near my angel think what a painful constraint i be under i be resolve to fetch she out if possible : and pretend to be go -- you can not agree as to any time mr moore when we can have this third room can you -- not that -lrb- whisper i loud enough to be hear in the next room not that -rrb- i would incommode the lady : but i would tell my wife when about -- and woman you know mr moore love to have every thing before they of this nature mr moore -lrb- say my charmer -rrb- -lrb- and never do she voice sound so harmonious to I : oh how my heart bound again it even talk to I in a manner for i think i hear as well as feel its unruly flutter and every vein about I seem a pulse mr moore -rrb- you may acquaint the gentleman that i shall stay here only for two or three day at most till i receive a answer to a letter i have write into the country and rather than be you hindrance i will take up with any apartment a pair of stair higher not for the world -- not for the world young lady cry i -- my wife as i love she should lie in a garret rather than put such a considerate young lady as you seem to be to the least inconveniency she open not the door yet and i say but since you have so much goodness madam if i could but just look into the closet as i stand i could tell my wife whether it be large enough to hold a cabinet she much value and ill have with she wherever she go then my charmer open the door and blaze upon I as it be in a flood of light like what one might imagine would strike a man who bear blind have by some propitious power be bless with he sight all at once in a meridian sun upon my soul i never be so strangely affect before i have much ado to forbear discover myself that instant : but hesitatingly and in great disorder i say look into the closet and around it there be room i see for my wife 's cabinet and it have many jewel in it of high price but upon my soul -lrb- for i could not forbear swearing like a puppy : habit be a cursed thing jack -- -rrb- nothing so valuable as a lady i see can be bring into it she start and look at I with terror the truth of the compliment as far as i know have take dissimulation from my accent i see it be impossible to conceal myself longer from she any more than -lrb- from the violent impulse of my passion -rrb- to forbear manifest myself i unbuttoned therefore my cape i pull off my flapt slouch hat i throw open my great coat and like the devil in milton -lrb- a odd comparison though -rrb- -- i start up in my own form divine touch would by the beam of she celestial eye more potent than ithuriel 's spear -- now belford for a similitude -- now for a likeness to illustrate the surprising scene and the effect it have upon my charmer and the gentlewoman -- but nothing be like it or equal to it the plain fact can only describe it and set it off -- thus then take it she no sooner see who it be than she give three violent scream and before i could catch she in my arm -lrb- as i be about to do the moment i discover myself -rrb- down she sink at my foot in a fit which make I curse my indiscretion for so suddenly and with so much emotion reveal myself the gentlewoman see so strange a alteration in my person and feature and voice and dress cry out murder help murder help by turn for half a dozen time run this alarm the house and up run two servant maid and my servant after they i cry out for water and hartshorn and every one fly a different way one of the maid as fast down as she come up while the gentlewoman run out of one room into another and by turn up and down the apartment we be in without mean or end wring she foolish hand and not know what she do up then come run a gentleman and he sister fetch and bring in by the maid who have run down and have let in a cursed crabbed old wretch hobble with he gout and mumble with he hoarse broken-toothed voice who be metamorphose all at once into a lively gay young fellow with a clear accent and all he tooth she would have it that i be neither more nor less than the devil and could not keep she eye from my foot expect no doubt every minute to see it discover itself to be cleave for my part i be so intent upon restore my angel that i regard nobody else and at last she slowly recover motion with bitter sigh and sob -lrb- only the whites of she eye however appear for some moment -rrb- i call upon she in the tenderest accent as i kneel by she my arm support she head my angel my charmer my clarissa look upon I my dearest life -- i be not angry with you i will forgive you my best beloved the gentleman and he sister know not what to make of all this : and the less when my fair-one recover she sight snatch another look at I and then again groan and faint away i throw up the closet-sash for air and then leave she to the care of the young gentlewoman the same notable miss rawlin who i have hear of at the flask : and to that of mr moore who by this time have recover herself and then retire to one corner of the room i make my servant pull off my gouty stocking brush my hat and loop it up into the usual smart cock i then stept to the closet to mr rawlin whom in the general confusion i have not much mind before -- sir say i you have a uncommon scene before you the lady be my wife and no gentleman 's presence be necessary here but my own i beg pardon sir if the lady be you wife i have no business here but sir by she concern at see you -- pray sir none of you if 's and but 's i beseech you : nor you concern about the lady 's concern you be a very unqualified judge in this cause and i beg of you sir to oblige I with you absence the woman only be proper to be present on this occasion add i and i think myself oblige to they for they care and kind assistance ` tis well he make not another word : for i find my choler begin to rise i could not bear that the finest neck and arm and foot in the world should be expose to the eye of any man living but mine i withdraw once more from the closet find she beginning to recover lest the sight of I too soon should throw she back again the first word she say look round she with great emotion be oh hide I hide I be he go -- oh hide I -- be he go sir say miss rawlin come to I with a air both peremptory and assure this be some surprising case the lady can not bear the sight of you what you have do be best know to yourself but another such fit will probably be she last it would be but kind therefore for you to retire it behove I to have so notable a person of my party and the rather as i have disoblige she impertinent brother the dear creature say i may well be concern to see I if you madam have a husband who love you as i love she you would not i be confident fly from he and expose yourself to hazard as she do whenever she have not all she way -- and yet with a mind not capable of intentional evil -- but mother-spoilt -- this be she fault and all she fault : and the more inexcusable it be as i be the man of she choice and have reason to think she love I above all the man in the world here jack be a story to support to the lady face to face too \* \* and here belford lest thou through inattention should be surprise at my assurance let I remind thee -lrb- and that thus by way of marginal observation that i may not break in upon my narrative -rrb- that this my intrepidity concerted -lrb- as i have from time to time acquaint thee -rrb- in apprehension of such a event as have fall out for have not the dear creature already pass for my wife before no less than four worthy gentleman of family and fortune \*\* and before mr sinclair and she household and miss partington and have she not agree to she uncle 's expedient that she should pass for such from the time of mr hickman 's application to that uncle \*\*\* and that the worthy capt tomlinson should be allow to propagate that belief : as he have actually report to two family -lrb- they possibly to more -rrb- purposely that it might come to the ear of jame harlowe and serve for a foundation for uncle john to build he reconciliation-scheme upon and canst thou think that nothing be mean by all this contrivance and that i be not still further prepare to support my story \*\* see vol iv letter iv towards the conclusion \*\*\* ibid letter xvi ibid indeed i little thought at the time that i form these precautionary scheme that she would ever have be able if willing to get out of my hand all that i hope i should have occasion to have recourse to they for be only in case i should have the courage to make the grand attempt and should succeed in it to bring the dear creature -lrb- and this out of tenderness to she for what attention do i ever yet pay to the grief the execration the tear of a woman i have triumph over -rrb- to bear I in she sight : to expostulate with I to be pacify by my plea and by my own future hope found upon the reconciliatory-project upon my reiterate vow and upon the captain 's assurance since in that case to forgive I to have go on with I for a week would have be to forgive I to have go on with I for ever and that have my eligible life of honor take place she trial would all have be then over : and she would have know nothing but gratitude love and joy to the end of one of we life for never would i never could i have abandon such a admirable creature as this thou knowest i never be a sordid villain to any of she inferior -- she inferior i may say -- for who be not she inferior you speak like a gentleman you look like a gentleman say miss rawlin -- but sir this be a strange case the lady see to dread the sight of you no wonder madam take she a little on one side nearer to mr moore i have three time already forgive the dear creature -- but this be jealousy -- there be a spice of that in it -- and of phrensy too -lrb- whisper i that it might have the face of a secret and of consequence the more engage they attention -rrb- -- but we story be too long i then make a motion to go to my beloved but they desire that i would walk into the next room and they would endeavor to prevail upon she to lie down i begged that they would not suffer she to talk for that she be accustom to fit and when in this way would talk of any thing that come uppermost : and the more she be suffer to run on the worse she be and if not keep quiet would fall into ravings : which might possibly hold she a week they promise to keep she quiet and i withdraw into the next room order every one down but mr moore and miss rawlin she be full of exclamation unhappy creature miserable ruin and undo she call herself wring she hand and beg they would assist she to escape from the terrible evil she should otherwise be make to suffer they preach patience and quietness to she and would have have she to lie down : but she refuse sink however into a easy chair for she tremble so she could not stand by this time i hope that she be enough recover to bear a presence that it behove I to make she bear and fear she would throw out something in she exclamation that would still more disconcert I i go into the room again o there he be say she and throw she apron over she face -- i can not see he -- i can not look upon he -- begone begone touch I not -- for i take she struggle hand beseech she to be pacify and assure she that i would make all up with she upon she own term and wish base man say the violent lady i have no wish but never to behold you more why must i be thus pursue and haunt have you not make I miserable enough already -- despoil of all succor and help and of every friend i be contented to be poor low and miserable so i may live free from you persecution miss rawlin stare at I -lrb- a confident slut this miss rawlin think i -rrb- : so do mrs moore i tell you so whisper say i turn to the woman shake my head with a face of great concern and pity and then to my charmer my dear creature how you rave you will not easily recover from the effect of this violence have patience my love be pacify and we will coolly talk this matter over : for you expose yourself as well as I : these lady will certainly think you have fall among robber and that i be the chief of they so you be so you be stamp she face still cover -lrb- she think of Wednesday night no doubt -rrb- and sigh as if she heart be break she put she hand to she forehead -- i shall be quite distract i will not my dearest love uncover you face you shall not look upon I since i be so odious to you but this be a violence i never think you capable of and i would have press she hand as i hold it with my lip but she draw it from I with indignation unhand I sir say she i will not be touch by you leave I to my fate what right what title have you to persecute I thus what right what title my dear -- but this be not a time -- i have a letter from captain tomlinson -- here it be -- offer it to she -- i will receive nothing from you hand -- tell I not of captain tomlinson -- tell I not of any body -- you have no right to invade I thus -- once more leave I to my fate -- have you not make I miserable enough i touch a delicate string on purpose to set she in such a passion before the woman as might confirm the intimation i have give of a phrensical disorder what a turn be here -- lately so happy -- nothing want but a reconciliation between you and you friend -- that reconciliation in such a happy train -- shall so slight so accidental a occasion be suffer to overturn all we happiness she start up with a tremble impatience she apron fall from she indignant face -- now say she that thou darest to call the occasion slight and accidental and that i be happily out of thy vile hand and out of a house i have reason to believe as vile traitor and wretch as thou art i will venture to cast a eye upon thee -- and oh that it be in my power in mercy to my sex to look thee first into shame and remorse and then into death this violent tragedy-speech and the high manner in which she utter it have its desire effect i look upon the woman and upon she by turn with a pity eye and they shake they wise head and beseech I to retire and she to lie down to compose herself this hurricane like other hurricane be presently allay by a shower she throw herself once more into she armed chair and begged pardon of the woman for she passionate excess but not of I : yet i be in hope that when compliment be stir i should have come in for a share indeed lady say i -lrb- with assurance enough thou ` lt say -rrb- this violence be not natural to my beloved 's temper -- misapprehension -- misapprehension wretch -- and want i excuses from thee by what a scorn be every lovely feature agitate then turn she face from I i have not patience o thou guileful betrayer to look upon thee begone begone with a face so unblushing how darest thou appear in my presence i think then that the character of a husband oblige I to be angry you may one day madam repent this treatment : -- by my soul you may you know i have not deserve it of you -- you know -- i have not do i know you have not -- wretch do i know -- you do madam -- and never do man of my figure and consideration -lrb- i think it be proper to throw that in -rrb- meet with such treatment -- she lift up she hand : indignation keep she silent but all be of a piece with the charge you bring against I of despoil you of all succor and help of make you poor and low and with other unprecedented language i will only say before these two gentlewoman that since it must be so and since you former esteem for I be turn into so rivet a aversion i will soon very soon make you entirely easy i will be go : -- i will leave you to you own fate as you call it and may that be happy -- only that i may not appear to be a spoiler a robber indeed let I know whither i shall send you apparel and every thing that belong to you and i will send it send it to this place and assure I that you will never molest I more never more come near I and that be all i ask of you i will do so madam say i with a dejected air but do i ever think i should be so indifferent to you -- however you must permit I to insist on you reading this letter and on you see captain tomlinson and hearing what he have to say from you uncle he will be here by-and-by do not trifle with I say she in a imperious tone -- do as you offer i will not receive any letter from you hand if i see captain tomlinson it shall be on he own account not on you 's you tell I you will send I my apparel -- if you would have I believe any thing you say let this be the test of you sincerity -- leave I now and send my thing the woman start -- they do nothing but stare and appear to be more and more at a loss what to make of the matter between we i pretend to be go from she in a pet but when i have get to the door i turn back and as if i have recollect myself -- one word more my dearest creature -- charming even in you anger -- o my fond soul say i turn half round and pull out my handkerchief -- i believe jack my eye do glisten a little i have no doubt but they do the woman pity I -- honest soul they show they have each of they a handkerchief as well as i so have thou not observe -lrb- to give a familiar illustration -rrb- every man in a company of a dozen or more obligingly pull out he watch when some one have ask what be o'clock -- as each man of a like number if one talk of he beard will fall to stroke he chin with he four finger and thumb one word only madam repeat i -lrb- as soon as my voice have recover its tone -rrb- i have represent to captain tomlinson in the most favourable light the cause of we present misunderstanding you know what you uncle insist upon and with which you have acquiesce -- the letter in my hand -lrb- and again i offer it to she -rrb- will acquaint you with what you have to apprehend from you brother 's active malice she be go to speak in a high accent put the letter from she with a open palm -- nay hear I out madam -- the captain you know have report we marriage to two different person it be come to you brother 's ear my own relation have also hear of it -- letter be bring I from town this morning from lady betty lawrance and miss montague here they be -lrb- i pull they out of my pocket and offer they to she with that of the captain but she hold back she still open palm that she might not receive they -rrb- reflect madam i beseech you reflect upon the fatal consequence with which this you high resentment may be attend ever since i know you say she i have be in a wilderness of doubt and error i bless god that i be out of you hand i will transact for myself what relate to myself i dismiss all you solicitude for I -- be i not my own mistress -- have you any title -- the woman stare -- -lrb- the devil stare ye think i -- can ye do nothing but stare -rrb- -- it be high time to stop she here i raise my voice to drown she 's -- you use my dearest creature to have a tender and apprehensive heart -- you never have so much reason for such a one as now let I judge for myself upon what i shall see not upon what i shall hear -- do you think i shall ever -- i dread she going on -- i must be hear madam -lrb- raise my voice still higher -rrb- -- you must let I read one paragraph or two out of this letter to you if you will not read it yourself -- begone from I man -- begone from I with thy letter what pretence hast thou for torment I thus what right -- what title -- dearest creature what question you ask -- question that you can as well answer yourself -- i can i will and thus i answer they -- still louder i raise my voice -- she be overborne -- sweet soul it would be hard thought i -lrb- and yet i be very angry with she -rrb- if such a spirit as thine can not be bring to yield to such a one as mine i lower my voice on she silence all gentle all intreative my accent my head bow -- one hand hold out -- the other on my honest heart -- for heaven 's sake my dearest creature resolve to see captain tomlinson with temper he would have come along with I but i be willing to try to soften you mind first on this fatal misapprehension and this for the same of you own wish for what be it otherwise to I whether you friend be or be not reconcile to we -- do i want any favor from they -- for you own mind 's sake therefore frustrate not captain tomlinson 's negociation that worthy gentleman will be here in the afternoon lady betty will be in town with my cousin montague in a day or two -- they will be you visiter i beseech you do not carry this misunderstanding so far as that lord m and lady betty and lady sarah may know it -lrb- how considerable this make I look to the woman -rrb- lady betty will not let you rest till you consent to accompany she to she own seat -- and to that lady may you safely intrust you cause again upon my pause a moment she be go to break out i like not the turn of she countenance nor the tone of she voice -- ` and thinkest thou base wretch ' be the word she do utter : i again raise my voice and drown she 's -- base wretch madam -- you know that i have not deserve the violent name you have call I word so opprobrious from a mind so gentle -- but this treatment be from you madam -- from you whom i love more than my own soul -- by that soul i swear that i do -- -lrb- the woman look upon each other -- they seem pleased with my ardor -- woman whether wife maid or widow love ardor : even miss howe thou knowest speak up for ardor \* -rrb- -- nevertheless i must say that you have carry matter too far for the occasion i see you hate I -- \* see vol iv letter xxix and xxxiv she be just go to speak -- if we be to separate for ever in a strong and solemn voice proceed i this island shall not long be trouble with I mean time only be please to give these letter a perusal and consider what be to be say to you uncle 's friend and what he be to say to you uncle -- any thing will i come into -lrb- renounce I if you will -rrb- that shall make for you peace and for the reconciliation you heart be so lately set upon but i humbly conceive that it be necessary that you should come into better temper with I be it but to give a favourable appearance to what have pass and weight to any future application to you friend in whatever way you shall think proper to make it i then put the letter into she lap and retire into the next apartment with a low bow and a very solemn air i be soon follow by the two woman mr moore withdraw to give the fair perverse time to read they : miss rawlin for the same reason and because she be send for home the widow besought she speedy return i join in the same request and she be ready enough to promise to oblige we i excused myself to mr moore for the disguise i have appear in at first and for the story i have invent i tell she that i hold myself oblige to satisfy she for the whole floor we be upon and for a upper room for my servant and that for a month certain she make many scruple and beg she might not be urge on this head till she have consult miss rawlin i consent but tell she that she have take my earnest and i hope there be no room for dispute just then miss rawlin return with a air of eager curiosity and have be tell what have pass between mr moore and I she give herself air of office immediately : which i humor plainly perceive that if i have she with I i have the other she wish if there be time for it and if it be not quite impertinent in she to desire it that i would give mr moore and she a brief history of a affair which as she say bear the face of novelty mystery and surprise for sometimes it look to she as if we be marry at other time that point appear doubtful and yet the lady do not absolutely deny it but upon the whole thought herself highly injured i say that we 's be a very particular case -- that be i to acquaint they with it some part of it would hardly appear credible but however as they seem hardly to be person of discretion i would give they a brief account of the whole and this in so plain and sincere a manner that it should clear up to they satisfaction every thing that have pass or might hereafter pass between we they sit down by I and throw every feature of they face into attention i be resolve to go as near the truth as possible lest any thing should drop from my spouse to impeach my veracity and yet keep in view what pass at the flask it be necessary although thou knowest my whole story and a good deal of my view that thou shouldst be apprize of the substance of what i tell they ' i give they in as concise a manner as i be able this history of we family fortune alliance antipathy she brother 's and mine particularly i aver the truth of we private marriage ' the captain 's letter which i will enclose will give thee my reason for that and besides the woman might have propose a parson to I by way of compromise ' i tell they the condition my spouse have make I swear to and to which she hold I in order i say to induce I the sooner to be reconcile to she relation ' i own that this restraint make I sometimes ready to fly out ' and mr moore be so good as to declare that she do not much wonder at it thou art a very good sort of woman mr moore think i as miss howe have actually detect we mother and might possibly find some way still to acquaint she friend with she discovery i think it proper to prepossess they in favor of mr sinclair and she two niece i say ` they be gentlewoman bear that they have not bad heart that indeed my spouse do not love they they have once take the liberty to blame she for she over-niceness with regard to I people i say even good people who know themselves to be guilty of a fault they have no inclination to mend be too often least patient when tell of it as they could less bear than other to be think indifferently of ' too often the case they own ` mr sinclair 's house be a very handsome house and fit to receive the first quality -lrb- true enough jack -rrb- mr sinclair be a woman very easy in she circumstance : -- a widow gentlewoman as you mr moore be -- let lodgings as you mr moore do -- once have better prospects as you mr moore may have have : the relict of colonel sinclair -- you mr moore might know colonel sinclair -- he have lodgings at hampstead ' she have hear of the name ` oh he be relate to the best family in scotland -- and he widow be not to be reflect upon because she let lodgings you know mr moore -- you know miss rawlin ' very true and very true -- and they must need say it do not look quite so pretty in such a lady as my spouse to be so censorious a foundation here think i to procure these woman 's help to get back the fugitive or they connivance at least at my do so as well as for anticipate any future information from miss howe i give they a character of that virago and intimate ` that for a head to contrive mischief and a heart to execute it she have hardly she equal in she sex ' to this miss howe it be mrs moore say she suppose that my spouse be so desirous to dispatch a man and horse by day-dawn with a letter she write before she go to bed last night propose to stay no longer than till she have receive a answer to it the very same say i i know she would have immediate recourse to she i should have be but too happy could i have prevent such a letter from pass or so to have it manage as to have it give into mr howe 's hand instead of she daughter 's woman who have live some time in the world know better than to encourage such skittish prank in young wife let I just stop to tell thee while it be in my head that i have since give will he cue to find out where the man live who be go with the fair fugitive 's letter and if possible to see he on he return before he see she i tell the woman ' i despair that it would ever be better with we while miss howe have so strange a ascendancy over my spouse and remain herself unmarried and until the reconciliation with she friend could be effect or a still happier event -- as i should think it who be the last male of my family and which my foolish vow and she rigor have hitherto ' -- here i stopt and look modest turn my diamond ring round my finger while goody moore look mighty significant call it a very particular case and the maiden fan away and primm would and pur would to show that what i have say need no farther explanantion ' i tell they the occasion of we present difference i avowed the reality of the fire but own that i would have make no scruple of break the unnatural oath she have bind I in -lrb- have a husband 's right on my side -rrb- when she be so accidentally fright into my arm and i blame myself excessively that i do not since she think fit to carry she resentment so high and have the injustice to suppose the fire to be a contrivance of mine ' nay for that matter mr moore say as we be marry and madam be so odd -- every gentleman would not -- and stopt there mr moore ` to suppose i should have recourse to such a poor contrivance say i when i see the dear creature every hour ' -- be not this a bold put jack a most extraordinary case truly cry the maiden fanning yet come in with she well-but 's -- and she sifting pray sir 's -- and she restraining enough sir 's -- fly from the question to the question -- she seat now-and-then uneasy for fear my want of delicacy should hurt she abundant modesty and yet it be difficult to satisfy she super-abundant curiosity ` my beloved 's jealousy -lrb- and jealousy of itself to female mind account for a thousand unaccountableness -rrb- and the imputation of she half-phrensy bring upon she by she father 's wicked curse and by the previous persecution she have undergo from all she family be what i dwelt upon in order to provide against what might happen ' in short ' i own against myself most of the offence which i do not doubt but she would charge I with in they hearing and as every cause have a black and white side i give the worst part of we story the gentlest turn and when i have do acquaint they with some of the contents of that letter of captain tomlinson which i leave with the lady i conclude with jame harlowe and of captain singleton or of any sailor-looking man ' this thou wilt see from the letter itself be necessary to be do here therefore thou mayest read it and a charming letter to my purpose wilt thou find it to be if thou givest the least attention to its contents to robert lovelace esq wedn June 7 dear sir although i be oblige to be in town to-morrow or next day at farthest yet i would not dispense with write to you by one of my servant -lrb- whom i send up before upon a particular occasion -rrb- in order to advertise you that it be probable you will hear from some of you own relation on you -lrb- suppose \* -rrb- nuptials one of the person -lrb- mr lilburne by name -rrb- to whom i hint my belief of you marriage happen to be acquaint with mr spurrier lady betty lawrance 's steward and -lrb- not be under any restriction -rrb- mention it to mr spurrier and he to lady betty as a thing certain and this -lrb- though i have not the honor to be personally know to she ladyship -rrb- bring on a inquiry from she ladyship to I by she gentleman who come to I in company with mr lilburne i have no way but to confirm the report -- and i understand that lady betty take it amiss that she be not acquaint with so desirable a piece of news from yourself \* what be between hook -lrb- -rrb- thou mayest suppose jack i sink upon the woman in the account i give they of the contents of this letter she ladyship it seem have business that call she to town -lrb- and you will possibly choose to put she right if you do it will i presume be in confidence that nothing may transpire from you own family to contradict what i have give out -rrb- -lrb- i have ever be of opinion that truth ought to be strictly adhere to on all occasion : and be concern that i have -lrb- though with so good a view -rrb- depart from my old maxim but my dear friend mr john harlowe would have it so yet i never know a departure of this kind a single departure but to make the best of it now allow I sir once more to beg the lady as soon as possible to authenticate the report give out -rrb- when both you and the lady join in the acknowledgement of you marriage it will be impertinent in any one to be inquisitive as to the day or week -lrb- and if as privately celebrate as you intend -lrb- while the gentlewoman with whom you lodge be properly instruct as you say they be and who shall actually believe you be marry long ago -rrb- who shall be able to give a contradiction to my report -rrb- and yet it be very probable that minute inquiry will be make and this be what render precaution necessary for mr jame harlowe will not believe that you be marry and be sure he say that you both live together when mr hickman 's application be make to mr john harlowe : and if you live together any time unmarried he infer from you character mr lovelace that it be not probable that you would ever marry and he leave it to he two uncle to decide if you even should be marry whether there be not room to believe that he sister be first dishonoured and if so to judge of the title she will have to they favor or to the forgiveness of any of she family -- i believe sir this part of my letter have best be keep from the lady young mr harlowe be resolve to find this out and to come at he sister 's speech likewise : and for that purpose set out to-morrow as i be well inform with a large attendance arm and mr solme be to be of the party and what make he the more earnest to find it out be this : -- mr john harlowe have tell the whole family that he will alter and new-settle he will mr antony harlowe be resolve to do the same by he for it seem he have now give over all thought of change he condition have lately be disappoint in a view he have of that sort with mr howe these two brother generally act in concert and mr jame harlowe dread -lrb- and let I tell you that he have reason for it on my mr harlowe 's account -rrb- that he younger sister will be at last more benefit than he wish for by the alteration intend he have already be endeavor to sound he uncle harlowe on this subject and want to know whether any new application have be make to he on he sister 's part mr harlowe avoid a direct answer and express he wish for a general reconciliation and he hope that he niece be marry this offend the furious young man and he remind he uncle of engagement they have all enter into at he sister 's go away not to be reconcile but by general consent mr john harlowe complain to I often of the uncontroulableness of he nephew and say that now that the young man have not any body of whose superior sense he stand in awe he observe not decency in he behavior to any of they and this make my mr harlowe still more desirous than ever of bring he younger niece into favor again i will not say all i might of this young man 's extraordinary rapaciousness : -- but one would think that these grasp man expect to live for ever ' i take the liberty but within these two hour to propose to set on foot -lrb- and offer my cover to -rrb- a correspondence between my friend and he daughter-niece as she still sometimes fondly call she she be mistress of so much prudence i say that i be sure she could better direct every thing to its desirable end than any body else could but he say he do not think himself entirely at liberty to take such a step at present and that it be best that he should have it in he power to say occasionally that he have not any correspondence with she or letter from she ` you will see sir from all this the necessity of keep we treaty a absolute secret and if the lady have mention it to she worthy friend miss howe i hope it be in confidence ' -lrb- and now sir a few line in answer to you 's of Monday last -rrb- -lrb- mr harlowe be very well pleased with you readiness to come into he proposal but as to what you both desire that he will be present at the ceremony he say that he nephew watch all he step so narrowly that he think it be not practicable -lrb- if he be inclinable -rrb- to oblige you : but that he consent with all he heart that i should be the person whom he have stipulate should be privately present at the ceremony on he part -rrb- -lrb- however i think i have a expedient for this if you lady continue to be very desirous of she uncle 's presence -lrb- except he should be more determine than he answer to I seem to import -rrb- of which i shall acquaint you and perhaps of what he say to it when i have the pleasure to see you in town but indeed i think you have no time to lose mr harlowe be impatient to hear that

want to see how you become you silken fetter : whether the charming yoke sit light upon you shoulder if with such a sweet yoke-fellow it do not my lord and my sister as well as i think that you will deserve a closer tie about you neck he lordship be very much displeased that you have not write he word of the day the hour the manner and every thing but i ask he how he can already expect any mark of deference or politeness from you he must stay i tell he till that sign of reformation among other appear from the influence and example of you lady : but that if ever you will be good for any thing it will be quickly see and o cousin what a vast vast journey have you to take from the dreary land of libertinism through the bright province of reformation into the serene kingdom of happiness -- you have need to lose no time you have many a weary step to tread before you can overtake those traveller who set out for it from a less remote quarter but you have a charming pole-star to guide you that be you advantage i wish you joy of it : and as i have never yet expect any highly complaisant thing from you i make no scruple to begin first but it be purely i must tell you in respect to my new cousin whose accession into we family we most heartily congratulate and rejoice in i have a letter from lady betty she command either my attendance or my sister 's to my cousin leeson 's she put lord m in hope that she shall certainly bring down with she we lovely new relation for she say she will not be deny he lordship be the willinger to let I be the person as i be in a manner wild to see she my sister have two year ago have that honor at sir robert biddulph 's so get ready to accompany we in we return except you lady have objection strong enough to satisfy we all lady sarah long to see she and say this accession to the family will supply to it the loss of she beloved daughter i shall soon i hope pay my compliment to the dear lady in person : so have nothing to add but that i be you old mad playfellow and cousin charlotte montague \*\*\* the woman have read the copy of these two letter i think that i might then threaten and swagger -- ` but very little heart have i say i to encourage such a visit from lady betty and miss montague to my spouse for after all i be tire out with she strange way she be not what she be and -lrb- as i tell she in you hearing lady -rrb- i will leave this plaguy island though the place of my birth and though the stake i have in it be very considerable and go and reside in france or italy and never think of myself as a married man nor live like one ' o dear say one that would be a sad thing say the other nay madam -lrb- turn to mr moore -rrb- -- indeed madam -lrb- to miss rawlin -rrb- -- i be quite desperate i can no longer bear such usage i have have the good fortune to be favor by the smile of very fine lady though i say it -lrb- and i look very modest -rrb- both abroad and at home -- -lrb- thou knowest this to be true jack -rrb- with regard to my spouse here i have but one hope left -lrb- for as to the reconciliation with she friend i leave i scorn they all too much to value that but for she sake -rrb- and that be that if it pleased god to bless we with child she might entirely recover she usual serenity and we might then be happy but the reconciliation she heart be so much set upon be now as i hint before entirely hopeless -- make so by this rash step of she 's and by the rash temper she be in since -lrb- as you will believe -rrb- she brother and sister when they come to know it will make a fine handle of it against we both -- affect as they do at present to disbelieve we marriage -- and the dear creature herself too ready to countenance such a disbelief -- as nothing more than the ceremony -- as nothing more -- hem -- as nothing more than the ceremony -- here as thou wilt perceive i be bashful for miss rawlin by she preparatory primness put I in mind that it be proper to be so -- i turn half round then face the fan-player and the matron -- you yourselve lady know not what to believe till now that i have tell you we story and i do assure you that i shall not give myself the same trouble to convince people i hate people from whom i neither expect nor desire any favor and who be determine not to be convinced and what pray must be the issue when she uncle 's friend come although he seem to be a truly worthy man it be not natural for he to say ` to what purpose mr lovelace should i endeavor to bring about a reconciliation between mr lovelace and she friend by means of she elder uncle when a good understanding be want between yourselve ' -- a fair inference mr moore -- a fair inference miss rawlin -- and here be the unhappiness -- till she be reconcile to they this cursed oath in she notion be bind the woman seem move for i speak with great earnestness though low -- and besides they love to have they sex and its favor appear of importance to we they shake they deep head at each other and look sorrowful : and this move my tender heart too ` tis a unheard-of case lady -- have she not prefer I to all mankind -- there i stop -- and that resume i feeling for my handkerchief be what stagger captain tomlinson when he hear of she flight who the last time he see we together see the most affectionate couple on earth -- the most affectionate couple on earth -- in the accent-grievous repeat i out then i pull my handkerchief and put it to my eye arise and walk to the window -- it make I weaker than a woman do i not love she as never man love he wife -lrb- i have no doubt but i do jack -rrb- there again i stopt and resume -- charming creature as you see she be i wish i have never behold she face -- excuse I lady traverse the room and have rub my eye till i suppose they red i turn to the woman and pull out my letter-case i will show you one letter -- here it be -- read it miss rawlin if you please -- it will confirm to you how much all my family be prepare to admire she i be freely treat in it -- so i be in the two other : but after what i have tell you nothing need be a secret to you two she take it with a air of eager curiosity and look at the seal ostentatiously coronet and at the superscription read out to robert lovelace esq -- ay madam -- ay miss that be my name -lrb- give myself a air though i have tell it to they before -rrb- i be not ashamed of it my wife 's maiden name -- unmarried name i should rather say -- fool that i be -- and i rub my cheek for vexation -lrb- fool enough in conscience jack -rrb- be harlowe -- clarissa harlowe -- you hear I call she my clarissa -- i do -- but think it to be a feigned or love-name say miss rawlin i wonder what be miss rawlin 's love-name jack most of the fair romancer have in they early womanhood choose love-name no parson ever give more real name than i have give fictitious one and to very good purpose : many a sweet dear have answer I a letter for the sake of own a name which she godmother never give she no -- it be she real name i say i bid she read out the whole letter if the spelling be not exact miss rawlin say i you will excuse it the writer be a lord but perhaps i may not show it to my spouse for if those i have leave with she have no effect upon she neither will this : and i shall not care to expose my lord m to she scorn indeed i begin to be quite careless of consequence miss rawlin who could not but be please with this mark of my confidence look as if she pity I and here thou mayest read the letter no iii \*\*\* to robert lovelace esq m hall wedn June 7 cousin lovelace i think you might have find time to let we know of you nuptials be actually solemnize i might have expect this piece of civility from you but perhaps the ceremony be perform at the very time that you ask I to be you lady 's father -- but i should be angry if i proceed in my guess -- and little say be soon amend but i can tell you that lady betty lawrance whatever lady sarah do will not so soon forgive you as i have do woman resent slight longer than man you that know so much of the sex -lrb- i speak it not however to you praise -rrb- might have know that but never be you before acquaint with a lady of such a amiable character i hope there will be but one soul between you i have before now say that i will disinherit you and settle all i can upon she if you prove not a good husband to she may this marriage be crown with a great many fine boy -lrb- i desire no girl -rrb- to build up again a family so antient the first boy shall take my surname by act of parliament that be my will lady betty and niece charlotte will be in town about business before you know where you be they long to pay they compliment to you fair bride i suppose you will hardly be at the lawn when they get to town because greme inform I you have send no order there for you lady 's accommodation pritchard have all thing in readiness for sign i will take no advantage of you slight indeed i be too much use to they -- more praise to my patience than to you complaisance however one reason for lady betty 's go up as i may tell you under the rose be to buy some suitable present for lady sarah and all of we to make on this agreeable occasion we would have blaze it away could we have have timely notice and think it would have be agreeable to all round the like occasion do not happen every day my most affectionate compliment and congratulation to my new niece conclude I for the present in violent pain that with all you heroicalness would make you mad you truly affectionate uncle m \*\*\* this letter clench would the nail not but that miss rawlin say she see i have be a wild gentleman and truly she think so the moment she behold I they begin to intercede for my spouse -lrb- so nicely have i turn the table -rrb- and that i would not go abroad and disappoint a reconciliation so much wish for on one side and such desirable prospects on the other in my own family who know thought i to myself but more may come of this plot than i have even promise myself what a happy man shall i be if these woman can be bring to join to carry my marriage into consummation lady you be exceedingly good to we both i should have some hope if my unhappily nice spouse could be bring to dispense with the unnatural oath she have lay I under you see what my case be do you think i may not insist upon she absolve I from this abominable oath will you be so good as to give you advice that one apartment may serve for a man and he wife at the hour of retirement -- -lrb- modestly put belford -- and let I here observe that few rake would find a language so decent as to engage modest woman to talk with he in upon such subject -rrb- they both simpered and look upon one another these subject always make woman simper at least no need but of the most delicate hint to they a man who be gross in a woman 's company ought to be knock down with a club : for like so many musical instrument touch but a single wire and the dear soul be sensible all over to be sure miss rawlin learnedly say playing with she fan a casuist would give it that the matrimonial vow ought to supercede any other obligation mr moore for she part be of opinion that if the lady own herself to be a wife she ought to behave like one whatever be my luck think i with this all-eyed fair-one any other woman in the world from fifteen to five-and-twenty would be mine upon my own term before the morning and now that i may be at hand to take all advantage i will endeavor say i to myself to make sure of good quarter i be you lodger mr moore in virtue of the earnest i have give you for these apartment and for any one you can spare above for my servant indeed for all you have to spare -- for who know what my spouse 's brother may attempt i will pay you to you own demand and that for a month or two certain -lrb- board include -rrb- as i shall or shall not be you hindrance take that as a pledge or in part of payment -- offer she a thirty pound bank note she decline take it desire she might consult the lady first add that she doubt not my honor and that she would not let she apartment to any other person whom she know not something of while i and the lady be here the lady the lady from both woman 's mouth 's continually -lrb- which still imply a doubt in they heart -rrb- : and not you spouse and you lady sir i never meet with such woman think i : -- so thoroughly convinced but this moment yet already doubt -- i be afraid i have a couple of skeptic to deal with i know no reason i say for my wife to object to my lodging in the same house with she here any more than in town at mr sinclair 's but be she to make such objection i would not quit possession since it be not unlikely that the same freakish disorder which bring she to hampstead might carry she absolutely out of my knowledge they both seem embarrassed and look upon one another yet with such a air as if they think there be reason in what i say and i declare myself she boarder as well as lodger and dinner-time approach be not deny to be the former letter xxv mr lovelace to john belford esq i think it be now high time to turn my whole mind to my beloved who have have full leisure to weigh the contents of the letter i have leave with she i therefore request mr moore to step in and desire to know whether she would be please to admit I to attend she in she apartment on occasion of the letter i have leave with she or whether she would favor I with she company in the dining-room mr moore desire miss rawlin to accompany she in to the lady they tap at the door and be both admit i can not but stop here for one minute to remark though against myself upon that security which innocence give that nevertheless have better have in it a greater mixture of the serpent with the dive for here heedless of all i could say behind she back because she be satisfy with she own worthiness she permit I to go on with my own story without interruption to person as great stranger to she as I and who as stranger to both might be suppose to lean to the side most injured and that as i manage it be to mine a dear silly soul think i at the time to depend upon the goodness of she own heart when the heart can not be see into but by its action and she to appearance a runaway a eloper from a tender a most indulgent husband -- to neglect to cultivate the opinion of individual when the whole world be govern by appearance yet what can be expect of a angel under twenty -- she have a world of knowledge : -- knowledge speculative as i may say but no experience -- how should she -- knowledge by theory only be a vague uncertain light : a will o ' the wisp which as often mislead the doubt mind as put it right there be many thing in the world could a moralizer say that would afford inexpressible pleasure to a reflect mind be it not for the mixture they come to we with to be graver still i have see parent -lrb- perhaps my own do so -rrb- who delight in those very quality in they child while young the natural consequence of which -lrb- too much indulge and encourage -rrb- make they as they grow up the plague of they heart -- to bring this home to my present purpose i must tell thee that i adore this charming creature for she vigilant prudence but yet i would not methink wish she by virtue of that prudence which be however necessary to carry she above the device of all the rest of the world to be too wise for mine my revenge my swear revenge be nevertheless -lrb- adore she as i will -rrb- uppermost in my heart -- miss howe say that my love be a herodian love \* by my soul that girl 's a witch i be half sorry to say that i find a pleasure in play the tyrant over what i love call it a ungenerous pleasure if thou wilt : softer heart than mine know it the woman to a woman know it and show it too whenever they be trust with power and why should it be think strange that i who love they so dearly and study they so much should catch the infection of they \* see letter xx of this volume letter xxvi mr lovelace to john belford esq i will now give thee the substance of the dialogue that pass between the two woman and the lady wonder not that a perverse wife make a listen husband the event however as thou wilt find justified the old observation that listner seldom hear good of themselves conscious of they own demerit if i may guess by myself -lrb- there be ingenuousness jack -rrb- and fearful of censure they seldom find themselves disappoint there be something of sense after all in these proverb in these phrase in this wisdom of nation mr moore be to be the messenger but miss rawlin begin the dialogue you spouse madam -- -lrb- devil -- only to fish for a negative or affirmative declaration -rrb- cl my spouse madam -- miss r mr lovelace madam aver that you be marry to he and beg admittance or you company in the dining-room to talk upon the subject of the letter he leave with you cl he be a poor wicked wretch let I beg of you madam to favor I with you company as often as possible while he be hereabouts and i remain here miss r i shall with pleasure attend you madam : but methink i could wish you would see the gentleman and hear what he have to say on the subject of the letter cl my case be a hard a very hard one -- i be quite bewildered-i know not what to do -- i have not a friend in the world that can or will help I yet have none but friend till i know that man miss r the gentleman neither look nor talk like a bad man -- not a very bad man as man go as man go poor miss rawlin think i and dost thou know how man go cl o madam you know he not he can put on the appearance of a angel of light but have a black a very black heart poor i -- miss r i could not have think it truly but man be very deceitful now-a-days now-a-day -- a fool -- have not she history-book tell she that they be always so mrs moore sighing i have find it so i be sure to my cost -- who know but in she time poor goody moore may have meet with a lovelace or a belford or some such vile fellow my little harum-scarum beauty know not what strange history every woman living who have have the least independence of will could tell she be such to be as communicative as she be but here be the thing -- i have give she cause enough of offence but not enough to make she hold she tongue cl as to the letter he have leave with I i know not what to say to they : but be resolve never to have any thing to say to he miss r if madam i may be allow to say so i think you carry matter very far cl have he be make a bad cause a good one with you madam -- that he can do with those who know he not indeed i hear he talk think not what he say and be indifferent about it -- but what account do he give of himself i be please to hear this to arrest to stop she passion think i in the height of its career be a charming presage then the busy miss rawlin fish on to find out from she either a confirmation or disavowal of my story -- be lord m my uncle do i court she at first with the allowance of she friend she brother except have i a rencounter with that brother be she so persecute in favor of a very disagreeable man one solme as to induce she to throw herself into my protection none of these be deny all the objection she could have make be stifle or keep in by the consideration -lrb- as she mention -rrb- that she should stay there but a little while and that she story be too long but miss rawlin would not be thus easily answer miss r he say madam that he could not prevail for marriage till he have consent under a solemn oath to separate bed while you family remain unreconciled cl o the wretch what can be still in he head to endeavor to pass these story upon stranger so no direct denial think i -- admirable -- all will do by-and-by miss r he have own that a accidental fire have frighten you very much on Wednesday night -- and that -- and that -- a accidental fire have frighten you -- very much frightened you -- last Wednesday night then after a short pause -- in short he own that he have take some innocent liberty which might have lead to a breach of the oath you have impose upon he and that this be the cause of you displeasure i would have be glad to see how my charmer then look -- to be sure she be at a loss in she own mind to justify herself for resent so highly a offence so trifling -- she hesitate -- do not presently speak -- when she do she wish that she -lrb- miss rawlin -rrb- might never meet with any man who would take such innocent liberty with she miss rawlin push further you case to be sure madam be very particular : but if the hope of a reconciliation with you own friend be make more distant by you leave he give I leave to say that ` tis pity -- ` tis pity -- -lrb- i suppose the maiden then primm would fann would and blush would -- ` tis pity -rrb- the oath can not be dispense with especially as he own he have not be so strict a liver i could have go in and kiss the girl cl you have hear he story mine as i tell you before be too long and too melancholy : my disorder on see the wretch be too great and my time here be too short for I to enter upon it and if he have any end to serve by he own vindication in which i shall not be a personal sufferer let he make himself appear as white as a angel with all my heart my love for she and the excellent character i give she be then plead cl specious seducer -- only tell I if i can not get away from he by some back way how my heart then go pit-a-pat to speak in the female dialect cl let I look out -- -lrb- i hear the sash lift up -rrb- -- whither do that path lead be there no possibility of get to a coach surely he must deal with some fiend or how could he have find I out can not i steal to some neighbouring house where i may be conceal till i can get quite away you be good people -- i have not be always among such -- o help I help I lady -lrb- with a voice of impatience -rrb- or i be ruin then pause be that the way to hendon -lrb- point i suppose -rrb- be hendon a private place -- the hampstead coach i be tell will carry passenger thither mr moore i have a honest friend at mill-hill -lrb- devil fetch she thought i -rrb- where if such be you determination madam and if you think yourself in danger you may be safe i believe cl any where if i can but escape from this man whither do that path lead out yonder -- what be that town on the right hand call mr moore highgate madam miss r on the side of the heath be a little village call north-end a kinswoman of mine life there but she house be small i be not sure she could accommodate such a lady devil take she too think i -- i imagine that i have make myself a better interest in these woman but the whole sex love plot -- and plotter too jack cl a barn a outhouse a garret will be a palace to I if it will but afford I a refuge from this man she sens think i be much livelier than mine -- what a devil have i do that she should be so very implacable i tell thee belford all i do : be there any thing in it so very much amiss such prospects of a family reconciliation before she too to be sure she be a very sensible lady she then espy my new servant walking under the window and ask if he be not one of mine will be on the look-out for old grime -lrb- so be the fellow call whom my beloved have dispatch to miss howe -rrb- and be tell that the man she see be my servant i see say she that there be no escape unless you madam -lrb- to miss rawlin i suppose -rrb- can befriend I till i can get farther i have no doubt

to he -- here they be -- be please to tell he that i wish he and lady betty and miss montague a happy meeting he never can want excuse to they for what have happen any more than pretence to those he

point you have acknowledge before those who know we better i would have whisper she about the treaty with she uncle and about the contents of the captain 's letter but retreat and with a reject hand keep thy distance man cry the dear insolent -- to thine own heart i appeal since thou evadest I thus pitifully -- i own no marriage with thee -- bear witness lady i do not and cease to torment I cease to follow I -- surely surely faulty as i have be i have not deserve to be thus persecute -- i resume therefore my former language : you have no right to pursue I : you know you have not : begone then and leave I to make the best of my hard lot o my dear cruel father say she in a violent fit of grief -lrb- fall upon she knee and clasp she uplifted hand together -rrb- thy heavy curse be complete upon thy devoted daughter i be punish dreadfully punish by the very wretch in whom i have place my wicked confidence by my soul belford the little witch with she word but more by she manner move I wonder not then that she action she grief she tear set the woman into the like compassionate manifestation have i not a cursed task of it the two woman withdraw to the further end of the room and whisper a strange case there be no phrensy here -- i just hear say the charming creature throw she handkerchief over she head and neck continue kneel she back towards I and she face hide upon a chair and repeatedly sob with grief and passion i take this opportunity to step to the woman to keep they steady you see lady -lrb- whisper -rrb- what a unhappy man i be you see what a spirit this dear creature have -- all all owe to she implacable relation and to she father 's curse -- a curse upon they all they have turn the head of the most charming woman in the world ah sir sir reply miss rawlin whatever be the fault of she relation all be not as it should be between you and she ` tis plain she do not think herself marry : ` tis plain she do not : and if you have any value for the poor lady and would not totally deprive she of she sens you have better withdraw and leave to time and cooler consideration the event in you favor she will compel I to this at last i fear miss rawlin i fear she will and then we be both undo : for i can not live without she she know it too well : and she have not a friend who will look upon she : this also she know we marriage when she uncle 's friend come will be prove incontestably but i be ashamed to think i have give she room to believe it no marriage : that be what she harp upon well ` tis a strange case a very strange one say miss rawlin and be go to say further when the angry beauty come towards the door say mr moore i beg a word with you and they both step into the dining-room i see she just before put a parcel into she pocket and follow they out for fear she should slip away and step to the stair that she might not go by I will cry i aloud -lrb- though i know he be not near -rrb- -- pray child to a maid who answer call either of my servant to I she then come up to I with a wrathful countenance : do you call you servant sir to hinder I between you from go where i please do not my dearest life misinterpret every thing i do can you think I so mean and unworthy as to employ a servant to constrain you -- i call he to send to the public-house or inn in this town to inquire after captain tomlinson who may have alight at some one of they and be now perhaps needlessly adjust he dress and i would have he come be he to be without clothes god forgive I for i be stab to the heart by you cruelty answer be return that neither of my servant be in the way not in the way say i -- whither can the dog be go o sir with a scornful air not far i 'll warrant one of they be under the window just now accord to order i suppose to watch my step -- but i will do what i please and go where i please and that to you face god forbid that i should hinder you in any thing that you may do with safety to yourself now i verily believe that she design be to slip out in pursuance of the closet-whispering between she and miss rawlin perhaps to miss rawlin 's house she then stept back to mr moore and give she something which prove to be a diamond ring and desire she -lrb- not whisperingly but with a air of defiance to I -rrb- that that might be a pledge for she till she defray she demand which she should soon find means to do have no more money about she than she might have occasion for before she come to a acquaintance 's mr moore would have decline take it but she would not be deny and then wipe she eye she put on she glove -- nobody have a right to stop I say she -- i will go -- whom should i be afraid of -- she very question charming creature testify she fear i beg pardon madam -lrb- turn to mr moore and courtesying -rrb- for the trouble i have give you -- i beg pardon madam to miss rawlin -lrb- courtesy likewise to she -rrb- -- you may both hear of I in a happier hour if such a one fall to my lot -- and god bless you both -- struggle with she tear till she sob -- and away be tripping i step to the door : i put it to and set my back against it take she struggle hand -- my dearest life my angel say i why will you thus distress I -- be this the forgiveness which you so solemnly promise -- unhand I sir -- you have no business with I you have no right over I you know you have not but whither whither my dearest love would you go -- think you not that i will follow you be it to the world 's end -- whither would you go well do you ask I whither i would go who have be the occasion that i have not a friend leave -- but god who know my innocence and my upright intention will not wholly abandon I when i be out of you power but while i be in it i can not expect a gleam of the divine grace or favor to reach I how severe be this -- how shockingly severe -- out of you presence my angry fair-one i can neither hope for the one nor the other as my cousin montague in the letter you have read observe you be my polar star and my guide and if ever i be to be happy either here or hereafter it must be in and by you she would then have open the door but i respectfully oppose she begone man begone mr lovelace say she

seem altogether distressed be ready to sink and force to lean against the wainscot as i kneel at she foot a stream of tear at last burst from she less indignant eye good heaven say she lift up she lovely face and clasped hand what be at last to be my destiny deliver I from this dangerous man and direct I -- i know not what to do what i can do nor what i ought to do the woman as i have own we marriage to be but half complete hear nothing in this whole scene to contradict -lrb- not flagrantly to contradict -rrb- what i have assert they believe they see in she return temper and stagger resolution a love for I which she indignation have before suppress and they join to persuade she to tarry till the captain come and to hear he proposal represent the danger to which she would be expose the fatigue she might endure a lady of she appearance unguarded unprotected on the other hand they dwell upon my declare contrition and on my promise for the performance of which they offer to be bind so much have my kneel humility affect they woman jack tacitly acknowledge the inferiority of they sex in the pride they take to behold a kneel lover at they foot she turn from I and throw herself into a chair i arise and approach she with reverence my dearest creature say i and be proceed but with a face glowing with conscious dignity she interrupt I -- ungenerous ungrateful lovelace you know not the value of the heart you have insult nor can you conceive how much my soul despise you meanness but meanness must ever be the portion of the man who can act vilely the woman believe we be likely to be on better term retire the dear perverse oppose they go but they see i be desirous of they absence and when they have withdraw i once more throw myself at she foot and acknowledge my offence implore she forgiveness for this one time and promise the most exact circumspection for the future it be impossible for she she say to keep she memory and forgive I what hadst thou see in the conduct of clarissa harlowe that should encourage such a insult upon she as thou didst dare to make how meanly must thou think of she that thou couldst presume to be so guilty and expect she to be so weak as to forgive thee i besought she to let I read over to she captain tomlinson 's letter i be sure it be impossible she could have give it the requisite attention i have give it the requisite attention say she and the other letter too so that what i say be upon deliberation and what have i to fear from my brother and sister they can but complete the ruin of my fortune with my father and uncle let they and welcome you sir i thank you have lower my fortune but i bless god that my mind be not sink with my fortune it be on the contrary raise above fortune and above you and for half a word they shall have the estate they envy I for and a acquittal from I of all the expectation from my family that may make they uneasy i lift up my hand and eye in silent admiration of she my brother sir may think I ruin to the praise of you character he may think it impossible to be with you and be innocent you have but too well justified they harshest censure by every part of you conduct but now that i have escape from you and that i be out of the reach of you mysterious device i will wrap myself up in mine own innocence -lrb- and then the passionate beauty fold she arm about herself -rrb- and leave to time and to my future circumspection the re-establishment of my character leave I then sir pursue I not -- good heaven -lrb- interrupt she -rrb- -- and all this for what -- have i not yield to you entreaty -lrb- forgive I madam -rrb- you could not have carry farther you resentment -- wretch be it not crime enough to give occasion for those entreaty wouldst thou make a merit to I that thou didst not utterly ruin she whom thou oughtest to have protect begone man -lrb- turn from I she face crimson over with passion -rrb- -- see I no more -- i can not bear thee in my sight -- dearest dearest creature if i forgive thee lovelace -- and there she stop -- to endeavor proceed she to endeavor by premeditation by low contrivance by cry of fire to terrify a poor creature who have consent to take a wretched chance with thee for life for heaven 's sake -- offer to take she repulse hand as she be fly from I towards the closet what hast thou to do to plead for the sake of heaven in thy favor -- o darkest of human mind then turn from I wipe she eye and again turn towards I but she sweet face half aside what difficulty hast thou involve I in that thou hadst a plain path before thee after thou hadst betray I into thy power -- at once my mind take in the whole of thy crooked behavior and if thou thinkest of clarissa harlowe as she proud heart tell she thou oughtest to think of she thou wilt seek thy fortune elsewhere how often hast thou provoke I to tell thee that my soul be above thee for heaven 's sake madam for a soul 's sake which it be in you power to save from perdition forgive I the past offence i be the greatest villain on earth if it be a premeditated one yet i presume not to excuse myself on you mercy i throw myself i will not offer at any plea but that of penitence see but captain tomlinson -- see but lady betty and my cousin let they plead for I let they be guarantee for my honor if captain tomlinson come while i stay here i may see he but as for you sir -- dearest creature let I beg of you not to aggravate my offence to the captain when he come let I beg of you -- what askest thou it be not that i shall be of party against myself that i shall palliate -- do not charge I madam interrupted i with villainous premeditation -- do not give such a construction to my offence as may weaken you uncle 's opinion -- as may strengthen you brother 's -- she fling from I to the further end of the room -lrb- she could go no further -rrb- and just then mr moore come up and tell she that dinner be ready and that she have prevail upon miss rawlin to give she she company you must excuse I mr moore say she miss rawlin i hope also will -- but i can not eat -- i can not go down as for you sir i suppose you will think it right to depart hence at least till the gentleman come whom you expect i respectfully withdraw into the next room that mr moore might acquaint she -lrb- i durst not myself -rrb- that i be she lodger and boarder as whisperingly i desire that she would and meeting miss rawlin in the passage dearest miss rawlin say i stand my friend join with mr moore to pacify my spouse if she have any new flight upon my have take lodgings and intend to board here i hope she will have more generosity than to think of hinder a gentlewoman from let she lodgings i suppose mr moore -lrb- whom i leave with my fair-one -rrb- have apprize she of this before miss rawlin go in for i hear she say while i withhold miss rawlin -- ` no indeed : he be much mistaken -- surely he do not think i will ' they both expostulate with she as i could gather from bit and scrap of what they say for they speak so low that i could not hear any distinct sentence but from the fair perverse whose anger make she louder and to this purpose i hear she deliver herself in answer to different part of they talk to she : -- ` good mr moore dear miss rawlin press I no further : -- i can not sit down at table with he ' they say something as i suppose in my behalf -- ' o the insinuate wretch what defense have i against a man who go where i will can turn every one even of the virtuous of my sex in he favor ' after something else say which i hear not distinctly -- ` this be execrable cunning -- be you to know he wicked heart he be not without hope of engage you two good person to second he in the vilest of he machination ' how come she -lrb- think i at the instant -rrb- by all this penetration my devil surely do not play I booty if i think he do i would marry and live honest to be even with he i suppose then they urge the plea which i hint to miss rawlin at go in that she would not be mr moore 's hindrance for thus she express herself -- ` he will no doubt pay you you own price you need not question he liberality but one house can not hold we -- why if it would do i fly from he to seek refuge among stranger ' then in answer to somewhat else they plead -- '' tis a mistake madam i be not reconcile to he i will believe nothing he say have he not give you a flagrant specimen of what a man he be and of what he be capable by the disguise you see he in my story be too long and my stay here will be but short or i could convince you that my resentment against he be but too well found ' i suppose that they plead for she leave for my dining with they for she say -- ' i have nothing to say to that : it be you own house mr moore -- it be you own table -- you may admit whom you please to it only leave I at my liberty to choose my company ' then in answer as i suppose to they offer of send she up a plate -- ' a bit of bread if you please and a glass of water that be all i can swallow at present i be really very much discompose saw you not how bad i be indignation only could have support my spirit -- ' i have no objection to he dine with you madam ' add she in reply i suppose to a farther question of the same nature -- ` but i will not stay a night in the same house where he lodge ' i presume miss rawlin have tell she that she would not stay dinner : for she say -- ` let I not deprive mr moore of you company miss rawlin you will not be displeased with he talk he can have no design upon you ' then i suppose they plead what i might say behind she back to make my own story good : -- ' i care not what he say or what he think of I repentance and amendment be all the harm i wish he whatever become of I ' by she accent she weep when she speak these last word they come out both of they wipe they eye and would have persuade I to relinquish the lodgings and to depart till she uncle 's friend come but i know better i do not care to trust the devil well as she and miss howe suppose I to be acquaint with he for find she out again if once more she escape I what i be most afraid of be that she will throw herself among she own relation and if she do i be confident they will not be able to withstand she affect eloquence but yet as thou ` lt see the captain 's letter to I be admirably calculate to obviate my apprehension on this score particularly in that passage where it be say that she uncle think not himself at liberty to correspond directly with she or to receive application from she -- but through captain tomlinson as be strongly imply \* \* see letter xxiv of this volume i must own -lrb- notwithstanding the revenge i have so solemnly vow -rrb- that i would very fain have make for she a merit with myself in she return favor and have owe as little as possible to the mediation of captain tomlinson my pride be concern in this : and this be one of my reason for not bring he with I -- another be that if i be oblige to have recourse to he assistance i should be better able -lrb- by visit without he -rrb- to direct he what to say or do as i should find out the turn of she humor i be however glad at my heart that mr moore come up so seasonably with notice that dinner be ready the fair fugitive be all in all she have the excuse for withdraw i have time to strengthen myself the captain have time to come and the lady to cool -- shakspeare advise well : oppose not rage whilst rage be in its force but give it way awhile and let it waste the rise deluge be not stopt with dam those it o'erbears and drown the hope of harvest but wisely manag would its divided strength be sluic would in channel and securely drain would : and when its force be spend and unsupply have the residue with mound may be restrain would and dry-shod we may pass the naked ford i go down with the woman to dinner mr moore send she fair boarder up a plate but she only eat a little bit of bread and drink a glass of water i doubt not but she would keep she word when it be once go out be she not a harlowe she seem to be enure herself to hardship which at the worst she can never know since though she should ultimately refuse to be oblige to I or -lrb- to express myself more suitable to my own heart -rrb- to oblige I every one who see she must befriend she but let I ask thee belford art thou not solicitous for I in relation to the contents of the letter which the angry beauty have write and dispatch away by man and horse and for what may be miss howe 's answer to it art thou not ready to inquire whether it be not likely that miss howe when she know of she saucy friend 's flight will be concern about she letter which she must know could not be at wilson 's till after that flight and so probably would fall into my hand -- all these thing as thou ` lt see in the sequel be provide for with as much contrivance as human foresight can admit i have already tell thee that will be upon the lookout for old grime -- old grime be it seem a gossip sottish rascal and if will can but light of he i 'll answer for the consequence for have not will be my servant upward of seven year letter xxvii mr lovelace -lrb- in continuation -rrb- we have at dinner besides miss rawlin a young widow-niece of mr moore who be come to stay a month with she aunt -- bevi she name very forward very lively and a great admirer of I i assure you -- hang smirkingly upon all i say and prepare to approve of every word before i speak : and who by the time we have half-dine -lrb- by the help of what she have collect before -rrb- be as much acquaint with we story as either of the other two as it behove I to prepare they in my favor against whatever might come from miss howe i improve upon the hint i have throw out above-stair against that mischief-making lady i represent she to be a arrogant creature revengeful artful enterprising and one who have she be a man would have swear and curse and commit rape and play the devil as far as i know : -lrb- i have no doubt of it jack -rrb- but who by advantage of a female education and pride and insolence i believe be personally virtuous mr bevi allow that there be a vast deal in education -- and in pride too she say while miss rawlin come with a prudish god forbid that virtue should be owe to education only however i declare that miss howe be a subtle contriver of mischief one who have always be my enemy : she motive i know not : but despise the man whom she mother be desirous she should have one hickman although i do not directly aver that she would rather have have I yet they all immediately imagine that that be the ground of she animosity to I and of she envy to my beloved : and it be pity they say that so fine a young lady do not see through such a pretended friend and yet nobody -lrb- add i -rrb- have more reason than she to know by experience the force of a hatred found in envy as i hint to you above mr moore and to you miss rawlin in the case of she sister arabellum i have compliment make to my person and talent on this occasion : which give I a singular opportunity of display my modesty by disclaim the merit of they with a no indeed -- i should be very vain lady if i think so while thus abuse myself and exalt miss howe i get they opinion both for modesty and generosity and have all the grace which i disclaimed throw in upon I besides in short they even oppress that modesty which -lrb- to speak modestly of myself -rrb- they praise create by disbelieve all i say against myself and truly i must need say they have almost persuade even I myself that miss howe be actually in love with I i have often be willing to hope this and who know but she may the captain and i have agree that it shall be so insinuated occasionally -- and what be thy opinion jack she certainly hate hickman and girl who be disengaged seldom hate though they may not love : and if she have rather have another why not that other I for be i not a smart fellow and a rake and do not you sprightly lady love you smart fellow and you rake and where be the wonder that the man who could engage the affection of miss harlowe should engage those of a lady -lrb- with she \* alas 's -rrb- who would be honor in be deem she second \* see letter xx of this volume where miss howe say alas my dear i know you love he nor accuse thou I of singular vanity in this presumption belford wert thou to know the secret vanity that lurk in the heart of those who disguise or cloke it best thou wouldst find great reason to acquit at least to allow for I : since it be generally the conscious over-fulness of conceit that make the hypocrite most upon he guard to conceal it yet with these fellow proudly humble as they be it will break out sometimes in spite of they cloke though but in self-denying compliment-begging self-degradation but now i have undervalue myself in apologize to thee on this occasion let I use another argument in favor of my observation that the lady generally prefer a rake to a sober man and of my presumption upon it that miss howe be in love with I : it be this : common fame say that hickman be a very virtuous a very innocent fellow -- a male-virgin i warrant -- a odd dog i always think he now woman jack like not novice two maidenhead meet together in wedlock the first child must be a fool be they common aphorism they be pleased with a love of the sex that be found in the knowledge of it reason good novice expect more than they can possibly find in the commerce with they the man who know they yet have ardor for they to borrow a word from miss howe \* though those ardor be generally owe more to the devil within he than to the witch without he be the man who make they the highest and most grateful compliment he know what to expect and with what to be satisfied \* see vol iv letter xxix and xxxiv then the merit of a woman in some case must be ignorance whether real or pretend the man in these case must be a adept will it then be wonder at that a woman prefer a libertine to a novice -- while she expect in the one the confidence she want she consider the other and herself as two parallel line which though they run side by side can never meet yet in this the sex be generally mistaken too for these sheepish fellow be sly i myself be modest once and this as i have elsewhere hint to thee \* have better enable I to judge of both sex \* see vol iii letter xxiii but to proceed with my narrative : have thus prepared every one against any letter should come from miss howe and against my beloved 's messenger return i think it proper to conclude that subject with a hint that my spouse could not bear to have any thing say that reflect upon miss howe and with a deep sigh add that i have be make very unhappy more than once by the ill-will of lady whom i have never offend the widow bevi believe that might very easily be will both without and within -lrb- for i intend he shall fall in love with widow moore 's maid and have save one hundred pound in my service at least -rrb- will be great help as thing may happen letter xxviii mr lovelace -lrb- in continuation -rrb- we have hardly dine when my coachman who keep a look-out for captain tomlinson as will do for old grime conduct hither that worthy gentleman attend by one servant both on horseback he alight i go out to meet he at the door thou knowest he solemn appearance and unblushing freedom and yet canst not imagine what a dignity the rascal assume nor how respectful to he i be i lead he into the parlor and present he to the woman and they to he i think it highly import I -lrb- as they might still have some diffidence about we marriage from my fair-one 's home-pushed question on that head -rrb- to convince they entirely of the truth of all i have assert and how could i do this better than by dialogue a little with he before they dear captain i think you long for i have have a terrible conflict with my spouse capt i be sorry that i be later than my intention -- my account with my banker -- -lrb- there be a dog jack -rrb- take I up longer time to adjust than i have foresee -lrb- all the time pull down and stroke he ruffle -rrb- : for there be a small difference between we -- only twenty pound indeed which i have take no account of the rascal have not see twenty pound of he own these ten year then have we between we the character of the harlowe family i rail against they all the captain take he dear friend mr john harlowe 's part with a not so fast -- not so fast young gentleman -- and the like free assumption he account for they animosity by my defiance : no good family have such a charming daughter would care to be defy instead of court : he must speak he mind : never be a double-tongued man -- he appeal to the lady if he be not right he get they on he side the correction i have give the brother he tell I must have aggravate matter how valiant this make I look to the woman -- the sex love we mettle fellow at they heart be that as it would i should never love any of the family but my spouse and want nothing from they i would not but for she sake have go so far as i have go towards a reconciliation this be very good of I mr moore say very good indeed miss rawlin good -- it be more than good it be very generous say the widow capt why so it be i must need say : for i be sensible that mr lovelace have be rudely treat by they all -- more rudely than it could have be imagine a man of he quality and spirit would have put up with but then sir -lrb- turn to I -rrb- i think you be amply reward in such a lady and that you ought to forgive the father for the daughter 's sake mr moore indeed so i think miss r so must every one think who have see the lady widow b a fine lady to be sure but she have a violent spirit and some very odd humor too by what i have hear the value of good husband be not know till they be lose she conscience then draw a sigh from she lovel nobody must reflect upon my angel -- a angel she be -- some little blemish indeed as to she over-hasty spirit and as to she unforgiving temper but this she have from the harlowe instigate too by that miss howe -- but she innumerable excellency be all she own capt ay talk of spirit there be a spirit now you have name miss howe -lrb- and so i lead he to confirm all i have say of that vixen -rrb- yet she be to be pity too look with meaning at I as i have already hint i have before agree with he to impute secret love occasionally to miss howe as the best means to invalidate all that might come from she in my disfavor capt mr lovelace but that i know you modesty or you could give a reason -- lovel look down and very modest -- i can not think so captain -- but let we call another cause every woman present could look I in the face so bashful be i capt well but as to we present situation -- only it may not be proper -- look upon I and round upon the woman lovel o captain you may say any thing before this company -- only andrew -lrb- to my new servant who attend we at table -rrb- do you withdraw : this good girl -lrb- look at the maid-servant -rrb- will help we to all we want away go andrew : he want not he cue and the maid seem pleased at my honor 's preference of she capt as to we present situation i say mr lovelace -- why sir we shall be all untwisted let I tell you if my friend mr john harlowe be to know what that be he would as much question the truth of you be marry as the rest of the family do here the woman perk up they ear and be all silent attention capt i ask you before for particulars mr lovelace but you decline give they -- indeed it may not be proper for I to be acquaint with they -- but i must own that it be past my comprehension that a wife can resent any thing a husband can do -lrb- that be not a breach of the peace -rrb- so far as to think herself justified for elope from he lovel captain tomlinson : -- sir -- i do assure you that i shall be offend -- i shall be extremely concern -- if i hear that word elope mention again -- capt you nicety and you love sir may make you take offence -- but it be my way to call every thing by its proper name let who will be offend -- thou canst not imagine belford how brave and how independent the rascal look capt when young gentleman you shall think proper to give we particulars we will find a word for this rash act in so admirable a lady that shall please you better -- you see sir that be the representative of my dear friend mr john harlowe i speak as freely as i suppose he would do if present but you blush sir -- i beg you pardon mr lovelace : it become not a modest man to pry into those secret which a modest man can not reveal i do not blush jack but deny not the compliment and look down : the woman seem delighted with my modesty : but the widow bevi be more inclined to laugh at I than praise I for it capt whatever be the cause of this step -lrb- i will not again sir call it elopement since that harsh word wound you tenderness -rrb- i can not but express my surprise upon it when i recollect the affectionate behavior to which i be witness between you when i attend you last over-love sir i think you once mention -- but over-love -lrb- smile -rrb- give I leave to say sir it be a odd cause of quarrel -- few lady -- lovel dear captain -- and i try to blush the woman also try and be more use to it succeed better -- mr bevis indeed have a red-hot countenance and always blush miss r it signify nothing to mince the matter : but the lady above as good as deny she marriage you know sir that she do turn to I capt deny she marriage heaven how then have i impose upon my dear friend mr john harlowe lovel poor dear -- but let not she veracity be call into question she would not be guilty of a wilful untruth for the world then i have all they praise again lovel dear creature -- she think she have reason for she denial you know mr moore you know miss rawlin what i own to you above as my vow i look down and as once before turn round my diamond ring mr moore look awry and with a leer at miss rawlin as to she partner in the hinted-at reference miss rawlin look down as well as i she eyelid half close as if mumble a pater-noster meditate she snuff-box the distance between she nose and chin lengthen by a close-shut mouth she put I in mind of the pious mr fetherstone at oxford whom i point out to thee once among other grotesque figure at st mary 's church whither we go to take a view of she two sister : she eye shut not daring to trust she heart with they open and but just half-rearing she lid to see who the next comer be and fall they again when she curiosity be satisfy the widow bevi gaze as if on the hunt for a secret the captain look archly as if half in the possession of one mr moore at last break the bashful silence mr lovelace 's behavior she say could be no otherwise so well account for as by the ill office of that miss howe and by the severity of she relation which might but too probably have affect she head a little at time : add that it be very generous in I to give way to the storm when it be up rather than to exasperate at such a time but let I tell you sir say the widow bevi that be not what one husband in a thousand would have do i desire that no part of this conversation might be hint to my spouse and look still more bashfully she great fault i must own be over-delicacy the captain leer round he and say he believe he could guess from the hint i have give he in town -lrb- of my over-love -rrb- and from what have now pass that we have not consummate we marriage o jack how sheepishly then look or endeavor to look thy friend how primly goody moore how affectedly miss rawlin -- while the honest widow bevi gaze around she fearless and though only simper with she mouth she eye laugh outright and seem to challenge a laugh from every eye in the company he observe that i be a phoenix of a man if so and he could not but hope that all matter would be happily accommodate in a day or two and that then he should have the pleasure to aver to she uncle that he be present as he might say on we wedding-day the woman seem all to join in the same hope ah captain ah lady how happy should

true : how should she say mrs bevis proud of know -- nothing but for she part she desire no present it be enough if she could contribute to reconcile man and wife and disappoint mischief-maker she

have be no imitate it for such a length she delicate and even mind be see in the very cut of she letter miss howe 's hand be no bad one but it be not so equal and regular that little devil 's natural impatience hurry on she finger give i suppose from the begin she handwriting as well as the rest of she its fit and start and those peculiarity which like strong muscular line in a face neither the pen nor the pencil can miss hast thou a mind tot see what it be i permit miss howe to write to she lovely friend why then read it here so extract from she be of Wednesday last with a few addition of my own the addition underscore \* \* editor 's note : in place of italics as in the original i have substitute hook -lrb- -rrb- my dearest friend you will perhaps think that i have be too long silent but i have begin two letter at different time since my last and write a great deal each time and with spirit enough i assure you incense as i be against the abominable wretch you be with particularly on read you 's of the 21st of the past month the first i intend to keep open till i could give you some account of my proceedings with mr townsend it be some day before i see she : and this intervenient space give I time to reperuse what i have write i think it proper to lay that aside and to write in a style a little less fervent for you would have blame I i know for the freedom of some of my expression -lrb- execration if you please -rrb- and when i have go a good way in the second and change you prospects on he communicate to you miss montague 's letter and he better behavior occasion a change in you mind i lay that aside also and in this uncertainty think i would wait to see the issue of affair between you before i write again believe that all would soon be decide one way or other \*\*\* -lrb- here i be force to break off i be too little my own mistress : -- my mother \* be always up and down -- and watch as if i be write to a fellow what need i -lrb- she ask I -rrb- lock myself in \*\* if i be only read past correspondency for that be my pretence when she come poke in with she face sharpen to a edge as i may say by a curiosity that give she more pain than pleasure -- the lord forgive I but i believe i shall huff she next time she come in -rrb- \* see letter xx of this volume \*\* ibid \*\*\* do you forgive I too my dear -- my mother ought because she say i be my father 's girl and because i be sure i be she 's -lrb- upon my life my dear i be sometimes of opinion that this vile man be capable of mean you dishonor when i look back upon he past conduct i can not help and verily believe that he have lay aside such thought my reason for both opinion i will give you -rrb- -lrb- for the first : to-wit that he have it once in he head to take you at advantage if he could i consider \* that -rrb- pride revenge and a delight to tread in unbeaten path be principal ingredient in the character of this finish libertine he hate all you family yourself except -- yet be a savage in love he pride and the credit which a few plausible quality sprinkle among he odious one have give he have secure he too good a reception from we eye-judging we undistinguish we self -- flattering we too-confiding sex to make assiduity and obsequiousness and a conquest of he unruly passion any part of he study he have some reason for he animosity to all the man and to one woman of you family he have always show you and he own family too that he prefer he pride to he interest he be a declare marriage-hater a notorious intriguer full of he invention and glory in they -- as he vanity have make he imagine that no woman could be proof against he love no wonder that he struggle like a lion hold in toil \* against a passion that he think not return \*\* hence perhaps it be not difficult to believe that it become possible for such a wretch as this to give way to he old prejudice against marriage and to that revenge which have always be a first passion with he \*\*\* \* see letter xx of this volume \*\* ibid \*\*\* ibid -lrb- and hence we may account for -rrb- he delay -- he teasing way -- he bring you to bear with he lodging in the same house -- he make you pass to the other people of it as he wife -- he bring you into the company of he libertine companion -- the attempt of impose upon you that miss partington for a bedfellow & c -lrb- my reason for a contrary opinion to wit that he be now resolve to do you all the justice in he power to do you -rrb- be these : -- that he see that all he own family \* have warmly engage themselves in you cause : that the horrid wretch love you with such a love however as herod love he mariamne : that on inquiry i find it to be true that counsellor william -lrb- whom mr hickman know to be a man of eminence in he profession -rrb- have actually as good as finish the settlement : that two draught of they have be make one avowedly to be send to this very captain tomlinson : -- and i find that a license have actually be more than once endeavor to be obtain and that difficulty have hitherto be make equally to lovelace 's vexation and disappointment my mother 's proctor who be very intimate with the proctor apply to by the wretch have come at this information in confidence and hint that as mr lovelace be a man of high fortune these difficulty will probably be get over \* see letter xx of this volume -lrb- i have once resolve to make strict inquiry about tomlinson and still if you will you uncle 's favorite housekeeper may be sound at a distance -rrb- -lrb- i know that the matter be so lay \* -rrb- that mr hodge be suppose to know nothing of the treaty set on foot by means of captain tomlinson but you uncle be a -- \* see letter xx of this volume but you uncle be a old man \* and old man imagine themselves to be under obligation to they paramour if younger than themselves and seldom keep any thing from they knowledge -- yet methink there can be no need since tomlinson as you describe he be so good a man and so much of a gentleman the end to be answer by he be a impostor so much more than necessary if lovelace have villany in he head -- and thus what he communicate to you of mr hickman 's application to you uncle and of mr norton 's to you mother -lrb- some of which particulars i be satisfied he vile agent joseph leman could not reveal to he viler employer -rrb- he push on the marriage-day in the name of you uncle which it could not answer any wicked purpose for he to do and what he write of you uncle 's proposal to have it think that you be marry from the time that you have live in one house together and that to be make to agree with the time of mr hickman 's visit to you uncle the insist on a trusty person 's be present at the ceremony at that uncle 's nomination -- these thing make I -lrb- assure that he now at last means honourably -rrb- \* see letter xx of this volume -lrb- but if any unexpected delay should happen on he side acquaint I my dear with the very street where mr sinclair life and where mr fretchville 's house be situate -lrb- which i can not find that you have ever mention in you former letter -- which be a little odd -rrb- and i will make strict inquiry of they and of tomlinson too and i will -lrb- if you heart will let you take my advice -rrb- soon procure you a refuge from he with mr townsend -rrb- -lrb- but why do i now when you seem to be in so good a train puzzle and perplex you with my retrospection and yet they may be of use to you if any delay happen on he part -rrb- -lrb- but that i think can not well be what you have therefore now to do be so to behave to this proud-spirited wretch as may banish from he mind all remembrance of -rrb- past disobligation \* and to receive he address as those of a betrothed lover you will incur the censure of prudery and affectation if you keep he at that distance which you have hitherto -lrb- keep he at -rrb- he sudden -lrb- and as suddenly recover -rrb- illness have give he a opportunity to find out that you love he -lrb- alas my dear i know you love he -rrb- he have seem to change he nature and be all love and gentleness -lrb- and no more quarrel now i beseech you -rrb- \* see letter xx of this volume -lrb- i be very angry with he nevertheless for the freedom which he take with you person \* and i think some guard be necessary as he be certainly a encroacher but indeed all man be so and you be such a charming creature and have keep he at such a distance -- but no more of this subject only my dear be not over-nice now you be so near the state you see what difficulty you lay yourself under -rrb- when tomlinson 's letter call you again into -lrb- the wretch 's -rrb- company \* see letter xi of this volume if you meet with no impediment no new cause of doubt \* you reputation in the eye of the world be concern that you should be he -lrb- and as you uncle rightly judge be think to have be he before now -rrb- and yet -lrb- let I tell you -rrb- i -lrb- can hardly -rrb- bear -lrb- to think -rrb- that these libertine should be reward for they villany with the best of the sex when the worst of it be too good for they \* see letter xx of this volume i shall send this long letter by collin \* who change he day to oblige I as none of we letter by wilson 's conveyance have miscarry when you have be in more apparently-disagreeable situation than you be in at present -lrb- i have no doubt -rrb- that this will go safe \* see letter xx of this volume miss lardner \* -lrb- whom you have see hat she cousin biddulph 's -rrb- see you

fashion : -lrb- and what make I mention this be that perhaps you will have a visit from she or message at least -rrb- \* see letter xx of this volume -lrb- so that you have mr doleman 's testimony to the credit of the house and people you be with and he be -rrb- a man of fortune and some reputation formerly a rake indeed but marry to a woman of family and have have a palsy blow one would think a penitent \* you have -lrb- also mr mennell 's at least passive testimony mr -rrb- tomlinson 's -lrb- and now lastly miss lardner 's so that there will be the less need for inquiry : but you know my busy and inquisitive temper as well as my affection for you and my concern for you honor but all doubt will soon be lose in certainty -rrb- -lrb- nevertheless i must add that i would have you -rrb- command I up if i can be of the least service or pleasure to you \* i value not fame i value not censure nor even life itself i verily think as i do you honor and you friendship -- for be not you

hard -lrb- and yet i may thank myself -rrb- to be put to all this plague and trouble : -- and for what dost thou ask -- o jack for a triumph of more value to I beforehand than a imperial crown -- do

let pass of she 's have reason to rejoice in the thought that it fall not into my hand and now must all my contrivance be set at work to intercept the expected letter from miss howe : which be as i suppose to direct she to a place of safety and out of my knowledge mr townsend be no doubt in this case to smuggle she off : i hope the villain as i be so frequently call between these two girl will

in she opinion she would have to get clear off without my knowledge assure she that she could be no where more safe than with she till she have fix whither to go and the lady herself recollect that if she go she might miss the expected letter from she dear friend miss howe which as she own be to direct she future step she must also surely have some curiosity to know what she uncle 's friend have to say to she from she uncle contemptuously as she yesterday treat a man of he importance nor could she i should think be absolutely determine to put herself out of the way of receive the visit of two of the principal lady of my family and to break entirely with I in the face of they all -- besides whither could she have go -- moreover miss howe 's letter come -lrb- after she elopement -rrb- so safely to she hand must surely put she into a more confide temper with I and with every one else though she would not immediately own it but these good folk have so little charity -- be such severe censurer -- yet who be absolutely perfect -- it be to be wish however that they would be so modest as to doubt themselves sometimes : then would they allow for other as other -lrb- excellent as they imagine

affair i send up the moment he come she desire to be excuse receive he visit till four this afternoon intolerable -- no consideration -- none at all in this sex when they curse humor be in the way -- pay-day pay-hour rather will come -- oh that it be to be the next the captain be in a pet who can blame he even the woman think a man of he consequence and generously come to serve we hardly use would to heaven she have attempt to get off last night the woman not my enemy who know but the husband 's exert authority might have meet with such connivance as might have conclude either in carry she back to she former lodgings or in consummation at mr moore 's in spite of exclamation fit and the rest of the female obsecration my beloved have not appear to any body this day except to mr moore be it seem extremely low : unfit for the interesting conversation that be to be hold in the afternoon long to hear from she dear friend miss howe -- yet can not expect a letter for a day or two have a bad opinion of all mankind -- no wonder -- excellent creature as she be with such a father such uncle such a brother as she have how do she look better than could be expect from yesterday 's fatigue and last night 's ill rest these tender dove know not till put to it what they can bear especially when engage in love affair and they attention wholly engrossed but the sex love busy scene still life be they aversion a woman will create a storm rather than be without one so that they can preside in the whirlwind and direct it they be happy -- but my beloved 's misfortune be that she must live in tumult yet neither raise they herself nor be able to controul they letter xxxiv mr lovelace to john belford esq sit night June 10 what will be the issue of all my plot and contrivance devil take I if i be able to divine but i will not as lord m would say forestall my own market at four the appoint hour i send up to desire admittance in the captain 's name and my own she would wait upon the captain presently -lrb- not upon I -rrb- and in the parlor if it be not engage the dining-room be mine perhaps that be the reason of she name the parlor -- mighty nice again if so no good sign for I think i this stiff punctilio in the parlor with I and the captain be mr moore miss rawlin and mr bevi the woman say they would withdraw when the lady come down lovel not except she choose you should lady -- people who be so much above-board as i be need not make secret of any of they affair besides you three lady be now acquaint with all we concern capt i have some thing to say to you lady that perhaps she would not herself choose that any body should hear not even you mr lovelace as you and she family be not upon such a good foot of understanding as be to be wish lovel well well captain i must submit give we a sign to withdraw and we will withdraw it be better that the exclusion of the woman should come from he than from I capt i will bow and wave my hand thus -- when i wish to be alone with the lady she uncle dote upon she i hope mr lovelace you will not make a reconciliation more difficult for the earnestness which my dear friend show to bring it to bear but indeed i must tell you as i tell you more than once before that i be afraid you have make lighter of the occasion of this misunderstanding to I than it ought to have be make lovel i hope captain tomlinson you do not question my veracity capt i beg you pardon mr lovelace -- but those thing which we man may think lightly of may not be light to a woman of delicacy -- and then if you have bind yourself by a vow you ought -- miss rawlin bridle she lip close -lrb- but she mouth stretch to a smile of approbation the longer for not button -rrb- tacitly show herself pleased with the captain for he delicacy mr moore could speak -- very true however be all she say with a motion of she head that express the bow-approbatory for my part say the jolly widow stare with eye as big as egg i know what i know -- but man and wife be man and wife or they be not man and wife -- i have no notion of standing upon such nicety but here she come cry one hear she chamber-door open -- here she come another hear it shut after she -- and down dropt the angel among we we all stand up bow and courtesy and could not help it for she enter with such a air as command all we reverence yet the captain look plaguy grave cl pray keep you seat lady -- pray do not go -lrb- for they make offer to withdraw yet miss rawlin would have burst have she be suffer to retire -rrb- before this time you have all hear my story i make no doubt -- pray keep you seat -- at least all mr lovelace 's a very saucy and whimsical beginning think i captain tomlinson you servant address herself to he with inimitable dignity i hope you do not take amiss my decline you visit yesterday i be really incapable of talk upon any subject that require attention capt i be glad to see you better now madam i hope i do cl indeed i be not well i would not have excuse myself from attend you some hour ago but in hope i should have be better i beg you pardon sir for the trouble i have give you and shall the rather expect it as this day will i hope conclude it all thus set thus determine thought i -- yet to have sleep upon it -- but as what she say be capable of a good as well as a bad construction i would not put a unfavourable one upon it lovel the captain be sorry my dear he do not offer he attendance the moment he arrive yesterday he be afraid that you take it amiss that he do not cl perhaps i think that my uncle 's friend might have wish to see I as soon as he come -lrb- how we stare -rrb- -- but sir -lrb- to I -rrb- it might be convenient to you to detain he the devil think i -- so there really be resentment as well as head - ache as my good friend mr bevi observe in she refusing to see the honest gentleman capt you would detain I mr lovelace -- i be for pay my respects to the lady the moment i come -- cl well sir -lrb- interrupt he -rrb- to wave this for i would not be think captious -- if you have not suffer inconvenience in be oblige to come again i shall be easy capt -lrb- half disconcert -rrb- a little inconvenience i can not say but i have suffer i have indeed too many affair upon my hand but the desire i have to serve you and mr lovelace as well as to oblige my dear friend you uncle harlowe make great inconveniency but small one cl you be very oblige sir -- here be a great alteration since you part with we last capt a great one indeed madam i be very much surprised at it on Thursday evening when mr lovelace conduct I to you lodgings where we hope to find you cl have you any thing to say to I sir from my uncle himself that require my private ear -- do not go lady -lrb- for the woman stand up and offer to withdraw -rrb- -- if mr lovelace stay i be sure you may i frowned -- i bit my lip -- i look at the woman -- and shake my head capt i have nothing to offer but what mr lovelace be a party to and may hear except one private word or two which may be postpone to the last cl pray lady keep you seat -- thing be altered sir since i see you you can mention nothing that relate to I now to which that gentleman can be a party capt you surprise I madam i be sorry to hear this -- sorry for you uncle 's sake -- sorry for you sake -- sorry for mr lovelace 's sake -- and yet i be sure he must have give greater occasion than he have mention to I or -- lovel indeed captain -- indeed lady i have tell you great part of my story -- and what i tell you of my offence be the truth : -- what i conceal of my story be only what i apprehended would if know cause this dear creature to be think more censorious than charitable cl well well sir say what you please make I as black as you please -- make yourself as white as you can -- i be not now in you power : that consideration will comfort I for all capt god forbid that i should offer to plead in behalf of a crime that a woman of virtue and honor can not forgive but surely surely madam this be go too far cl do not blame I captain tomlinson i have a good opinion of you as my uncle 's friend but if you be mr lovelace 's friend that be another thing for my interest and mr lovelace 's must now be for ever separate capt one word with you madam if you please -- offer to retire cl you may say all that you please to say before these gentlewoman -- mr lovelace may have secret -- i have none : -- you seem to think I faulty : i should be glad that all the world know my heart let my enemy sit in judgment upon my action fairly scan i fear not the result let they even ask I my most secret thought and whether they make for I or against I i will reveal they capt noble lady who can say as you say the woman hold up they hand and eye each as if she have say -- not i no disorder here say miss rawlin : -- but -lrb- judge by she own heart -rrb- a confound deal of improbability i believe she think finely say to be sure say the widow bevi shrug she shoulder mr moore sigh jack belford think i know all mine and in this i be more ingenuous than any of the three and a fit match for this paragon cl how mr lovelace have find I out here i can not tell : but such mean device such artful such worse than waltham disguise put on to obtrude himself into my company such bold such shocking untruth -- capt the favor of but one word madam in private -- cl in order to support a right which he have not over I -- o sir -- o captain tomlinson -- i think i have reason to say that the man -lrb- there he stand -rrb- be capable of any vileness -- the woman look upon one another and upon I by turn to see how i bear it i have such darting in my head at the instant that i think i should have go distract my brain seem on fire what would i have give to have have she alone with I -- i traverse the room my clenched fist to my forehead o that i have any body here think i that hercules-like when flame in the torture of dejanira 's poison shirt i could tear in piece capt dear lady see you not how the poor gentleman -- lord how have i impose upon you uncle at this rate how happy do i tell he i see you how happy i be sure you would be in each other cl o sir you do not know how many premeditated offence i have forgive when i see you last before i could appear to you what i hope then i might for the future be -- but now you may tell my uncle if you please that i can not hope for he mediation tell he that my guilt in give this man a opportunity to spirit I away from my try my experienced my natural friend -lrb- harshly as they treat I -rrb- stare I every day more and more in the face and still the more as my fate seem to be draw to a crisis accord to the malediction of my offended father and then she burst into tear which even affect that dog who bring to abet I be himself all belford over the woman so use to cry without grief as they be to laugh without reason by mere force of example -lrb- confound they promptitude -rrb- must need pull out they handkerchief the less wonder however as i myself between confusion surprise and concern could hardly stand it what be a tender heart good for -- who can be happy that have a feeling heart -- and yet thou ` lt say that he who have it not must be a tiger and no man capt let I beg the favor of one word with you madam in private and that on my own account the woman hereupon offer to retire she insist that if they go i should not stay capt sir bow to I shall i beg -- i hope think i that i may trust this solemn dog instruct as he be she do not doubt he i 'll stay out no longer than to give she time to spend she first fire i then passively withdraw with the woman -- but with such a bow to my goddess that it win for I every heart but that i want most to win for the haughty maid bent not she knee in return the conversation between the captain and the lady when we be retire be to the following effect : -- they both talk loud enough for I to hear they -- the lady from anger the captain with design and thou mayest be sure there be no listener but myself what i be imperfect in be supply afterwards for i have my vellum-leaved book to note all down if she have know this perhaps she would have be more sparing of she invective -- and but perhaps neither he tell she that as she brother be absolutely resolve to see she and as he himself in compliance with she uncle 's expedient have report she marriage and as that report have reach the ear of lord m lady betty and the rest of my relation and as he have be oblige in consequence of he first report to vouch it and as she brother might find out where she be and apply to the woman here for a confirmation or refutation of the marriage he have think himself oblige to countenance the report before the woman that this have embarrassed he not a little as he would not for the world that she should have cause to think he capable of prevarication contrivance or double dealing and that this make he desirous of a private conversation with she it be true she say she have give she consent to such a expedient believe it be she uncle 's and little thinking that it would lead to so many error yet she might have know that one error be frequently the parent of many mr lovelace have make she sensible of the truth of that observation on more occasion than one and it be a observation that he the captain have make in one of the letter that be show she yesterday \* \* see letter xxiv he hope that she have no mistrust of he : that she have no doubt of he honor if madam you suspect I -- if you think I capable -- what a man the lord be merciful to I -- what a man must you think I i hope sir there can not be a man in the world who could deserve to be suspect in such a case as this i do not suspect you if it be possible there could be one such a man i be sure captain tomlinson a father of child a man in year of sense and experience can not be that man he tell I that just then he think he feel a sudden flash from she eye a eye-beam as he call it dart through he shiver rein and he could not help tremble the dog 's conscience jack -- nothing else -- i have feel half a dozen such flash such eye-beam in as many different conversation with this soul-piercing beauty she uncle she must own be not accustom to think of such expedient but she have reconcile this to herself as the case be unhappily uncommon and by the regard he have for she honor this set the puppy 's heart at ease and give he more courage she ask he if he think lady betty and miss montague intend she a visit he have no doubt but they do and do he imagine say she that i could be bring to countenance to they the report you have give out -lrb- i have hope to bring she to this jack or she have see they letter but i have tell the captain that i believe i must give up this expectation -rrb- no -- he believe that i have not such a thought he be pretty sure that i intend when i see they to tell they -lrb- as in confidence -rrb- the naked truth he then tell she that she uncle have already make some step towards a general reconciliation the moment madam that he know you be really marry he will enter into confidence with you father upon it have actually express to you mother he desire to be reconcile to you and what sir say my mother what say my dear mother with great emotion she ask this question hold out she sweet face as the captain describe she with the most earnest attention as if she would shorten the way which he word be to have to she heart you mother madam burst into tear upon it : and you uncle be so penetrate by she tenderness that he could not proceed with the subject but he intend to enter upon it with she in form as soon as he hear that the ceremony be over by the tone of she voice she weep the dear creature think i begin to relent -- and i grudged the dog he eloquence i could hardly bear the thought that any man breathing should have the power which i have lose of persuade this high-souled woman though in my own favor and wouldest thou think it this reflection give I more uneasiness at the moment than i feel from she reproach violent as they be or than i have pleasure in she suppose relent : for there be beauty in every thing she say and do -- beauty in she passion -- beauty in she tear -- have the captain be a young fellow and of rank and fortune he throat would have be in danger and i should have think very hardly of she o captain tomlinson say she you know not what i have suffer by this man 's strange way he have as i be not ashamed to tell he yesterday a plain path before he he at first betray I into he power -- but when i be in it -- there she stopt -- then resume -- o sir you know not what a strange man he have be -- a unpolite a rough-manner would man in disgrace of he birth and education and knowledge a unpolite man -- and so act as if he worldly and personal advantage set he above those grace which distinguish a gentleman the first woman that ever say or that ever think so of I that be my comfort think i -- but this -lrb- speak of to she uncle 's friend behind my back -rrb- help to heap up thy already-too-full measure dearest -- it be down in my vellum-book cl when i look back on he whole behavior to a poor young creature -lrb- for i be but a very young creature -rrb- i can not acquit he either of great folly or of deep design and last Wednesday -- there she stopt and i suppose turn away she face i wonder she be not ashamed to hint at what she think so shameful and that to a man and alone with he capt far be it from I madam to offer to enter too closely into so tender a subject mr lovelace own that you have reason to be displeased with he but he so solemnly clear himself of premeditated offence -- cl he can not clear himself captain tomlinson the people of the house must be very vile as well as he i be convince that there be a wicked confederacy -- but no more upon such a subject capt only one word more madam -- he tell I that you promise to pardon he he tell I -- he know interrupted she that he deserve not pardon or he have not extort the promise from I nor have i give it to he but to shield myself from the vilest outrage -- capt i could wish madam inexcusable as he behavior have be since he have something to plead in the reliance he make upon you promise that for the sake of appearance to the world and to avoid the mischief that may follow if you absolutely break with he you could prevail upon you naturally-generous mind to lay a obligation upon he by you forgiveness she be silent capt you father and mother madam deplore a daughter lose to they whom you generosity to mr lovelace may restore : do not put it to the possible chance that they may have cause to deplore a double loss the losing of a son as well as a daughter who by he own violence which you may perhaps prevent may be for ever lose to they and to the whole family she pause -- she weep -- she own that she feel the force of this argument i will be the making of this fellow thought i capt permit I madam to tell you that i do not think it would be difficult to prevail upon you uncle if you insist upon it to come up privately to town and to give you with he own hand to mr lovelace -- except indeed you present misunderstanding be to come to he ear besides madam you brother it be likely may at this very time be in town and he be resolve to find you out -- cl why sir should i be so much afraid of my brother my brother have injure I not i he will my brother offer to I what mr lovelace have offer -- wicked ungrateful man to insult a friendless unprotected creature make friendless by himself -- i can not can not think of he in the light i once think of he what sir to put myself into the power of a wretch who have act by I with so much vile premeditation -- who shall pity who shall excuse I if i do be i to suffer ever so much from he -- no sir -- let mr lovelace leave I -- let my brother find I i be not such a poor creature as to be afraid to face the brother who have injure I capt be you and you brother to meet only to confer together to expostulate to clear up difficulty it be another thing but what madam can you think will be the issue of a interview -lrb- mr solme with he -rrb- when he find you unmarried and resolve never to have mr lovelace suppose mr lovelace be not to interfere which can not be imagine cl well sir i can only say i be a very unhappy creature -- i must resign to the will of providence and be patient under evil which that will not permit I to shun but i have take my measure mr lovelace can never make I happy nor i he i wait here only for a letter from miss howe -- that must determine I -- determine you as to mr lovelace madam interrupt the captain cl i be already determine as to he capt if it be not in he favor i have do i can not use stronger argument than i have use and it would be impertinent to repeat they if you can not forgive he offence i be sure it must have be much greater than he have own to I if you be absolutely determine be please to let I know what i shall say to you uncle you be please to tell I that this day would put a end to what you call my trouble : i should not have think it any could i have be a humble mean of reconcile person of worth and honor to each other here i enter with a solemn air lovel captain tomlinson i have hear a part of what have pass between you and this unforgiving -lrb- however otherwise excellent -rrb- lady i be cut to the heart to find the dear creature so determine i could not have believe it possible with such prospects that i have so little share in she esteem nevertheless i must do myself justice with regard to the offence i be so unhappy as to give since i find you be ready to think it much greater than it really be cl i hear not sir you recapitulation i be and ought to be the sole judge of insult offer to my person i enter not into discussion with you nor hear you on the shocking subject and be go i put myself between she and the door -- you may hear all i have to say madam my fault be not of such a nature but that you may i will be a just accuser of myself and will not wind you ear i then protest that the fire be a real fire -lrb- so it be -rrb- i disclaimed -lrb- less truly -rrb- premeditation i own that i be hurry on by the violence of a youthful passion and by a sudden impulse which few other person in the like situation would have be able to check : that i withdraw at she command and entreaty on the promise of pardon without have offer the least indecency or any freedom that would not have be forgive by person of delicacy surprise in a attitude so charming -- she terror on the alarm of fire call for a soothing behavior and personal tenderness she be ready to fall into fit : my hoped-for happy day so near that i might be presume to be look upon as a betrothed lover -- and that this excuse might be plead even for the woman of the house that they think we actually marry might suppose themselves to be the less concerned to interfere on so tender a occasion -- -lrb- there jack be a bold insinuation on behalf of the woman -rrb- high indignation fill she disdainful eye eye-beam after eye-beam flash at I every feature of she sweet face have soul in it yet she speak not perhaps jack she have a thought that this plea for the woman account for my contrivance to have she pass to they as marry when i first carry she thither capt indeed sir i must say that you do not well to add to the apprehension of a lady so much terrify before the dear creature offer to go by I i set my back against the door and besought she to stay a few moment i have not say thus much my dearest creature but for you sake as well as for my own that captain tomlinson should not think i have be viler than i be nor will i say one word more on the subject after i have appeal to you own heart whether it be not necessary that i should say so much and to the captain whether otherwise he would not have go away with a much worse opinion of I if he have judge of my offence by the violence of you resentment capt indeed i should i own i should and i be very glad mr lovelace that you be able to defend yourself thus far cl that cause must be well try where the offender take he seat upon the same bench with the judge -- i submit not mine to man -- nor give I leave to say to you captain tomlinson though i be willing to have a good opinion of you have not the man be assure that he have influence you in he favor he would not have bring you up to hampstead capt that i be influence as you call it madam be for the sake of you uncle and for you own sake more -lrb- i will say to mr lovelace 's face -rrb- than for he what can i have in view but peace and reconciliation i have from the first blame and i now again blame mr lovelace for add distress to distress and terror to terror the lady as you acknowledge sir -lrb- look valiantly -rrb- ready before to fall into fit lovel let I own to you captain tomlinson that i have be a very faulty a very foolish man and if this dear creature ever honor I with she love a ungrateful one but i have have too much reason to doubt it and this be now a flagrant proof that she never have the value for I which my proud heart wish for that with such prospects before we a day so near settlement approve and draw she uncle meditate a general reconciliation which for she sake not my own i be desirous to give into she can for a offence so really slight on a occasion so truly accidental renounce I for ever and with I all hope of that reconciliation in the way she uncle have put it in and she have acquiesce with and risque all consequence fatal one as they may too possibly be -- by my soul captain tomlinson the dear creature must have hate I all the time she be intend to honor I with she hand and now she must resolve to abandon I as far as i know with a preference in she heart of the most odious of man -- in favor of that solme who as you tell I accompany she brother : and with what hope with what view accompany he -- how can i bear to think of this -- cl it be fit sir that you should judge of my regard for you by you own conscienceness of demerit yet you know or you would not have dare to behave to I as sometimes you do that you have more of it than you deserve she walk from we and then return captain tomlinson say she i will own to you that i be not capable of resolve to give my hand and -- nothing but my hand have i not give a flagrant proof of this to the once most indulgent of parent which have bring I into a distress which this man have heighten when he ought in gratitude and honor to have endeavor to render it supportable i have even a bias sir in he favor i scruple not to own it long -lrb- much too long -rrb- bear i with he unaccountable way attribute he error to unmeaning gaiety and to a want of know what true delicacy and true generosity require from a heart susceptible of grateful impression to one involve by he means in unhappy circumstance it be now wickedness in he -lrb- a wickedness which discredit all he profession -rrb- to say that this last cruel and ungrateful insult be not a premeditated one -- but what need i say more of this insult when it be of such a nature and that it have change that bias in he favor and make I choose to forego all the invite prospects he talk of and to run all hazard to free myself from he power o my dearest creature how happy for we both have i be able to discover that bias as you condescend to call it through such reserve as man never encounter with he do discover it capt tomlinson he bring I more than once to own it the more needlessly bring I to own it as i dare say he own vanity give he no cause to doubt it and as i have apparently no other motive in not be forward to own it than my too-justly-founded apprehension of he want of generosity in a word captain tomlinson -lrb- and now that i be determine upon my measure i the less scruple to say -rrb- i should have despise myself have i find myself capable of affectation or tyranny to the man i intend to marry i have always blame the dearest friend i have in the world for a fault of this nature in a word -- lovel and have my angel really and indeed the favor for I she be pleased to own -- dearest creature forgive I restore I to you good opinion surely i have not sin beyond forgiveness you say that i extort from you the promise you make I but i could not have presume to make that promise the condition of my obedience have i not think there be room to expect forgiveness permit i beseech you the prospects to take place that be open so agreeably before we i will go to town and bring the license all difficulty to the obtain of it be surmount captain tomlinson shall be witness to the deed he will be present at the ceremony on the part of you uncle indeed he give I hope that you uncle himself -- capt i do mr lovelace : and i will tell you my grounds for the hope i give i promise to my dear friend -lrb- you uncle madam -rrb- that he should give out that he would take a turn with I to my little farm-house as i call it near northampton for a week or so -- poor gentleman he have of late be very little abroad -- too visibly decline -- change of air it might be give out be good for he -- but i see madam that this be too tender a subject -- the dear creature weep she know how to apply as mean the captain 's hint to the occasion of she uncle 's decline state of health capt we might indeed i tell he set out in that road but turn short to town in my chariot and he might see the ceremony perform with he own eye and be the desire father as well as the beloved uncle she turn from we and wipe she eye capt and really there seem now to be but two objection to this as mr harlowe discourage not the proposal -- the one the unhappy misunderstanding between you which i would not by any means he should know since then he might be apt to give weight to mr jame harlowe 's unjust surmise -- the other that it would necessarily occasion some delay to the ceremony which certainly may be perform in a day or two -- if -- and then he reverently bow to my goddess -- charming fellow -- but often do i curse my star for make I so much oblige to he adroitness she be go to speak but not like the turn of she countenance -lrb- although as i think its severity and indignation seem a little abate -rrb- i say and have like to have blow myself up by it -- one expedient i have just think of -- cl none of you expedient mr lovelace -- i abhor you expedient you invention -- i have have too many of they lovel see capt tomlinson -- see sir -- o how we expose ourselves to you -- little do you think i dare say that we have live in such a continued misunderstanding together -- but you will make the best of it all we may yet be happy oh that i could have be assure that this dear creature love I with the hundredth part of the love i have for she -- we diffidence have be mutual i presume to say that she have too much punctilio : i be afraid that i have too little hence we difficulty but i have a heart captain tomlinson a heart that bid I hope for she love because it be resolve to deserve it as much as man can deserve it capt i be indeed surprise at what i have see and hear i defend not mr lovelace madam in the offence he have give you -- as a father of daughter myself i can not defend he though he fault seem to be lighter than i have apprehend -- but in my conscience madam i think you carry you resentment too high cl too high sir -- too high to the man that might have be happy if he would too high to the man that have hold my soul in suspense a hundred time since -lrb- by artifice and deceit -rrb- he obtain a power over I -- say lovelace thyself say art thou not the very lovelace who by insulting I hast wrong thine own hope -- the wretch that appear in vile disguise personate a old lame creature seek for lodgings for thy sick wife -- tell the gentlewoman here story all of thine own invention and assert to they a husband 's right over I which thou hast not -- and be it -lrb- turn to the captain -rrb- to be expect that i should give credit to the protestation of such a man lovel treat I my dearest creature as you please i will bear it : and yet you scorn and you violence have fix dagger in my heart -- but be it possible without those disguise to come at you speech -- and could i lose you if study if invention would put it in my power to arrest you anger and give I hope to engage you to confirm to I the promise pardon the address i make to you before the woman as if the marriage-ceremony have pass be in consequence of what you uncle have advise and what you have acquiesce with and the rather make as you brother and singleton and solme be resolve to find out whether what be report of you marriage be true or not that they might take they measure accordingly and in hope to prevent that mischief which i have be but too studious to prevent since this tameness have but invite insolence from you brother and he confederate cl o thou strange wretch how thou talkest -- but captain tomlinson give I leave to say that be i incline to enter farther upon this subject i would appeal to miss rawlin 's judgment -lrb- whom else have i to appeal to -rrb- she seem to be a person of prudence and honor but not to any man 's judgment whether i carry my resentment beyond fit bound when i resolve -- capt forgive madam the interruption -- but i think there can be no reason for this you ought as you say to be the sole judge of indignity offer you the gentlewoman here be stranger to you you will perhaps stay but a little while among they if you lay the state of you case before any of they and you brother come to inquire of they you uncle 's intended mediation will be discover and render abortive -- i shall appear in a light that i never appear in in my life -- for these woman may not think themselves oblige to keep the secret charming fellow cl o what difficulty have one fatal step involve I in -- but there be no necessity for such a appeal to any body i be resolve on my measure capt absolutely resolve madam cl i be capt what shall i say to you uncle harlowe madam -- poor gentleman how will he be surprise -- you see mr lovelace -- you see sir -- turn to I with a flourishing hand -- but you may thank yourself -- and admirably stalk he from we true by my soul think i i traverse the room and bit my unpersuasive lip now upper now under for vexation he make a profound reverence to she -- and go to the window where lay he hat and whip and take they up open the door child say he to some body he see pray order my servant to bring my horse to the door -- lovel you will not go sir -- i hope you will not -- i be the unhappiest man in the world -- you will not go -- yet alas -- but you will not go sir -- there may be yet hope that lady betty may have some weight -- capt dear mr lovelace and may not my worthy friend and affectionate uncle hope for some influence upon he daughter-niece -- but i beg pardon -- a letter will always find I disposed to serve the lady and that as well for she sake as for the sake of my dear friend she have throw herself into she chair : she eye cast down : she be motionless as in a profound study the captain bow to she again : but meet with no return to he bow mr lovelace say he -lrb- with a air of equality and independence -rrb- i be you 's still the dear unaccountable sit as immovable as a statue stir neither hand foot head nor eye -- i never before saw any one in so profound a reverie in so wake a dream he pass by she to go out at the door she sit near though the passage by the other door be he direct way and bow again she move not i will not disturb the lady in she meditation sir -- adieu mr lovelace -- no farther i beseech you she start sigh -- be you go sir capt i be madam i could have be glad to do you service but i see it be not in my power she stand up hold out one hand with inimitable dignity and sweetness -- i be sorry you be go sir -- can not help it -- i have no friend to advise with -- mr lovelace have the art -lrb- or good fortune perhaps i should call it -rrb- to

may put herself into she protection and accompany she down to she seat in oxfordshire it be one of she ladyship 's purpose to prevail on she suppose new niece to go down with she it may pass to every one but to lady betty and to you captain tomlinson and to you friend mr harlowe -lrb- as he desire -rrb- that we have be some time marry : and she be with my relation will amount to a proof to jame

charming expedient -- this will answer every end she muse -- she be greatly perplex -- at last god direct I say she : i know not what to do -- a young unfriended creature whom can i have to advise with -- let I retire if i can retire she withdraw with slow and tremble foot and go up to she chamber for heaven 's sake say the penetrate varlet -lrb- he hand lift up -rrb- for heaven 's sake take compassion upon this admirable woman -- i can not proceed -- she deserve all thing -- softly -- d -- n the fellow -- the woman be come in he sob up he grief -- turn about -- hemm have up a more manly accent -- wipe thy curse eye -- he do the sunshine take place on one cheek and spread slowly to the other and the fellow have he whole face again the woman all three come in lead by that ever-curious miss rawlin i tell they that the lady be go up to consider of every thing : that we have hope of she and such a representation we make of all that have pass as bring either tacit or declare blame upon the fair perverse for hardness of heart and over-delicacy the widow bevi in particular put out one lip toss up she head wrinkle she forehead and make such motion with she now lifted-up now cast-down eye as show that she think there be a great deal of perverseness and affectation in the lady now-and-then she change she censuring look to look of pity of I -- but -lrb- as she say -rrb- she love not to aggravate -- a poor business god help 's shrug up she shoulder to make such a rout about and then she eye laugh heartily -- indulgence be a good thing love be a good thing -- but too much be too much miss rawlin however declare after she have call the widow bevi with a prudish simper a comical gentlewoman that there must be something in we story which she could not fathom and go from we into a corner and sit down seemingly vex that she could not letter xxxv mr lovelace -lrb- in continuation -rrb- the lady staid longer above than we wish and i hope that -lrb- lady-like -rrb- she only wait for a invitation to return to we desire the widow bevi in the captain 's name -lrb- who want to go to town -rrb- to request the favor of she company i care not to send up either miss rawlin or mr moore on the errand lest my beloved should be in a communicative disposition especially as she have hint at a appeal to miss rawlin who besides have such a unbounded curiosity mr bevi presently return with a answer -lrb- wink and pink at I -rrb- that the lady would follow she down miss rawlin could not but offer to retire as the other do she eye however intimate that she have rather stay but they not be answer as she seem to wish she go with the rest but with slower foot and have hardly leave the parlor when the lady enter it by the other door a melancholy dignity in she person and air she sit down pray mr tomlinson be seat he take he chair over against she i stand behind she be that i might give he agreed-upon signal should there be occasion for they as thus -- a wink of the left eye be to signify push that point captain a wink of the right and a nod be to indicate approbation of what he have say my fore-finger hold up and bite my lip get off of that as fast as possible a right-forward nod and a frown swear to it captain my whole spread hand to take care not to say too much on that particular subject a scowling brow and a positive nod be to bid he rise in temper and these motion i could make even those with my hand without hold up my arm or move my wrist have the woman be there as when the motion be agree upon i know not but they would she hem -- i be go to speak to spare she suppose confusion : but this lady never want presence of mind when presence of mind be necessary either to she honor or to that conscious dignity which distinguish she from all the woman i ever know i have be consider say she as well as i be able of every thing that have pass and of all that have be say and of my unhappy situation i mean no ill i wish no ill to any creature living mr tomlinson i have always delighted to draw favourable rather than unfavourable conclusion sometimes as it have prove for very bad heart censoriousness whatever fault i have be not naturally my fault -- but circumstance as i be treat as i have be unworthily treat by a man who be full of contrivance and glory in they -- lovel my dearest life -- but i will not interrupt you cl thus treat it become I to doubt -- it concern my honor to doubt to fear to apprehend -- you intervention sir be so seasonable so kind for this man -- my uncle 's expedient the first of the kind he ever i believe thought of a plain honest good-minded man as he be not affect such expedient -- you report in conformity to it -- the consequence of that report the alarm take by my brother he rash resolution upon it -- the alarm take by lady betty and the rest of mr lovelace 's relation -- the sudden letter write to he upon it which with you 's he show I -- all ceremony among person bear observer of ceremony and entitle to value themselves upon they distinction dispense with -- all these thing have happen so quick and some of they so seasonable -- lovel lady betty you see madam in she letter dispense with punctilo avowedly in compliment to you charlotte in she 's profess to do the same for the same reason good heaven that the respect intend you by my relation who in every other case be really punctilious should be thus construe they be glad madam to have a opportunity to compliment you at my expense every one of my family take delight in rally I but they joy on the suppose occasion -- cl do i doubt sir that you have not something to say for any thing you think fit to do i be speak to captain tomlinson sir i will you would be please to withdraw -- at least to come from behind my chair and she look at the captain observe no doubt that he eye seem to take lesson from mine a fair match by jupiter the captain be disconcert the dog have not have such a blush upon he face for ten year before i bit my lip for vexation : walk about the room but nevertheless take my post again and blink with my eye to the captain as a caution for he to take more care of he : and then scoul with my brow and give the nod positive i as good as say resent that captain capt i hope madam you have no suspicion that i be capable -- cl be not displeased with I captain tomlinson i have tell you that i be not of a suspicious temper excuse I for the sake of my sincerity there be not i will be bold to say a sincerer heart in the world than she 's before you she take out she handkerchief and put it to she eye i be go at that instant after she example to vouch for the honesty of my heart but my conscience mennell upon I and would not suffer the meditate vow to pass my lip -- a devilish thing think i for a man to be so little himself when he have most occasion for himself the villain tomlinson look at I with a rueful face as if he beg leave to cry for company it might have be as well if he have cry a feeling heart or the token of it give by a sensible eye be very reputable thing when keep in countenance by the occasion and here let I fairly own to thee that twenty time in this try conversation i say to myself that could i have think that i should have have all this trouble and incur all this guilt i would have be honest at first but why jack be this dear creature so lovely yet so invincible -- ever heardst thou before that the sweet of may blossom in December capt be please -- be pleased madam -- if you have any doubt of my honor -- a whine varlet he should have be quite angry -- for what give i he the nod positive he should have stalk again to the window as for he whip and hat cl i be only make such observation as my youth my inexperience and my present unhappy circumstance suggest to I -- a worthy heart -lrb- such i hope as captain tomlinson 's -rrb- need not fear a examination -- need not fear be look into -- whatever doubt that man who have be the cause of my error and as my severe father imprecate the punisher of the error he have cause might have have of I or of my honor i would have forgive he for they if he have fairly propose they to I : for some doubt perhaps such a man might have of the future conduct of a creature whom he could induce to correspond with he against parental prohibition and against the light which she own judgment throw in upon she : and if he have propound they to I like a man and a gentleman i would have be glad of the opportunity give I to clear my intention and to have show myself entitle to he good opinion -- and i hope you sir -- capt i be ready to hear all you doubt madam and to clear they up -- cl i will only put it sir to you conscience and honor -- the dog sit uneasy -- he shuffle with he foot -- she eye be upon he -- he be therefore after the rebuff he have meet with afraid to look at I for my motion and now turn he eye towards I then from I as if he would unlook he own look cl that all be true that you have write and that you have tell I i give he a right forward nod and a frown -- as much as to say swear to it captain but the varlet do not round it off as i would have have he however he aver that it be he have hope he say that the circumstance with which he commission be attend and what he have communicate to she which he could not know but from he dear friend she uncle might have shield he even from the shadow of suspicion but i be contented say he stammer to be think -- to be think -- what -- what you please to think of I -- till till you be satisfied -- a whore 's - bird cl the circumstance you refer to i must own ought to shield you sir from suspicion but the man before you be a man that would make a angel suspect should that angel plead for he i come forward -- traverse the room -- be indeed in a bl -- dy passion -- i have no patience madam -- and again i bit my unpersuasive lip cl no man ought to be impatient at imputation he be not ashamed to deserve a innocent man will not be outrageous upon such imputation a guilty man ought not -lrb- most excellently would this charming creature cap sentence with lord m -rrb- but i be not now try you sir -lrb- to I -rrb- on the foot of you merit i be only sorry that i be constrain to put question to this worthier gentleman -lrb- worthier gentleman jack -rrb- which perhaps i ought not to put so far as they regard himself and i hope captain tomlinson that you who know not mr lovelace so well as to my unhappiness i do and who have child of you own will excuse a poor young creature who be deprive of all worldly protection and who have be insult and endanger by the most design man in the world and perhaps by a confederacy of he creature there she stopt and stand up and look at I fear nevertheless apparently mingle with she anger -- and so it ought i be glad however of this poor sign of love no one fear whom they value not woman 's tongue be licensed i be go to say but my conscience would not let I call she a woman nor use to she so vulgar a phrase i could only rave by my motion lift up my eye spread my hand rub my face pull my wig and look like a fool indeed i have a great mind to run mad have i be alone with she i would and she should have take consequence the captain interpose in my behalf gently however and as a man not quite sure that he be himself acquit some of the plea we have both insist on he again enforce and speak low poor gentleman say he who can but pity he indeed madam it be easy to see with all he failing the power you have over he cl i have no pleasure sir in distressing any one not even he who have so much distressed I but sir when i think and when i see he before I i can not command my temper indeed indeed captain tomlinson mr lovelace have not act by I either as a grateful or a generous man nor even as a prudent one -- he know not as i tell he yesterday the value of the heart he have insult there the angel stopt she handkerchief at she eye o belford belford that she should so greatly excel as to make I at time appear as a villain in my own eye i besought she pardon i promise that it should be the study of my whole life to deserve it my fault i say whatever they have be be rather fault in she apprehension than in fact i besought she to give way to the expedient i have hit upon -- i repeat it the captain enforce it for she uncle 's sake i once more for the sake of the general reconciliation for the sake of all my family for the sake of prevent further mischief she weep she seem stagger in she resolution -- she turn from I i mention the letter of lord m i besought she to resign to lady betty 's mediation all we difference if she would not forgive I before she see she she turn towards I -- she be go to speak but she heart be full and again she turn away she eye -- and do you really and indeed expect lady betty and miss montague -- and do you -- again she stopt i answer in a solemn manner she turn from I she whole face and pause and seem to consider but in a passionate accent again turn towards I -lrb- o how difficult jack for a harlowe spirit to forgive -rrb- let she ladyship come if she please say she i can not can not wish to see she and if i do see she and she be to plead for you i can not wish to hear she the more i think the less i can forgive a attempt that i be convince be intend to destroy I -lrb- a plaguy strong word for the occasion suppose she be right -rrb- what have my conduct be that a insult of such a nature should be offer to I and it would be a weakness in I to forgive i be sink in my own eye and how can i receive a visit that must depress I more the captain urge she in my favor with greater earnestness than before we both even clamour as i may say for mercy and forgiveness -lrb- didst thou never hear the good folk talk of take heaven by storm -rrb- -- contrition repeatedly avow a total reformation promise the happy expedient again urge cl i have take my measure i have go too far to recede or to wish to recede my mind be prepare for adversity that i have not deserve the evil i have meet with be my consolation i have write to miss howe what my intention be my heart be not with you -- it be against you mr lovelace i have not write to you as i do in the letter i leave behind I have i not resolve whatever become of I to renounce you for ever i be full of hope now severe as she expression be i see she be afraid that i should think of what she have write and indeed she letter be violence itself -- angry people jack should never write while they passion hold lovel the severity you have show I madam whether by pen or by speech shall never have place in my remembrance but for you honor in the light you have take thing all be deserve and but the natural result of virtuous resentment and i adore you even for the pang you have give I she be silent she have employment enough with she handkerchief at she eye lovel you lament sometimes that you have no friend of you own sex to consult with miss rawlin i must confess be too inquisitive to be confide in -lrb- i like not thou mayest think she appeal to miss rawlin -rrb- she may mean well but i never in my life know a person who be fond of prying into the secret of other that be fit to be trust the curiosity of such be govern by pride which be not gratify but by whisper about a secret till it become public in order to show either they consequence or they sagacity it be so in every case what man or woman who be covetous of power or of make a right use of it but in the lady of my family you may confide it be they ambition to think of you as one of themselves renew but you consent to pass to the world for the sake of you uncle 's expedient and for the prevention of mischief as a lady some time married lady betty may be acquaint with the naked truth and you may -lrb- as she hope you will -rrb- accompany she to she seat and if it must be so consider I as in a state of penitence or probation to be accept or reject as i may appear to deserve the captain again clapt he hand on he breast and declare upon he honor that this be a proposal that be the case that of he own daughter and she be not resolve upon immediate marriage -lrb- which yet he think by far the more eligible choice -rrb- he should be very much concern be she to refuse it cl be i with mr lovelace 's relation and to pass as he wife to the world i could not have any choice and how could he be then in a state of probation -- o mr tomlinson you be too much he friend to see into he drift capt he friend madam as i say before as i be you 's and you uncle 's for the sake of a general reconciliation which must begin with a better understanding between yourselve lovel only my dearest life resolve to attend the arrival and visit of lady betty and permit she to arbitrate between we capt there can be no harm in that madam you can suffer no inconvenience from that if mr lovelace 's offence be such that a woman of lady betty 's character judge it to be unpardonable why then -- cl -lrb- interrupt and to I -rrb- if i be not invade by you sir if i be -lrb- as i ought to be -rrb- my own mistress i think to stay here in this honest house -lrb- and then have i a eye-beam as the captain call it flash at I -rrb- till i receive a letter from miss howe that i hope will be in a day or two if in that time the lady come whom you expect and if they be desirous to see the creature whom you have make unhappy i shall know whether i can or can not receive they visit she turn short to the door and retire go up stair to she chamber o sir say the captain as soon as she be go what a angel of a woman be this i have be and i be a very wicked man but if any thing should happen amiss to this admirable lady through my means i shall have more cause for self-reproach than for all the bad action of my life put together and he eye glisten nothing can happen amiss thou sorrowful dog -- what can happen amiss be we to form we opinion of thing by the romantic notion of a girl who suppose that to be the greatest which be the slightest of evil have i not tell thee we whole story have she not break she promise do i not generously spare she when in my power i be decent though i have she at such advantage -- greater liberty have i take with girl of character at a common romp ` bout and all have be laugh off and handkerchief and head-clothes adjust and petticoat shake to rights in my presence never man in the like circumstance and resolve as i be resolve goad on as i be goad on as well by she own sex as by the impulse of a violent passion be ever so decent yet what mercy do she show I now jack this pitiful dog be such another unfortunate one as thyself -- he argument serve to confirm I in the very purpose he bring they to prevail upon I to give up have he leave I to myself to the tenderness of my own nature move as i be when the lady withdraw and have he set down and make odious face and say nothing -- it be very possible that i should have take the chair over against he which she have quit and have cry and blubber with he for half a hour together but the varlet to argue with I -- to pretend to convince a man who know in be heart that he be do a wrong thing -- he must need think that this would put I upon try what i could say for myself and when the extend compunction can be carry from the heart to the lip it must evaporate in word thou perhaps in this place wouldst have urge the same plea that he urge what i answer to he therefore may do for thee and spare thee the trouble of write and I of read a good deal of nonsense capt you be please to tell I sir that you only propose to try she virtue and that you believe you should actually marry she lovel so i shall and can not help it i have no doubt but i shall and as to try she be she not now in the height of she trial have i not reason to think that she be come about be she not now yield up she resentment for a attempt which she think she ought not to forgive and if she do may she not forgive the last attempt -- can she in a word resent that more than she do this woman often for they own sake will keep the last secret but will ostentatiously din the ear of god and man with they clamor upon a successless offer it be my folly my weakness that i give she not more cause for this she unsparing violence capt o sir you will never be able to subdue this lady without force lovel well then puppy must i not endeavor to find a proper time and place -- capt forgive I sir but can you think of force to such a fine creature lovel force indeed i abhor the thought of and for what thinkest thou have i take all the pain i have take and engage so many person in my cause but to avoid the necessity of violent compulsion but yet imaginest thou that i expect direct consent from such a lover of form as this lady be know to be let I tell thee m ` donald that thy master belford have urge on thy side of the question all that thou canst urge must i have every sorry fellow 's conscience to pacify as well as my own -- by my soul patrick she have a friend here -lrb- clap my hand on my breast -rrb- that plead for she with greater and more irresistible eloquence than all the man in the world can plead for she and have she not escape I -- and yet how have i answer my first design of try she \* and in she the virtue of the most virtuous of the sex -- perseverance man -- perseverance -- what wouldst thou have I decline a trial that they make for the honor of a sex we all so dearly love \* see vol iii letter xviii then sir you have no thought -- no thought -- -lrb- look still more sorrowfully -rrb- of marry this wonderful lady yes yes patrick but i have but let I first to gratify my pride bring down she 's let I see that she love I well enough to forgive I for my own sake have she not heretofore lament that she staid not in she father 's house though the consequence must have be if she have that she would have be the wife of the odious solme if now she be bring to consent to be mine seest thou not that the reconciliation with she detested relation be the inducement as it always be and not love of I -- neither she virtue nor she love can be establish but upon full trial the last trial -- but if she resistance and resentment be such as hitherto i have reason to expect they will be and if i find in that resentment less of hatred of I than of the fact then shall she be mine in she own way then hateful as be the life of shackle to I will i marry she well sir i can only say that i be dough in you hand to be mould into what shape you please but if as i say before -- none of thy said-before 's patrick i remember all thou saidst -- and i know all thou canst farther say -- thou art only pontius pilate like wash thine own hand -lrb- do not i know thee -rrb- that thou mayest have something to silence thy conscience with by load I but we have go too far to recede be not all we engine in readiness dry up thy sorrowful eye let unconcern and heart 's ease once more take possession of thy solemn feature thou hast hitherto perform extremely well -- shame not thy past by thy future behavior and a rich reward await thee if thou art dough be dough and i slapt he on the shoulder -- resume but thy former shape and i 'll be answerable for the event he bow assent and compliance go to the glass and begin to untwist and unsadden he feature pull he wig right as if that as well as he head and heart have be discompose by he compunction and once more become old lucifer 's and mine but didst thou think jack that there be so much -- what-shall-i-call-it -- in this tomlinson didst thou imagine that such a fellow as that have bowels that nature so long dead and bury in he as to all humane effect should thus revive and exert itself -- yet why do i ask this question of thee who to my equal surprise hast show on the same occasion the like compassionate sensibility as to tomlinson it look as if poverty have make he the wicked fellow he be as plenty and wantonness have make we what we be necessity after all be the test of principle but what be there in this dull word or thing call honesty that even i who can not in my present view be serve by it can not help think even the accidental emanation of it amiable in tomlinson though demonstrate in a female case and judge better of he for be capable of such letter xxxvi mr lovelace to john belford esq this debate between the captain and I be hardly over when the three woman lead by miss rawlin enter hope no intrusion but very desirous the maiden say to know if we be likely to accommodate o yes i hope so you know lady that you sex must in these case preserve they form they must be court to comply with they own happiness a lucky expedient we have hit upon the uncle have he doubt of we marriage he can not believe nor will any body that it be possible that a man so much in love the lady so desirable -- they all take the hint it be a very extraordinary case the two widow allow woman jack -lrb- as i believe i have observe \* elsewhere -rrb- have a high opinion of what they can do for we miss rawlin desire if i pleased to let they know the expedient and look as if there be no need to proceed in the rest of my speech \* see letter xxiv of this volume i begged that they would not let the lady know i have tell they what this expedient be and they should hear it they promise it be this : that to oblige and satisfy mr harlowe the ceremony be to be again perform he be to be privately present and to give he niece to I with he own hand -- and she be retire to consider of it thou seest jack that i have provide a excuse to save my veracity to the woman here in case i should incline to marriage and she should choose to have miss rawlin 's assistance at the ceremony nor doubt i to bring my fair-one to save my credit on this occasion if i could get she to consent to be mine a charming expedient cry the widow they be all three ready to clap they hand for joy upon it woman love to be marry twice at least jack though not indeed to the same man and all bless the reconciliatory scheme and the proposer of it and suppose it come from the captain they look at he with pleasure while he face shine with the applause imply he should think himself very happy if he could bring about a general reconciliation and he flourish with he head like my man will on he victory over old grime bridle by turn like miss rawlin in the height of a prudish fit but now it be time for the captain to think of return to town have a great deal of business to dispatch before morning nor be he certain that he should be able again to attend we at hampstead before he go home and yet as every thing be draw towards a crisis i do not intend that he should leave hampstead that night a message to the above effect be carry up at my desire by mr moore with the captain 's compliment and to know if she have any command for he to she uncle but i hint to the woman that it would be proper for they to withdraw if the lady do come down lest she should not care to be so free before they on a proposal so particular as she would be to we who have offer it to she consideration mr moore bring down word that the lady be follow she they all three withdraw and she enter at one door as they go out at the other the captain accost she repeat the contents of the message send up and desire that she would give he she command in relation to the report he be to make to she uncle harlowe i know not what to say sir nor what i would have you to say to my uncle -- perhaps you may have business in town -- perhaps you need not see my uncle till i have hear from miss howe till after lady betty -- i do not know what to say i implore the return of that value which she have so generously acknowledge once to have have for I i presume i say to flatter myself that lady betty in she own person and in the name of all my family would be able on my promise reformation and contrition to prevail in my favor especially as we prospects in other respects with regard to the general reconciliation wish for be so happy but let I owe to you own generosity my dearest creature say i rather than to the mediation of any person on earth the forgiveness i be a humble suitor for how much more agreeable to yourself o best beloved of my soul must it be as well as oblige to I that you first personal knowledge of my relation and theirs of you -lrb- for they will not be deny attend you -rrb- should not be begin in recrimination in appeal as lady betty will be here soon it will not perhaps be possible for you to receive she visit with a brow absolutely serene but dearest dearest creature i beseech you let the misunderstanding pass as a slight one -- as a misunderstanding clear up appeal give pride and superiority to the person appeal to and be apt to lessen the appellant not only in they eye but in she own exalt not into judge those who be prepare to take lesson and instruction from you the individual of my family be as proud as i be say to be but they will cheerfully resign to you superiority -- you will be the first woman of the family in every one 's eye this might have do with any other woman in the world but this and yet she be the only woman in the world of whom it may with truth be say but thus angrily do she disclaim the compliment yes indeed -- -lrb- and there she stopt a moment she sweet bosom heave with a noble disdain -rrb- -- cheat out of myself from the very first -- a fugitive from my own family renounce by my relation insult by you -- lay humble claim to the protection of you 's -- be not this the light in which i must appear not only to the lady of you family but to all the world -- think you sir that in these circumstance or even have i be in the happiest that i could be affect by this plea of undeserved superiority -- you be a stranger to the mind of clarissa harlowe if you think she capable of so poor and so undue a pride she go from we to the farther end of the room the captain be again affect -- excellent creature i call she and reverently approach she urge farther the plea i have last make it be but lately say i that the opinion of my relation have be more than indifferent to I whether good or bad and it be for you sake more than for my own that i now wish to stand well with my whole family the principal motive of lady betty 's come up be to purchase present for the whole family to make on the happy occasion this consideration turn to the captain with so noble-minded a dear creature i know can have no weight only as it will show they value and respect but what a damp would they worthy heart receive be they to find they admire new niece as they now think she not only not they niece but capable of renounce I for ever they love I they all love I i have be guilty of carelessness and levity to they indeed but of carelessness and levity only and that owe to a pride that have set I above meanness though it have not do every thing for I my whole family will be guaranty for my good behavior to this dear creature they niece they daughter they cousin they friend they choose companion and directress all in one -- upon my soul captain we may we must be happy but dearest dearest creature let I on my knee -lrb- and down i dropt she face all the time turn half from I as she stand at the window she handkerchief often at she eye -rrb- on my knee let I plead you promise forgiveness and let we not appear to they on they visit thus unhappy with each other lady betty the next hour that she see you will write she opinion of you and of the likelihood of we future happiness to lady sarah she sister a weak-spirited woman who now hope to supply to herself in my bride the lose daughter she still mourn for the captain then join in and re-urged she uncle 's hope and expectation and he resolution effectually to set about the general reconciliation the mischief that might be prevent and the certainty that there be that she uncle might be prevail on to give she to I with he own hand if she make it she choice to wait for he come up but for he own part he humbly advise and fervently press she to make the very next day or Monday at farthest my happy day permit I dearest lady say he and i could kneel to you myself -lrb- bend he knee -rrb- though i have no interest in my earnestness but the pleasure i should have to be able to serve you all to beseech you to give I a opportunity to assure you uncle that i myself see with my own eye the happy knot tie -- all misunderstanding all doubt all diffidence will then be at a end and what madam rejoin i still kneel can there be in you new measure be they what they will that can so happily so reputably i will presume to say for all around obviate the present difficulty miss howe herself if she love you and if she love you fame madam urge the captain he knee still bent must congratulate you on such happy conclusion then turn she face she see the captain half-kneeling -- o sir o capt tomlinson -- why this undue condescension extend she hand to he elbow to raise he i can not bear this -- then cast she eye on I rise mr lovelace -- kneel not to the poor creature whom you have insult -- how cruel the occasion for it -- and how mean the submission not mean to such a angel -- nor can i rise but to be forgive the captain then re-urged once more the day -- he be amaze he say if she ever value I -- o captain tomlinson interrupted she how much be you the friend of this man -- if i have never value he he never would have have it in he power to insult I nor could i if i have never regard he have take to heart as i do the insult -lrb- execrable as it be -rrb- so undeservedly so ungratefully give -- but let he retire -- for a moment let he retire i be more than half afraid to trust the captain by himself with she he give I a sign that i might depend upon he and then i take out of my pocket he letter to I and lady betty 's and miss montague 's and lord m 's letter -lrb- which last she have not then see -rrb- and give they to he procure for I in the first place mr tomlinson a re-perusal of these three letter and of this from lord m and i beseech you my dearest life give they due consideration : and let I on my return find the happy effect of that consideration i then withdraw with slow foot however and a misgiving heart the captain insist upon this re-perusal previously to what she have to say to he as he tell I she comply but with some difficulty as if she be afraid of be soften in my favor she lament she unhappy situation destitute of friend and not know whither to go or what to do she ask question sifting-question about she uncle about she family and after what he know of mr hickman 's fruitless application in she favor he be well prepare in this particular for i have show he the letter and extract of letter of miss howe which i have so happily come at \* might she be assure she ask he that she brother with singleton and solme be actually in quest of she \* vol iv letter xliv he aver that they be she ask if he think i have hope of prevail on she to go back to town he be sure i have not be he really of opinion that lady betty would pay she a visit he have no doubt of it but sir but captain tomlinson -- -lrb- impatiently turn from he and again to he -rrb- i know not what to do -- but be i you daughter sir -- be you my own father -- alas sir i have neither father nor mother he turn from she and wipe he eye o sir you have humanity -lrb- she weep too -rrb- there be some man in the world thank heaven that can be move o sir i have meet with hard - heart man -- in my own family too -- or i could not have be so unhappy as i be -- but i make every body unhappy he eye no doubt run over -- dearest madam heavenly lady -- who can -- who can -- hesitate and blubber the dog as he own and indeed i hear some part of what pass though they both talk lower than i wish for from the nature of they conversation there be no room for altitude they and both and they -- how it go against I to include this angel of a creature and any man on earth but myself in one world capt who can forbear be affect -- but madam you can be no other man 's cl nor would i be but he be so sink with I -- to fire the house -- a artifice so vile -- contrived for the worst of purpose -- would you have a daughter of you 's -- but what would i say -- yet you see that i have nobody in whom i can confide -- mr lovelace be a vindictive man -- he could not love the creature whom he could insult as he have insult I she pause and then resume -- in short i never never can forgive he nor he I -- do you think sir i never would have go so far as i have go if i have intend ever to draw with he in one yoke -- i leave behind I such a letter -- you know madam he have acknowledge the justice of you resentment -- o sir he can acknowledge and he can retract fifty time a day -- but do not think i be trifle with myself and you and want to be persuade to forgive he and to be he there be not a creature of my sex who would have be more explicit and more frank than i would have be from the moment i intend to be he have i a heart like my own to deal with i be always above reserve sir i will presume to say where i have no cause of doubt mr lovelace 's conduct have make I appear perhaps over-nice when my heart want to be encourage and assure and when if it have be so my whole behavior would have be govern by it she stopt she handkerchief at she eye i inquire after the minutest part of she behavior as well as after she word i love thou knowest to trace human nature and more particularly female nature through its most secret recess the pitiful fellow be lose in silent admiration of she and thus the noble creature proceed it be the fate in unequal union that tolerable creature through they frequently incur censure when more happily yoke they might be entitle to praise and shall i not shun a union with a man that might lead into error a creature who flatter herself that she be bless with a inclination to be good and who wish to make every one happy with whom she have any connection even to she very servant she pause take a turn about the room -- the fellow devil fetch he a mummy all the time : -- then proceed formerly indeed i hope to be a humble mean of reform he but when i have no such hope be it right -lrb- you be a serious man sir -rrb- to make a venture that shall endanger my own moral still silent be the varlet if my advocate have nothing to say for I what hope of carry my cause and now sir what be the result of all -- it be this -- that you will endeavor if you have that influence over he which a man of you sense and experience ought to have to prevail upon he and that for he own sake as well as for mine to leave I free to pursue my own destiny and of this you may assure he that i will never be any other man 's impossible madam i know that mr lovelace would not hear I with patience on such a topic and i do assure you that i have some spirit and should not care to take a indignity from he or from any man living she pause -- then resume -- and think you sir that my uncle will refuse to receive a letter from I -lrb- how averse jack to concede a tittle in my favor -rrb- i know madam as matter be circumstance that he would not answer it if you please i will carry one down from you and will he not pursue he intention in my favor nor be himself reconcile to I except i be marry from what you brother give out and effect to believe on mr lovelace 's living with you in the same -- no more sir -- i be a unhappy creature he then re-urge that it would be in she power instantly or on the morrow to put a end to all she difficulty how can that be say she : the license still to be obtain the settlement still to be sign miss howe 's answer to my last unreceived -- and shall i sir be in such a hurry as if i think my honor in danger if i delay yet marry the man from whom only it can be endanger -- unhappy thrice unhappy clarissa harlowe -- in how many difficulty have one rash step involve thee -- and she turn from he and weep the varlet by way of comfort weep too : yet she tear as he might have observe be tear that indicate rather a yielding than a perverse temper there be a sort of stone thou knowest so soft in the quarry that it may in manner be cut with a knife but if the opportunity not be take and it be expose to the air for any time it will become as hard as marble and then with difficulty it yield to the chisel \* so this lady not take at the moment after a turn or two across the room gain more resolution and then she declare as she have do once before that she would wait the issue of miss howe 's answer to the letter she have send she from hence and take she measure accordingly -- leave it to he mean time to make what report he think fit to she uncle -- the kindest that truth could bear she doubt not from captain tomlinson : and she should be glad of a few line from he to hear what that be \* the nature of the bath stone in particular she wish he a good journey she complain of she head and be about to withdraw : but i stept round to the door next the stair as if i have but just come in from the garden -lrb- which as i enter i call a very pretty one -rrb- and take she reluctant hand as she be go out : my dearest life you be not go -- what hope captain -- have you not some hope to give I of pardon and reconciliation she say she would not be detain but i would not let she go till she have promise to return when the captain have report to I what she resolution be and when he have i send up and claim she promise and she come down again and repeat -lrb- as what she be determine upon -rrb- that she would wait for miss howe 's answer to the letter she have write to she and take she measure accord to its contents i expostulate with she upon it in the most submissive and earnest manner she make it necessary for I to repeat many of the plea i have before urge the captain second I with equal earnestness at last each fall down on we knee before she she be distressed i be afraid at one time she would have faint yet neither of we would rise without some concession i plead my own sake the captain he dear friend she uncle 's and both re-plead the prevention of future mischief and the peace and happiness of the two family she own herself unequal to the conflict she sigh she sob she weep she wring she hand i be perfectly eloquent in my vow and protestation she tearful eye be cast down upon I a glow upon each charming cheek a visible anguish in every lovely feature -- at last she tremble knee seem to fail she she dropt into the next chair she charming face as if seek for a hiding place -lrb- which a mother 's bosom would have best supply -rrb- sink upon she own shoulder i forget at the instant all my vow of revenge i throw myself at she foot as she sit and snatch she hand press it with my lip i besought heaven to forgive my past offence and prosper my future hope as i design honourably and justly by the charmer of my heart if once more she should restore I to she favor and i think i feel drop of scalding water -lrb- could they be tear -rrb- trickle down upon my cheek while my cheek glowing like fire seem to scorch up the unwelcome stranger i then arise not doubt of a imply pardon in this silent distress i raise the captain i whisper he -- by my soul man i be in earnest -- now talk of reconciliation of she uncle of the license of settlement -- and raise my voice if now at last captain tomlinson my angel will give I leave to call so great a blessing mine it will be impossible that you should say too much to she uncle in praise of my gratitude my affection and fidelity to he charming niece and he may begin as soon as he please he kind scheme for effect the desirable reconciliation -- nor shall he prescribe any term to I that i will not comply with the captain bless I with he eye and hand -- thank god whisper he we approach the lady together capt what hinder dearest madam what now hinder but that lady betty lawrance when she come may be acquaint with the truth of every thing and that then she may assist privately at you nuptials i will stay till they be celebrated and then shall go down with the happy tiding to my dear mr harlowe and all will all must soon be happy i must have a answer from miss howe reply the still tremble fair - one i can not change my new measure but with she advice i will forfeit all my hope of happiness in this world rather than forfeit she good opinion and that she should think I giddy unsteady or precipitate all i shall further say on the present subject be this that when i have she answer to what i have write i will write to she the whole state of the matter as i shall then be enable to do lovel then must i despair for ever -- o captain tomlinson miss howe hate I -- miss howe -- capt not so perhaps -- when miss howe know you concern for have offend she will never advise that with such prospects of general reconciliation the hope of so many considerable person in both family should be frustrate some little time as this excellent lady have foresee and hint will necessarily be take up in actually procure the license and in peruse and sign the settlement in that time miss howe 's answer may be receive and lady betty may arrive and she no doubt will have weight to dissipate the lady 's doubt and to accelerate the day it shall be my part mean time to make mr harlowe easy all i fear be from mr jame harlowe 's quarter and therefore all must be conduct with prudence and privacy : as you uncle madam have propose she be silent i rejoice in she silence the dear creature think i have actually forgive I in she heart -- but why will she not lay I under obligation to she by the generosity of a explicit declaration -- and yet as that would not accelerate any thing while the license be not in my hand she be the less to be blame -lrb- if i do she justice -rrb- for take more time to descend i propose as on the morrow night to go to town and doubt not to bring the license up with I on Monday morning would she be please to assure I that she would not depart form mr moore 's she should stay at mr moore 's till she have a answer from miss howe i tell she that i hope i might have she tacit consent at least to the obtain of the license i saw by the turn of she countenance that i should not have ask this question she be so far from tacitly consent that she declare to the contrary as i never intend i say to ask she to enter again into a house with the people of which she be so much offend would she be please to give order for she clothes to be bring up hither or should dorca attend she for any of she command on that head she desire not ever more to see any body belong to that house she might perhaps get mr moore or mr bevi to go thither for she and take she key with they i doubt not i say that lady betty would arrive by that time i hope she have no objection to my bring that lady and my cousin montague up with I she be silent to be sure mr lovelace say the captain the lady can have no objection to this she be still silent so silence in this case be assent would she be please to write to miss howe -- sir sir peevishly interrupt -- no more question no prescribing to I -- you will do as you think fit -- so will i as i please i own no obligation to you captain tomlinson you servant recommend I to my uncle harlowe 's favor and be go i take she reluctant hand and besought she only to promise to meet I early in the morning to what purpose meet you have you more to say than have be say i have have enough of vow and protestation mr lovelace to what purpose should i meet you to-morrow morning i repeat my request and that in the most fervent manner name six in the morning ` you know that i be always stir before that hour at this season of the year ' be the half-expressed consent she then again recommend herself to she uncle 's favor and withdraw and thus belford have she mend she market as lord m would say and i worsted mine miss howe 's next letter be now the hinge on which the fate of both must turn i shall be
