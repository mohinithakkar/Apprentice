unnecessary but there be a imply kindness in it and it be a proof that he gentle manners excite that kindness for we the most important fact of the christ 's hospital school-day be the commencement of lamb 's life-long friendship with samuel taylor coleridge two year he senior and the object of he fervent hero-worship most of we perhaps can find the true source of whatever of notable good or evil we have effect in life in the moulding influence of one of these early friendship or admiration it be the boy 's hero the one he love and reverence among he schoolfellow -- not he taskmaster -- that be he true teacher the setter of the broader standard by which he be to abide through life happy the man the foot of whose early idol have not be of clay it be under the quicken influence of the eloquent precocious genius of the inspired charity boy that charle lamb 's ideal and ambition shape themselves out of the haze of a child 's conception coleridge at sixteen be already a poet he ear attuned to the subtlest melody of verse and he hand rival in prelude fragment the effort of he maturer year he be already a philosopher rapt in utopian scheme and mantle hope as enchanting -- and as chimerical -- as the pleasure-dome and cave of ice decree by kublum khan and the younger lad become he ardent disciple lamb quit christ 's hospital prematurely in November 1787 and the companionship of the two friend be for a time interrupted to part with coleridge to exchange the ease and congenial scholastic atmosphere of the hospital for the _ re angusta domus _ for the intellectual starvation of a life of counting-house drudgery must have be a bitter trial for he but the shadow of poverty be upon the little household in the temple on the horizon of the future the blacken cloud of anxiety

dilettante _ in art genial prosperous thoroughly selfish in so far as the family fortune be concern a outsider -- already hold a lucrative post it be not long before charle obtain promotion in the form of a clerkship with the east indium company -- one of the last kind service of samuel salt who die in the same year 1792 -- and with the east indium company he remain for the rest of he work life upon the death of they generous patron the lamb remove from the temple and take lodgings in little queen street holborn and for charle the battle of life may be say to have fairly begin he work as a junior clerk absorb of course the greater part of he day and of he year yet there be breathing-space : there be the long evening with the poet with marlowe drayton drummond of hawthornden and cowley -- the sweetest name which carry a perfume in the mention there be the visit to the play the yearly vacation jaunt to sunny hertfordshire the intercourse with coleridge too be now occasionally renew the latter have go up to cambridge early in 1791 there to remain -- except the period of he six month ' dragoon -- for the nest four year during he visit to london it be the habit of the two schoolfellow to meet at a tavern near smithfield the salutation and cat to discuss the topic dear to both : and it be about this time that lamb 's sonnet to mr siddon he first appearance in print be publish in the morning chronicle the year 1796 be a terribly eventful one for the lamb there be a taint of insanity in the family on the father 's side and on may 27 1796 we find charle write to coleridge these sad word -- doubly sad for the ring of mockery in they : -- my life have be somewhat diversify of late the six week that finish last year and begin this you very humble servant spend very agreeably in a madhouse at hoxton i be get somewhat rational now and do not bite any one but mad i be -lrb- 4 -rrb- charle thanks to the resolution with which he combate the tendency and to the steadying influence of he work at the desk -- despite he occasional murmur he best friend and sheet-anchor in life -- never again succumb to the family malady but from that moment over he small household madness -- like death in milton 's vision -- continually shake its dart and at best only delay to strike -lrb- 5 -rrb- it be in the September of 1796 that the calamity befall which have tinge the story of charle and mary lamb with the sombrest hue of the greek tragedy the family be still in the holborn lodgings -- the mother a invalid the father sink into a second childhood mary in addition to the burden of minister to she parent be work for they support with she needle at this point it will be well to insert a prefatory word or two as to the character of mary lamb and here the witness be in accord there be no jarring of opinion as in she brother 's case for charle lamb have be sorely misjudge -- often it must be admit with ground of reason sometimes by person who might and should have look deeper in a notable instance the heroism of he life have be meanly overlook by one who preach to mankind with the eloquence of the prophet the prime need and virtue of recognize the hero if self-abnegation lie at the root of true heroism charle lamb -- that sorry phenomenon with a insuperable proclivity to gin -lrb- 6 -rrb- -- be a greater hero than be cover by the shield of achille the character of mary lamb be quickly sum up she be one of the most womanly of woman in all its essential sweetness say talfourd she character be like she brother 's while by a temper more placid a spirit of enjoyment more serene she be enable to guide to counsel to cheer he and to protect he on the verge of the mysterious calamity from the depths of which she rise so often unruffled to he side to a friend in any difficulty she be the most comfortable of adviser the wisest of consoler hazlitt say that he never meet with a woman who could reason and have meet with only one thoroughly reasonable -- mary lamb the writings of elium be strew as we know with the tenderest tribute to she worth i wish he say that i could throw into a heap the remainder of we joint existence that we might share they in equal division the psychology of madness be a most subtle inquiry how slight the mysterious touch that throw the smooth-running human mechanism into a chaos of jarring element that transform in the turn of a eyelash the mild humanity of the gentlest of being into the unreasoning ferocity of the tiger the london time of September 26 1796 contain the follow paragraph : -- on Friday afternoon the coroner and a jury sit on the body of a lady in the neighborhood of holborn who die in consequence of a wound from she daughter the precede day it appear by the evidence adduce

necessary for charle and he father to make a immediate change of residence and they take lodgings at pentonville there be a pregnant sentence in one of lamb 's letter that flash with the vividness of lightning into the darkest recess of those early trouble and embarrassment we be he write to coleridge _ in a manner marked _ charle lamb after some week obtain the release of he sister from the hoxton asylum by formally undertake she future guardianship -- a charge which be bear until death release the compact with a steadfastness a cheerful renunciation of what man regard as the crowning blessing of manhood -lrb- 8 -rrb- that have shed a halo more radiant even than that of he genius about the figure -- it be small and mean say sprightly mr mathew -- of the indium house clerk as

because man nowadays if they be put to it could not on the average write as good letter as ever -lrb- the average although we certainly have no lamb and perhaps no walpole or southey to raise it would

of it as elaborate there be time when one be not in a disposition thoroughly to relish good writing i have re-read it in a more favorable moment and hesitate not to pronounce it sublime if there be anything in it approach to tumidity -lrb- which i mean not to infer by elaborate i mean simply labor -rrb- it be the gigantic hyperbole by which you describe the evil of exist society : snake lion hyena and behemoth be carry you resentment beyond bound the picture of the simoom of frenzy and ruin of the whore of babylon and the cry of foul spirit disinherit of earth and the strange beatitude which the good man shall recognize in heaven as well as the particularizing of the child of wretchedness -lrb- i have unconsciously include every part of it -rrb- form a variety of uniform excellence

of the bystander i rather wish you have leave the monody on chatterton conclude as it do abruptly it have more of unity the conclusion of you religious musicg i fear will entitle you to the reproof of you beloved woman who wisely will not suffer you fancy to run riot but bid you walk humbly with you god the very last word i exercise my young novitiate think in ministery of heart-stirring song though not now new to I can not be enough admire to speak politely they be a well-turned compliment to poetry i hasten to read joan of arc etc i have read you line at the beginning of second book -lrb- 1 -rrb- they be worthy of milton but in my mind yield to you religious musing i shall read the whole carefully and in some future letter take the liberty to particularize my opinion of it of what be new to I among you poem next to the musing that begin my pensive sara give I most pleasure the line in it i just allude to be most exquisite they make my sister and self smile as convey a please picture of mr c check you wild wanderings which we be so fond of hear you indulge when among we it have endear we more than anything to you good lady and you own self-reproof that follow delighted we ' t be a charming poem throughout -lrb- you have well remark that charming admirable exquisite be the word expressive of feeling more than convey of idea else i might plead very well want of room in my paper as excuse for generalize -rrb- i want room to tell you how we be charm with you verse in the manner of spenser etc i be glad you resume the watchman change the name leave out all article of news and whatever thing be peculiar to newspaper and confine yourself to ethic verse criticism or rather do not confine yourself let you plan be as diffuse as the spectator and i 'll answer for it the work prosper if i be vain enough to think i can be a contributor rely on my inclination coleridge in read you religious musing i feel a transient superiority over you i _ have _ see priestley i love to see he name repeat in you writings i love and honor he almost profanely you would be charm with he _ sermon _ if you never read 'em you have doubtless read he book illustrative of the doctrine of necessity prefix to a late work of he in answer to paine there be a preface give a account of the man and he service to man write by lindsey he dearest friend well worth you reading _ Tuesday eve _ -- forgive my prolixity which be yet too brief for all i could wish to say god give you comfort and all that be of you household we love and best good-wish to mr c c lamb -lrb- 1 -rrb- coleridge contribute some four hundred line to the second book of southey 's epic iii to coleridge _ June _ 10 1796 with joan of arc i have be delighted amaze i have not presume to expect anything of such excellence from southey why the poem be alone sufficient to redeem the character of the age we live in from the imputation of degenerate in poetry be there no such being extant as burn and bowle cowper and -- -- fill up the blank how you please i say nothing the subject be well choose it open well to become more particular i will notice in they order a few passage that chiefly strike I on perusal page 26 : fierce and terrible benevolence be a phrase full of grandeur and originality the whole context make I feel _ possess _ even like joan herself page 28 : it be most horrible with the keen sword to gore the finely fibr human frame and what follow pleased I mightily in the second book the first forty line in particular be majestic and high-sounding indeed the whole vision of the palace of ambition and what follow be supremely excellent you simile of the laplander by niemus 's lake or balda zhiok or the mossy stone of solfar-kapper -lrb- 1 -rrb- will bear comparison with any in milton for fulness of circumstance and lofty-pacedness of versification southey 's simile though many of 'em be capital be all inferior in one of he book the simile of the oak in the storm occur i think four time to return : the light in which you view the heathen deity be accurate and beautiful southey 's personification in this book be so many fine and faultless picture i be much pleased with you manner of accounting for the reason why monarch take delight in war at the 447th line you have place prophet and enthusiast cheek by jowl on too intimate a footing for the dignity of the former necessarian-like-speaking it be correct page 98 : dead be the dougla cold thy warrior frame illustrious buchan etc be of kindred excellence with gray 's cold be cadwallo 's tongue etc how famously the maid baffle the doctor seraphic and irrefragable with all they trumpery page 126 : the procession the appearance of the maid of the bastard son of orlean and of tremouille be full of fire and fancy and exquisite melody of versification the personification from line 303 to 309 in the heat of the battle have better be omit they be not very striking and only encumber the converse which joan and conrade hold on the bank of the loire be altogether beautiful page 313 : the conjecture that in dream all thing be that seem be one of those conceit which the poet delight to admit into he creed -- a creed by the way more marvellous and mystic than ever athanasius dream of page 315 : i need only _ mention _ those line end with she see a serpent gnawing at she heart they be good imitative line : he toil and toil of toil to reap no end but endless toil and never-ending woe page 347 : cruelty be such as hogarth might have paint she page 361 : all the passage about love -lrb- where he seem to confound conjugal love with create and preserve love -rrb- be very confused and sicken I with a load of useless personification else that ninth book be the finest in the volume -- a exquisite combination of the ludicrous and the terrible i have never read either even in translation but such i conceive to be the manner of dante or ariosto the tenth book be the most languid on the whole consider the celerity wherewith the poem be finish i be astonish at the unfrequency of weak line i have expect to find it verbose joan i think do too little in battle dunoi perhaps the same conrade too much the anecdote intersperse among the battle refresh the mind very agreeably and i be delighted with the very many passage of simple pathos abound throughout the poem -- passage which the author of crazy kate might have write have not master southey speak very slightingly in he preface and disparagingly of cowper 's homer what make he reluctant to give cowper he fame and do not southey use too often the expletive do and do they have a good effect at time but be too inconsiderable or rather become blemish when they mark a style on the whole i expect southey one day to rival milton i already deem he equal to cowper and superior to all live poet besides what say coleridge the monody on henderson be _ immensely good _ the rest of that little volume be _ readable and above mediocrity _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- i proceed to a more pleasant task -- pleasant because the poem be yours pleasant because you impose the task on I and pleasant let I add because it will confer a whimsical importance on I to sit in judgment upon you rhyme first though let I thank you again and again in my own and my sister 's name for you invitation nothing could give we more pleasure than to come but -lrb- be there no other reason -rrb- while my brother 's leg be so bad it be out of the question poor fellow he be very feverish and light-headed but cruikshank have pronounce the symptom favourable and give we every hope that there will be no need of amputation god send not we be necessarily confine with he all the afternoon and evening till very late so that i be steal a few minute to write to you thank you for you frequent letter you be the only correspondent and i might add the only friend i have in the world i go nowhere and have no acquaintance slow of speech and reserve of manners no one seek or care for my society and i be leave alone austin call only occasionally as though it be a duty rather and seldom stay ten minute then judge how thankful i be for you letter do not however burden yourself with the correspondence i trouble you again so soon only in obedience to you injunction complaint apart proceed we to we task i be call away to tea -- thence must wait upon my brother so must delay till to-morrow farewell -- _ Wednesday _ _ Thursday _ -- i will first notice what be new to I thirteenth page : the thrilling tone that concentrate the soul be a nervous line and the six first line of page 14 be very pretty the twenty-first effusion a perfect thing that in the manner of spenser be very sweet particularly at the close the thirty-fifth effusion be most exquisite -- that line in particular and tranquil muse upon tranquillity it be the very reflex pleasure that distinguish the tranquillity of a thinking be from that of a shepherd -- a modern one i would be understand to mean -- a damoeta one that keep other people 's sheep certainly coleridge you letter from shurton bar have less merit than most thing in you volume personally it may chime in best with you own feeling and therefore you love it best it have however great merit in you fourth epistle that be a exquisite paragraph and fancy-full of a stream there be which roll in lazy flow etc murmur sweet undersong ` mid jasmin bower be a sweet line and so be the three next the conclude simile be far-fetched tempest-honored be a quaintish phrase yours be a poetical family i be much surprised and pleased to see the signature of sara to that elegant composition the fifth epistle i dare not _ criticise _ the religious musing i like not to _ select _ any part where all be excellent i can only admire and thank you for it in the name of a christian as well as a lover of good poetry only let I ask be not that thought and those word in young stand in the sun -- or be it only such as young in one of he _ better moment _ might have writ believe thou o my soul life be a vision shadowy of truth and vice and anguish and the wormy grave shape of a dream i thank you for these line in the name of a necessarian and for what follow in next paragraph in the name of a child of fancy after all you can not nor ever will write anything with which i shall be so delighted as what i have hear yourself repeat you come to town and i see you at a time when you heart be yet bleeding with recent wound like yourself i be sore gall with disappointed hope you have many a holy lay that mourning soothe the mourner on he way i have ear of sympathy to drink they in and they yet vibrate pleasant on the sense when i read in you little volume you nineteenth effusion or the twenty-eighth or twenty-ninth or what you call the sigh i think i hear _ you _ again i image to myself the little smoky room at the salutation and cat where we have sit together through the winter night beguile the care of life with poesy when you leave london i feel a dismal void in my heart i find myself cut off at one and the same time from two most dear to I how blest with ye the path could i have tread of quiet life in you conversation you have blended so many pleasant fancy that they cheat I of my grief but in you absence the tide of melancholy rush in again and do its worst mischief by overwhelming my reason i have recover but feel a stupor that make I indifferent to the hope and fear of this life i sometimes wish to introduce a religious turn of mind but habit be strong thing and my religious fervor be confine alas to some fleeting moment of occasional solitary devotion a correspondence opening with you have rouse I a little from my lethargy and make I conscious of existence indulge I in it i will not be very troublesome at some future time i will amuse you with a account as full as my memory will permit of the strange turn my frenzy take i look back upon it at time with a gloomy kind of envy for while it last i have many many hour of pure happiness dream not coleridge of have taste all the grandeur and wildness of fancy till you have go mad all now seem to I vapid -- comparatively so excuse this selfish digression you monody -lrb- 3 -rrb- be so superlatively excellent that i can only wish it perfect which i can not help feel it be not quite indulge I in a few conjecture what i be go to propose would make it more compress and i think more energetic though i be sensible at the expense of many beautiful line let it begin be this the land of song-ennobled line and proceed to otway 's famished form then thee chatterton to blaze of seraph then clothe in nature 's rich array to orient day then but soon the scathing lightning to blighted land then sublime of think to he bosom glow then but soon upon he poor unsheltered head do penury she sickly mildew shed ah where be flee the charm of vernal grace and joy 's wild gleam that lighten o'er he face then youth of tumultuous soul to sigh as before the rest may all stand down to gaze upon the wave below what follow now may come next as detach verse suggest by the monody rather than a part of it they be indeed in themselves very sweet and we at sober eve would round thee throng hang enrapture on thy stately song in particular perhaps if i be obscure you may understand I by count line i have propose omit twenty-four line i feel that thus compress it would gain energy but think it most likely you will not agree with I for who shall go about to bring opinion to the bed of procruste and introduce among the son of man a monotony of identical feeling i only propose with diffidence reject you if you please with as little remorse as you would the color of a coat or the pattern of a buckle where we fancy differ the pixie be a perfect thing and so be the line on the spring page 28 the epitaph on a infant like a jack-o ' - lantern have dance about -lrb- or like dr forster 's -lrb- 4 -rrb- scholar -rrb- out of the morning chronicle into the watchman and thence back into you collection it be very pretty and you seem to think so but may be overlook its chief merit that of fill up a whole page i have once deem sonnet of unrivalled use that way but you epitaph i find be the more diffuse edmund still hold its place among you best verse ah fair delight to rose round in you poem call absence recall -lrb- none more forcibly -rrb- to my mind the tone in which you recite it i will not notice in this tedious -lrb- to you -rrb- manner verse which have be so long delighful to I and which you already know my opinion of of this kind be bowle priestley and that most exquisite and most bowles-like of all the nineteenth effusion it would have better end with agony of care the last two line be obvious and unnecessary and you need not now make fourteen line of it now it be rechristen from a sonnet to a effusion schiller might have write the twentieth effusion ' t be worthy of he in any sense i be glad to meet with those line you send I when my sister be so ill i have lose the copy and i feel not a little proud at see my name in you verse the complaint of ninathoma -lrb- first stanza in particular -rrb- be the best or only good imitation of ossian i ever see you restless gale except to a infant be most sweet be not foodful though very harsh would not dulcet fruit be less harsh or some other friendly bi-syllable in edmund frenzy fierce-eyed child be not so well as frantic though that be a epithet add nothing to the meaning slander _ couch _ be better than squat in the man of ross it _ be _ a better line thus -- if ` neath this roof thy wine-cheered moment pass than as it stand now time nor nothing can reconcile I to the conclude five line of kosciusko call it anything you will but sublime in my twelfth effusion i have rather have see what i write myself though they bear no comparison with you exquisite line -- on rose-leaf bed amid you faery bower etc i love my sonnet because they be the reflect image of my own feeling at different time to instance in the thirteenth -- how reason reel etc be good line but must spoil the whole with I who know it be only a fiction of yours and that the rude dashing do in fact not rock I to repose i grant the same objection apply not to the former sonnet but still i love my own feeling -- they be dear to memory though they now and then wake a sigh or a tear think on diver thing fordo i charge you coleridge spare my ewe-lamb and though a gentleman may borrow six line in a epic poem -lrb- i should have no objection to borrow five hundred and without acknowledge -rrb- still in a sonnet a personal poem i do not ask my friend the aid verse i would not wrong you feeling by propose any improvement -lrb- do i think myself capable of suggest ` era -rrb- in such personal poem as thou bleedest my poor heart -- ` od so -- i be catch -- i have already do it but that simile i propose abridge would not change the feeling or introduce any alien one do you understand I in the twenty-eighth however and in the sigh and that compose at clevedon thing that come from the heart direct not by the medium of the fancy i would not suggest a alteration when my blank verse be finish or any long fancy poem propino tibus alterandum cut-up-andum abridgeandum just what you will with it : but spare my ewe-lamb that to mr siddon ' now you be welcome to improve if it have be worth it but i say unto you again coleridge spare my ewe-lamb i must confess be the mine i should omit _ in editione secunda _ effusion two and three because satiric and below the dignity of the poet of religious musing fifth seventh half of the eighth that write in early youth as far as thousand eye -- though i part not unreluctantly with that lively line -- chaste joyance dancing in she bright blue eye and one or two just thereabout but i would substitute for it that sweet poem call recollection in the fifth number of the watchman better i think than the remainder of this poem though not differ materially as the poem now stand it look altogether confuse and do not omit those line upon the early blossom in you sixth number of the watchman and i would omit the tenth effusion or what would do better alter and improve the last four line in fact i suppose if they be mine i should _ not _ omit 'em but you verse be for the most part so exquisite that i like not to see aught of meaner matter mix with it forgive my petulance and often i fear ill-founded criticism and forgive I that i have by this time make you eye and head ache with my long letter but i can not forego hastily the pleasure and pride of thus converse with you you do not tell I whether i be to include the concione ad populum in my remark on you poem they be not unfrequently sublime

what have past awful to she mind and impressive -lrb- as it must be to the end of life -rrb- but temper with religious resignation and the reasoning of a sound judgment which in this early stage know how to distinguish between a deed commit in a transient fit of frenzy and the terrible guilt of a mother 's murder i have see she i find she this morning calm and serene far very very far from a indecent forgetful serenity she have a most affectionate and tender concern for what have happen indeed from the begin frightful and hopeless as she disorder seem i have confidence enough in she strength of mind and religious principle to look forward to a time when _ even she _ might recover tranquillity god be praise coleridge wonderful as it be to tell i have never once be otherwise than collect and calm even on the dreadful day and in the midst of the terrible scene i preserve a tranquillity which bystander may have construe into indifference -- a tranquillity not of despair be it folly or sin in I to say that it be a religious principle that _ most _ support I i allow much to other favorable circumstance i feel that i have something else to do than to regret on that first evening my aunt be lie insensible to all appearance like one die my father with he poor forehead plaster over from a wound he have receive from a daughter dearly love by he and who love he no less

in to this way of feeling there be not a chair a room a object in we room that will not awaken the keenest grief i must rise above such weakness i hope this be not want of true feeling i do not let this carry I though too far on the very second day -lrb- i date from the day of horror -rrb- as be usual in such case there be a matter of twenty people i do think sup in we room they prevail on I to eat _ with they _ -lrb- for to eat i never refuse -rrb- they be all make merry in the room some have come from friendship some from busy curiosity and some from interest i be go to partake with they when my recollection come that my poor dead mother be lie in the next room -- the very next room a mother who through life wish nothing but she child 's welfare indignation the rage of grief something like remorse rush upon my mind in a agony of emotion i find my way mechanically to the adjoining room and fall on my knee by the side of she coffin ask forgiveness of heaven and sometimes of she for

interest of she little money -lrb- which be formerly pay my father for she board -rrb- wholely and solely to my sister 's use reckoning this we have daddy and i for oar two self and a old maid-servant to look after he when i be out which will be necessary # 170 or # 180 rather a year out of which we can spare # 50 or # 60 at least for mary while she stay at islington where she roust and shall stay during she father 's life for he and she comfort i know john will make speech about it but she shall not go into a hospital the good lady of the madhouse and she daughter a elegant sweet-behaved young lady love she and be take with she amazingly and i know from she own mouth she love they and long to be with they as much poor thing they say she be but the other morning say she know she must go to bethlem for life that one of she brother would have it so but the other would wish it not but be oblige to go with the stream that she have often as she pass bethlem think it likely here it may be my fate to end my day conscious of a certain flightiness in she poor head oftentimes and mindful of more than one severe illness of that nature before a legacy of # 100 which my father will have at christmas and this # 20 i mention before with what be in the house will much more than set we clear if my father a old servant-maid and i can not live and live comfortably on # 130 or # 120 a year we ought to burn by slow fire and i almost would that mary might not go into a hospital let I not leave one unfavorable impression on you mind respect my brother since this have happen he have be very kind and brotherly but i fear for he mind he have take he ease in the world and be not fit himself to struggle with difficulty nor have much accustomed himself to throw himself into they way and i know he language be already charle you must take care of yourself you must not abridge yourself of a single pleasure you have be use to etc and in that style of talk but you a necessarian can respect a difference of mind and love what _ be amiable _ in a character not perfect he have be very good but i fear for he mind thank god i can unconnect myself with he and shall manage all my father 's money in future myself if i take charge of daddy which poor john have not even hint a wish at any future time even to share with I the lady at this madhouse assure I that i may dismiss immediately both doctor and apothecary retain occasionally a compose draught or so for a while and there be a less expensive establishment in she house where she will only not have a room and nurse to herself for # 50 or guinea a year -- the outside would be # 60 you know by economy how much more even i shall be able to spare for she comfort she will i fancy if she stay make one of the family rather than of the patient and the old and young lady i like exceedingly and she love dearly and they as the say be take to she very extraordinarily if it be extraordinary that people who see my sister should love she of all the people i ever see in the world my poor sister be most and thoroughly devoid of the least tincture of selfishness i will enlarge upon she quality poor dear dearest soul in a future letter for my own comfort for i understand she thoroughly and if i mistake not in the most try situation that a human being can be find in she will be find -lrb- i speak not with sufficient humility i fear but humanly and foolishly speak -rrb- -- she will be find i trust uniformly great and amiable god keep she in she present mind to whom be thanks and praise for all he dispensation to mankind c lamb these mention good fortune and change of prospects have almost bring my mind over to the extreme the very opposite to despair i be in danger of make myself too happy you letter bring I back to a view of thing which i have entertain from the beginning i hope -lrb- for mary i can answer -rrb- -- but i hope that _ i _ shall through life never have less recollection nor a fainter impression of what have happen than i have now ' t be not a light thing nor mean by the almighty to be receive lightly i must be serious circumspect and deeply religious through life and by such means may _ both _ of we escape madness in future if it so please the almighty send I word how it fare with sara i repeat it you letter be and will be a inestimable treasure to I you have a view of what my situation demand of I like my own view and i trust a just one coleridge continue to write but do not forever offend I by talk of send I cash sincerely and on my soul we do not want it god love you both i will write again very soon do you write directly -lrb- 1 -rrb- john lamb the jame elium of the essay my relation -lrb- 2 -rrb- a christ 's hospital schoolfellow vii to coleridge _ October _ 17 1796 my dearest friend -- i grieve from my very soul to observe you in you plan of life veer about from this hope to the other and settle nowhere be it a untoward fatality -lrb- speaking humanly -rrb- that do this for you -- a stubborn irresistible concurrence of event -- or lie the fault as i fear it do in you own mind you seem to be take up splendid scheme of fortune only to lay they down again and you fortune be a _ igni fatuus _ that have be conduct you in think from lancaster court strand to somewhere near matlock then jump across to dr somebody 's whose son 's tutor you be likely to be and would to god the dancing demon _ may _ conduct you at last in peace and comfort to the life and labor of a cottager you see from the above awkward playfulness of fancy that my spirit be not quite depressed i should ill deserve god 's blessing which since the late terrible event have come down in mercy upon we if i indulge in regret or querulousness mary continue serene and cheerful i have not by I a little letter she write to I for though i see she almost every day yet we delight to write to one another for we can scarce see each other but in company with some of the people of the house i have not the letter by I but will quote from memory what she write in it : i have no bad terrifying dream at midnight when i happen to awake the nurse sleeping by the side of I with the noise of the poor mad people around I i have no fear the spirit of my mother seem to descend and smile upon I and bid I live to enjoy the life and reason which the almighty have give I i shall see she again in heaven she will then understand I better my grandmother too will understand I better and will then say no more as she use to do ` polly what be those poor crazy moythered brain of yours thinking of always ' poor mary my mother indeed _ never understand _ she right she love she as she love we all with a mother 's love but in opinion in feeling and sentiment and disposition bear so distant a resemblance to she daughter that she never understand she right -- never could believe how much _ she _ love she but meet she caress she protestation of filial affection too frequently with coldness and repulse still she be a good mother god forbid i should think of she but _ most _ respectfully _ most _ affectionately yet she would always love my brother above mary who be not worthy of one tenth of that affection which mary have a right to claim but it be my sister 's gratifying recollection that every act of duty and of love she could pay every kindness -lrb- and i speak true when i say to the hurt of she health and most probably in great part to the derangement of she sens -rrb- through a long course of infirmity and sickness she could show she she ever do i will some day as i promise enlarge to you upon my sister 's excellence ' t will seem like exaggeration but i will do it at present short letter suit my state of mind best so take my kindest wish for you comfort and establishment in life and for sara 's welfare and comfort with you god love you god love we all c lamb viii to coleridge _ November _ 14 1796 coleridge i love you for dedicate you poetry to bowle -lrb- 1 -rrb- genius

the idea but there be a monotony in the affection which people live together or as we do now very frequently see each other be apt to give in to -- a sort of indifference in the expression of kindness for each other which demand that we should sometimes call to we aid the trickery of surprise do you publish with lloyd or without he in either case my little portion may come last and after the

undoubtedly spring from a present feeling somewhat like sincerity that you might melt the most un-muse-ical soul do you not -lrb- now for a rowland compliment for you profusion of oliver -rrb- -- do you not in you very epistle by the many pretty fancy and profusion of heart display in it dissuade and discourage I from attempt anything after you at present i have not leisure to make verse nor

line relative to burn but it be at a time when in my highly agitate and perhaps distorted state of mind i think it a duty to read 'em hastily and burn 'em i burn all my own verse all my book of extract from beaumont and fletcher and a thousand source i burn a little journal of my foolish passion which i have a long time keep -- note ere they past away the little line of yesterday i almost burn all you letter i do as bad -- i lend 'em to a friend to keep out of my brother 's sight should he come and make inquisition into we papers for much as he dwell upon you conversation while you be among we and delighted to be with you it have be he fashion ever since to depreciate and cry you down -- you be the cause of my madness you and you damned foolish sensibility and melancholy and he

memory of it be very confused and taint with unpleasant association burn be the god of my idolatry as bowle of yours i be jealous of you fraternize with bowle when i think you relish he more than burn or my old favorite cowper but you conciliate matter when you talk of the divine chit-chat of the latter by the expression i see you thoroughly relish he i love mr coleridge for she excuse a hundred-fold more dearly than if she heap line upon line out-hannah-ing hannah more and have rather hear you sing do a very little baby by you family fireside than listen to you when you be repeat one of bowle 's sweetest sonnet in you sweet manner while we two be indulge sympathy a solitary luxury by the fireside at the salutation yet have i no higher idea of heaven you company be one cordial in this melancholy vale -- the remembrance of it be a blessing partly and partly a curse when i can abstract myself from thing present i can enjoy it with a freshness of relish but it more constantly operate to a unfavorable comparison with the uninteresting converse i always and _ only _ can partake in not a soul love bowle here scarce one have hear of burn few but laugh at I for read my

can wish in a companion but we spirit be alike poorly we reading and knowledge from the selfsame source we communication with the scene of the world alike narrow never have keep separate company or any company _ together _ never have read separate book and few book _ together _ -- what knowledge have we to convey to each other in we little range of duty and connection how few sentiment can take

can not help occasionally exclaim woe be I that i be constrain to dwell with meshech and to have my habitation among the tent of kedar i know i be noways better in practice than my neighor but i have a taste for religion a occasional earnest aspiration after perfection which they have not i gain nothing by be with such as myself -- we encourage one another in mediocrity i be always longing to be

-lrb- 1 -rrb- a well-known conjuror of the time xiii to coleridge _ February _ 13 1797 you poem be altogether admirable -- part of it be even exquisite in particular you personal account of the maid far surpass anything of the sort in southey -lrb- 1 -rrb- i perceive all its excellence on a first reading as readily as now you have be remove a suppose film from my eye i be only strike with a certain faulty disproportion in the matter and the _ style _ which i still think i perceive between these line and the former one i have a end in view -- i wish to make you reject the poem only as be discordant with the other and in subservience to that end it be politically do in I to over-pass and make no mention of merit which could you think I capable of _ overlook _ might reasonably damn forever in you judgment all pretension in I to be critical there i will be judge by lloyd whether i have not make a very handsome recantation i be in the case of a man whose friend have ask he he opinion of a certain young lady the deluded wight give judgment against she _ in toto _ -- do not like she face she walk she manners find fault with she eyebrow can see no wit in she he friend look blank he begin to smell a rat wind veer about he acknowledge she good sense she judgment in dress a certain simplicity of manners and honesty of heart something too in she manners which gain upon you after a short acquaintance -- and then she accurate pronunciation of the french language and a pretty uncultivated taste in draw the reconcile gentleman smile applause squeeze he by the hand and hope he will do he the honor of take a bit of dinner with mr -- and he -- a plain family dinner -- some day next week for i suppose you never hear we be marry i be glad to see you like my wife however you 'll come and see she ha now be i too proud to retract entirely yet i do perceive i be in some sort straiten you be manifestly wed to this poem and what fancy have join let no man separate i turn I to the joan of arc second book the solemn opening of it be with sound which lloyd would say be silence to the mind the deep prelude strain be fit to initiate the mind with a please awe into the sublimest mystery of theory concern man 's nature and he noblest destination -- the philosophy of a first cause of subordinate agent in creation superior to man the subserviency of pagan worship and pagan faith to the introduction of a purer and more perfect religion which you so elegantly describe as win with gradual step she difficult way northward from bethabara after all this cometh joan a _ publican 's _ daughter sit on a ale-house _ bench _ and mark the _ swinging _ of the _ signboard _ find a poor man he wife and six child starve to death with cold and thence rouse into a state of mind proper to receive vision emblematical of equality -- which what the devil joan have to do with i do not know or indeed with the french and american revolution though that need no pardon it be execute so nobly after all if you perceive no disproportion all argument be vain i do not so much object to part again when you talk of build you fame on these line in preference to the religious musing i can not help conceive of you and of the author of that as two different person and i think you a very vain man i have be re-read you letter much of it i _ could _ dispute but with the latter part of it in which you compare the two joan with respect to they predisposition for fanaticism i _ toto corde _ coincide only i think that southey 's strength rather lie in the description of the emotion of the maid under the weight of inspiration these -lrb- i see no mighty difference between _ she _ describe they or _ you _ describe they -rrb- -- these if you only equal the previous admirer of he poem as be natural will prefer he if you surpass prejudice will scarcely allow it and i scarce think you will surpass though you specimen at the conclusion -lrb- i be in earnest -rrb- i think very nigh equal they and in a account of a fanatic or of a prophet the description of she _ emotion _ be expect to be most highly finish by the way i speak far too disparagingly of you line and i be ashamed to say purposely i should like you to specify or particularize the story of the totter eld of he eventful year all come and go be too general why not make he a soldier or some character however in which he have be witness to frequency of cruel wrong and strange distress i think i should when i laugh at the miserable man crawl from beneath the coverture i wonder i do not perceive it be a laugh of horror -- such as i have laugh at dante 's picture of the famished ugolino without falsehood i perceive a hundred beauty in you narrative yet i wonder you do not perceive something out-of-the-way something unsimple and artificial in the expression voice a sad tale i hate made-dish at the muse ' banquet i believe i be wrong in most of my other objection but surely hail he immortal add nothing to the terror of the man 's death which it be you business to heighten not diminish by a phrase which take away all terror from it i like that line they close they eye in sleep nor know 'twa death indeed there be scarce a line i do not like _ turbid _ ecstasy be surely not so good as what you have write -- troublous turbid rather suit the muddy kind of inspiration which london porter confer the versification be throughout to my ear unexceptionable with no disparagement to the measure of the religious musing which be exactly fit to the thought you be build you house on a rock when you rest you fame on that poem i can scarce bring myself to believe that i be admit to a familiar correspondence and all the license of friendship with a man who write blank verse like milton now this be delicate flattery _ indirect _ flattery go on with you maid of orlean and be content to be second to yourself i shall become a convert to it when ` tis finish this afternoon i attend the funeral of my poor old aunt who die on Thursday i own i be thankful that the good creature have end all she day of suffering and infirmity she be to I the cherisher of infancy and one must fall on these occasion

heartburning i have wellnigh quarrel with charle lloyd and for no other reason i believe than that the good creature do all he could to make I happy the truth be i think he try to force my mind from its natural and proper bent : he continually wish I to be from home he be draw I _ from _ the consideration of my poor dear mary 's situation rather than assist I to gain a proper view of it with religious consolation i want to be leave to the tendency of my own mind in a solitary state which in time past i know have lead to quietness and a patient bearing of the yoke he be hurt that i be not

love he very much i meet company there sometimes -- indiscriminate company any society almost when i be in affliction be sorely painful to I i seem to breathe more freely to think more collectedly to

more be feel than strike the ear -- a terseness a jocular pathos which make one feel in laughter the measure too be novel and pleasing i could almost wonder rob burn in he lifetime never stumble upon it the fourth stanza be less striking as be less original the fifth fall off it have no felicity of phrase no old-fashioned phrase or feeling young hope and love 's delightful dream savor neither of burn nor quarle they seem more like shred of many a modern sentimental sonnet the last stanza have nothing striking in it if i except the two conclude line which be burn all over i wish if you concur with I these thing could be look to i be sure this be a kind of write which come tenfold better recommend to the heart come there more like a neighbor or familiar than thousand of hamnel and zillah and madelon i beg you will send I the holly-tree if it at all resemble this for it must please I i have never see it i love this sort of poem that open a new intercourse with the most despise of the animal and insect race i think this vein may be further open peter pindar have very prettily apostrophize a fly burn have he mouse and he louse coleridge less successfully have make overture of intimacy to a jackass -- therein only follow at unresemble distance sterne and greater cervante besides these i know of no other example of break down the partition between we and we poor earth-born

mole -- people bake mole alive by a slow oven-fire to cure consumption rat be indeed the most despise and contemptible part of god 's earth i kill a rat the other day by punch he to piece and feel a

many more a series of such poem suppose they accompany with plate descriptive of animal torment -- cook roast lobster fishmonger crimp skate etc -- would take excessively i will willingly enter into a partnership in the plan with you i think my heart and soul would go with it too -- at least give it a think my plan be but this minute come into my head but it strike I instantaneously as something

george dyer make I a visit yesternight on purpose to borrow one suppose rationally enough i must say that you have make I a present of one before this the omission of which i take to have proceed only from negligence : but it be a fault i could lend he no assistance you must know he be just now divert from the pursuit of bell letter by a paradox which he have hear he friend frend -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- that learn mathematician -rrb- maintain that the negative quantity of mathematician be _ merae nugae _ -- thing scarcely _ in rerum naturâ _ and smack too much of mystery for gentleman of mr frend 's clear unitarian capacity however the dispute once set a-going have seize violently on george 's pericranick and it be necessary for he health that he should speedily come to a resolution of he doubt he go about tease he friend with he new mathematics he even frantically talk of purchase manning 's algebra which show he far go for to my knowledge he have not be master of seven shilling a good time george 's pocket and -- 's brain be two thing in nature which do not abhor a vacuum now if you could step in in this tremble suspense of he reason and he should find on Saturday morning lie for he at the porter 's lodge clifford 's inn -- he safest address -- manning 's algebra with a neat manuscriptum in the blank leaf run thus from the author it might save he wit and restore the unhappy author to those study of poetry and criticism which be at present suspend to the infinite regret of the whole literary world nb -- dirty book smear leaf and dog ' ear will be rather a recommendation than otherwise nb -- he must have the book as soon as possible or nothing can withhold he from madly purchase the book on tick then shall we see he sweetly restore to the chair of longinus -- to dictate in smooth and modest phrase the law of verse to prove that theocritus first introduce the pastoral and virgil and pope bring it to its perfection that gray and mason -lrb- who always hunt in couple in george 's brain -rrb- have show a great deal of poetical fire in they lyric poetry that aristotle 's rule be not to be servilely follow which george have show to have impose great shackle upon modern genius he poem i find be to consist of two vol reasonable octavo and a third book will exclusively contain criticism in which he assert he have go _ pretty deeply _ into the law of blank verse and rhyme epic poetry dramatic and pastoral ditto -- all which be to come out before christmas but above all he have _ touch _ most _ deeply _ upon the drama compare the english with the modern german stage they merit and defect apprehend that he _ study _ -lrb- not to mention he _ turn _ which i take to be chiefly towards the lyrical poetry -rrb- hardly qualify he for these disquisition i modestly inquire what play he have read i find by george 's reply that he _ have _ read shakspeare but that be a good while since : he call he a great but irregular genius which i think to be a original and just remark -lrb- beaumont and fletcher massinger ben jonson shirley marlowe ford and the worthy of dodsley 's collection -- he confess he have read none of they but profess he _ intention _ of look through they all so as to be able to _ touch _ upon they in he book -rrb- so shakspeare otway and i believe rowe to whom he be naturally direct by johnson 's life and these not read lately be to stand he in stead of a general knowledge of the subject god bless he dear absurd head by the by do i not write you a letter with something about a invitation in it -- but let that pass i suppose it be not agreeable nb it would not be amiss if you be to accompany you _ present _ with a dissertation on negative quantity c l -lrb- 1 -rrb- man while at cambridge publish a work on

the darling of the nine and midwife to they wander babe also we take tea with that learn poet and critic on Tuesday night at half-past five in he neat library the repast will be light and attic with criticism if thou couldst contrive to wheel up thy dear carcase on the Monday and after dine with we on tripe calf ' kidney or whatever else the cornucopia of st clare may be willing to pour out on the occasion might we not adjourn together to the heathen 's thou with thy black back and i with some innocent volume of the bell letter -- shenstone or the like it would make he wash he old flannel

that weigh upon he dear wound pium mater thou shouldst restore light to he eye and he to he friend and the public parnassus should shower she civic crown upon thee for save the wit of a citizen i think i see a lucid interval in george the other night : he break in upon my study just at tea-time and bring with he dr anderson a old gentleman who tie he breeches ' knee with packthread and boast that he have be disappoint by minister the doctor want to see _ I _ for i be a poet he think i might furnish he with a copy of verse to suit he agricultural magazine the doctor in the course of the conversation mention a poem call the epigoniad by one wilkie a epic poem in which there be not one tolerable good line all through but every incident and speech borrow from homer george have be sit inattentive seemingly to what be go on -- hatching of negative quantity -- when suddenly the name of he old friend homer sting he pericranick and jump up he beg to know where he could meet with wilkie 's work it be a curious fact that there should be such a epic poem and he not know of it and he _ must _ get a copy of it as he be go to touch pretty deeply upon the subject of the epic -- and he be sure there must be some thing good in a poem of eight thousand line i be please with this transient return of he reason and recurrence to he old way of think it give I great hope of a recovery which nothing but you book can completely insure pray come on Monday if you _ can _ and stay you own time i have a good large room with two bed in it in the handsomest of which thou shalt repose a-night and dream of spheroide i hope you will understand by the nonsense of this letter that i be _ not _ melancholy at the thought of thy come i think it necessary to add this because you love _ precision _ take notice that we stay at dyer 's will not exceed eight o'clock after which we pursuit will be we own but indeed i think a little recreation among the bell letter and poetry will do you some service in the interval of severer study i hope we shall fully discuss with george dyer what i have never yet hear do to my satisfaction -- the reason of dr johnson 's malevolent stricture on the higher

blessing that george dyer have prepared two ponderous volume full of poetry and criticism they impend over the town and be threaten to fall in the winter the first volume contain every sort of poetry except personal satire which george in he truly original prospectus renounceth forever whimsically foist the intention in between the price of he book and the propose number of subscriber -lrb- if i can i will get you a copy of he _ handbill _ -rrb- he have try he _ vein _ in every species besides -- the spenserian thomsonian masonic and akensidish more especially the second volume be all criticism wherein he demonstrate to the entire satisfaction of the literary world in a way that must silence all reply forever that the pastoral be introduce by theocritus and polish by virgil and pope that gray and mason -lrb- who always hunt in couple in george 's brain -rrb- have a good deal of poetical fire and true lyric genius that cowley be ruin by excess of wit -lrb- a warning to all

the name of a poet anterior to barbor i begged to know what be remain of he work there be nothing _ extant _ of he work sir but by all account he seem to have be a fine genius this fine genius without anything to show for it or any title beyond george 's courtesy without even a name and barbor and dougla and blind harry now be the predominant sound in george 's pium mater and they buzzing exclude politics criticism and algebra -- the late lord of that illustrious lumber-room mark he have never read any of these buck but be impatient till he read they _ all _ at the doctor 's suggestion poor dyer he friend should be careful what spark they let fall into such inflammable matter could i have my will of the heathen i would lock he up from all access of new idea i would exclude all critic

copy from _ homer _ george who have be sit quite inattentive to the doctor 's criticism no sooner hear the sound of _ homer _ strike he pericranik than up he get and declare he must see that poem immediately : where be it to be have a epic poem of eight thousand line and _ he _ not hear of it there must be some thing good in it and it be necessary he should see it for he have touch pretty deeply upon that subject in he criticism on the epic george have touch pretty deeply upon the lyric i find he have also prepare a dissertation on the drama and the comparison of the english and german theater as i rather doubt he competency to do the latter know that he peculiar _ turn _ lie in the lyric species of composition i question george what english play he have read i find that he _ have _ read shakspeare -lrb- whom he call a original but irregular genius -rrb- but it be a good while ago and he have dip into rowe and otway i suppose have find they name in johnson 's life at full length and upon this slender ground he have undertake the task he never seem even to have hear of fletcher ford marlowe massinger and the worthy of dodsley 's collection but he be to read all these to prepare he for bring out he parallel in the winter i find he be also determine to vindicate poetry from the shackle which aristotle and some other have impose upon it -- which be very good-natured of he and very necessary just now now i be _ touching _ so _ deeply _ upon poetry can i forget that i have just receive from cottle a magnificent copy of he guinea epic -lrb- 2 -rrb- four-and-twenty book to read in the dog day i get as far as the mad monk the first day and faint mr cottle 's genius strongly point he to the _ pastoral _ but he inclination divert he perpetually from he call he imitate southey as rowe do shakspeare with he good morrow to ye good master lieutenant instead of _ a _ man _ a _ woman _ a _ daughter he constantly write one a man one a woman one he daughter instead of _ the _ king _ the _ hero he constantly write he the king he the hero -- two flower of rhetoric palpably from the joan but mr cottle soar a higher pitch and when he _ be _ original it be in a most original way indeed he terrific scene be indefatigable serpent asp spider ghost dead body staircase make of nothing with adder ' tongue for bannister -- good heaven what a brain he must have he put as

of burlesque memory i go tremble to see poor cottle so immediately upon the event he be in black and he younger brother be also in black everything wear a aspect suitable to the respect due to the freshly dead for some time after we entrance nobody spake till george modestly put in a question whether alfr be likely to sell this be lethe to cottle and he poor face wet with tear and he kind eye brighten up in a moment now i feel it be my cue to speak i have to thank he for a present of a magnificent copy and have promise to send he my remark -- the least thing i could do so i venture to suggest that i perceive a considerable improvement he have make in he first book since the state in which he first read it to I joseph who till now have sit with he knee cower in by the fireplace wheel about and with great difficulty of body shift the same round to the corner of a table where i be sit and first station one thigh over the other which be he sedentary mood and placidly fix he benevolent face right against mine wait my observation at that moment it come strongly into my mind that i have get uncle toby before I he look so kind and so good i could not say a unkind thing of alfr so i set my memory to work to recollect what be the name of alfred 's queen and with some adroitness recall the well-known sound to cottle 's ear of alswitha at that moment i could perceive that cottle have forget he brother be so lately become a bless spirit in the language of mathematician the author be as 9 the brother as 1 i feel my cue and strong pity work at the root i go to work and beslabber would alfr with most unqualified praise or only qualify my praise by the occasional polite interposition of a exception take against trivial fault slip and human imperfection which by remove the appearance of insincerity do but in truth heighten the relish perhaps i might have spare that refinement for joseph be in a humor to hope and believe _ all thing _ what i say be beautifully support corroborate and confirm by the stupidity of he brother on my left hand and by george on my right who have a utter incapacity of comprehend that there can be anything bad in poetry all poem be _ good _ poem to george all man be _ fine genius _ so what with my actual memory of which i make the most and cottle 's own help I out for i _ really _ have forget a good deal of alfred i make shift to discuss the most essential part entirely to the satisfaction of its author who repeatedly declare that he love nothing better than _ candid _ criticism be i a candid greyhound now for all this or do i do right i believe i do the effect be luscious to my conscience for all the rest of the evening amo be no more hear of till george revive the subject by inquire whether some account should not be draw up by the friend of the decease to be insert in phillip 's monthly obituary add that amo be estimable both for he head and heart and would have make a fine poet if he have live to the expediency

that mopsey miss wesley to dance after you in the hope of have she nonsense put into a nonsensical anthology we have pretty well shake she off by that simple expedient of refer she to you but there be more burr in the wind i come home t ` other day from business hungry as a hunter to dinner with nothing i be sure of _ the author but hunger _ about I and whom find i closet with mary but a friend of this miss wesley one miss benje or bengey -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- i do not know how she spell she name i just come be time enough i believe luckily to prevent they from exchange vow of eternal friendship it

up two pair of stair in east street tea and coffee and macaroon -- a kind of cake -- i much love we sit down presently miss benje break the silence by declare herself quite of a different opinion from d'lsraelus who suppose the difference of human intellect to be the mere effect of organization she beg to know my opinion i attempt to carry it off with a pun upon organ but that go off very flat she immediately conceive a very low opinion of my metaphysics and turn round to mary put some question to she in french -- possibly have hear that neither mary nor i understand french the explanation that take place occasion some embarrassment and much wonder she then fall into a insulting conversation about the comparative genius and merit of all modern language and conclude with assert that the saxon be esteem the purest dialect in germany from thence she pass into the subject of poetry where i who have hitherto sit mute and a hearer only humbly hope i might now put in a word to some advantage see that it be my own trade in a manner but i be stop by a round assertion that no good poetry have appear since dr johnson 's time it seem the doctor have suppress many hopeful genius that way by the severity of he critical stricture in he life of the poet i here venture to question the fact and be begin to appeal to _ name _ but i be assure it be certainly the case then we discuss miss more 's book on education which i have never read it seem dr gregory another of miss bengey 's friend have find fault with one of miss more 's metaphor miss more have be at some pain to vindicate herself -- in the opinion of miss bengey not without success it seem the doctor be invariably against the use of broken or mixed metaphor which he reprobate against the authority of shakspeare himself we next discuss the question whether pope be a poet i find dr gregory be of opinion he be not though miss seward do not at all concur with he in this we then sit upon the comparative merit of the ten translation of pizarro and miss bengey or benje advise mary to take two of they home she think it might afford she some pleasure to compare they _ verbatim _ which we decline it be now nine o'clock

and present i have already borrow you second volume -lrb- 1 -rrb- what please one most be the song of lucy _ simon 's sickly daughter _ in the sexton make I _ cry _ next to these be the description of these continuous echo in the story of joanna 's laugh where the mountain and all the scenery absolutely seem alive and that fine shakspearian character of the happy man in the brother -- that creep about the field follow he fancy by the hour to bring tear down he cheek or solitary smile into he face until the setting sun write fool upon he forehead i will mention one more -- the delicate and curious feeling in the wish for the cumberland beggar that he may have about he the melody of bird although he hear they not here the mind knowingly pass a fiction upon herself first substitute she own feeling for the beggar 's and in the same breath detect the fallacy will not part with the wish the poet 's epitaph be disfigure to my taste by the common satire upon parson and lawyer in the beginning and the coarse epithet of pin-point in the sixth stanza all the rest be eminently good and you own i will just add that it appear to I a fault in the beggar that the instruction convey in it be too direct and like a lecture : they do not slide into the mind of the reader while he be imagine no such matter a intelligent reader find a sort of insult in be tell i will teach you how to think upon this subject this fault if i be right be in a ten-thousandth worse degree to be find in sterne and in many novelist and modern poet who continually put a sign-post up to show where you be to feel they set out with assume they reader to be stupid -- very different from robinson crusoe the vicar of wakefield roderick random and other beautiful bare narrative there be imply a unwritten compact between author and reader : i will tell you a story and i suppose you will understand it modern novel st leon and the like be full of such flower as these -- let not my reader suppose imagine if you can modest etc i will here have do with praise and blame i have write so much only that you may not think i have pass over you book without observation i be sorry that coleridge have christen he ancient marinere a poet 's reverie it be as bad as bottom the weaver 's declaration that he be not a lion but only the scenical representation of a lion what new idea be gain by this title but one subversive of all credit -- which the tale should force upon we -- of its truth for I i be never so affect with any human tale after first reading it i be totally possess with it for many day i dislike all the miraculous part of it but the feeling of the man under the operation of such scenery drag I along like tom pipe 's magic whistle i totally differ from you idea that the marinere should have have a character and a profession this be a beauty in gulliver 's travels where the mind be keep in a placid state of little wonderment but the ancient marinere undergo such trial as overwhelm and bury all individuality or memory of what he be -- like the state of a man in a bad dream one terrible peculiarity of which be that all consciousness of personality be go you other observation be i think as well a little unfounded : the marinere from be conversant in supernatural event _ have _ acquire a supernatural and strange cast of _ phrase _ eye appearance etc which frighten the wedding guest you will excuse my remark because i be hurt and vex that you should think it necessary with a prose apology to open the eye of dead man that can not see to sum up a general opinion of the second volume i do not feel any one poem in it so forcibly as the ancient marinere and the mad mother and the line at tintern abbey in the first c l -lrb- 1 -rrb- of the lyrical ballad then just publish for certain result of lamb 's stricture in this letter see letter xxxvii xxxv to wordsworth _ January _ 30 1801 i ought before this to have reply to you very kind invitation into cumberland with you and

my life i have pass all my day in london until i have form as many and intense local attachment as any of you mountaineer can have do with dead nature the light shop of the strand and fleet street the innumerable trade tradesman and customer coach wagon playhouse all the bustle and wickedness round about covent garden the very woman of the town the watchman drunken scene rattle life awake if you awake at all hour of the night the impossibility of be dull in fleet street the crowd the very dirt and mud the sun shine upon house and pavement the print-shop the old-book stall parson cheapen book

emotion to I but consider what must i have be do all my life not to have lend great portion of my heart with usury to such scene my attachment be all local purely local -- i have no passion -lrb- or

i have need be cautious henceforward what opinion i give of the lyrical ballad all the north of england be in a turmoil cumberland and westmoreland have already declare a state of war i lately receive from wordsworth a copy of the second volume accompany by a acknowledgment of have receive from I many month since a copy of a certain tragedy with excuse for not have make any acknowledgment sooner it be owe to a almost insurmountable aversion from letter-writing this letter i answer in due form and time and enumerate several of the passage which have most affected I add unfortunately that no single piece have move I so forcibly as the ancient mariner the mad mother or the line at tintern abbey the post do not sleep a moment i receive almost instantaneously a long letter of four sweating page from my reluctant letter-writer the purport of which be that he be sorry he second volume have not give I more pleasure -lrb- devil a hint do i give that it have _ not pleased I _ -rrb- and be compel to wish that my range of sensibility be more extend be oblige to believe that i should receive large influx of happiness and happy thought -lrb- i suppose from the l b -rrb- -- with a deal of stuff about a certain union of tenderness and imagination which in the sense he use imagination be not the characteristic of shakspeare but which milton possess in a degree far exceed other poet which union as the highest species of poetry and chiefly deserving that name he be most proud to aspire to then illustrate the say union by two quotation from he own second volume -lrb- which i have be so unfortunate as to miss -rrb- first specimen a father address he son : -- when thou first camest into the world as it befall to new-born infant thou didst sleep away two day _ and blessing from thy father 's tongue then fall upon thee _ the line be thus undermarked and then follow this passage as combine in a extraordinary degree that union of tenderness and imagination which i be speaking of i consider as one of the best i ever write second specimen : a youth after year of absence revisit he native place and think -lrb- as most people do -rrb- that there have be strange alteration in he absence -- and that the rock and everlasting hill themselves be change you see both these be good poetry but after one have be read shakspeare twenty of the best year of one 's life to have a fellow start up and prate about some unknown quality which shakspeare possess in a degree inferior to milton and _ somebody else _ this be not to be _ all _ my castigation coleridge who have not write to I for some month before start up from he bed of sickness to reprove I for my tardy presumption four long page equally sweaty and more tedious come from he assure I that when the work of a man of true genius such as w undoubtedly be do not please I at first sight i should expect the fault to lie in I and not in they etc what be i to do with such people i certainly shall write they a very merry letter write to _ you _ i may say that the second volume have no such piece as the three i enumerate it be full of original thinking and a observe mind but it do not often make you laugh or cry it too artfully aim at simplicity of expression and you sometimes doubt if simplicity be not a cover for poverty the best piece in it i will send you be _ short _ i have grievously offend my friend in the

therefore that could be no objection however i be very glad i do not go because you have leave paris -lrb- i see -rrb- before i could have set out i believe stoddart promising to go with I another

breeches _ this _ my purer mind reject as indelicate and my final resolve be a tour to the lake i set out with mary to keswick without give coleridge any notice for my time be precious do not admit of it he receive we with all the hospitality tality in the world and give up he time to show we all the wonder of the country he dwell upon a small hill by the side of keswick in a comfortable house quite envelop on all side by a net of mountain -- great flounder bear and monster they seem all couchant and asleep we get in in the evening travel in a post-chaise from penrith in the midst of a gorgeous sunshine which transmute all the mountain into color purple etc we think we have get into fairy-land but that go off -lrb- as it never come again while we stay we have no more fine sunset -rrb- and we enter coleridge 's comfortable study just in the dusk when the mountain be all dark with cloud upon they head such a impression i never receive from object of sight before nor do i suppose that i can ever again glorious creature fine old fellow skiddaw etc i never shall forget ye how ye lay about that night like a intrenchment go to bed as it seem for the night but promise that

of lodore in fine i have satisfy myself that there be such a thing as that which tourist call _ romantic _ which i very much suspect before they make such a splutter about it and toss they splendid epithet around they till they give as dim a light as at four o'clock next morning the lamp do after a illumination mary be excessively tire when she get about half way up skiddaw but we come to a cold rill -lrb- than which nothing can be imagine more cold run over cold stone -rrb- and with the reinforcement of a draught of cold water she surmount it most manfully oh its fine black head and the bleak air atop of it with a prospect of mountain all about and about make you giddy and then scotland afar off and the border country so famous in song and ballad it be a day that will stand out like

of she co-operation i dare not think iest i should think wrong so used be i to look up to she in the least and the biggest perplexity to say all that i know of she would be more than i think anybody could believe or ever understand and when i hope to have she well again with I it would be sin against she feeling to go about to praise she for i can conceal nothing that i do from she she be older and wiser and better than i and all my wretched imperfection i cover to myself by resolutely think on she goodness she would share life and death heaven and hell with I she live but for I and i know i have be waste and tease she life for five year past incessantly with my cursed way of go on but even in this upbraiding of myself i be offend against she for i know that she have cleave to I for better for worse and if the balance have be against she hitherto it be a noble trade i be stupid and lose myself in what i write i write rather what answer to my feeling -lrb- which be sometimes sharp enough -rrb- than express my present one for i be only flat and stupid i be sure you will excuse my write any more i be so very poorly i can not resist transcribe three or four line which poor mary make upon a picture -lrb- a holy family -rrb- which we see at a auction only one week before she leave home they be sweet line and upon a sweet picture but i send they only as the last memorial of she

wish to mary 's recovery i have almost forget you repeat invitation suppose that mary will be well and able there be another _ ability _ which you may guess at which i can not promise myself in prudence we ought not to come this illness will make it still more prudential to wait it be not a balance of this way of spend we money against another way but a absolute question of whether we shall

to see _ anything by he _ then pause and look sad he ejaculate poor spencer i begged to know the reason of he ejaculation think that time have by this time soften down any calamity which the bard might have endure why poor fellow say he he have lose he wife lose he wife say i who be you talk of why spencer say he i have read the monody he write on the occasion and _ a very pretty thing it be _ this lead to a explanation -lrb- it could be delay no longer -rrb- that the sound _ spenser _ which when poetry be talk of generally excite a image of a old bard in a ruff and sometimes with it dim notion of sir p sidney and perhaps lord burleigh have raise in my gentleman a quite contrary image of the honorable william spencer who have translate some thing from the german very prettily which be publish with lady di beauclerk 's design nothing like define of term when we talk what blunder might i have fall into of quite inapplicable criticism but for this timely explanation nb -- at the beginning of _ edm _ spenser -lrb- to prevent mistake -rrb- i have copy from my own copy and primarily from a book of chalmer 's on shakspeare a sonnet of spenser 's never print among he poem it be curious as be manly and rather miltonic and as a sonnet of spenser 's with nothing in it about love or knighthood i have no room for remembrance but i hope we do you commission will prove we do not quite forget you c l -lrb- 1 -rrb- wordsworth 's son thoma be bear June 16 1806 xlviii to man _ December _ 5 1806 man you letter date hottentot August the what-was-it come to hand i can scarce hope that mine will have the same luck china canton -- bless we how it strain the imagination and make it ache i write under another uncertainty whether it can go to-morrow by a ship which i have just learn be go off direct to you part of the world or whether the despatch may not be seal up and this have to wait for if it be detain here it will grow staler in a fortnight than in a five month ' voyage come to you it will be a point of conscience to send you none but bran-new news -lrb- the latest edition -rrb- which will but grow the better like orange for a sea-voyage oh that you should be so many hemisphere off -- if i speak incorrectly you can correct I why the simplest death or marriage that take place here must be important to you as news in the old bastile there be you friend tuthill have get away from france -- you remember france and tuthill -- ten to one but he write by this post if he do not get my note in time apprise he of the vessel sailing know then that he have find means to obtain leave from bonaparte without make use of any _ incredible romantic pretence _ as some have do who never mean to fulfil they to come home and i have see he here and at holcroft 's a not you glad about tuthill now then be sorry for holcroft whose new play call the vindictive man be damned about a fortnight since it die in part of its own weakness and in part for be choke up with bad actor the two principal part be destine to mr jordan and mr bannister but mr j have not come to term with the manager -- they have have some squabble -- and bannister shoot some of he finger off by the go off of a gun so miss duncan have she part and mr de camp take he he part the principal comic hope of the play be most unluckily goldfinch take out of the road to ruin -- not only the same character but the identical goldfinch the same as falstaff be in two play of shakspeare as the devil of ill-luck would have it half the audience do not know that h have write it but be displeased at he steal from the road to ruin and those who might have home a gentlemanly coxcomb with he that be you sort go it -- such as lewi be -- do not relish the intolerable vulgarity and inanity of the idea strip of he manner de camp be hoot more than hiss -- hoot and bellow off the stage before the second act be finish so that the remainder of he part be force to be with some violence to the play omit in addition to this a strumpet be another principal character -- a most unfortunate choice in this moral day the audience be as scandalize as if you be to introduce such a personage to they private tea-table besides she action in the play be gross -- wheedle a old man into marriage but the mortal blunder of the play be that which oddly enough h take pride in and exultingly tell I of the night before it come out that there be no less than eleven principal character in it and i believe he mean of the man only for the play-bill express as much not reckon one woman and one -- and true it be for mr powell mr raymond mr bartlett mr h siddon mr barrymore etc to the number of eleven have all part equally prominent and there be as much of they in quantity and rank as of the hero and heroine and most of they gentleman who seldom appear but as the hero 's friend in a farce -- for a minute or two -- and here they all have they ten-minute speech and one of they give the audience a serious account how he be now a lawyer but have be a poet and then a long enumeration of the inconvenience of authorship rascally bookseller reviewer etc which first set the audience a-gaping but i have say enough you will be so sorry that you will not think the best of I for my detail : but news be news at canton poor h i fear will feel the disappointment very seriously in a pecuniary light from what i can learn he have save nothing you and i be hope one day that he have but i fear he have nothing but he picture and book and a no very flourishing business and to be oblige to part with he long-necked guido that hang opposite as you enter and the game-piece that hang in the back drawing-room and all those vandyke etc god should temper the wind to the shear connoisseur i hope i need not say to you that i feel for the weather-beaten author and for all he household i assure you he fate have sour a good deal the pleasure i should have otherwise take in my own little farce be accept and i hope about to be act -- it be in rehearsal actually and i expect it to come out next week it be keep a sort of secret and the rehearsal have go on privately lest by many folk know it the story should come out which would infallibly damn it you remember i have send it before you go wroughton read it and be much pleased with it i speedily get a answer i take it to make alteration and lazily keep it some month then take courage and furbish it up in a day or two and take it in less than a fortnight i hear the principal part be give to elliston who like it and only want a prologue which i have since do and send and i have a note the day before yesterday from the manager wroughton -lrb- bless he fat face he be not a bad actor in some thing -rrb- to say that i should be summon to the rehearsal after the next which next be to be yesterday i have no idea it be so forward i have have no trouble attend no reading or rehearsal make no interest what a contrast to the usual parade of author but it be peculiar to modesty to do all thing without noise or pomp i have some suspicion it will appear in public on Wednesday next for w say in he note it be so forward that if want it may come out next week and a new melodrama be announce for every day till then and a new farce be in rehearsal be put up in the bill now you would like to know the subject the title be mr h no more how simple how take a

wordsworth _ October _ 19 1810 dear w -- mary have be very ill which you have hear i suppose from the montague she be very weak and low-spirited now i be much pleased with you continuation of the essay on epitaph -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be the only sensible thing which have be write on that subject and it go to the bottom in particular i be please with you translation of that turgid epitaph into the plain feeling under it it be perfectly a test but what be the reason we have no good epitaph after all a very striking instance of you position might be find in the churchyard of ditton-upon-thame if you know such a place ditton-upon-thame have be bless by the residence of a poet who for love or money i do not well know which have dignified every gravestone for the last few year with brand new verse all different and all ingenious with the author 's name at the bottom of each this sweet swan of thame have so artfully diversify he strain and he rhyme that the same thought never occur twice -- more justly perhaps as no thought ever occur at all there be a physical impossibility that the same thought should recur it be long since i saw and read these inscription but i remember the impression be of a smug usher at he desk in the interval of instruction level he pen of death as it consist of dust and worm and mourner and uncertainty he have never think but the word death he have often see separate and conjunct with other word till he have learn to speak of all its attribute as glibly as unitarian belsham will discuss you the attribute of the word god in a pulpit and will talk of infinity with a tongue that dangle from a skull that never reach in thought and thorough imagination two inch or farther than from he hand to he mouth or from the vestry to the sounding-board of the pulpit but the epitaph be trim and sprag and patent and please the survivor of thame ditton above the old mumpsimus of affliction sore to do justice though it must be own that even the excellent feeling which dictate this dirge when new must have suffer something in pass through so many thousand application many of they no doubt quite misplace as i have see in islington churchyard -lrb- i think -rrb- a epitaph to a infant who die _ ætatis _ four month with this seasonable inscription append honor thy father and thy mother that thy day may be long in the land etc sincerely wish you child long life to honor etc i remain c lamb -lrb- 1 -rrb- publish in coleridge 's friend feb 22 1810 liii to wordsworth _ August _ 14 1814 dear wordsworth -- i can not tell you how pleased i be at the receipt of the great armful of poetry which you have send I : and to get it before the rest of the world too i have go quite through with it and be think to have accomplish that pleasure a second time before i write to thank you but martin burney come in the night -lrb- while we be out -rrb- and make holy theft of it : but we expect restitution in a day or two it be the noblest conversational poem -lrb- 1 -rrb- i ever read -- a day in heaven the part -lrb- or rather main body -rrb- which have leave the sweetest odor on my memory -lrb- a bad term for the remains of a impression so recent -rrb- be the tale of the churchyard -- the only girl among seven brethren bear out of due time and not duly take away again the deaf man and the blind man the jacobite and the hanoverian whom antipathy reconcile the scarron-entry of the rusticate parson upon he solitude -- these be all new to I too my have know the story of margaret -lrb- at the beginning -rrb- a very old acquaintance even as long back as when i see you first at stowey do not make she reappearance less fresh i do not know what to pick out of this best of book upon the best subject for partial naming that gorgeous sunset be famous i think it must have be the identical one we see on salisbury plain five year ago that draw phillip from the card-table where he have sit from rise of that luminary to its unequalled setting but neither he nor i have gifted eye to see those symbol of common thing glorified such as the prophet see they in that sunset -- the wheel the potter 's clay the washpot the wine-press the almond-tree rod the basket of fig the four-fold-visaged head the throne and he that sit thereon one feeling i be particularly strike with as what i recognize so very lately at harrow church on enter in it after a hot and secular day 's pleasure -- the instantaneous coolness and calming almost transform property of a country church just enter a certain fragrance which it have either from its holiness or be keep shut all the week or the air that be let in be pure country -- exactly what you have reduce into word but i be feel that which i can not express the reading you line about it fix I for a time a monument in harrow church -- do you know it -- with its fine long spire white as washed marble to be see by vantage of its high site as far as salisbury spire itself almost i shall select a day or two very shortly when i be coolest in brain to have a steady second reading which i feel will lead to many more for it will be a stock book with I while eye or spectacles shall be lend I there be a great deal of noble matter about mountain scenery yet not so much as to overpower and discountenance a poor londoner or south-countryman entirely -- though mary seem to have feel it occasionally a little too powerfully for it be she remark during read it that by you system it be doubtful whether a liver in town have a soul to be save she almost tremble for that invisible part of we in she save for a late excursion to harrow and a day or two on the bank of the thame this summer rural image be fast fading from my mind and by the wise provision of the regent all that be countrify in the park be all but obliterate the very color of green be vanish the whole surface of hyde park be dry crumble sand -lrb- _ arabium arenosa _ -rrb- not a vestige or hint of grass ever have grow there booth and drinking-place go all round it for a mile and a half i be confident -- i might say two mile in circuit the stench of liquor _ bad _ tobacco dirty people and provision conquer the air and we be all stifled and suffocate in hyde park -lrb- 2 -rrb- order after order have be issue by lord sidmouth in the name of the regent -lrb- act in behalf of he royal father -rrb- for the dispersion of the varlet but in vain the _ vis unita _ of all the publican in london westminster marylebone and mile round be too powerful a force to put down the regent have raise a phantom which he can not lay there they 'll stay probably forever the whole beauty of the place be go -- that lake-look of the serpentine -lrb- it have get foolish ship upon it -rrb- but something whisper to have confidence in nature and its revival -- at the come of the _ milder _ day these monument shall all be overgrown meantime i confess to have smoke one delicious pipe in one of the cleanliest and goodliest of the booth -- a tent rather -- oh call it not a booth erect by the public spirit of watson who keep the adam and eve at pancra -lrb- the ale-house have all emigrate with they train of bottle mug cork-screw waiter into hyde park -- whole ale-house with all they ale -rrb- in company with some of the guard that have be in france and a fine french girl habit like a princess of bandit which one of the dog have transport from the garonne to the serpentine the unusual scene in hyde park by candle-light in open air -- good tobacco bottled stout -- make it look like a interval in a campaign a repose after battle i almost fancied scar smart and be ready to club a story with my comrade of some of my lie deed after all the firework be splendid the rocket in cluster in tree and all shape spread about like young star in the make flounder about in space -lrb- like unbroke horse -rrb- till some of newton 's calculation should fix they but then they go out any one who could see 'em and the still finer shower of gloomy rain-fire that fall sulkily and angrily from 'em and could go to bed without dream of the last day must be as harden a atheist as -- the conclusion of this epistle get gloomy i have choose this part to desire _ we _ kindest love to mr wordsworth and to dorothea will none of you ever be in london again again let I thank you for you present and assure you that firework and triumph have not distract I from receive a calm and noble enjoyment from it -lrb- which i trust i shall often -rrb- and i sincerely congratulate you on its appearance with kindest

make I very proud with you successive book present -lrb- 1 -rrb- i have be carefully through the two volume to see that nothing be omit which use to be there i think i miss nothing but a character in the antithetic manner which i do not know why you leave out -- the moral to the boy build the giant the omission whereof leave it in my mind less complete -- and one admirable line go -lrb- or something come instead of it -rrb- the stone-chat and the glance sandpiper which be a line quite alive i demand these at you hand i be glad that you have not sacrifice a verse to those scoundrel i would not have have you offer up the poorest rag that linger upon the strip shoulder of little alice fall to have atone all they malice i would not have give 'em a red cloak to save they soul i be afraid lest that substitution of a shell -lrb- a flat falsification of the history -rrb- for the household implement as it stand at first be a kind of tub throw out to the beast or rather throw out for he the tub be a good honest tub in its place and nothing could fairly be say against it you say you make the alteration for the friendly reader but the malicious will take it to himself damn 'em if you give 'em a inch etc the preface be noble and such as you should write i wish i could set my name to it _ imprimatur _ but you have set it there yourself and i thank you i have rather be a doorkeeper in you margin than have they proudest text swell with my eulogy the poem in the volume which be new to I be so much in the old tone that i hardly receive they as novelty of those of which i have no previous knowledge the four yew-tree and the mysterious company which you have assemble there most strike I -- death the skeleton and time the shadow it be a sight not for every youthful poet to dream of it be one of the last result he must have go think on for year for laodamium be a very original poem -- i mean original with reference to you own manner you have nothing like it i should have see it in a strange place and greatly admire it but not suspect its derivation let I in this place for i have writ you several letter name it mention that my brother who be a picture-collector have pick up a undoubtable picture of milton -lrb- 2 -rrb- he give a few shilling for it and could get no history with it but that some old lady have have it for a great many year its age be ascertainable from the state of the canvas and you need only see it to be sure that it be the original of the head in the tonson edition with which we be all so well familiar since i see you i have have a treat in the reading way which cony not every day -- the latin poem of v bourne which be quite new to I what a heart that man have all lay out upon town scene -- a proper counterpoise to _ some people 's _ rural extravaganza why i mention he be that you power of music remind I of he poem of the ballad-singer in the seven dial do you remember he epigram on the old woman who teach newton the a b c which after all he say he hesitate not to call newton 's principium i be lately fatiguing myself with go through a volume of fine word by lord thurlow -- excellent word and if the heart could live by word alone it could desire no better regale but what a ache vacuum of matter i do not stick at the madness of it for that be only a consequence of shut he eye and think he be in the age of the old elizabeth poet from thence i turn to bourne what a sweet unpretend pretty-mannered _ matter-ful _ creature suck from every flower make a flower of everything he diction all latin and he thought all english bless he latin be not good enough for he why be not he content with the language which gay and prior write in i be almost sorry that you print extract from those first poem or that you do not print they at length they do not read to I as they do altogether besides they have diminish the value of the original -lrb- which i possess -rrb- as a curiosity i have hitherto keep they distinct in my mind as refer to a particular period of you life all the rest of you poem be so much of a piece they might have be write in the same week these decidedly speak of a earlier period they tell more of what you have be read we be glad to see the poem by a female friend -lrb- 3 -rrb- the one on the wind be masterly but not new to we be only three perhaps you might have clap a d at the corner and let it have past as a printer 's mark to the uninitiated as a delightful hint to the better instruct as it be expect a formal criticism on the poem of you female friend and she must expect it i should have write before but i be cruelly engage and like to be on Friday i be at office from ten in the morning -lrb- two hour dinner except -rrb- to eleven at night last night till nine my business and office business in general have increase so i do not mean i be there every night but i must expect a great deal of it i never leave till four and do not keep a holiday now once in ten time where i use to keep all red-letter day and some few day besides which i use to dub nature 's holiday i have have my day i have formerly little to do so of the little that be leave of life i may reckon two third as dead for time that a man may call he own be he life and hard work and think about it taint even the leisure hour -- stain Sunday with work-day contemplation this be Sunday and the headache i have be part late hour at work the two precede night and part later hour over a consoling pipe afterwards but i find stupid acquiescence come over I i bend to the yoke and it be almost with I and my household as with the man and he consort -- to they each evening have its glittering star and every sabbath-day its golden sun -lrb- 4 -rrb- to such strait be i drive for the life of life time oh that from that superfluity of holiday-leisure my youth waste age might but take some hour youth want not nb -- i have leave off spirituous liquor for four or more month with a moral certainty of its lasting farewell dear wordsworth o happy pari seat of idleness and pleasure from some return english i hear that not such a thing as a counting-house be to be see in she street -- scarce a desk earthquake swallow up this mercantile city and its gripple merchant as drayton have it bear to be the curse of this brave isle i invoke this not on account of any parsimonious habit the mercantile interest may have but to confess truth because i be not fit for a office farewell in haste from a head that be too ill to methodize a stomach to digest and all out of tune better harmony await you c

read of you two last volume the more i feel it necessary to make my acknowledgment for they in more than one short letter the night piece to which you refer I i mean fully to have notice but the fact be i come so flutter and languid from business tire with thought of it frighten with fear of it that when i get a few minute to sit down and scribble -lrb- a action of the hand now seldom natural to I -- i mean voluntary pen-work -rrb- i lose all presential memory of what i have intend to say and say what i can talk about vincent bourne or any casual image instead of that which i have meditate -lrb- by the way i mast look out v b for you -rrb- so i have mean to have mention yarrow visit with that stanza but thou that didst appear so fair : -lrb- 1 -rrb- than which i think no lovelier stanza can be find in the wide world of poetry yet the poem on the whole seem condemn to leave behind it a melancholy of imperfect satisfaction as if you have wrong the feeling with which in what precede it you have resolve never to visit it and as if the muse have determine in the most delicate manner to make you and _ scarce make you _ feel it else it be far superior to the other which have but one exquisite verse in it -- the last but one or the last two : this be all fine except perhaps that _ that _ of studious ease and generous care have a little tinge of the _ less romantic _ about it the farmer of tilsbury vale be a charming counterpart to poor susan with the addition of that delicacy towards aberration from the strict path which be so fine in the old thief and the boy by he side which always bring water into my eye perhaps it be the worse for be a repetition susan stand for the representative of poor _ rus in urbe _ there be quite enough to stamp the moral of the thing never to be forget -- bright volume of vapor etc the last verse of susan be to be get rid of at all event it throw a kind of dubiety upon susan 's moral conduct susan be a servant-maid i see she trundle she mop and contemplate the whirling phenomenon through blur optics but to term she a poor outcast seem as much as to say that poor susan be no better than she should be -- which i trust be not what you mean to express robin goodfellow support himself without that _ stick _ of a moral which you have throw away but how i can be bring in _ felo de omittendo _ for that end to the boy-builder -lrb- 2 -rrb- be a mystery i can not say positively now i only know that no line oftener or readier occur than that light-hearted boy i will build up a giant with you it come naturally with a warm holiday and the freshness of the blood it be a perfect summer amulet that i tie round my leg to quicken they motion when i go out a-maying -lrb- n b -rrb- i do not often go out a-maying _ must _ be the tense with I now do you take the pun _ young romilly _ be divine the reason of he mother 's grief be remediless -- i never see parental love carry up so high towering above the other love -- shakspeare have do something for the filial in cordelium and by implication for the fatherly too in lear 's resentment he leave it for you to explore the depths of the maternal heart i get stupid and flat and flattering what be the use of tell you what good thing you have write or -- i hope i may add -- that i know they to be good _ a propo _ when i first open upon the just-mentioned poem in a careless tone i say to mary as if put a riddle what be good for a bootless bene -lrb- 3 -rrb- to which with infinite presence of mind -lrb- as the jest-book have it -rrb- she answer a shoeless pea it be the first joke she ever make joke the second i make you distinguish well in you old preface between the verse of dr johnson of the man in the strand and that from the babe in the wood i be think whether take you own glorious line -- and from the love which be in she soul for she youthful romilly which by the love i bear my own soul i think have no parallel in any of the best old ballad and just alter it to -- and from the great respect she feel for sir samuel romilly would not nave explain the boundary of prose expression and poetic feeling nearly as well excuse my levity on such a occasion i never feel deeply in my life if that poem do not make I both lately and when i read it in m no alderman ever long after a haunch of buck venison more than i for a spiritual taste of that white doe you promise i be sure it be superlative or will be when _ dress _ i e print all thing read raw to I in m to compare _ magna parvi _ i can not endure my own writings in that state the only one which i think would not very much win upon I in print be peter bell but i be not certain you ask I about you preface i like both that and the supplement without a exception the account of what you mean by imagination be very valuable to I it will help I to like some thing in poetry better which be a little humiliating in I to confess i think i could not be instruct in that science -lrb- i mean the critical -rrb- as i once hear old obscene beastly peter pindar in a dispute on milton say he think that if he have reason to value himself upon one thing more than another it be in know what good verse be who look over you proof-sheet and leave _ ordebo _ in that line of virgil my brother 's picture of milton be very finely paint -- that be it might have be do by a hand next to vandyke 's it be the genuine milton and a object of quiet gaze for the half-hour at a time yet though i be confident there be no better one of he the face do not quite answer to milton there be a tinge of _ petit _ -lrb- or _ petite _ how do you spell it -rrb- querulousness about it yet hang it now i remember better there be not -- it be calm melancholy and poetical _ one _ of the copy of the poem you send have precisely the same pleasant blending of a sheet of second volume with a sheet of first i think it be page 245 but i send it and have it rectify it give I in the first impetus of cut the leaf just such a cold squelch as go down a plausible turning and suddenly read no thoroughfare robinson 's be entire i wish you would write more criticism about spencer etc i think i could say something about he myself but lord bless I these

put all the noble present i have lately receive in that way the excursion wordsworth 's two last volume and now roderick have come pour in upon I like some irruption from helicon the story of the brave maccabee be already you may be sure familiar to I in all its part i have since the receipt of you present read it quite through again and with no diminished pleasure i do not know whether i ought to say that it have give I more pleasure than any of you long poem kehama be doubtless more powerful but i do not feel that firm footing in it that i do in roderick my imagination go sink and flounder in the vast space of unopened-before system and faith i be put out of the pale of my old sympathy my moral sense be almost outraged i can not believe or with horror be make to believe such desperate chance against omnipotence such disturbance of faith to the center the more potent the more painful the spell jove and he brotherhood of god totter with the giant assailing i can bear for the soul 's hope be not strike at in such contest but you oriental almighty be too much type of the intangible prototype to be meddle with without shudder one never connect what be call the attribute with jupiter i mention only what diminish my delight at the wonder-workings of kehama not what impeach its power which i confess with tremble but roderick be a comfortable poem it remind I of the delight i take in the first reading of the joan of arc it be maturer and better than _ that _ though not better to I now than that be then it suit I better than madoc i be at home in spain and christendom i have a timid imagination i be afraid i do not willingly admit of strange belief or out-of-the-way creed or place i never read book of travel at least not farther than pari or rome i can just endure moor because of they connection as foe with christian but abyssinian ethiop esquimaux dervise and all that tribe i hate i believe i fear they in some manner a mahometan turban on the stage

londoner _ templar _ god help I when i come to put off these snug relation and to get abroad into the world to come i shall be like _ the crow on the sand _ as wordsworth have it but i will not think on it -- no need i hope yet the part i have be most pleased with both on first and second reading perhaps be florinda 's palliation of roderick 's crime confess to he in he disguise the retreat of pelayo 's family first discover he be make king -- for acclamation one form must serve _ more solemn for _ the _ breach _ of _ old observance _ roderick 's vow be extremely fine and he blessing on the vow of alphonso -- towards the troop be spread he arm as if the expand soul diffuse itself and carry to all spirit _ with the act _ its affluent inspiration it strike I forcibly that the feeling of these last line might have be suggest to you by the cartoon of paul at athen certain it be that a better motto or guide to that famous attitude can nowhere be find i shall adopt it as explanatory of that violent but dignified motion i must read again landor 's julian i have not read it some time i think he must have fail in roderick for i remember nothing of he nor of any distinct character as a character -- only fine-sounding passage i remember thinking also he have choose a point of time after the event as it be for roderick survive to no use but my memory be weak and i will not wrong a fine poem by trust to it the note to you poem i have not read again but it will be a take-downable book on my shelf and they will serve sometimes at breakfast or time too light for the text to be duly

revivification of it by blunder barker you have no hand whatever to imagine that at this time of day roger brood over a fantastic expression of more than thirty year ' standing would be to suppose he indulge he pleasure of memory with a vengeance you never pen a line which for its own sake you need die wish to blot you mistake you heart if you think you _ can _ write a lampoon you whip be rod of

a compliment as another man would at the perpetration of a affront but do not lug I into the same soreness of conscience with yourself i maintain and will to the last hour that i never writ of you but _ con amore _ that if any allusion be make to you near-sightedness it be not for the purpose of mock a infirmity but of connect it with scholar-like habit -- for be it not erudite and scholarly to be somewhat near of sight before age naturally bring on the malady you could not then plead the _ obrepen senectus _ do i not moreover make it a apology for a certain _ absence _ which some of you friend may have experience when you have not on a sudden make recognition of they in a casual street-meeting and do i not strengthen you excuse for this slowness of recognition by further accounting morally for the present engagement of you mind in worthy object do i not in you person make the handsomest apology for absent-of-mind people that be ever make if these thing be not so i never know what i

which be the prize at you young gentleman 's academy \* \* \* \* \* but do not go and lay this to you eye you always write hieroglyphically yet not to come up to the mystical notation and conjure character of dr parr you never write what i call a schoolmaster 's hand like mr clarke nor a woman 's hand like southey nor a missal hand like porson nor a all-on-the-wrong-side sloping hand like miss haye nor a dogmatic mede-and-persian peremptory tory hand like rickman : but you write what i call a grecian 's hand -- what the grecian write -lrb- or write -rrb- at christ 's hospital such as whalley would have admire and boyer -lrb- 2 -rrb- have applaud but smith or atwood -lrb- writing-master -rrb- would have horse you for you boy-of-genius hand and you mercantile hand be various by you

the length of this scrawl you will think i have a design upon you optics but i have writ as large as i could out of respect to they -- too large indeed for beauty mine be a sort of deputy-grecian 's hand -- a little better and more of a worldly hand than a grecian 's but still remote from the mercantile i do not know how it be but i keep my rank in fancy still since school-day i can never forget i be a deputy-grecian and write to you or to coleridge besides affection i feel a reverential deference as to grecian still -lrb- 3 -rrb- i keep my soar way above the great erasmian yet far beneath
