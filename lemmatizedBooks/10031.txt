eiro and charmion shadow -- a parable silence -- a fable essay : the poetic principle the philosophy of composition old english poetry memoir of edgar allan poe during the last few year every incident in the life of edgar poe have be subject to microscopic investigation the result have not be altogether satisfactory on the one hand envy and prejudice have magnify every blemish of he character into crime whilst on the other blind admiration would depict he as far too good for human nature 's daily food let we endeavor to judge he impartially grant that he be as a mortal subject to the ordinary weakness of mortality but that he be tempt sorely treat badly and suffer deeply the poet 's ancestry and parentage be chiefly interesting as explain some of the complexity of he character he father david poe be of anglo-irish extraction educate for the bar he elect to abandon it for the stage in one of he tour through the chief town of the united state he meet and marry a young actress elizabeth arnold member of a english family distinguish for its musical talent as a actress elizabeth poe acquire some reputation but become even better know for she domestic virtue in those day the united state afford little scope for dramatic energy so it be not surprising to find that when she husband die after a few year of married life the young widow have a vain struggle to maintain herself and three little one william henry edgar and rosalie before she premature death in December 1811 the poet 's mother have be reduce to the dire necessity of live on the charity of she neighbor edgar the second child of david and elizabeth poe be bear at boston in the united state on the 19th of January 1809 upon he mother 's death at richmond virginium edgar be adopt by a wealthy scotch merchant john allan mr allan who have marry a american lady and settle in virginium be childless he therefore take naturally to the brilliant and beautiful little boy treat he as he son and make he take he own surname edgar allan as he be now style after some elementary tuition in richmond be take to england by he adopt parent and in 1816 place at the manor house school stoke-newington under the rev dr bransby the future poet spend a lustrum of he life neither unprofitably nor apparently ungenially dr bransby who be himself so quaintly portray in poe 's tale of ` william wilson ' describe edgar allan by which name only he know the lad as a quick and clever boy who would have be a very good boy have he not be spoil by he parent meaning of course the allan they allow he a extravagant amount of pocket-money which enable he to get into all manner of mischief still i like the boy add the tutor but poor fellow he parent spoil he poe have describe some aspect of he school day in he oft cite story of ` william wilson ' probably there be the usual amount of poetic exaggeration in these reminiscence but they be almost the only record we have of that portion of he career and therefore apart from they literary merit be on that account deeply interesting the description of the sleepy old london suburb as it be in those day be remarkably accurate but the revision which the story of ` william wilson ' go through before it reach its present perfect state cause many of the author 's detail to deviate widely from they original correctness he schoolhouse in the earliest draft be truthfully describe as a old irregular and cottage-built dwelling and so it remain until its destruction a few year ago the ` soi-disant ' william wilson refer to those bygone happy day spend in the english academy say the teem brain of childhood require no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it the morning 's awaken the nightly summons to bed the conning the recitation the periodical half-holiday and perambulation the playground with its broil its pastime its intrigue -- these by a mental sorcery long forget be make to involve a wilderness of sensation a world of rich incident a universe of varied emotion of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring _ ` oh le bon temps que ce siècle de fer ' _ from this world of boyish imagination poe be call to he adopt parent ' home in the united state he return to america in 1821 and be speedily place in a academy in richmond virginium in which city the allan continue to reside already well ground in the elementary process of education not without reputation on account of he european residence handsome proud and regard as the heir of a wealthy man poe must have be look up to with no little respect by he fellow pupil he speedily make himself a prominent position in the school not only by he classical attainment but by he athletic feat -- accomplishment calculate to render he a leader among lad in the simple school athletics of those day when a gymnasium have not be hear of he be ` facile princep ' be the reminiscence of he fellow pupil colonel t l preston poe he remember as a swift runner a wonderful leaper and what be more rare a boxer with some slight training he would allow the strongest boy in the school to strike he with full force in the chest he teach I the secret and i imitate he after my measure it be to inflate the lung to the uttermost and at the moment of receive the blow to exhale the air it look surprising and be indeed a little rough but with a good breast-bone and some resolution it be not difficult to stand it for swim he be note be in many of he athletic proclivity surprisingly like byron in he youth in one of he feat poe only come off second best a challenge to a foot race say colonel preston have be pass between the two classical school of the city we select poe as we champion the race come off one bright may morning at sunrise in the capitol square historical truth compel I to add that on this occasion we school be beat and we have to pay up we small bet poe run well but he competitor be a long-legged indian-looking fellow who would have outstrip atalanta without the help of the golden apple in we latin exercise in school continue the colonel poe be among the first -- not first without dispute we have competitor who fairly dispute the palm especially one nat howard afterwards know as one of the ripest scholar in virginium and distinguish also as a profound lawyer if howard be less brilliant than poe he be far more studious for even then the germ of waywardness be develop in the nascent poet and even then no inconsiderable portion of he time be give to versify but if i put howard as a latinist on a level with poe i do he full justice poe say the colonel be very fond of the ode of horace and repeat they so often in my hearing that i learn by sound the word of many before i understand they meaning in the lilting rhythm of the sapphic and iambic he ear as yet untutored in more complicated harmony take special delight two ode in particular have be hum in my ear all my life since set to the tune of he recitation : _ ` jam sati terri nivi atque dirce grandini misit pater et rubente ' _ and _ ` non ebur neque aureum mea renidet in dono lacu ar _ ' etc i remember that poe be also a very fine french scholar yet with all he superiority he be not the master spirit nor even the favorite of the school i assign from my recollection this place to howard poe as i recall my impression now be self-willed capricious inclined to be imperious and though of generous impulse not steadily kind nor even amiable and so what he would exact be refuse to he i add another thing which have its influence i be sure at the time of which i speak richmond be one of the most aristocratic city on this side of the atlantic a school be of its nature democratic but still boy will unconsciously bear about the odor of they father ' notion good or bad of edgar poe who have then resume he parental cognomen it be know that he parent have be player and that he be dependent upon the bounty that be bestow upon a adopted son all this have the effect of make the boy decline he leadership and on look back on it since i fancy it give he a fierceness he would otherwise not have have this last paragraph of colonel preston 's recollection cast a suggestive light upon the cause which render unhappy the lad 's early life and tend to blight he prospective hope although mix with member of the best family of the province and naturally endow with hereditary and native pride -- foster by the indulgence of wealth and the consciousness of intellectual superiority -- edgar poe be make to feel that he parentage be obscure and that he himself be dependent upon the charity and caprice of a alien by blood for many lad these thing would have have but little meaning but to one of poe 's proud temperament it must have be a source of constant torment and all allusion to it gall and wormwood and mr allan be not the man to wean poe from such festering fancy : as a rule he be proud of the handsome and talented boy and indulge he in all that wealth could purchase but at other time he treat he with contumely and make he feel the bitterness of he position still poe do maintain he lead position among the scholar at that virginian academy and several still live have favor we with reminiscence of he he feat in swim to which colonel preston have allude be quite a feature of he youthful career colonel mayo record one daring performance in natation which be thoroughly characteristic of the lad one day in mid-winter when stand on the bank of the jame river poe dare he comrade into jump in in order to swim to a certain point with he after flounder about in the nearly frozen stream for some time they reach the pile upon which mayo 's bridge be then support and there attempt to rest and try to gain the shore by climb up the log abutment to the bridge upon reach the bridge however they be dismay to find that its plank flooring overlap the abutment by several foot and that it be impossible to ascend it nothing remain for they but to let go they slippery hold and swim back to the shore poe reach the bank in a exhaust and benumb condition whilst mayo be rescue by a boat just as he be succumb on get ashore poe be seize with a violent attack of vomit and both lad be ill for several week allude to another quite famous swimming feat of he own the poet remark any ` swimmer in the fall ' in my day would have swim the hellespont and think nothing of the matter i swam from ludlam 's wharf to warwick -lrb- six mile -rrb- in a hot June sun against one of the strongest tide ever know in the river it would have be a feat comparatively easy to swim twenty mile in still water i would not think much poe add in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with he of attempt to swim the british channel from dover to calai colonel mayo who have try to accompany he in this performance have to stop on the way and say that poe when he reach the goal emerge from the water with neck face and back blister the fact of this feat which be undertake for a wager have be question poe ever intolerant of contradiction obtain and publish the affidavit of several gentleman who have witness it they also certify that poe do not seem at all fatigue and that he walk back to richmond immediately after the performance the poet be generally remember at this part of he career to have be slight in figure and person but to have be well make active sinewy and graceful despite the fact that he be thus note among he schoolfellow and indulge at home he do not appear to have be in sympathy with he surroundings already dower with the hate of hate the scorn of scorn he appear to have make foe both among those who envy he and those whom in the pride of intellectuality he treat with pugnacious contempt beneath the haughty exterior however be a warm and passionate heart which only need circumstance to call forth a almost fanatical intensity of affection a well-authenticated instance of this be thus relate by mr whitman : while at the academy in richmond he one day accompany a schoolmate to he home where he see for the first time mr helen stannard the mother of he young friend this lady on enter the room take he hand and speak some gentle and gracious word of welcome which so penetrate the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive he of the power of speech and for a time almost of consciousness itself he return home in a dream with but one think one hope in life -- to hear again the sweet and gracious word that have make the desolate world so beautiful to he and fill he lonely heart with the oppression of a new joy this lady afterwards become the confidant of all he boyish sorrow and hers be the one redeeming influence that save and guide he in the earlier day of he turbulent and passionate youth when edgar be unhappy at home which say he aunt mr clemm be very often the case he go to mr stannard for sympathy for consolation and for advice unfortunately the sad fortune which so frequently thwart he hope end this friendship the lady be overwhelm by a terrible calamity and at the period when she guide voice be most requisite she fall a prey to mental alienation she die and be entomb in a neighbor cemetery but she poor boyish admirer could not endure to think of she lie lonely and forsake in she vaulted home so he would leave the house at night and visit she tomb when the night be drear when the autumnal rain fall and the wind wail mournfully over the grave he linger longest and come away most regretfully the memory of this lady of this one idolatrous and purely ideal love of he boyhood be cherish to the last the name of helen frequently recur in he youthful verse the pæan now first include in he poetical work refer to she and to she he inscribe the classic and exquisitely beautiful stanza begin helen thy beauty be to I another important item to be note in this epoch of he life be that he be already a poet among he schoolfellow he appear to have acquire some little reputation as a writer of satirical verse but of he poetry of that which as he declare have be with he not a purpose but a passion he probably preserve the secret especially as we know that at he adoptive home poesy be a forbid thing as early as 1821 he appear to have essay various piece and some of these be ultimately include in he first volume with poe poetry be a personal matter -- a channel through which the turbulent passion of he heart find a outlet with feeling such as be he it come to pass as a matter of course that the youthful poet fall in love he first affair of the heart be doubtless reminiscently portray in what he say of he boyish ideal byron this passion he remark if passion it can properly be call be of the most thoroughly romantic shadowy and imaginative character it be bear of the hour and of the youthful necessity to love it have no peculiar regard to the person or to the character or to the reciprocate affection any maiden not immediately and positively repulsive he deem would have suit the occasion of frequent and unrestricted intercourse with such a imaginative and poetic youth the result he deem be not merely natural or merely probable it be as inevitable as destiny itself between the line may be read the history of he own love the egerium of _ he _ dream -- the venus aphrodite that spring in full and supernal loveliness from the bright foam upon the storm-tormented ocean of _ he _ thought be a little girl elmira royster who live with she father in a house opposite to the allan in richmond the young people meet again and again and the lady who have only recently pass away recall edgar as a beautiful boy passionately fond of music enthusiastic and impulsive but with prejudice already strongly develop a certain amount of love-making take place between the young people and poe with he usual passionate energy ere he leave home for the university have persuade he fair inamorata to engage herself to he poe leave home for the university of virginium charlottesville in the beginning of 1825 lie write frequently to miss royster but she father do not approve of the affair and so the story run intercept the correspondence until it cease at seventeen elmira become the bride of a mr shelton and it be not until some time afterwards that poe discover how it be he passionate appeal have fail to elicit any response from the object of he youthful affection poe 's short university career be in many respects a repetition of he course at the richmond academy he become note at charlottesville both for he athletic feat and he scholastic success he enter as a student on February 11826 and remain till the close of the second session in December of that year he enter the school of ancient and modern language attend the lecture on latin greek french spanish and italian i be a member of the last three class say mr william wertenbaker the recently decease librarian and can testify that he be tolerably regular in he attendance and a successful student have obtain distinction at the final examination in latin and french and this be at that time the highest honor a student could obtain the present regulation in regard to degree have not then be adopt under exist regulation he would have graduate in the two language above-named and have be entitle to diploma these statement of poe 's classmate be confirm by dr harrison chairman of the faculty who remark that the poet be a great favorite with he fellow-student and be note for the remarkable rapidity with which he prepare he recitation and for they accuracy he translation from the modern language be especially noteworthy several of poe 's classmate at charlottesville have testify to he noble quality and other good endowment but they remember that he disposition be rather retire and that he have few intimate associate mr thoma boil one of he fellow-student who have favor we with reminiscence of he say : i be ` acquaint ' with he but that be about all my impression be and be that no one could say that he ` know ' he he wear a melancholy face always and even he smile -- for i do not ever remember to have see he laugh -- seem to be force when he engage sometimes with other in athletic exercise in which so far as high or long jump i believe he excel all the rest poe with the same ever sad face appear to participate in what be amusement to the other more as a task than sport poe have no little talent for draw and mr john willis state that the wall of he college room be cover with he crayon sketch whilst mr boil mention in connection with the poet 's artistic facility some interesting incident the two young man have purchase copy of a handsomely-illustrated edition of byron 's poem and upon visit poe a few day after this purchase mr bolling find he engage in copy one of the engraving with crayon upon he dormitory ceiling he continue to amuse himself in this way from time to time until he have fill all the space in he room with life-size figure which it be remember by those who see they be highly ornamental and well execute as mr bolling talk with he associate poe would continue to scribble away with he pencil as if write and when he visitor jestingly remonstrate with he on he want of politeness he reply that he have be all attention and prove that he have by suitable comment assign as a reason for he apparent want of courtesy that he be try ` to divide he mind ' to carry on a conversation and write sensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time mr wertenbaker in he interesting reminiscence of the poet say : as librarian i have frequent official intercourse with poe but it be at or near the close of the session before i meet he in the social circle after spend a evening together at a private house he invite I on we return into he room it be a cold night in December and he fire have go pretty nearly out by the aid of some tallow candle and the fragment of a small table which he break up for the purpose he soon rekindle it and by its comfortable blaze i spend a very pleasant hour with he on this occasion he speak with regret of the large amount of money he have waste and of the debt he have contract during the session if my memory be not at fault he estimate he indebtedness at $ 2000 and though they be gaming debt he be earnest and emphatic in the declaration that he be bind by honor to pay they at the earliest opportunity this appear to have be poe 's last night at the university he leave it never to return yet short as be he sojourn there he leave behind he such honorable memory that he ` alma mater ' be now only too proud to enrol he name among she most respect son poe 's adopt father however do not regard he ` protégé 's ' collegiate career with equal pleasure : whatever view he may have entertain of the lad 's scholastic success he resolutely refuse to discharge the gambling debt which like too many of he classmate he have incur a violent altercation take place between mr allan and the youth and poe hastily quit the shelter of home to try and make he way in the world alone take with he such poem as he have ready poe make he way to boston and there look up some of he mother 's old theatrical friend whether he think of adopt the stage as a profession or whether he think of get they assistance towards help he to put a drama of he own upon the stage -- that dream of all young author -- be now unknown he appear to have wander about for some time and by some means or the other succeed in get a little volume of poem print for private circulation only this be towards the end of 1827 when he be near nineteen doubtless poe expect to dispose of he volume by subscription among he friend but copy do not go off and ultimately the book be suppress and the remainder of the edition for reason of a private nature destroy what happen to the young poet and how he contrived to exist for the next year or so be a mystery still unsolved it have always be believe that he find he way to europe and meet with some curious adventure there and poe himself certainly allege that such be the case number of mythical story have be invent to account for this chasm in the poet 's life and most of they self-evidently fabulous in a recent biography of poe a attempt have be make to prove that he enlist in the army under a assumed name and serve for about eighteen month in the artillery in a highly creditable manner receive a honorable discharge at the instance of mr allan this account be plausible but will need further explanation of its many discrepancy of date and verification of the different document cite in proof of it before the public can receive it as fact so many fable have be publish about poe and even many fictitious document quote that it behove the unprejudiced to be wary in accept any new statement concern he that be not thoroughly authenticate on the 28th February 1829 mr allan die and with she death the final thread that have bind poe to she husband be break the adopted son arrive too late to take a last farewell of she whose influence have give the allan residence its only claim upon the poet 's heart a kind of truce be patch up over the grave of the deceased lady but for the future poe find that home be home no longer again the young man turn to poetry not only as a solace but as a means of earn a livelihood again he print a little volume of poem which include he longest piece al aaraaf and several other now deem classic the book be a great advance upon he previous collection but fail to obtain any amount of public praise or personal profit for its author feel the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he see he might have to rely largely upon he own exertion for a livelihood poe express a wish to enter the army after no little difficulty a cadetship be obtain for he at the west point military academy a military school in many respects equal to the best in europe for the education of officer for the army at the time poe enter the academy it possess anything but a attractive character the discipline have be of the most severe character and the accommodation in many respects unsuitable for grow lad the poet appear to have enter upon this new course of life with he usual enthusiasm and for a time to have bear the rigid rule of the place with unusual steadiness he enter the institution on the 1st July 1830 and by the follow march have be expel for determine disobedience whatever view may be take of poe 's conduct upon this occasion it must be see that the expulsion from west point be of he own seek highly-colored picture have be draw of he eccentric behavior at the academy but the fact remain that he wilfully or at any rate purposely fling away he cadetship it be surmise with plausibility that the second marriage of mr allan and he express intention of withdraw he help and of not endow or bequeath this adopted son any of he property be the mainspring of poe 's action believe it impossible to continue without aid in a profession so expensive as be a military life he determine to relinquish it and return to he long cherish attempt to become a author expel from the institution that afford board and shelter and discard by he former protector the unfortunate and penniless young man yet a third time attempt to get a start in the world of letter by means of a volume of poetry if it be true as allege that several of he brother cadet aid he effort by subscribe for he little work there be some possibility that a few dollar reward this latest venture whatever may have result from the alleged aid it be certain that in a short time after leave the military academy poe be reduce to sad strait he disappear for nearly two year from public notice and how he live during that period have never be satisfactorily explain in 1833 he return to history in the character of a winner of a hundred-dollar award offer by a newspaper for the best story the prize be unanimously adjudge to poe by the adjudicator and mr kennedy a author of some little repute have become interested by the young man 's evident genius generously assist he towards obtain a livelihood by literary labor through he new friend 's introduction to the proprietor of the ` southern literary messenger ' a moribund magazine publish at irregular interval poe become first a pay contributor and eventually the editor of the publication which ultimately he render one of the most respected and profitable periodical of the day this success be entirely due to the brilliancy and power of poe 's own contribution to the magazine in march 1834 mr allan die and if we poet have maintain any hope of further assistance from he all doubt be settle by the will by which the whole property of the decease be leave to he second wife and she three son poe be not name on the 6th may 1836 poe who now have nothing but he pen to trust to marry he cousin virginium clemm a child of only fourteen and with she mother as housekeeper start a home of he own in the meantime he various writings in the ` messenger ' begin to attract attention and to extend he reputation into literary circle but beyond he editorial salary of about $ 520 bring he no pecuniary reward in January 1837 for reason never thoroughly explain poe sever he connection with the ` messenger ' and move with all he household goods from richmond to new york southern friend state that poe be desirous of either be admit into partnership with he employer or of be allow a larger share of the profit which he own labor procure in new york he earnings seem to have be small and irregular he most important work have be a republication from the ` messenger ' in book form of he defoe-like romance entitle ` arthur gordon pym ' the truthful air of the narrative as well as its other merit excite public curiosity both in england and america but poe 's remuneration do not appear to have be proportionate to its success nor do he receive anything from the numerous european edition the work rapidly pass through in 1838 poe be induce by a literary friend to break up he new york home and remove with he wife and aunt -lrb- she mother -rrb- to philadelphia the quaker city be at that time quite a hotb for magazine project and among the many new periodical poe be enable to earn some kind of a live to burton 's ` gentleman 's magazine ' for 1837 he have contribute a few article but in 1840 he arrange with its proprietor to take up the editorship poe have long seek to start a magazine of he own and it be probably with a view to such a eventuality that one of he condition for accept the editorship of the ` gentleman 's magazine ' be that he name should appear upon the title-page poe work hard at the ` gentleman 's ' for some time contribute to its column much of he best work ultimately however he come to loggerheads with its proprietor burton who dispose of the magazine to a mr graham a rival publisher at this period poe collect into two volume and get they publish as ` tale of the grotesque and arabesque ' twenty-five of he story but he never receive any remuneration save a few copy of the volume for the work for some time the poet strive most earnestly to start a magazine of he own but all he effort fail owe to he want of capital the purchaser of burton 's magazine have amalgamate it with another issue the two under the title of ` graham 's magazine ' poe become a contributor to the new venture and in November of the year 1840 consent to assume the post of editor under poe 's management assist by the liberality of mr graham ` graham 's magazine ' become a grand success to its page poe contribute some of he finest and most popular tale and attract to the publication the pen of many of the best contemporary author the public be not slow in show its appreciation of ` pabulum ' put before it and so its director aver in less than two year the circulation rise from five to fifty-two thousand copy a great deal of this success be due to poe 's weird and wonderful story still more perhaps to he trenchant critique and he startling theory anent cryptology as regard the tale now issue in ` graham 's ' attention may especially be draw to the world-famed murder in the rue morgue the first of a series -- ` une espèce de trilogie ' as baudelaire style they -- illustrative of a analytic phase of poe 's peculiar mind this ` trilogie ' of tale of which the later two be the purloined letter and the mystery of marie roget be avowedly write to prove the capability of solve the puzzling riddle of life by identify another person 's mind by we own by try to follow the process by which a person would reason out a certain thing poe propound the theory that another person might ultimately arrive as it be at that person 's conclusion indeed penetrate the innermost arcanum of he brain and read he most secret thought whilst the public be still ponder over the startling proposition and enjoy perusal of its apparent proof poe still further increase he popularity and draw attention to he work by put forward the attractive but less dangerous theorem that human ingenuity could not construct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve this cryptographic assertion be make in connection with what the public deem a challenge and poe be inundate with cipher more or less abstruse demand solution in the correspondence which ensue in ` graham 's magazine ' and other publication poe be universally acknowledge to have prove he case so far as he own personal ability to unriddle such mystery be concerned although he have never offer to undertake such a task he triumphantly solve every cryptogram send to he with one exception and that exception he prove conclusively be only a imposture for which no solution be possible the outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor be the fascinating story of the gold bug a story in which the discovery of hidden treasure be bring about by the unriddling of a intricate cipher the year 1841 may be deem the brightest of poe 's checkered career on every side acknowledge to be a new and brilliant literary light chief editor of a powerful magazine admire fear and envy with a reputation already spread rapidly in europe as well as in he native continent the poet might well have hope for prosperity and happiness but dark canker be gnawing he heart he pecuniary position be still embarrassing he writings which be the result of slow and careful labor be poorly pay and he remuneration as joint editor of ` graham 's ' be small he be not permit to have undivided control and but a slight share of the profit of the magazine he have render world-famous whilst a fearful domestic calamity wreck all he hope and cause he to resort to that refuge of the broken-hearted -- to that drink which finally destroy he prospects and he life edgar poe 's own account of this terrible malady and its cause be make towards the end of he career its truth have never be disprove and in its most important point it have be thoroughly substantiate to a correspondent he write in January 1848 : you say ` can you _ hint _ to I what be that terrible evil which cause the irregularity so profoundly lament ' yes i can do more than hint this _ evil _ be the greatest which can befall a man six year ago a wife whom i love as no man ever love before rupture a blood-vessel in singing she life be despair of i take leave of she forever and undergo all the agony of she death she recover partially and i again hope at the end of a year the vessel break again i go through precisely the same scene then again -- again -- and even once again at vary interval each time i feel all the agony of she death -- and at each accession of the disorder i love she more dearly and cling to she life with more desperate pertinacity but i be constitutionally sensitive -- nervous in a very unusual degree i become insane with long interval of horrible sanity during these fit of absolute unconsciousness i drink -- god only know how often or how much as a matter of course my enemy refer the insanity to the drink rather than the drink to the insanity i have indeed nearly abandon all hope of a permanent cure when i find one in the _ death _ of my wife this i can and do endure as become a man it be the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope and despair which i could _ not _ longer have endure without total loss of reason the poet at this period be reside in a small but elegant little home superintend by he ever-faithful guardian he wife 's mother -- he own aunt mr clemm the lady whom he so gratefully address in after year in the well-known sonnet as more than mother unto I but a change come o'er the spirit of he dream he severance from ` graham 's ' owe to we know not what cause take place and he fragile scheme of happiness fade as fast as the sunset he means melt away and he become unfitted by mental trouble and ill-health to earn more the terrible strait to which he and he unfortunate beloved one be reduce may be comprehend after perusal of these word from mr a b harri 's reminiscence refer to the poet 's residence in spring garden philadelphium this writer say : it be during they stay there that mr poe while sing one evening rupture a blood-vessel and after that she suffer a hundred death she could not bear the slightest exposure and need the utmost care and all those convenience as to apartment and surroundings which be so important in the case of a invalid be almost matter of life and death to she and yet the room where she lay for week hardly able to breathe except as she be fan be a little narrow place with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that she head almost touch it but no one dare to speak mr poe be

and very great advantage of sound by the modern usage of rhyme alliteration be nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancient have in common with we it will be see that much of the melody of ` the raven ' arise from alliteration and the studious use of similar sound in unusual place in regard to its measure it may be note that if all the verse be like the second they might properly be place

\* \* \* \* introduction to poem -- 1831 letter to mr b -- west point 1831 dear b -- believe only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second edition -- that small portion i think it as well to include in the present book as to republish by itself i have therefore herein combine ` al aaraaf ' and ` tamerlane ' with other poem hitherto unprinted nor have i hesitate to insert from the ` minor poem ' now omit whole line and even passage to the end that be place in a fairer light and the trash shake from they in which they be imbed they may have some chance of be see by posterity it have be say that a good critique on a poem may be write by one who be no poet himself this accord to _ you _ idea and _ mine _ of poetry i feel to be false -- the less poetical the critic the less just the critique and the converse on this account and because there be but few b -- s in the world i would be as much ashamed of the world 's good opinion as proud of you own another than yourself might here observe ` shakespeare be in possession of the world 's good opinion and yet shakespeare be the greatest of poet it appear then that the world judge correctly why should you be ashamed of they favorable judgment ' the difficulty lie in the interpretation of the word ` judgment ' or ` opinion ' the opinion be the world 's truly but it may be call theirs as a man would call a book he have buy it he do not write the book but it be he they do not originate the opinion but it be theirs a fool for example think shakespeare a great poet -- yet the fool have never read shakespeare but the fool 's neighbor who be a step higher on the ande of the mind whose head -lrb- that be to say he more exalted thought -rrb- be too far above the fool to be see or understand but whose foot -lrb- by which i mean he every-day action -rrb- be sufficiently near to be discern and by means of which that superiority be ascertain which _ but _ for they would never have be discover -- this neighbor assert that shakespeare be a great poet -- the fool believe he and it be henceforward he _ opinion _ this neighbor 's own opinion have in like manner be adopt from one above _ he _ and so ascendingly to a few gifted individual who kneel around the summit behold face to face the master spirit who stand upon the pinnacle you be aware of the great barrier in the path of a american writer he be read if at all in preference to the combined and established wit of the world i say establish for it be with literature as with law or empire -- a established name be a estate in tenure or a throne in possession besides one might suppose that book like they author improve by travel -- they have cross the sea be with we so great a distinction we antiquary abandon time for distance we very fops glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page where the mystic character which spell london pari or genoa be precisely so many letter of recommendation i mention just now a vulgar error as regard criticism i think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of he own writings be another i remark before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a critique upon poetry therefore a bad poet would i grant make a false critique and he self-love would infallibly bias he little judgment in he favor but a poet who be indeed a poet could not i think fail of make a just critique whatever should be deduct on the score of self-love might be replace on account of he intimate acquaintance with the subject in short we have more instance of false criticism than of just where one 's own writings be the test simply because we have more bad poet than good there be of course many objection to what i say : milton be a great example of the contrary but he opinion with respect to the ` paradise regain ' be by no means fairly ascertain by what trivial circumstance man be often lead to assert what they do not really believe perhaps a inadvertent word have descend to posterity but in fact the ` paradise regain ' be little if at all inferior to the ` paradise lose ' and be only suppose so to be because man do not like epic whatever they may say to the contrary and read those of milton in they natural order be too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second i dare say milton prefer ` comus ' to either -- if so -- justly as i be speaking of poetry it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern history -- the heresy of what be call very foolishly the lake school some year ago i might have be induce by a occasion like the present to attempt a formal refutation of they doctrine at present it would be a work of supererogation the wise must bow to the wisdom of such man as coleridge and southey but be wise have laugh at poetical theory so prosaically exemplify aristotle with singular assurance have declare poetry the most philosophical of all writings -- but it require a wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical he seem to think that the end of poetry be or should be instruction yet it be a truism that the end of we existence be happiness if so the end of every separate part of we existence everything connect with we existence should be still happiness therefore the end of instruction should be happiness and happiness be another name for pleasure -- therefore the end of instruction should be pleasure : yet we see the above-mentioned opinion imply precisely the reverse to proceed : _ ceteris paribus _ he who please be of more importance to he fellow-men than he who instruct since utility be happiness and pleasure be the end already obtain which instruction be merely the means of obtain i see no reason then why we metaphysical poet should plume themselves so much on the utility of they work unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view in which case sincere respect for they piety would not allow I to express my contempt for they judgment contempt which it would be difficult to conceal since they writings be professedly to be understand by the few and it be the many who stand in need of salvation in such case i should no doubt be tempt to think of the devil in ` melmoth ' who labor indefatigably through three octavo volume to accomplish the destruction of one or two soul while any common devil would have demolish one or two thousand against the subtlety which would make poetry a study -- not a passion -- it become the metaphysician to reason -- but the poet to protest yet wordsworth and coleridge be man in year the one imbue in contemplation from he childhood the other a giant in intellect and learn the diffidence then with which i venture to dispute they authority would be overwhelming do i not feel from the bottom of my heart that learning have little to do with the imagination -- intellect with the passion -- or age with poetry ` trifle like straw upon the surface flow he who would search for pearl must dive below ' be line which have do much mischief as regard the greater truth man oftener err by seek they at the bottom than at the top truth lie in the huge abyss where wisdom be seek -- not in the palpable palace where she be find the ancient be not always right in hide the goddess in a well witness the light which bacon have throw upon philosophy witness the principle of we divine faith -- that moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of a man we see a instance of coleridge 's liability to err in he ` biographia literaria ' -- professedly he literary life and opinion but in fact a treatise ` de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis ' he go wrong by reason of he very profundity and of he error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a star he who regard it directly and intensely see it be true the star but it be the star without a ray -- while he who survey it less inquisitively be conscious of all for which the star be useful to we below -- its brilliancy and its beauty as to wordsworth i have no faith in he that he have in youth the feeling of a poet i believe -- for there be glimpse of extreme delicacy in he writings -- -lrb- and delicacy be the poet 's own kingdom -- he ` el dorado ' -rrb- -- but they have the appearance of a better day recollect and glimpse at best be little evidence of present poetic fire we know that a few straggle flower spring up daily in the crevice of the glacier he be to blame in wear away he youth in contemplation with the end of poetize in he manhood with the increase of he judgment the light which should make it apparent have fade away he judgment consequently be too correct this may not be understand -- but the old goth of germany would have understand it who use to debate matter of importance to

destiny be lose in immensity whose cognizance of ourselves be akin with we own cognizance of the _ animalculæ _ which infest the brain a be which we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these _ animalculæ _ must thus regard we we telescope and we mathematical investigation assure we on every hand notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood that space and therefore that bulk be a important consideration in the eye of the almighty the cycle in which the star move be those best adapt for the evolution without collision of the greatest possible number of body the form of those body be accurately such as within a give surface to include the greatest possible amount of matter while the surface themselves be so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodate on the same surface otherwise arrange nor be it any argument against bulk be a object with god that space itself be infinite for there may be a infinity of matter to fill it and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality be a principle -- indeed as far as we judgment extend the _ lead _ principle in the operation of deity it be scarcely logical to imagine it confine to the region of the minute where we daily trace it and not extend to those of the August as we find cycle within cycle without end yet all revolve around one far-distant center which be the godhead may we not analogically suppose in the same manner life within life the less within the greater and all within the spirit divine in short we be madly err through self-esteem in believe man in either he temporal or future destiny to be of more moment in the universe than that vast clod of the valley which he till and contemn and to which he deny a soul for no more profound reason than that he do not behold it in operation -lrb- 2 -rrb- these fancy and such as these have always give to my meditation among the mountain and the forest by the river and the ocean a tinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic my wanderings amid such scene have be many and far-searching and often solitary and the interest with which i have stray through many a dim deep valley or gaze into the reflect heaven of many a bright lake have be a interest greatly deepen by the thought that i have stray and gaze _ alone _ what flippant frenchman -lrb- 3 -rrb- be it who say in allusion to the well known work of zimmermann that _ la solitude est une belle choose mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitude est une belle choose _ the epigram can not be gainsay but the necessity be a thing that do not exist it be during one of my lonely journeying amid a far distant region of mountain lock within mountain and sad river and melancholy tarn writhe or sleep within all that i chanced upon a certain rivulet and island i come upon they suddenly in the leafy June and throw myself upon the turf beneath the branch of a unknown odorous shrub that i might doze as i contemplate the scene i feel that thus only should i look upon it such be the character of phantasm which it wear on all side save to the west where the sun be about sink arise the verdant wall of the forest the little river which turn sharply in its course and be thus immediately lose to sight seem to have no exit from its prison but to be absorb by the deep green foliage of the tree to the east while in the opposite quarter -lrb- so it appear to I as i lay at length and glance upward -rrb- there pour down noiselessly and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountain of the sky about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision take in one small circular island profusely verdure repose upon the bosom of the stream so blended bank and shadow there that each seem pendulous in air -- so mirror-like be the glassy water that it be scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal dominion begin my position enable I to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremity of the islet and i observe a singularly-marked difference in they aspect the latter be all one radiant harem of garden beauty it glow and blush beneath the eye of the slant sunlight and fairly laugh with flower the grass be short springy sweet-scented and asphodel-interspersed the tree be lithe mirthful erect bright slender and graceful of eastern figure and foliage with bark smooth glossy and parti-colored there seem a deep sense of life and joy about all and although no air blow from out the heaven yet everything have motion through the gentle sweepings to and fro of innumerable butterfly that might have be mistake for tulip with wing -lrb- 4 -rrb- the other or eastern end of the isle be whelm in the blackest shade a sombre yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervade all thing the tree be dark in color and mournful in form and attitude -- wreathe themselves into sad solemn and spectral shape that convey idea of mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wear the deep tint of the cypress and the head of its blade hang droopingly and hither and thither among it be many small unsightly hillock low and narrow and not very long that have the aspect of grave but be not although over and all about they the rue and the rosemary clamber the shades of the tree fall heavily upon the water and seem to bury itself therein impregnate the depths of the element with darkness i fancy that each shadow as the sun descend lower and lower separated itself sullenly from the trunk that give it birth and thus become absorb by the stream while other shadow issue momently from the tree take the place of they predecessor thus entomb this idea have once seize upon my fancy greatly excite it and i lose myself forthwith in reverie if ever island be enchant say i to myself this be it this be the haunt of the few gentle fay who remain from the wreck of the race be these green tomb theirs -- or do they yield up they sweet life as mankind yield up they own in die do they not rather waste away mournfully render unto god little by little they existence as these tree render up shadow after shadow exhaust they substance unto dissolution what the waste tree be to the water that imbibe its shade grow thus blacker by what it prey upon may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulf it as i thus muse with half-shut eye while the sun sink rapidly to rest and eddy current career round and round the island bearing upon they bosom large dazzling white flake of the bark of the sycamore flake which in they multiform position upon the water a quick imagination might have convert into anything it please while i thus muse it appear to I that the form of one of those very fays about whom i have be ponder make its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island she stand erect in a singularly fragile canoe and urge it with the mere phantom of a oar while within the influence of the linger sunbeam she attitude seem indicative of joy but sorrow deform it as she pass within the shade slowly she glide along and at length round the islet and re-enter the region of light the revolution which have just be make by the fay continue i musingly be the cycle of the brief year of she life she have float through she winter and through she summer she be a year nearer unto death : for i do not fail to see that as she come into the shade she shadow fall from she and be swallow up in the dark water make its blackness more black and again the boat appear and the fay but about the attitude of the latter there be more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy she float again from out the light and into the gloom -lrb- which deepen momently -rrb- and again she shadow fall from she into the ebony water and become absorb into its blackness and again and again she make the circuit of the island -lrb- while the sun rush down to he slumber -rrb- and at each issue into the light there be more sorrow about she person while it grow feebler and far fainter and more indistinct and at each passage into the gloom there fall from she a darker shade which become whelm in a shadow more black but at length when the sun have utterly depart the fay now the mere ghost of she former self go disconsolately with she boat into the region of the ebony flood and that she issue thence at all i can not say for darkness fall over all thing and i beheld she magical figure no more -lrb- footnote 1

spiritual vision be it not at all point arrest by the continuous golden wall of the universe -- the wall of the myriad of the shine body that mere number have appear to blend into unity ` oino ' i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter be no dream ` agatho ' there be no dream in aidenn -- but it be here whisper that of this infinity of matter the _ sole _ purpose be to afford infinite spring at which the soul may allay the thirst _ to know _ which be forever unquenchable within it -- since to quench it would be to extinguish the soul 's self question I then my oino freely and without fear come we will leave to the leave the loud harmony of the pleiade and swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadow beyond orion where for pansy and violet and heart 's - ease be the bed of the triplicate and triple-tinted sun ` oino ' and now agatho as we proceed instruct I -- speak to I in the earth 's familiar tone i understand not what you hint to I just now of the mode or of the method of what during mortality we be accustom to call creation do you mean to say that the creator be not god ` agatho ' i mean to say that the deity do not create ` oino ' explain ` agatho ' in the begin only he create the seeming creature which be now throughout the universe so perpetually spring into be can only be consider as the mediate or indirect not as the direct or immediate result of the divine creative power ` oino ' among man my agatho this idea would be consider heretical in the extreme ` agatho ' among the angel my oino it be see to be simply true ` oino ' i can comprehend you thus far -- that certain operation of what we term nature or the natural law will under certain condition give rise to that which have all the _ appearance _ of creation shortly before the final overthrow of the earth there be i well remember many very successful experiment in what some philosopher be weak enough to denominate the creation of animalculæ ` agatho ' the case of which you speak be in fact instance of the secondary creation and of the _ only _ species of creation which have ever be since the first word speak into existence the first law ` oino ' be not the starry world that from the abyss of nonentity burst hourly forth into the heaven -- be not these star agathos the immediate handiwork of the king ` agatho ' let I endeavor my oino to lead you step by step to the conception i intend you be well aware that as no thought can perish so no act be without infinite result we move we hand for example when we be dweller on the earth and in so do we give vibration to the atmosphere which engirdle it this vibration be indefinitely extend till it give impulse to every particle of the earth 's air which thenceforward _ and forever _ be actuate by the one movement of the hand this fact the mathematician of we globe well know they make the special effect indeed work in the fluid by special impulse the subject of exact calculation -- so that it become easy to determine in what precise period a impulse of give extent would engirdle the orb and impress -lrb- forever -rrb- every atom of the atmosphere circumambient retrograde they find no difficulty from a give effect under give condition in determine the value of the original impulse now the mathematician who see that the result of any give impulse be absolutely endless -- and who see that a portion of these result be accurately traceable through the agency of algebraic analysis -- who see too the facility of the retrogradation -- these man see at the same time that this species of analysis itself have within itself a capacity for indefinite progress -- that there be no bound conceivable to its advancement and applicability except within the intellect of he who advance or apply it but at this point we mathematician pause ` oino ' and why agatho should they have proceed ` agatho ' because there be some consideration of deep interest beyond it be deducible from what they know that to a being of infinite understanding -- one to whom the _ perfection _ of the algebraic analysis lay unfold -- there could be no difficulty in trace every impulse give the air -- and the ether through the air -- to the remotest consequence at any even infinitely remote epoch of time it be indeed demonstrable that every such impulse _ give the air _ must _ in the end _ impress every individual thing that exist _ within the universe _ -- and the being of infinite understanding -- the be whom we have imagine -- might trace the remote undulation of the impulse -- trace they upward and onward in they influence upon all particle of all matter -- upward and onward forever in they modification of old form -- or in other word _ in they creation of new _ -- until he find they reflect -- unimpressive _ at last _ -- back from the throne of the godhead and not only could such a be do this but at any epoch should a give result be afford he -- should one of these numberless comet for example be present to he inspection -- he could have no difficulty in determine by the analytic retrogradation to what original impulse it be due this power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection -- this faculty of refer at _ all _ epoch _ all _ effect to _ all _ cause -- be of course the prerogative of the deity alone -- but in every variety of degree short of the absolute perfection be the power itself exercise by the whole host of the angelic intelligence ` oino ' but you speak merely of impulse upon the air ` agatho ' in speaking of the air i refer only to the earth : but the general proposition have reference to impulse upon the ether -- which since it pervade and alone pervade all space be thus the great medium of _ creation _ ` oino ' then all motion of whatever nature create ` agatho ' it must : but a true philosophy have long teach that the source of all motion be think -- and the source of all thought be -- ` oino ' god ` agatho ' i have speak to you oino as to a child of the fair earth which lately perish -- of impulse upon the atmosphere of the earth ` oino ' you do ` agatho ' and while i thus speak do there not cross you mind some thought of the _ physical power of word _ be not every word a impulse on the air ` oino ' but why agatho do you weep -- and why oh why do you wing droop as we hover above this fair star -- which be the greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encounter in we flight its brilliant flower look like a fairy dream -- but its fierce volcano like the passion of a turbulent heart ` agatho ' they _ be _ -- they _ be _ -- this wild star -- it be now three century since with clasped hand and with streaming eye at the foot of my beloved -- i speak it -- with a few passionate sentence -- into birth its brilliant flower _ be _ the dearest of all unfulfilled dream and its rage volcano _ be _ the passion of the most turbulent and unhallowed of heart \* \* \* \* \* the colloquy of mono and una -lrb- greek : mellonta sauta ' -rrb- these thing be in the future _ sophocle _ -- ` antig ' ` una ' bear again ` monos ' yes fairest and best beloved una bear again these be the word upon whose mystical meaning i have so long ponder reject the explanation of the priesthood until death itself resolve for I the secret ` una ' death ` monos ' how strangely sweet _ una _ you echo my word i observe too a vacillation in you step a joyous inquietude in you eye you be confuse and oppress by the majestic novelty of the life eternal yes it be of death i speak and here how singularly sound that word which of old be wont to bring terror to all heart throw a mildew upon all pleasure ` una ' ah death the spectre which sate at all feast how often mono do we lose ourselves in speculation upon its nature how mysteriously do it act as a check to human bliss say unto it thus far and no farther that earnest mutual love my own mono which burn within we bosom how vainly do we flatter ourselves feel happy in its first upspringing that we happiness would strengthen with its strength alas as it grow so grow in we heart the dread of that evil hour which be hurry to separate we forever thus in time it become painful to love hate would have be mercy then ` monos ' speak not here of these grief dear una -- mine mine forever now ` una ' but the memory of past sorrow be it not present joy i have much to say yet of the thing which have be above all i burn to know the incident of you own passage through the dark valley and shadow ` monos ' and when do the radiant una ask anything of she mono in vain i will be minute in relate all but at what point shall the weird narrative begin ` una ' at what point ` monos ' you have say ` una ' monos i comprehend you in death we have both learn the propensity of man to define the indefinable i will not say then commence with the moment of life 's cessation -- but commence with that sad sad instant when the fever have abandon you you sink into a breathless and motionless torpor and i press down you pallid eyelid with the passionate finger of love ` monos ' one word first my una in regard to man 's general condition at this epoch you will remember that one or two of the wise among we forefather -- wise in fact although not in the world 's esteem -- have venture to doubt the propriety of the term improvement as apply to the progress of we civilization there be period in each of the five or six century immediately precede we dissolution when arise some vigorous intellect boldly contend for those principle whose truth appear now to we disenfranchised reason so utterly obvious -- principle which should have teach we race to submit to the guidance of the natural law rather than attempt they control at long interval some master-mind appear look upon each advance in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility occasionally the poetic intellect -- that intellect which we now feel to have be the most exalted of all -- since those truth which to we be of the most enduring importance could only be reach by that _ analogy _ which speak in proof-tone to the imagination alone and to the unaided reason bear no weight -- occasionally do this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolve of the vague idea of the philosophic and find in the mystic parable that tell of the tree of knowledge and of its forbid fruit death-produce a distinct intimation that knowledge be not meet for man in the infant condition of he soul and these man -- the poet -- living and perish amid the scorn of the utilitarian -- of rough pedant who arrogate to themselves a title which could have be properly apply only to the scorn -- these man the poet ponder piningly yet not unwisely upon the ancient day when we want be not more simple than we enjoyment be keen -- day when _ mirth _ be a word unknown so solemnly deep-toned be happiness -- holy August and blissful day blue river run undammed between hill unhewn into far forest solitude primeval odorous and unexplored yet these noble exception from the general misrule serve but to strengthen it by opposition alas we have fall upon the most evil of all we evil day the great movement -- that be the cant term -- go on : a diseased commotion moral and physical art -- the art -- arise supreme and once enthrone cast chain upon the intellect which have elevated they to power man because he could not but acknowledge the majesty of nature fall into childish exultation at he acquire and still-increasing dominion over she element even while he stalk a god in he own fancy a infantine imbecility come over he as might be suppose from the origin of he disorder he grow infect with system and with abstraction he enwrap himself in generality among other odd idea that of universal equality gain ground and in the face of analogy and of god -- in despite of the loud warning voice of the law of _ gradation _ so visibly pervade all thing in earth and heaven -- wild attempt at a omniprevalent democracy be make yet this evil spring necessarily from the lead evil knowledge man could not both know and succumb meantime huge smoking city arise innumerable green leaf shrink before the hot breath of furnace the fair face of nature be deform as with the ravages of some loathsome disease and methink sweet una even we slumbering sense of the force and of the far-fetched might have arrest we here but now it appear that we have work out we own destruction in the perversion of we _ taste _ or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the school for in truth it be at this crisis that taste alone -- that faculty which hold a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral sense could never safely have be disregard -- it be now that taste alone could have lead we gently back to beauty to nature and to life but alas for the pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato alas for the -lrb- greek : mousicha -rrb- which he justly regard as a all-sufficient education for the soul alas for he and for it -- since both be most desperately need when both be most entirely forget or despise -lrb- 1 -rrb- pascal a philosopher whom we both love have say how truly -- _ que tout notre raisonnement se réduit à céder au sentiment _ and it be not impossible that the sentiment of the natural have time permit it would have regain its old ascendency over the harsh mathematical reason of the school but this thing be not to be prematurely induce by intemperance of knowledge the old age of the world draw near this the mass of mankind see not or live lustily although unhappily affect not to see but for myself the earth 's record have teach I to look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization i have imbibe a prescience of we fate from comparison of china the simple and endure with assyrium the architect with egypt the astrologer with nubium more crafty than either the turbulent mother of all art in the history of these region i meet with a ray from the future the individual artificiality of the three latter be local disease of the earth and in they individual overthrow we have see local remedy apply but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration save in death that man as a race should not become extinct i see that he must be _ bear again _ and now it be fairest and dearest that we wrap we spirit daily in dream now it be that in twilight we discourse of the day to come when the art-scarred surface of the earth have undergo that purification which alone could efface its rectangular obscenity should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the mountain-slope and the smile water of paradise and be render at length a fit dwelling-place for man : -- for man the death-purged -- for man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more -- for the redeem regenerated blissful and now immortal but still for the _ material _ man ` una ' well do i remember these conversation dear mono but the epoch of the fiery overthrow be not so near at hand as we believe and as the corruption you indicate do surely warrant we in believe man live and die individually you yourself sicken and pass into the grave and thither you constant una speedily follow you and though the century which have since elapse and whose conclusion bring up together once more tortured we slumbering sens with no impatience of duration yet my mono it be a century still ` monos ' say rather a point in the vague infinity unquestionably it be in the earth 's dotage that i die wearied at heart with anxiety which have they origin in the general turmoil and decay i succumb to the fierce fever after some few day of pain and many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy the manifestation of which you mistake for pain while i longed but be impotent to undeceive you -- after some day there come upon I as you have say a breathless and motionless torpor and this be term _ death _ by those who stand around I word be vague thing my condition do not deprive I of sentience it appear to I not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of he who have slumber long and profoundly lie motionless and fully prostrate in a mid-summer noon begin to steal slowly back into consciousness through the mere sufficiency of he sleep and without be awaken by external disturbance i breathe no longer the pulse be still the heart have cease to beat volition have not depart but be powerless the sens be unusually active although eccentrically so -- assume often each other 's function at random the taste and the smell be inextricably confound and become one sentiment abnormal and intense the rose-water with which you tenderness have moisten my lip to the last affect I with sweet fancy of flower -- fantastic flower far more lovely than any of the old earth but whose prototype we have here bloom around we the eye-lids transparent and bloodless offer no complete impediment to vision as volition be in abeyance the ball could not roll in they socket -- but all object within the range of the visual hemisphere be see with more or less distinctness the ray which fall upon the external retina or into the corner of the eye produce a more vivid effect than those which strike the front or interior surface yet in the former instance this effect be so far anomalous that i appreciate it only as _ sound _ -- sound sweet or discordant as the matter present themselves at my side be light or dark in shade -- curve or angular in outline the hearing at the same time although excite in degree be not irregular in action -- estimate real sound with a extravagance of precision not less than of sensibility touch have undergo a modification more peculiar its impression be tardily receive but pertinaciously retain and result always in the highest physical pleasure thus the pressure of you sweet finger upon my eyelid at first only recognize through vision at length long after they removal fill my whole be with a sensual delight immeasurable i say with a sensual delight _ all _ my perception be purely sensual the material furnish the passive brain by the sens be not in the least degree work into shape by the deceased understanding of pain there be some little of pleasure there be much but of moral pain or pleasure none at all thus you wild sob float into my ear with all they mournful cadence and be appreciate in they every variation of sad tone but they be soft musical sound and no more they convey to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrow which give they birth while large and constant tear which fall upon my face tell the bystander of a heart which break thrill every fiber of my frame with ecstasy alone and this be in truth the _ death _ of which these bystander speak reverently in low whisper -- you sweet una gaspingly with loud cry they attire I for the coffin -- three or four dark figure which flit busily to and fro as these cross the direct line of my vision they affect I as _ form _ but upon pass to my side they image impress I with the idea of shriek groan and other dismal expression of terror of horror or of woe you alone habit in a white robe pass in all direction musically about the day wane and as its light fade away i become possess by a vague uneasiness -- a anxiety such as the sleeper feel when sad real sound fall continuously within he ear -- low distant bell-tone solemn at long but equal interval and commingle with melancholy dream night arrive and with its shadow a heavy discomfort it oppress my limb with the oppression of some dull weight and be palpable there be also a moan sound not unlike the distant reverberation of surf but more continuous which begin with the first twilight have grow in strength with the darkness suddenly light be bring into the room and this reverberation become forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal burst of the same sound but less dreary and less distinct the ponderous oppression be in a great measure relieved and issue from the flame of each lamp -lrb- for there be many -rrb- there flow unbrokenly into my ear a strain of melodious monotone and when now dear una approach the bed upon which i lay outstretch you sit gently by my side breathing odor from you sweet lip and press they upon my brow there arise tremulously within my bosom and mingle with the merely physical sensation which circumstance have call forth a something akin to sentiment itself -- a feeling that half appreciate half respond to you earnest love and sorrow but this feeling take no root in the pulseless heart and seem indeed rather a shadow than a reality and fade quickly away first into extreme quiescence and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before and now from the wreck and the chaos of the usual sens there appear to have arise within I a sixth all perfect in its exercise i find a wild delight -- yet a delight still physical inasmuch as the understanding have in it no part motion in the animal frame have fully cease no muscle quiver no nerve thrill no artery throb but there seem to have spring up in the brain _ that _ of which no word could convey to the merely human intelligence even a indistinct conception let I term it a mental pendulous pulsation it be the moral embodiment of man 's abstract idea of _ time _ by the absolute equalization of this movement -- or of such as this -- have the cycle of the firmamental orb themselves be adjust by its aid i measure the irregularity of the clock upon the mantel and of the watch of the attendant they ticking come sonorously to my ear the slightest deviation from the true proportion -- and these deviation be omniprevalent -- affect I just as violation of abstract truth be wont on earth to affect the moral sense although no two of the timepiece in the chamber strike the individual seconds accurately together yet i have no difficulty in hold steadily in mind the tone and the respective momentary error of each and this -- this keen perfect self-existing sentiment of _ duration _ -- this sentiment exist -lrb- as man could not possibly have conceive it to exist -rrb- independently of any succession of event -- this idea -- this sixth sense upspringing from the ash of the rest be the first obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of the temporal eternity it be midnight and you still sit by my side all other have depart from the chamber of death they have deposit I in the coffin the lamp burn flickeringly for this i know by the tremulousness of the monotonous strain but suddenly these strain diminish in distinctness and in volume finally they cease the perfume in my nostril die away form affect my vision no longer the oppression of the darkness uplift itself from my bosom a dull shot like that of electricity pervade my frame and be follow by total loss of the idea of contact all of what man have term sense be merge in the sole consciousness of entity and in the one abide sentiment of duration the mortal body have be at length stricken with the hand of the deadly _ decay _ yet have not all of sentience depart for the consciousness and the sentiment remain supply some of its function by a lethargic intuition i appreciate the direful change now in operation upon the flesh and as the dreamer be sometimes aware of the bodily presence of one who lean over he so sweet una i still dully feel that you sit by my side so too when the noon of the second day come i be not unconscious of those movement which displace you from my side which confine I within the coffin which deposit I within the hearse which bear I to the grave which lower I within it which heap heavily the mould upon I and which thus leave I in blackness and corruption to my sad and solemn slumber with the worm and here in the prison-house which have few secret to disclose there roll away day and week and month and the soul watch narrowly each second as it fly and without effort take record of its flight -- without effort and without object a year pass the consciousness of _ be _ have grow hourly more indistinct and that of mere _ locality _ have in great measure usurp its position the idea of entity be become merge in that of _ place _ the narrow space immediately surround what have be the body be now grow to be the body itself at length as often happen to the sleeper -lrb- by sleep and its world alone be _ death _ image -rrb- -- at length as sometimes happen on earth to the deep slumberer when some flitting light half startle he into awake yet leave he half envelop in dream -- so to

damp earth upon my moulder bone there descend the coffin of una and now again all be void that nebulous light have be extinguish that feeble thrill have vibrate itself into quiescence many _ lustre _

eiro ' o god -- pity I charmion -- i be overburthen with the majesty of all thing -- of the unknown now know -- of the speculative future merge in the August and certain present ` charmion ' grapple not now with such thought to-morrow we will speak of this you mind waver and its agitation will find relief in the exercise of simple memory look not around nor forward -- but back i be burn with anxiety to hear the detail of that stupendous event which throw you among we tell I of it let we converse of familiar thing in the old familiar language of the world which have so fearfully perish ` eiro ' most fearfully fearfully -- this be indeed no dream ` charmion ' dream be no more be i much mourn my eiro ` eiro ' mourn charmion -- oh deeply to that last hour of all there hang a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over you household ` charmion ' and that last hour -- speak of it remember that beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself i know nothing when come out from among mankind i pass into night through the grave -- at that period if i remember aright the calamity which overwhelm you be utterly unanticipated but indeed i know little of the speculative philosophy of the day ` eiro ' the individual calamity be as you say entirely unanticipated but analogous misfortune have be long a subject of discussion with astronomer i need scarce tell you my friend that even when you leave we man have agree to understand those passage in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all thing by fire as have reference to the orb of the earth alone but in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin speculation have be at fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comet be divest of the terror of flame the very moderate density of these body have be well establish they have be observe to pass among the satellite of jupiter without bring about any sensible alteration either in the mass or in the orbit of these secondary planet we have long regard the wanderer as vapory creation of inconceivable tenuity and as altogether incapable of do injury to we substantial globe even in the event of contact but contact be not in any degree dread for the element of all the comet be accurately know that among _ they _ we should look for the agency of the threaten fiery destruction have be for many year consider a inadmissible idea but wonder and wild fancy have be of late day strangely rife among mankind and although it be only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevail upon the announcement by astronomer of a _ new _ comet yet this announcement be generally receive with i know not what of agitation and mistrust the element of the strange orb be immediately calculate and it be at once concede by all observer that its path at perihelion would bring it into very close proximity with the earth there be two or three astronomer of secondary note who resolutely maintain that a contact be inevitable i can not very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people for a few short day they would not believe a assertion which they intellect so long employ among worldly consideration could not in any manner grasp but the truth of a vitally important fact soon make its way into the understanding of even the most stolid finally all man see that astronomical knowledge lie not and they await the comet its approach be not at first seemingly rapid nor be its appearance of very unusual character it be of a dull red and have little perceptible train for seven or eight day we see no material increase in its apparent diameter and but a partial alteration in its color meantime the ordinary affair of man be discard and all interest absorb in a grow discussion institute by the philosophic in respect to the cometary nature even the grossly ignorant arouse they sluggish capacity to such consideration the learn _ now _ give they intellect -- they soul -- to no such point as the allay of fear or to the sustenance of loved theory they seek -- they pant for right view they groan for perfect knowledge _ truth _ arise in the purity of she strength and exceed majesty and the wise bow down and adore that material injury to we globe or to its inhabitant would result from the apprehend contact be a opinion which hourly lose ground among the wise and the wise be now freely permit to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd it be demonstrate that the density of the comet 's _ nucleus _ be far less than that of we rarest gas and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellite of jupiter be a point strongly insist upon and which serve greatly to allay terror theologist with a earnestness fear-enkindled dwelt upon the biblical prophecy and expound they to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance have be know that the final destruction of the earth must be bring about by the agency of fire be urge with a spirit that enforce everywhere conviction and that the comet be of no fiery nature -lrb- as all man now know -rrb- be a truth which relieve all in a great measure from the apprehension of the great calamity foretell it be noticeable that the popular prejudice and vulgar error in regard to pestilence and war -- error which be wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet -- be now altogether unknown as if by some sudden convulsive exertion reason have at once hurl superstition from she throne the feeblest intellect have derive vigor from excessive interest what minor evil might arise from the contact be point of elaborate question the learn speak of slight geological disturbance of probable alteration in climate and consequently in vegetation of possible magnetic and electric influence many hold that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produce while such discussion be go on they subject gradually approach grow larger in apparent diameter and of a more brilliant lustre mankind grow paler as it come all human operation be suspend there be a epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet have attain at length a size surpass that of any previously record visitation the people now dismiss any linger hope that the astronomer be wrong experience all the certainty of evil the chimerical aspect of they terror be go the heart of the stoutest of we race beat violently within they bosom a very few day suffer however to merge even such feeling in sentiment more unendurable we could no longer apply to the strange orb any _ accustom _ thought its _ historical _ attribute have disappear it oppress we with a hideous _ novelty _ of emotion we see it not as a astronomical phenomenon in the heaven but as a incubus upon we heart and a shadow upon we brain it have take with unconceivable rapidity the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame extend from horizon to horizon yet a day and man breathe with greater freedom it be clear that we be already within the influence of the comet yet we live we even feel a unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind the exceed tenuity of the object of we dread be apparent for all heavenly object be plainly visible through it meantime we vegetation have perceptibly altered and we gain faith from this predict circumstance in the foresight of the wise a wild luxuriance of foliage utterly unknown before burst out upon every vegetable thing yet another day -- and the evil be not altogether upon we it be now evident that its nucleus would first reach we a wild change have come over all man and the first sense of _ pain _ be the wild signal for general lamentation and horror the first sense of pain lay in a rigorous construction of the breast and lung and a insufferable dryness of the skin it could not be deny that we atmosphere be radically affect the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modification to which it might be subject be now the topic of discussion the result of investigation send a electric thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man it have be long know that the air which encircle we be a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gas in the proportion of twenty-one measure of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere oxygen which be the principle of combustion and the vehicle of heat be absolutely necessary to the support of animal life and be the most powerful and energetic agent in nature nitrogen on the contrary be incapable of support either animal life or flame a unnatural excess of oxygen would result it have be ascertain in just such a elevation of the animal spirit as we have latterly experience it be the pursuit the extension of the idea which have engender awe what would be the result of a _ total extraction of the nitrogen _ a combustion irresistible all-devouring omni-prevalent immediate -- the entire fulfilment in all they minute and terrible detail of the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciation of the prophecy of the holy book why need i paint charmion the now disenchain frenzy of mankind that tenuity in the comet which have previously inspire we with hope be now the source of the bitterness of despair in its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceive the consummation of fate meantime a day again pass -- bear away with it the last shadow of hope we gasp in the rapid modification of the air the red blood bound tumultuously through its strict channel a furious delirium possess all man and with arm rigidly outstretch towards the threatening heaven they tremble and shriek aloud but the nucleus of the destroyer be now upon we -- even here in aidenn i shudder while i speak let I be brief -- brief as the ruin that overwhelmed for a moment there be a wild lurid light alone visit and penetrate all thing then -- let we bow down charmion before the excessive majesty of the great god -- then there come a shouting and pervade sound as if from the mouth itself of he while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we exist burst at once into a species of intense flame for whose surpass brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angel in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name thus end all \* \* \* \* \* shadow -- a parable yea though i walk through the valley of the _ shadow _ ` psalm of david ' ye who read be still among the living

man and when see there will be some to disbelieve and some to doubt and yet a few who will find much to ponder upon in the character here grave with a stylus of iron the year have be a year of terror and of feel more intense than terror for which there be no name upon the earth for many prodigy and sign have take place and far and wide over sea and land the black wing of the pestilence be spread abroad to those nevertheless cunning in the star it be not unknown that the heaven wear a aspect of ill and to I the greek oino among other it be evident that now have arrive the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth year when at the entrance of aries the planet jupiter be enjoin with the red ring of the terrible saturnus the peculiar spirit of the sky if i mistake not greatly make itself manifest not only in the physical orb of the earth but in the soul imagination and meditation of mankind over some flask of the red chian wine within the wall of a noble hall in a dim city call ptolemai we sit at night a company of seven and to we chamber there be no entrance save by a lofty door of brass : and the door be fashion by the artisan corinno and be of rare workmanship be fasten from within black drapery likewise in the gloomy room shut out from we view the moon the lurid star and the peopleless street -- but the boding and the memory of evil they would not be so exclude there be thing around we and about of which i can render no distinct account -- thing material and spiritual -- heaviness in the atmosphere -- a sense of suffocation -- anxiety -- and above all that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the sens be keenly live and awake and meanwhile the power of think lie dormant a dead weight hang upon we it hang upon we limb -- upon the household furniture -- upon the goblet from which we drink and all thing be depress and bear down thereby -- all thing save only the flame of the seven iron lamp which illumine we revel uprear themselves in tall slender line of light they thus remain burn all pallid and motionless and in the mirror which they lustre form upon the round table of ebony at which we sit each of we there assemble behold the pallor of he own countenance and the unquiet glare in the downcast eye of he companion yet we laugh and be merry in we proper way -- which be hysterical and sing the song of anacreon -- which be madness and drink deeply -- although the purple wine remind we of blood for there be yet another tenant of we chamber in the person of young zoilus dead and at full length he lay enshroud -- the genius and the demon of the scene alas he bear no portion in we mirth save that he countenance distort with the plague and he eye in which death have but half extinguish the fire of the pestilence seem to take such a interest in we merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who be to die but although i oinos feel that the eye of the depart be upon I still i force myself not to perceive the bitterness of they expression and gaze down steadily into the depths of the ebony mirror sing with a loud and sonorous voice the song of the son of teo but gradually my song they cease and they echo roll afar off among the sable drapery of the chamber become weak and undistinguishable and so fade away and lo from among those sable drapery where the sound of the song depart there come forth a dark and undefiled shadow -- a shadow such as the moon when low in heaven might fashion from the figure of a man : but it be the shadow neither of man nor of god nor of any familiar thing and quiver awhile among the drapery of the room it at length rest in full view upon the surface of the door of brass but the shadow be vague and formless and indefinite and be the shadow neither of man nor god -- neither god of greece nor god of chaldæa nor any egyptian god and the shadow rest upon the brazen doorway and under the arch of the entablature of the door and move not nor speak any word but there become stationary and remain and the door whereupon the shadow rest be if i remember aright over against the foot of the young zoilus enshroud but we the seven there assemble have see the shadow as it come out from among the drapery dare not steadily behold it but cast down we eye and gaze continually into the depths of the mirror of ebony and at length i oinos speak some low word demand of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation and the shadow answer i be shadow and my dwelling be near to the catacomb of ptolemai and hard by those dim plain of helusion which border upon the foul charonian canal and then do we the seven start from we seat in horror and stand tremble and shudder and aghast : for the tone in the voice of the shadow be not the tone of any one be but of a multitude of being and vary in they cadence from syllable to syllable fall duskily upon we ear in the well remembered and familiar accent of many thousand depart friend \* \* \* \* \* silence -- a fable the mountain pinnacle slumber valley crag and cave _ be silent _ listen to _ I _ say the demon as he place he hand upon my head the region of which i speak be a dreary region in libya by the border of the river zäire and there be no quiet there nor silence the water of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow not onward to the sea but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion for many mile on either side of the river 's oozy bed be a pale desert of gigantic water-lily they sigh one unto the other in that solitude and stretch towards the heaven they long and ghastly neck and nod to and fro they everlasting head and there be a indistinct murmur which cometh out from among they like the rush of subterrene water and they sigh one unto the other but there be a boundary to they realm -- the boundary of the dark horrible lofty forest there like the wave about the hebride the low underwood be agitate continually but there be no wind throughout the heaven and the tall primeval tree rock eternally hither and thither with a crash and mighty sound and from they high summit one by one drop everlasting dew and at the root strange poisonous flower lie writhe in perturb slumber and overhead with a rustling and loud noise the gray cloud rush westwardly forever until they roll a cataract over the fiery wall of the horizon but there be no wind throughout the heaven and by the shore of the river zäire there be neither quiet nor silence it be night and the rain fall and fall it be rain but have fall it be blood and i stand in the morass among the tall lily and the rain fall upon my head -- and the lily sigh one unto the other in the solemnity of they desolation and all at once the moon arise through the thin ghastly mist and be crimson in color and mine eye fall upon a huge gray rock which stand by the shore of the river and be light by the light of the moon and the rock be gray and ghastly and tall -- and the rock be gray upon its front be character engraven in the stone and i walk through the morass of water-lily until i come close unto the shore that i might read the character upon the stone but i could not decipher they and i be go back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller red and i turn and look again upon the rock and upon the character -- and the character be desolation and i look upward and there stand a man upon the summit of the rock and i hide myself among the water-lily that i might discover the action of the man and the man be tall and stately in form and wrap up from he shoulder to he foot in the toga of old rome and the outline of he figure be indistinct -- but he feature be the feature of a deity for the mantle of the night and of the mist and of the moon and of the dew have leave uncovered the feature of he face and he brow be lofty with thought and he eye wild with care and in the few furrow upon he cheek i read the fable of sorrow and weariness and disgust with mankind and a longing after solitude and the man sit upon the rock and lean he head upon he hand and look out upon the desolation he look down into the low unquiet shrubbery and up into the tall primeval tree and up higher at the rustling heaven and into the crimson moon and i lay close within shelter of the lily and observe the action of the man and the man tremble in the solitude -- but the night wane and he sit upon the rock and the man turn he attention from the heaven and look out upon the dreary river zäire and upon the yellow ghastly water and upon the pale legion of the water-lily and the man listen to the sigh of the water-lily and to the murmur that come up from among they and i lay close within my covert and observe the action of the man and the man tremble in the solitude -- but the night wane and he sit upon the rock then i go down into the recess of the morass and wade afar in among the wilderness of the lily and call unto the hippopotamus which dwell among the fen in the recess of the morass and the hippopotamus hear my call and come with the behemoth unto the foot of the rock and roar loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and i lay close within my covert and observe the action of the man and the man tremble in the solitude -- but the night wane and he sit upon the rock then i curse the element with the curse of tumult and a frightful tempest gather in the heaven where before there have be no wind and the heaven become livid with the violence of the tempest -- and the rain beat upon the head of the man -- and the flood of the river come down -- and the river be torment into foam -- and the water-lily shriek within they bed -- and the forest crumble before the wind -- and the thunder roll -- and the lightning fall -- and the rock rock to its foundation and i lay close within my covert and observe the action of the man and the man tremble in the solitude -- but the night wane and he sit upon the rock then i grow angry and curse with the curse of silence the river and the lily and the wind and the forest and the heaven and the thunder and the sigh of the water-lily and they become accursed and _ be still _ and the moon cease to totter up its pathway to heaven -- and the thunder die away -- and the lightning do not flash -- and the cloud hang motionless -- and the water sink to they level and remain -- and the tree cease to rock -- and the water-lily sigh no more -- and the murmur be hear no longer from among they nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert and i look upon the character of the rock and they be change -- and the character be silence and mine eye fall upon the countenance of the man and he countenance be wan with terror and hurriedly he raise he head from he hand and stand forth upon the rock and listen but there be no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert and the character upon the rock be silence and the man shudder and turn he face away and flee afar off in haste so that i beheld he no more now there be fine tale in the volume of the magus -- in the iron-bound melancholy volume of the magus therein i say be glorious history of the heaven and of the earth and of the mighty sea -- and of the genie that overrule the sea and the earth and the lofty heaven there be much lore too in the saying which be say by the sybil and holy holy thing be hear of old by the dim leaf that tremble around dodona -- but as allah liveth that fable which the demon tell I as he sit by my side in the shadow of the tomb i hold to be the most wonderful of all and as the demon make a end of he story he fall back within the cavity of the tomb and laugh and i could not laugh with the demon and he curse I because i could not laugh and the lynx which dwelleth forever in the tomb come out therefrom and lay down at the foot of the demon and look at he steadily in the face \* \* \* \* \* essay \* \* \* \* \* the poetic principle in speaking of the poetic principle i have no design to be either thorough or profound while discuss very much at random the essentiality of what we call poetry my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poem which best suit my own taste or which upon my own fancy have leave the most definite impression by minor poem i mean of course poem of little length and here in the beginning permit I to say a few word in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle which whether rightfully or wrongfully have always have its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem i hold that a long poem do not exist i maintain that the phrase a long poem be simply a flat contradiction in term i need scarcely observe that a poem deserve its title only inasmuch as it excite by elevate the soul the value of the poem be in the ratio of this elevate excitement but all excitement be through a psychal necessity transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so call at all can not be sustain throughout a composition of any great length after the lapse of half a hour at the very utmost it flag -- fail -- a revulsion ensue -- and then the poem be in effect and in fact no longer such there be no doubt many who have find difficulty in reconcile the critical dictum that the paradise lose be to be devoutly admire throughout with the absolute impossibility of maintain for it during perusal the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand this great work in fact be to be regard as poetical only when lose sight of that vital requisite in all work of art unity we view it merely as a series of minor poem if to preserve its unity -- its totality of effect or impression -- we read it -lrb- as would be necessary -rrb- at a single sit the result be but a constant alternation of excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true poetry there follow inevitably a passage of platitude which no critical prejudgment can force we to admire but if upon complete the work we read it again omit the first book -- that be to say commence with the second -- we shall be surprise at now find that admirable which we before condemn -- that damnable which we have previously so much admire it follow from all this that the ultimate aggregate or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun be a nullity -- and this be precisely the fact in regard to the iliad we have if not positive proof at least very good reason for believe it intend as a series of lyric but grant the epic intention i can say only that the work be base in a imperfect sense of art the modern epic be of the supposititious ancient model but a inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day of these artistic anomaly be over if at any time any very long poem _ be _ popular in reality -- which i doubt -- it be at least clear that no very long poem will ever be popular again that the extent of a poetical work be _ ceteri paribus _ the measure of its merit seem undoubtedly when we thus state it a proposition sufficiently absurd -- yet we be indebted for it to the quarterly review surely there can be nothing in mere _ size _ abstractly consider -- there can be nothing in mere _ bulk _ so far as a volume be concern which have so continuously elicit admiration from these saturnine pamphlet a mountain to be sure by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it convey _ do _ impress we with a sense of the sublime -- but no man be impressed after _ this _ fashion by the material grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterly have not instruct we to be so impressed by it _ as yet _ they have not _ insist _ on we estimate lamartine by the cubic foot or pollock by the pound -- but what else be we to _ infer _ from they continual prate about sustained effort if by sustained effort any little gentleman have accomplish a epic let we frankly commend he for the effort -- if this indeed be a thing commendable -- but let we forbear praise the epic on the effort 's account it be to be hope thai common sense in the time to come will prefer decide upon a work of art rather by the impression it make -- by the effect it produce -- than by the time it take to impress the effect or by the amount of sustained effort which have be find necessary in effect the impression the fact be that perseverance be one thing and genius quite another -- nor can all the quarterly in christendom confound they by and by this proposition with many which i have be just urge will be receive as self-evident in the meantime by be generally condemn as falsity they will not be essentially damage as truth on the other hand it be clear that a poem may be improperly brief undue brevity degenerate into mere epigrammatism a _ very _ short poem while now and then produce a brilliant or vivid never produce a profound or enduring effect there must be the steady press down of the stamp upon the wax de béranger have work innumerable thing pungent and spirit-stirring but in general they have be too imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention and thus as so many feather of fancy have be blow aloft only to be whistle down the wind a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depress a poem in keep it out of the popular view be afford by the follow exquisite little serenade : i arise from dream of thee in the first sweet sleep of night when the wind be breathe low and the star be shine bright i arise from dream of thee and a spirit in my foot have lead I -- who know how -- to thy chamber-window sweet the wander air they faint on the dark the silent stream -- the champak odor fail like sweet thought in a dream the nightingale 's complaint it die upon she heart as i must die on thine o beloved as thou art o lift I from the grass i die i faint i fail let thy love in kiss rain on my lip and eyelid pale my cheek be cold and white alas my heart beat loud and fast : o press it close to thine again where it will break at last very few perhaps be familiar with these line yet no less a poet than shelley be they author they warm yet delicate and ethereal imagination will be appreciate by all but by none so thoroughly as by he who have himself arise from sweet dream of one beloved to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night one of the finest poem by willi the very best in my opinion which he have ever write have no doubt through this same defect of undue brevity be keep back from its proper position not less in the critical than in the popular view : the shadow lay along broadway 'twa near the twilight-tide -- and slowly there a lady fair be walk in she pride alone walk would she but viewlessly walk would spirit at she side peace charm have the street beneath she foot and honor charm have the air and all astir look kind on she and call she good as fair -- for all god ever give to she she keep with chary care she keep with care she beauty rare from lover warm and true -- for heart be cold to all but gold and the rich come not to woo -- but honor would well she charm to sell if priest the selling do now walk there be one more fair -- a slight girl lily-pale and she have unseen company to make the spirit quail -- twixt want and scorn she walk would forlorn and nothing could avail no mercy now can clear she brow from this world 's peace to pray for as love 's wild prayer dissolve in air she woman 's heart give way -- but the sin forgive by christ in heaven by man be curse alway in this composition we find it difficult to recognize the willi who have write so many mere verse of society the line be not only richly ideal but full of energy while they breathe a earnestness a evident sincerity of sentiment for which we look in vain throughout all the other work of this author while the epic mania while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity be indispensable have for some year past be gradually die out of the public mind by mere dint of its own absurdity we find it succeed by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerate but one which in the brief period it have already endure may be say to have accomplish more in the corruption of we poetical literature than all its other enemy combine i allude to the heresy of _ the didactic _ it have be assume tacitly and avowedly directly and indirectly that the ultimate object of all poetry be truth every poem it be say should inculcate a moral and by this moral be the poetical merit of the work to be adjudge we american especially have patronize this happy idea and we bostonian very especially have develop it in full we have take it into we head that to write a poem simply for the poem 's sake and to acknowledge such to have be we design would be to confess ourselves radically want in the true poetic dignity and force : -- but the simple fact be that would we but permit ourselves to look into we own soul we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exist nor _ can _ exist any work more thoroughly dignified more supremely noble than this very poem this poem _ per se _ this poem which be a poem and nothing more this poem write solely for the poem 's sake with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspire the bosom of man i would nevertheless limit in some measure its mode of inculcation i would limit to enforce they i would not enfeeble they by dissipation the demand of truth be severe she have no sympathy with the myrtle all _ that _ which be so indispensable in song be precisely all _ that _ with which _ she _ have nothing whatever to do it be but make she a flaunt paradox to wreathe she in gem and flower in enforce a truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be simple precise terse we must be cool calm unimpassioned in a word we must be in that mood which as nearly as possible be the exact converse of the poetical _ he _ must be blind indeed who do not perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical mode of inculcation he must be theory-mad beyond redemption who in spite of these difference shall still persist in attempt to reconcile the obstinate oils and water of poetry and truth divide the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinction we have the pure intellect taste and the moral sense i place taste in the middle because it be just this position which in the mind it occupy it hold intimate relation with either extreme but from the moral sense be separate by so faint a difference that aristotle have not hesitate to place some of its operation among the virtue themselves nevertheless we find the _ office _ of the trio mark with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concern itself with truth so taste inform we of the beautiful while the moral sense be regardful of duty of this latter while conscience teach the obligation and reason the expediency taste contents herself with display the charm wage war upon vice solely on the ground of she deformity she disproportion she animosity to the fitting to the appropriate to the harmonious in a word to beauty a immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man be thus plainly a sense of the beautiful this it be which administer to he delight in the manifold form and sound and odor and sentiment amid which he exist and just as the lily be repeat in the lake or the eye of amarylli in the mirror so be the mere oral or write repetition of these form and sound and color and odor and sentiment a duplicate source of delight but this mere repetition be not poetry he who shall simply sing with however glowing enthusiasm or with however vivid a truth of description of the sight and sound and odor and color and sentiment which greet he in common with all mankind -- he i say have yet fail to prove he divine title there be still a something in the distance which he have be unable to attain we have still a thirst unquenchable to allay which he have not show we the crystal spring this thirst belong to the immortality of man it be at once a consequence and a indication of he perennial existence it be the desire of the moth for the star it be no mere appreciation of the beauty before we but a wild effort to reach the beauty above inspire by a ecstatic prescience of the glory beyond the grave we struggle by multiform combination among the thing and thought of time to attain a portion of that loveliness whose very element perhaps appertain to eternity alone and thus when by poetry or when by music the most entrancing of the poetic mood we find ourselves melt into tear we weep then not as the abbate gravina suppose through excess of pleasure but through a certain petulant impatient sorrow at we inability to grasp _ now _ wholly here on earth at once and forever those divine and rapturous joy of which _ through _ the poem or _ through _ the music we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpse the struggle to apprehend the supernal loveliness -- this struggle on the part of soul fittingly constitute -- have give to the world all _ that _ which it -lrb- the world -rrb- have ever be enable at once to understand and _ to feel _ as poetic the poetic sentiment of course may develop itself in various mode -- in painting in sculpture in architecture in the dance -- very especially in music -- and very peculiarly and with a wide field in the composition of the landscape garden we present theme however have regard only to its manifestation in word and here let I speak briefly on the topic of rhythm content myself with the certainty that music in its various mode of metre rhythm and rhyme be of so vast a moment in poetry as never to be wisely reject -- be so vitally important a adjunct that he be simply silly who decline its assistance i will not now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it be in music perhaps that the soul most nearly attain the great end for which when inspire by the poetic sentiment it struggle -- the creation of supernal beauty it _ may _ be indeed that here this sublime end be now and then attain in _ fact _ we be often make to feel with a shiver delight that from a earthly harp be stricken note which _ can not _ have be unfamiliar to the angel and thus there can be little doubt that in the union of poetry with music in its popular sense we shall find the widest field for the poetic development the old bard and minnesinger have advantage which we do not possess -- and thoma moore singing he own song be in the most legitimate manner perfect they as poem to recapitulate then : -- i would define in brief the poetry of word as _ the rhythmical creation of beauty _ its sole arbiter be taste with the intellect or with the conscience it have only collateral relation unless incidentally it have no concern whatever either with duty or with truth a few word however in explanation _ that _ pleasure which be at once the most pure the most elevate and the most intense be derive i maintain from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation or excitement _ of the soul _ which we recognize as the poetic sentiment and which be so easily distinguish from truth which be the satisfaction of the reason or from passion which be the excitement of the heart i make beauty therefore -- use the word as inclusive of the sublime -- i make beauty the province of the poem simply because it be a obvious rule of art that effect should be make to spring as directly as possible from they cause : -- no one as yet have be weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question be at least _ most readily _ attainable in the poem it by no means follow however that the incitement of passion or the precept of duty or even the lesson of truth may not be introduce into a poem and with advantage for they may subserve incidentally in various way the general purpose of the work : but the true artist will always contrive to tone they down in proper subjection to that beauty which be the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem i can not better introduce the few poem which i shall present for you consideration than by the citation of the pröem to longfellow 's waif : the day be do and the darkness fall from the wing of night as a feather be waft downward from a eagle in he flight i see the light of the village gleam through the rain and the mist and a feeling of sadness come o'er I that my soul can not resist a feeling of sadness and longing that be not akin to pain and resemble sorrow only as the mist resemble the rain come read to I some poem some simple and heartfelt lay that shall soothe this restless feeling and banish the thought of day not from the grand old master not from the bard sublime whose distant footstep echo through the corridor of time for like strain of martial music they mighty thought suggest life 's endless toil and endeavor and to-night i long for rest read from some humbler poet whose song gush from he heart as shower from the cloud of summer or tear from the eyelid start who through long day of labor and night devoid of ease still hear in he soul the music of wonderful melody such song have power to quiet the restless pulse of care and come like the benediction that follow after prayer then read from the treasured volume the poem of thy choice and lend to the rhyme of the poet the beauty of thy voice and the night shall be fill with music and the care that infest the day shall fold they tent like the arab and as silently steal away with no great range of imagination these line have be justly admire for they delicacy of expression some of the image be very effective nothing can be better than -- the bard sublime whose distant footstep echo down the corridor of time the idea of the last quatrain be also very effective the poem on the whole however be chiefly to be admire for the graceful _ insouciance _ of its metre so well in accordance with the character of the sentiment and especially for the _ ease _ of the general manner this ease or naturalness in a literary style it have long be the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone -- as a point of really difficult attainment but not so : -- a natural manner be difficult only to he who should never meddle with it -- to the unnatural it be but the result of write with the understanding or with the instinct that _ the tone _ in composition should always be that which the mass of mankind would adopt -- and must perpetually vary of course with the occasion the author who after the fashion of _ the north american review _ should be upon _ all _ occasion merely quiet must necessarily upon _ many _ occasion be simply silly or stupid and have no more right to be consider easy or natural than a cockney exquisite or than the sleep beauty in the waxworks among the minor poem of bryant none have so much impressed I as the one which he entitle June i quote only a portion of it : there through the long long summer hour the golden light should lie and thick young herb and group of flower stand in they beauty by the oriole should build and tell he love-tale close beside my cell the idle butterfly should rest he there and there be hear the housewife-bee and humming bird and what if cheerful shout at noon come from the village send or song of maid beneath the moon with fairy laughter blent and what if in the evening light betrothed lover walk in sight of my low monument i would the lovely scene around might know no sadder sight nor sound i know i know i should not see the season 's glorious show nor would its brightness shine for I nor its wild music flow but if around my place of sleep the friend i love should come to weep they might not haste to go soft air and song and light and bloom should keep they linger by my tomb these to they soften would heart should bear the thought of what have be and speak of one who can not share the gladness of the scene whose part in all the pomp that fill the circuit of the summer hill be -- that he grave be green and deeply would they heart rejoice to hear again he living voice the rhythmical flow here be even voluptuous -- nothing could be more melodious the poem have always affect I in a remarkable manner the intense melancholy which seem to well up perforce to the surface of all the poet 's cheerful saying about he grave we find thrilling we to the soul -- while there be the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the impression left be one of a pleasurable sadness and if in the remain composition which i shall introduce to you there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent let I remind you that -lrb- how or why we know not -rrb- this certain taint of sadness be inseparably connect with all the higher manifestation of true beauty it be nevertheless a feeling of sadness and longing that be not akin to pain and resemble sorrow only as the mist resemble the rain the taint of which i speak be clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coote pinkney : i fill this cup to one make up of loveliness alone a woman of she gentle sex the seeming paragon to whom the better element and kindly star have give a form so fair that like the air ` tis less of earth than heaven she every tone be music 's own like those of morning bird and something more than melody dwell ever in she word the coinage of she heart be they and from she lip each flow as one may see the burden would bee forth issue from the rose affection be as thought to she the measure of she hour she feeling have the fragrancy the freshness of young flower and lovely passion change oft so fill she she appear the image of themselves by turn -- the idol of past year of she bright face one glance will trace a picture on the brain and of she voice in echo heart a sound must long remain but memory such as mine of she so very much endear when death be nigh my latest sigh will not be life 's but hers i fill would this cup to one make up of loveliness alone a woman of she gentle sex the seeming paragon -- she health and would on earth there stand some more of such a frame that life might be all poetry and weariness a name it be the misfortune of mr pinkney to have be bear too far south have he be a new englander it be probable that he would have be rank as the first of american lyrist by that magnanimous cabal which have so long control the destiny of american letter in conduct the thing call ` the north american review ' the poem just cite be especially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induce we must refer chiefly to we sympathy in the poet 's enthusiasm we pardon he hyperbole for the evident earnestness with which they be utter it be by no means my design however to expatiate upon the _ merit _ of what i should read you these will necessarily speak for themselves boccalina in he ` advertisement from parnassus ' tell we that zoilus once present apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable book : -- whereupon the god ask he for the beauty of the work he reply that he only busy himself about the error on hearing this apollo hand he a sack of unwinnowed wheat bid he pick out _ all the chaff _ for he reward now this fable answer very well as a hit at the critic -- but i be by no means sure that the god be in the right i be by no means certain that the true limit of the critical duty be not grossly misunderstand excellence in a poem especially may be consider in the light of a axiom which need only be properly _ put _ to become self-evident it be _ not _ excellence if it require to be demonstrate its such : -- and thus to point out too particularly the merit of a work of art be to admit that they be _ not _ merit altogether among the melody of thoma moore be one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seem to have be singularly leave out of view i allude to he line begin -- come rest in this bosom the intense energy of they expression be not surpass by anything in byron there be two of the line in which a sentiment be convey that embody the _ all in all _ of the divine passion of love -- a sentiment which perhaps have find its echo in more and in more passionate human heart that any other single sentiment ever embody in word : come rest in this bosom my own stricken deer though the herd have flee from thee thy home be still here here still be the smile that no cloud can o'ercast and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last oh what be love make for if ` tis not the same through joy and through torment through glory and shame i know not i ask not if guilt 's in that heart i but know that i love thee whatever thou art thou hast call would I thy angel in moment of bliss and thy angel i 'll be ` mid the horror of this -- through the furnace unshrink thy step to pursue and shield thee and save thee -- or perish there too it have be the fashion of late day to deny moore imagination while grant he fancy -- a distinction originate with coleridge -- than whom no man more fully comprehend the great power of moore the fact be that the fancy of this poet so far predominate over all he other faculty and over the fancy of all other man as to have induce very naturally the idea that he be fanciful _ only _ but never be there a greater mistake never be a grosser wrong do the fame of a true poet in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more profoundly -- more weirdly _ imaginative _ in the best sense than the line commence -- i would i be by that dim lake -- which be the composition of thomas moore i regret that i be unable to remember they one of the noblest -- and speaking of fancy -- one of the most singularly fanciful of modern poet be thomas hood he fair ine have always for I a inexpressible charm : o see ye not fair ine she be go into the west to dazzle when the sun be down and rob the world of rest she take we daylight with she the smile that we love best with morning blush on she cheek and pearl upon she breast o turn again fair ine before the fall of night for fear the moon should shine alone and star unrivall would bright and bless will the lover be that walk beneath they light and breathe the love against thy cheek i dare not even write would i have be fair ine that gallant cavalier who ride so gaily by thy side and whisper would thee so near be there no bonny dame at home or no true lover here that he should cross the sea to win the dearest of the dear i see thee lovely ine descend along the shore with band of noble gentleman and banners-waved before and gentle youth and maiden gay and snowy plume they wear it would have be a beauteous dream if it have be no more alas alas fair ine she go away with song with music wait on she step and shouting of the throng but some be sad and feel no mirth but only music 's wrong in sound that sing farewell farewell to she you have love so long farewell farewell fair ine that vessel never bear so fair a lady on its deck nor dance so light before -- alas for pleasure on the sea and sorrow on the shore the smile that bless one lover 's heart have break many more the haunt house by the same author be one of the truest poem ever write -- one of the truest one of the most unexceptionable one of the most thoroughly artistic both in its theme and in its execution it be moreover powerfully ideal -- imaginative i regret that its length render it unsuitable for the purpose of this lecture in place of it permit I to offer the universally appreciate bridge of sigh : one more unfortunate weary of breath rashly importunate go to she death take she up tenderly lift she with care -- fashion would so slenderly young and so fair look at she garment cling like cerement whilst the wave constantly drip from she clothing take she up instantly love not loathe touch she not scornfully think of she mournfully gently and humanly not of the stain of she all that remain of she now be pure womanly make no deep scrutiny into she mutiny rash and undutiful past all dishonor death have leave on she only the beautiful where the lamp quiver so far in the river with many a light from window and casement from garret to basement she stand with amazement houseless by night the bleak wind of march make she tremble and shiver but not the dark arch or the black flow river : mad from life 's history glad to death 's mystery swift to be hurl would -- anywhere anywhere out of the world in she plunge boldly no matter how coldly the rough river run -- over the brink of it picture it -- think of it dissolute man lave in it drink of it then if you can still for all slip of hers one of eve 's family -- wipe those poor lip of hers ooze so clammily loop up she tress escape from the comb she fair auburn tress whilst wonderment guess where be she home who be she father who be she mother have she a sister have she a brother or be there a dearer one still and a nearer one yet than all other alas for the rarity of christian charity under the sun oh it be pitiful near a whole city full home she have none sisterly brotherly fatherly motherly feeling have change : love by harsh evidence throw from its eminence even god 's providence seem estrange take she up tenderly lift she with care fashion would so slenderly young and so fair ere she limb frigidly stiffen too rigidly decently -- kindly -- smooth and compose they and she eye close they stare so blindly dreadfully stare through muddy impurity as when with the daring last look of despair fix on futurity perishing gloomily spur by contumely cold inhumanity burning insanity into she rest -- cross she hand humbly as if pray dumbly over she breast own she weakness she evil behavior and leave with meekness she sin to she savior the vigor of this poem be no less remarkable than its pathos the versification although carry the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic be nevertheless admirably adapt to the wild insanity which be the thesis of the poem among the minor poem of lord byron be one which have never receive from the critic the praise which it undoubtedly deserve : though the day of my destiny 's over and the star of my fate have decline thy soft heart refuse to discover the fault which so many could find though thy soul with my grief be acquaint it shrink not to share it with I and the love which my spirit have paint it never have find but in _ thee _ then when nature around I be smile the last smile which answer to mine i do not believe it beguiling because it remind I of thine and when wind be at war with the ocean as the breast i believe in with I if they billow excite a emotion it be that they bear I from _ thee _ though the rock of my last hope be shiver and its fragment be sink in the wave though i feel that my soul be deliver to pain -- it shall not be its slave there be many a pang to pursue I : they may crush but they shall not contemn -- they may torture but shall not subdue I -- ` ti of _ thee _ that i think -- not of they though human thou didst not deceive I though woman thou didst not forsake though loved thou forborest to grieve I though slander thou never couldst shake -- though trust thou didst not disclaim I though part it be not to fly though watchful 'twa not to defame I nor mute that the world might belie yet i blame not the world nor despise it nor the war of the many with one -- if my soul be not fit to prize it 'twa folly not sooner to shun : and if dearly that error have cost I and more than i once could foresee i have find that whatever it lose I it could not deprive I of _ thee _ from the wreck of the past which have perished thus much i at least may recall it have teach I that which i most cherish deserve to be dearest of all : in the desert a fountain be spring in the wide waste there still be a tree and a bird in the solitude singing which speak to my spirit of _ thee _ although the rhythm here be one of the most difficult the versification could scarcely be improve no nobler theme ever engage the pen of poet it be the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself entitle to complain of fate while in he adversity he still retain the unwavering love of woman from alfred tennyson although in perfect sincerity i regard he as the noblest poet that ever live i have leave myself time to cite only a very brief specimen i call he and _ think _ he the noblest of poet _ not _ because the impression he produce be at _ all _ time the most profound -- _ not _ because the poetical excitement which he induce be at _ all _ time the most intense -- but because it be at all time the most ethereal -- in other word the most elevate and most pure no poet be so little of the earth earthy what i be about to read be from he last long poem the princess : tear idle tear i know not what they mean tear from the depth of some divine despair rise in the heart and gather to the eye in look on the happy autumn field and thinking of the day that be no more fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail that bring we friend up from the underworld sad as the last which redden over one that sink with all we love below the verge so sad so fresh the day that be no more ah sad and strange as in dark summer dawn the earliest pipe of half-awaken would bird to die ear when unto die eye the casement slowly grow a glimmer square so sad so strange the day that be no more dear as remember would kiss after death and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign would on lip that be for other deep as love deep as first love and wild with all regret o death in life the day that be no more thus although in a very cursory and imperfect manner i have endeavor to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it have be my purpose to suggest that while this principle itself be strictly and simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty the manifestation of the principle be always find in _ a elevate excitement of the soul _ quite independent of that passion which be the intoxication of the heart or of that truth which be the satisfaction of the reason for in regard to passion alas its tendency be to degrade rather than to elevate the soul love on the contrary -- love -- the true the divine ero -- the uranian as distinguish from the dionasan venus -- be unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical theme and in regard to truth if to be sure through the attainment of a truth we be lead to perceive a harmony where none be apparent before we experience at once the true poetical effect but this effect be referable to the harmony alone and not in the least degree to the truth which merely serve to render the harmony manifest we shall reach however more immediately a distinct conception of what true poetry be by mere reference to a few of the simple element which induce in the poet himself the true poetical effect he recognize the ambrosia which nourish he soul in the bright orb that shine in heaven in the volute of the flower in the clustering of low shrubbery in the wave of the grain-field in the slanting of tall eastern tree in the blue distance of mountain in the grouping of cloud in the twinkling of half-hidden brook in the gleaming of silver river in the repose of sequestered lake in the star-mirroring depths of lonely well he perceive it in the song of bird in the harp of æolus in the sighing of the night-wind in the repining voice of the forest in the surf that complain to the shore in the fresh breath of the wood in the scent of the violet in the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth in the suggestive odor that come to he at eventide from far-distant undiscovered island over dim ocean illimitable and unexplored he own it in all noble thought in all unworldly motive in all holy impulse in all chivalrous generous and self-sacrificing deed he feel it in the beauty of woman in the grace of she step in the lustre of she eye in the melody of she voice in she soft laughter in she sigh in the harmony of the rustling of she robe he deeply feel it in she win endearment in she burning enthusiasm in she gentle charity in she meek and devotional endurance but above all ah far above all he kneel to it he worship it in the faith in the purity in the strength in the altogether divine majesty of she _ love _ let I conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem one very different in character from any that i have before quote it be by motherwell and be call the song of the cavalier with we modern and altogether rational idea of the absurdity and impiety of warfare we be not precisely in that frame of mind best adapt to sympathize with the sentiment and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier : a steed a steed of matchless speede a sword of metal keene al else to noble hearte be drosse -- al else on earth be meane the neighynge of the war-horse prowde the rowleing of the drum the clangor of the trumpet lowde -- be sounde from heaven that come and oh the thunder presse of knighte when as they war-crye welle may tole from heaven a angel bright and rowse a fiend from hell then mounte then mounte brave gallant all and don you helme amaine deathe 's courier fame and honor call we to the field againe no shrewish teare shall fill you eye when the sword-hilt 's in we hand -- heart-whole we 'll part and no whit sighe for the fayrest of the land let piping swaine and craven wight thus weepe and puling crye we business be like man to fight and hero-like to die \* \* \* \* \* the philosophy of composition charle dickens in a note now lie before I allude to a examination i once make of the mechanism of _ barnaby rudge _ say -- by the way be you aware that godwin write he _ caleb william _ backwards he first involve he hero in a web of difficulty form the second volume and then for the first cast about he for some mode of accounting for what have be do i can not think this the _ precise _ mode of procedure on the part of godwin -- and indeed what he himself acknowledge be not altogether in accordance with mr dickens 's idea -- but the author of _ caleb william _ be too good a artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at least a somewhat similar process nothing be more clear than that every plot worth the name must be elaborate to its _ dénouement _ before anything be attempt with the pen it be only with the _ dénouement _ constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence or causation by make the incident and especially the tone at all point tend to the development of the intention there be a radical error i think in the usual mode of construct a story either history afford a thesis -- or one be suggest by a incident of the day -- or at best the author set himself to work in the combination of striking event to form merely the basis of he narrative -- design generally to fill in with description dialogue or autorial comment whatever crevice of fact or action may from page to page render themselves apparent i prefer commence with the consideration of a _ effect _ keep originality _ always _ in view -- for he be false to himself who venture to dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of interest -- i say to myself in the first place of the innumerable effect or impression of which the heart the intellect or -lrb- more generally -rrb- the soul be susceptible what one shall i on the present occasion select have choose a novel first and secondly a vivid effect i consider whether it can be best work by incident or tone -- whether by ordinary incident and peculiar tone or the converse or by peculiarity both of incident and tone -- afterwards look about I -lrb- or rather within -rrb- for such combination of event or tone as shall best aid I in the construction of the effect i have often think how interesting a magazine paper might be write by any author who would -- that be to say who could -- detail step by step the process by which any one of he composition attain its ultimate point of completion why such a paper have never be give to the world i be much at a loss to say -- but perhaps the autorial vanity have have more to do with the omission than any one other cause most writer -- poet in especial -- prefer have it understand that they compose by a species of fine frenzy -- a ecstatic intuition -- and would positively shudder at let the public take a peep behind the scene at the elaborate and vacillate crudity of thought -- at the true purpose seize only at the last moment -- at the innumerable glimpse of idea that arrive not at the maturity of full view -- at the fully-matured fancy discard in despair as unmanageable -- at the cautious selection and rejection -- at the painful erasure and interpolation -- in a word at the wheel and pinion the tackle for scene-shift the step-ladder and demon-trap the cock 's feather the red paint and the black patch which in ninety-nine case out of the hundred constitute the property of the literary _ histrio _ i be aware on the other hand that the case be by no means common in which a author be at all in condition to retrace the step by which he conclusion have be attain in general suggestion have arise pell-mell be pursue and forget in a similar manner for my own part i have neither sympathy with the repugnance allude to nor at any time the least difficulty in recall to mind the progressive step of any of my composition and since the interest of a analysis or reconstruction such as i have consider a _ desideratum _ be quite independent of any real or fancied interest in the thing analyze it will not be regard as a breach of decorum on my part to show the _ modus operandus _ by which some one of my own work be put together i select the raven as most generally know it be my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition be referrible either to accident or intuition -- that the work proceed step by step to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem let we dismiss as irrelevant to the poem _ per se _ the circumstance -- or say the necessity -- which in the first place give rise to the intention of compose _ a _ poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste we commence then with this intention the initial consideration be that of extent if any literary work be too long to be read at one sit we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression -- for if two sitting be require the affair of the world interfere and everything like totality be at once destroy but since _ ceteri paribus _ no poet can afford to dispense with _ anything _ that may advance he design it but remain to be see whether there be in extent any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attend it here i say no at once what we term a long poem be in fact merely a succession of brief one -- that be to say of brief poetical effect it be needless to demonstrate that a poem be such only inasmuch as it intensely excite by elevate the soul and all intense excitement be through a psychal necessity brief for this reason at least one-half of the paradise lose be essentially prose -- a succession of poetical excitement intersperse _ inevitably _ with corresponding depression -- the whole be deprive through the extremeness of its length of the vastly important artistic element totality or unity of effect it appear evident then that there be a distinct limit as regard length to all work of literary art -- the limit of a single sit -- and that although in certain class of prose composition such as _ robinson crusoe _ -lrb- demand no unity -rrb- this limit may be advantageously overpass it can never properly be overpass in a poem within this limit the extent of a poem may be make to bear mathematical relation to its merit -- in other word to the excitement or elevation -- again in other word to the degree of the true poetical effect which it be capable of induce for it be clear that the brevity must be in direct ratio of the intensity of the intended effect -- this with one proviso -- that a certain degree of duration be absolutely requisite for the production of any effect at all hold in view these consideration as well as that degree of excitement which i deem not above the popular while not below the critical taste i reach at once what i conceive the proper _ length _ for my intended poem -- a length of about one hundred line it be in fact a hundred and eight my next thought concern the choice of a impression or effect to be convey : and here i may as well observe that throughout the construction i keep steadily in view the design of render the work _ universally _ appreciable i should be carry too far out of my immediate topic be i to demonstrate a point upon which i have repeatedly insist and which with the poetical stand not in the slightest need of demonstration -- the point i mean that beauty be the sole legitimate province of the poem a few word however in elucidation of my real meaning which some of my friend have evince a disposition to misrepresent that pleasure which be at once the most intense the most elevate and the most pure be i believe find in the contemplation of the beautiful when indeed man speak of beauty they mean precisely not a quality as be suppose but a effect -- they refer in short just to that intense and pure elevation of _ soul _ -- _ not _ of intellect or of heart -- upon which i have comment and which be experience in consequence of contemplate the beautiful now i designate beauty as the province of the poem merely because it be a obvious rule of art that effect should be make to spring from direct cause -- that object should be attain through means best adapt for they attainment -- no one as yet have be weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation allude to be _ most readily _ attain in the poem now the object truth or the satisfaction of the intellect and the object passion or the excitement of the heart be although attainable to a certain extent in poetry far more readily attainable in prose truth in fact demand a precision and passion a _ homeliness _ -lrb- the truly passionate will comprehend I -rrb- which be absolutely antagonistic to that beauty which i maintain be the excitement or pleasurable elevation of the soul it by no means follow from anything here say that passion or even truth may not be introduce and even profitably introduce into a poem -- for they may serve in elucidation or aid the general effect as do discord in music by contrast -- but the true artist will always contrive first to tone they into proper subservience to the predominant aim and secondly to enveil they as far as possible in that beauty which be the atmosphere and the essence of the poem regard then beauty as my province my next question refer to the _ tone _ of its highest manifestation -- and all experience have show that this tone be one of _ sadness _ beauty of whatever kind in its supreme development invariably excite the sensitive soul to tear melancholy be thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tone the length the province and the tone be thus determine i betook myself to ordinary induction with the view of obtain some artistic piquancy which might serve I as a key-note in the construction of the poem -- some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn in carefully think over all the usual artistic effect -- or more properly _ point _ in the theatrical sense -- i do not fail to perceive immediately that no one have be so universally employ as that of the _ refrain _ the universality of its employment suffice to assure I of its intrinsic value and spare I the necessity of submit it to analysis i consider it however with regard to its susceptibility of improvement and soon see it to be in a primitive condition as commonly use the _ refrain _ or burden not only be limit to lyric verse but depend for its impression upon the force of monotone -- both in sound and think the pleasure be deduce solely from the sense of identity -- of repetition i resolve to diversify and so heighten the effect by adhering in general to the monotone of sound while i continually vary that of thought : that be to say i determine to produce continuously novel effect by the variation _ of the application _ of the _ refrain _ -- the _ refrain _ itself remain for the most part unvaried these point be settle i next bethought I of the _ nature _ of my _ refrain _ since its application be to be repeatedly vary it be clear that the _ refrain _ itself must be brief for there would have be a insurmountable difficulty in frequent variation of application in any sentence of length in proportion to the brevity of the sentence would of course be the facility of the variation this lead I at once to a single word as the best _ refrain _ the question now arise as to the _ character _ of the word have make up my mind to a _ refrain _ the division of the poem into stanza be of course a corollary the _ refrain _ form the close to each stanza that such a close to have force must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted emphasis admit no doubt and these consideration inevitably lead I to the long _ o _ as the most sonorous vowel in connection with _ r _ as the most producible consonant the sound of the _ refrain _ be thus determine it become necessary to select a word embody this sound and at the same time in the fullest possible keep with that melancholy which i have predetermine as the tone of the poem in such a search it would have be absolutely impossible to overlook the word nevermore in fact it be the very first which present itself the next _ desideratum _ be a pretext for the continuous use of the one word nevermore in observe the difficulty which i at once find in invent a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition i do not fail to perceive that this difficulty arise solely from the pre-assumption that the word be to be so continuously or monotonously speak by a _ human _ be -- i do not fail to perceive in short that the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeat the word here then immediately arise the idea of a _ non _ - reasoning creature capable of speech and very naturally a parrot in the first instance suggest itself but be supersede forthwith by a raven as equally capable of speech and infinitely more in keep with the intended _ tone _ i have now go so far as the conception of a raven the bird of ill-omen monotonously repeat the one word nevermore at the conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone and in length about one hundred line now never lose sight of the object _ supremeness _ or perfection at all point i ask myself -- of all melancholy topic what accord to the _ universal _ understanding of mankind be the _ most _ melancholy death be the obvious reply and when i say be this most melancholy of topic most poetical from what i have already explain at some length the answer here also be obvious -- when it most closely ally itself to _ beauty _ the death then of a beautiful woman be unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world and equally be it beyond doubt that the lip best suit for such topic be those of a bereaved lover i have now to combine the two idea of a lover lament he deceased mistress and a raven continuously repeat the word nevermore i have to combine these bearing in mind my design of vary at every turn the _ application _ of the word repeat but the only intelligible mode of such combination be that of imagine the raven employ the word in answer to the query of the lover and here it be that i see at once the opportunity afford for the effect on which i have be depend that be to say the effect of the _ variation of application _ i see that i could make the first query propound by the lover -- the first query to which the raven should reply nevermore -- that i could make this first query a commonplace one the second less so the third still less and so on until at length the lover startle from he original _ nonchalance _ by the melancholy character of the word itself by its frequent repetition and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that utter it be at length excite to superstition and wildly propound query of a far different character -- query whose solution he have passionately at heart -- propound they half in superstition and half in that species of despair which delight in self-torture -- propound they not altogether because he believe in the prophetic or demoniac character of the bird -lrb- which reason assure he be merely repeat a lesson learn by rote -rrb- but because he experience a frenzied pleasure in so model he question as to receive from the _ expect _ nevermore the most delicious because the most intolerable of sorrow perceive the opportunity thus afford I or more strictly thus force upon I in the progress of the construction i first establish in mind the climax or conclude query -- that query to which nevermore should be in the last place a answer -- that query in reply to which this word nevermore should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair here then the poem may be say to have its beginning at the end where all work of art should begin for it be here at this point of my preconsideration that i first put pen to paper in the composition of the stanza : prophet say i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bend above we -- by that god we both adore tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angel name lenore -- clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angel name lenore quoth the raven nevermore i compose this stanza at this point first that by establish the climax i might the better vary and graduate as regard seriousness and importance the precede query of the lover and secondly that i might definitely settle the rhythm the metre and the length and general arrangement of the stanza as well as graduate the stanza which be to precede so that none of they might surpass this in rhythmical effect have i be able in the subsequent composition to construct more vigorous stanza i should without scruple have purposely enfeebled they so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect and here i may as well say a few word of the versification my first object -lrb- as usual -rrb- be originality the extent to which this have be neglect in versification be one of the most unaccountable thing in the world admit that there be little possibility of variety in mere _ rhythm _ it be still clear that the possible variety of metre and stanza be absolutely infinite and yet for _ century no man in verse have ever do or ever seem to think of do a original thing _ the fact be that originality -lrb- unless in mind of very unusual force -rrb- be by no mean a matter as some suppose of impulse or intuition in general to be find it must be elaborately seek and although a positive merit of the highest class demand in its attainment less of invention than negation of course i pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of the raven the former be trochaic -- the latter be octametre acatalectic alternate with heptametre catalectic repeat in the _ refrain _ of the fifth verse and terminate with tetrametre catalectic less pedantically the foot employ throughout -lrb- trochee -rrb- consist of a long syllable follow by a short the first line of the stanza consist of eight of these foot the second of seven and a half -lrb- in effect two-third -rrb- the third of eight the fourth of seven and a half the fifth the same the sixth three and a half now each of these line take individually have be employ before and what originality the raven have be in they _ combination into stanza _ nothing even remotely approach this combination have ever be attempt the effect of this originality of combination be aid by other unusual and some altogether novel effect arise from a extension of the application of the principle of rhyme and alliteration the next point to be consider be the mode of bring together the lover and the raven -- and the first branch of this consideration be the _ locale _ for this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a forest or the field -- but it have always appear to I that a close _ circumscription of space _ be absolutely necessary to the effect of insulate incident -- it have the force of a frame to a picture it have a indisputable moral power in keep concentrate the attention and of course must not be confound with mere unity of place i determine then to place the lover in he chamber -- in a chamber render sacred to he by memory of she who have frequent it the room be represent as richly furnished -- this in mere pursuance of the idea i have already explain on the subject of beauty as the sole true poetical thesis the _ locale _ be thus determine i have now to introduce the bird -- and the thought of introduce he through the window be inevitable the idea of make the lover suppose in the first instance that the flap of the wing of the bird against the shutter be a tap at the door originate in a wish to increase by prolong the reader 's curiosity and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arise from the lover 's throw open the door find all dark and thence adopt the half-fancy that it be the spirit of he mistress that knock i make the night tempestuous first to account for the raven 's seek admission and secondly for the effect of contrast with the -lrb- physical -rrb- serenity within the chamber i make the bird alight on the bust of palla also for the effect of contrast between the marble and the plumage -- it be understand that the bust be absolutely _ suggest _ by the bird -- the bust of _ palla _ be choose first as most in keep with the scholarship of the lover and secondly for the sonorousness of the word palla itself about the middle of the poem also i have avail myself of the force of contrast with a view of deepen the ultimate impression for example a air of the fantastic -- approach as nearly to the ludicrous as be admissible -- be give to the raven 's entrance he come in with many a flirt and flutter not the _ least obeisance make he _ -- not a moment stop or stay he _ but with mien of lord or lady _ perch above my chamber door in the two stanza which follow the design be more obviously carry out : then this ebony bird beguiling my _ sad fancy _ into smile by the _ grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wear _ though thy _ crest be shear and shave _ thou i say art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wander from the nightly shore -- tell I what thy lordly name be on the night 's plutonian shore quoth the raven nevermore much i marvel _ this ungainly fowl _ to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaning -- little relevancy bear for we can not help agree that no live human be _ ever yet be bless with see bird above he chamber door -- bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above he chamber door _ with such name as nevermore the effect of the dénouement be thus provide for i immediately drop the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness -- this tone commence in the stanza directly follow the one last quote with the line but the raven sit lonely on that placid bust speak only etc from this epoch the lover no longer jest -- no longer see anything even of the fantastic in the raven 's demeanor he speak of he as a grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore and feel the fiery eye burn into he bosom 's core this revolution of thought or fancy on the lover 's part be intend to induce a similar one on the part of the reader -- to bring the mind into a proper frame for the _ dénouement _ -- which be now bring about as rapidly and as _ directly _ as possible with the _ dénouement _ proper -- with the raven 's reply nevermore to the lover 's final demand if he shall meet he mistress in another world -- the poem in its obvious phase that of a simple narrative may be say to have its completion so far everything be within the limit of the accountable -- of the real a raven have learn by rote the single word nevermore and have escape from the custody of its owner be drive at midnight through the violence of a storm to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleam -- the chamber-window of a student occupied half in pour over a volume half in dream of a beloved mistress decease the casement be throw open at the fluttering of the bird 's wing the bird itself perch on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student who amuse by the incident and the oddity of the visitor 's demeanor demand of it in jest and with out look for a reply its name the raven address answer with its customary word nevermore -- a word which find immediate echo in the melancholy heart of the student who give utterance aloud to certain thought suggest by the occasion be again startle by the fowl 's repetition of nevermore the student now guess the state of the case but be impel as i have before explain by the human thirst for self-torture and in part by superstition to propound such query to the bird as will bring he the lover the most of the luxury of sorrow through the anticipated answer nevermore with the indulgence to the extreme of this self-torture the narration in what i have term its first or obvious phase have a natural termination and so far there have be no overstepping of the limit of the real but in subject so handle however skilfully or with however vivid a array of incident there be always a certain hardness or nakedness which repel the artistical eye two thing be invariably require -- first some amount of complexity or more properly adaptation and secondly some amount of suggestiveness some undercurrent however indefinite of mean it be this latter in especial which impart to a work of art so much of that _ richness _ -lrb- to borrow from colloquy a forcible term -rrb- which we be too fond of confound with _ the ideal _ it be the _ excess _ of the suggest meaning -- it be the render this the upper instead of the under current of theme -- which turn into prose -lrb- and that of the very flattest kind -rrb- the so-called poetry of the so-called transcendentalist hold these opinion i add the two conclude stanza of the poem -- they suggestiveness be thus make to pervade all the narrative which have precede they the undercurrent of meaning be render first apparent in the line : take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door quoth the raven nevermore it will be observe that the word from out my heart involve the first metaphorical expression in the poem they with the answer nevermore dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that have be previously narrate the reader begin now to regard the raven as emblematical -- but it be not until the very last line of the very last stanza that the intention of make he emblematical of _ mournful and never-ending remembrance _ be permit distinctly to be see : and the raven never flit still be sit still be sit on the pallid bust of palla just above my chamber door and he eye have all the seeming of a demon 's that be dream and the lamplight o'er he streaming throw he shadow on the floor and my soul _ from out that shadow _ that lie float on the floor shall be lift -- nevermore \* \* \* \* \* old english poetry -lrb- 1 -rrb- it should not be doubt that at least one-third of the affection with which we regard the elder poet of great britain should be attribute to what be in itself a thing apart from poetry -- we mean to the simple love of the antique -- and that again a third of even the proper _ poetic sentiment _ inspire by they writings should be ascribe to a fact which while it have strict connection with poetry in the abstract and with the old british poem themselves should not be look upon as a merit appertaining to the author of the poem almost every devout admirer of the old bard if demand he opinion of they production would mention vaguely yet with perfect sincerity a sense of dreamy wild indefinite and he would perhaps say indefinable delight on be require to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling this quaintness be in fact a very powerful adjunct to ideality but in the case in question it arise independently of the author 's will and be altogether apart from he intention word and they rhythm have vary verse which affect we to-day with a vivid delight and which delight in many instance may be trace to the one source quaintness must have worn in the day of they construction a very commonplace air this be of course no argument against the poem _ now _ -- we mean it only as against the poet _ then _ there be a grow desire to overrate they the old english muse be frank guileless sincere and although very learn still learn without art no general error evince a more thorough confusion of idea than the error of suppose donne and cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth and coleridge be so with the two former ethic be the end -- with the two latter the mean the poet of the creation wish by highly artificial verse to inculcate what he suppose to be moral truth -- the poet of the ancient mariner to infuse the poetic sentiment through channel suggest by analysis the one finish by complete failure what he commence in the grossest misconception the other by a path which could not possibly lead he astray arrive at a triumph which be not the less glorious because hide from the profane eye of the multitude but in this view even the metaphysical verse of cowley be but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man and he be in this but a type of he _ school _ -- for we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writer whose poem be bind up in the volume before we and throughout all of whom there run a very perceptible general character they use little art in composition they writings spring immediately from the soul -- and partook intensely of that soul 's nature nor be it difficult to perceive the tendency of this _ abandon _ -- to elevate immeasurably all the energy of mind -- but again so to mingle the greatest possible fire force delicacy and all good thing with the lowest possible bathos baldness and imbecility as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average result of mind in such a school will be find inferior to those result in one -lrb- _ ceteri paribus _ -rrb- more artificial we can not bring ourselves to believe that the selection of the book of gem be such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the _ school _ -- but if the intention have be merely to show the school 's character the attempt might have be consider successful in the highest degree there be long passage now before we of the most despicable trash with no merit whatever beyond that of they antiquity the criticism of the editor do not particularly please we he enthusiasm be too general and too vivid not to be false he opinion for example of sir henry 's wotton 's verse on the queen of bohemia -- that there be few finer thing in we language be untenable and absurd in such line we can perceive not one of those higher attribute of poesy which belong to she in all circumstance and throughout all time here everything be art nakedly or but awkwardly conceal no prepossession for the mere antique -lrb- and in this case we can imagine no other prepossession -rrb- should induce we to dignify with the sacred name of poetry a series such as this of elaborate and threadbare compliment stitch apparently together without fancy without plausibility and without even a attempt at adaptation in common with all the world we have be much delighted with the shepherd 's hunting by withers -- a poem partaking in a remarkable degree of the peculiarity of ` il penseroso ' speaking of poesy the author say : by the murmur of a spring or the least bough rustlele by a daisy whose leave spread shut when titan go to bed or a shady bush or tree she could more infuse in I than all nature 's beauty con in some other wiser man by she help i also now make this churlish place allow something that may sweeten gladness in the very gall of sadness -- the dull loneness the black shade that these hang vault have make the strange music of the wave beat on these hollow cave this black den which rock emboss overgrown with eldest moss the rude portal that give light more to terror than delight this my chamber of neglect wall about with disrespect from all these and this dull air a fit object for despair she have teach I by she might to draw comfort and delight but these line however good do not bear with they much of the general character of the english antique something more of this will be find in corbet 's farewell to the fairy we copy a portion of marvell 's maiden lament for she fawn which we prefer -- not only as a specimen of the elder poet but in itself as a beautiful poem abound in pathos exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness -- to anything of its species : it be a wondrous thing how fleet 'twa on those little silver foot with what a pretty skip grace it oft would challenge I the race and whe not have leave I far away ` twould stay and run again and stay for it be nimbler much than hind and tread as if on the four wind i have a garden of my own but so with rose overgrown and lily that you would it guess to be a little wilderness and all the spring-time of the year it only love to be there among the bed of lily i have seek it oft where it should lie yet could not till itself would rise find it although before mine eye for in the flaxen lily shade it like a bank of lily lay upon the rose it would feed until its lip even seem to bleed and then to I ` twould boldly trip and print those rose on my lip but all its chief delight be still with rose thus itself to fill and its pure virgin limb to fold in whitest sheet of lily cold have it live long it would have be lily without rose within how truthful a air of lamentation hang here upon every syllable it pervade all it come over the sweet melody of the word -- over the gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself -- even over the half-playful half-petulant air with which she linger on the beauty and good quality of she favorite -- like the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lily and violet and all sweet flower the whole be redolent with poetry of a very lofty order every line be a idea convey either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn or the artlessness of the maiden or she love or she admiration or she grief or the fragrance and warmth and _ appropriateness _ of the little nest-like bed of lily and rose which the fawn devour as it lay upon they and could scarcely be distinguish from they by the once happy little damsel who go to seek she pet with a arch and rosy smile on she face consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few line we have quote -- the _ wonder _ of the little maiden at the fleetness of she favorite -- the little silver foot -- the fawn challenge he mistress to a race with a pretty skip grace run on before and then with head turn back await she approach only to fly from it again -- can we not distinctly perceive all these thing how exceedingly vigorous too be the line and trod as if on the four wind a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four foot of the favorite one for each wind then consider the garden of my own so overgrown entangled with rose and lily as to be a little wilderness -- the fawn loving to be there and there only -- the maiden seek it where it _ should _ lie -- and not be able to distinguish it from the flower until itself would rise -- the lie among the lily like a bank of lily -- the loving to fill itself with rose and its pure virgin limb to fold in whitest sheet of lily cold and these thing be its chief delight -- and then the pre-eminent beauty and naturalness of the conclude line whose very hyperbole only render they more true to nature when we consider the innocence the artlessness the enthusiasm the passionate girl and more passionate admiration of the bereaved child : have it live long it would have be lily without rose
