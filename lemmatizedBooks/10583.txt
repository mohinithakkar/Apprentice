chapter i from the invasion of the netherland by the roman to the invasion by the salian frank bc 50 -- ad 200 the netherland form a kingdom of moderate extent situate on the border of the ocean opposite to the southeast coast of england and stretch from the frontier of france to those of hanover the country be principally compose of low and humid grounds present a vast plain irrigated by the water from all those neighbor state which be traverse by the rhine the meuse and the scheldt this plain gradually rise toward its eastern and southern extremity blend on the one hand with prussium and on the other with france have therefore no natural or strongly marked limit on those side the extent of the kingdom could only be determine by convention and it must be at all time subject to the arbitrary and vary influence of european policy its greatest length from north to south be about two hundred and twenty english mile and its breadth from east to west be nearly one hundred and forty two distinct kind of man inhabit this kingdom the one occupy the valley of the meuse and the scheldt and the high grounds border on france speak a dialect of the language of that country and evidently belong to the gallic race they be call walloon and be distinguish from the other by many peculiar quality they most prominent characteristic be a propensity for war and they principal source of subsistence the working of they mine they form nearly one-fourth of the population of the whole kingdom or about one million three hundred thousand person all the rest of the nation speak low german in its modification of dutch and flemish and they offer the distinctive characteristic of the saxon race -- talent for agriculture navigation and commerce perseverance rather than vivacity and more courage than taste for the profession of arm they be subdivide into fleming -- those who be the last to submit to the house of austrium and dutch -- those who form the republic of the united province but there be no difference between these two subdivision except such as have be produce by political and religious institution the physical aspect of the people be the same and the soil equally law and moist be at once fertilize and menace by the water the history of this last-mentioned portion of the nation be completely link to that of the soil which they occupy in remote time when the inhabitant of this plain be few and uncivilized the country form but one immense morass of which the chief part be incessantly inundate and make sterile by the water of the sea pliny the naturalist who visit the northern coast have leave we a picture of they state in he day there say he the ocean pour in its flood twice every day and produce a perpetual uncertainty whether the country may be consider as a part of the continent or of the sea the wretched inhabitant take refuge on the sand-hill or in little hut which they construct on the summit of lofty stake whose elevation be conformable to that of the highest tide when the sea rise they appear like navigator when it retire they seem as though they have be shipwreck they subsist on the fish leave by the refluent water and which they catch in net form of rush or seaweed neither tree nor shrub be visible on these shore the drink of the people be rain-water which they preserve with great care they fuel a sort of turf which they gather and form with the hand and yet these unfortunate being dare to complain against they fate when they fall under the power and be incorporate with the empire of rome the picture of poverty and suffering which this passage present be heighten when join to a description of the country the coast consist only of sand-bank or slime alternately overflow or leave imperfectly dry a little further inland tree be to be find but on a soil so marshy that a inundation or a tempest throw down whole forest such as be still at time discover at either eight or ten foot depth below the surface the sea have no limit the river no bed nor bank the earth no solidity for accord to a author of the third century of we era there be not in the whole of too immense plain a spot of ground that do not yield under the footstep of man -- eumenius it be not the same in the southern part which form at present the walloon country these high grounds suffer much less from the ravages of the water the ancient forest of the ardenne extend from the rhine to the scheldt sheltered a numerous though savage population which in all thing resemble the german from whom they derive they descent the chase and the occupation of rude agriculture suffice for the want of a race less poor and less patient but more unsteady and ambitious than the fisherman of the low land thus it be that history present we with a tribe of warrior and conqueror on the southern frontier of the country while the scatter inhabitant of the remain part seem to have fix there without a contest and to have trace out for themselves by necessity and habit a existence which any other people must have consider insupportable this difference in the nature of the soil and in the fate of the inhabitant appear more striking when we consider the present situation of the country the high grounds formerly so preferable be now the least valuable part of the kingdom even as regard they agriculture while the ancient marsh have be change by human industry into rich and fertile tract the best part of which be precisely those conquer from the grasp of the ocean in order to form a idea of the solitude and desolation which once reign where we now see the most richly cultivate field the most thriving village and the wealthiest town of the continent the imagination must go back to time which have not leave one monument of antiquity and scarcely a vestige of fact the history of the netherland be then essentially that of a patient and industrious population struggle against every obstacle which nature could oppose to its well-being and in this contest man triumph most completely over the element in those place where they offer the greatest resistance this extraordinary result be due to the hardy stamp of character imprint by suffer and danger on those who have the ocean for they foe to the nature of they country which present no lure for conquest and finally to the toleration the justice and the liberty nourish among man leave to themselves and who find resource in they social state which render change neither a object of they want nor wish about half a century before the christian era the obscurity which envelop the north of europe begin to disperse and the expedition of julius cæsar give to the civilized world the first notion of the netherland germany and england cæsar after have subjugate the chief part of gaul turn he arm against the warlike tribe of the ardenne who refuse to accept he alliance or implore he protection they be call belgæ by the roman and at once pronounce the least civilized and the bravest of the gaul cæsar there find several ignorant and poor but intrepid clan of warrior who march fiercely to encounter he and notwithstanding they inferiority in number in weapon and in tactic they nearly destroy the disciplined army of rome they be however defeat and they country ravage by the invader who find less success when they attack the native of the low grounds the menapian a people who occupy the present province of flander and antwerp though less numerous than those whom the roman have last vanquished arrest they progress both by open fight and by that petty and harassing contest -- that warfare of the people rather than of the soldiery -- so well adapt to the nature of the country the roman legion retreat for the first time and be contented to occupy the higher part which now form the walloon province but the policy of cæsar make greater progress than he arm he have rather defeat than subdue those who have dare the contest he consolidate he victory without new battle he offer peace to he enemy in propose to they alliance and he require they aid as friend to carry on new war in other land he thus attract toward he and range under he banner not only those people situate to the west of the rhine and the meuse but several other nation more to the north whose territory he have never see and particularly the batavian -- a valiant tribe state by various ancient author and particularly by tacitus as a fraction of the cattus who occupy the space comprise between these river the young man of these warlike people dazzle by the splendor of the roman army feel proud and happy in be allow to identify themselves with they cæsar encourage this disposition and even go so far on some occasion as to deprive the roman cavalry of they horse on which he mount those new ally who manage they better than they italian rider he have no reason to repent these measure almost all he subsequent victory and particularly that of pharsalium be decide by the valor of the auxiliary he obtain from the low country these auxiliary be chiefly draw from hainault luxemburg and the country of the batavian and they form the best cavalry of the roman army as well as they choicest light infantry force the batavian also signalize themselves on many occasion by the skill with which they swim across several great river without break they squadron rank they be amply reward for they military service and hazardous exploit and be treat like stanch and valuable ally but this unequal connection of a mighty empire with a few petty state must have be fatal to the liberty of the weaker party its first effect be to destroy all feeling of nationality in a great portion of the population the young adventurer of this part of the low country after twenty year of service under the imperial eagle return to he native wild a roman the general of the empire pierce the forest of the ardenne with causeway and found town in the heart of the country the result of such innovation be a total amalgamation of the roman and they new ally and little by little the national character of the latter become entirely obliterate but to trace now the precise history of this gradual change would be as impossible as it will be one day to follow the progress of civilization in the wood of north america but it must be remark that this metamorphosis affect only the inhabitant of the high grounds and the batavian -lrb- who be in they origin german -rrb- properly so call the scanty population of the rest of the country endowed with that fidelity to they ancient custom which characterize the saxon race show no tendency to mix with foreigner rarely figure in they rank and seem to revolt from the southern refinement which be so little in harmony with they manners and way of life it be astonishing at the first view that those being whose whole existence be a contest against famine or the wave should show less inclination than they happier neighbor to receive from rome a abundant recompense for they service but the greater they difficulty to find subsistence in they native land the stronger seem they attachment like that of the switzer to he barren rock or of the mariner to the frail and hazardous home that bear he afloat on the ocean this race of patriot be divide into two separate people those to the north of the rhine be the frison those to the west of the meuse the menapian already mention the frison differ little from those early inhabitant of the coast who perch on they high-built hut feed on fish and drink the water of the cloud slow and successive improvement teach they to cultivate the bean which grow wild among the marsh and to tend and feed a small and degenerate breed of horn cattle but if these first step toward civilization be slow they be also sure and they be make by a race of man who could never retrograde in a career once begin the menapian equally repugnant to foreign impression make on they part a more rapid progress they be already a maritime people and carry on a considerable commerce with england it appear that they export thither salt the art of manufacturing which be well know to they and they bring back in return marl a most important commodity for the improvement of they land they also understand the preparation of salt meat with a perfection that make it in high repute even in italy and finally we be tell by ptolemy that they have establish a colony on the eastern coast of ireland not far from dublin the two class of what form at present the population of the netherland thus follow career widely different during the long period of the roman power in these part of europe while those of the high land and the batavian distinguish themselves by a long-continued course of military service or servitude those of the plain improve by degree they social condition and fit themselves for a place in civilized europe the former receive from rome great mark of favor in exchange for they freedom the latter reject the honor and distinction lavish on they neighbor secure they national independence by trust to they industry alone for all the advantage they gradually acquire be the means of protect themselves and they country from the inundation of the sea know and practice by these ancient inhabitant of the coast or do they occupy only those elevated point of land which stand out like island in the middle of the flood these question be among the most important present by they history since it be the victorious struggle of man against the ocean that fix the extent and form of the country it appear almost certain that in the time of cæsar they do not labor at the construction of dike but that they begin to be raise during the obscurity of the following century for the remains of ancient town be even now discover in place at present overflow by the sea these ruin often bring to light trace of roman construction and latin inscription in honor of the menapian divinity it be then certain that they have learn to imitate those who rule in the neighboring country : a result by no means surprising for even england the mart of they commerce and the nation with which they have the most constant intercourse be at that period occupy by the roman but the nature of they country repulse so effectually every attempt at foreign domination that the conqueror of the world leave they unmolested and established arsenal and form communication with great britain only at boulogne and in the island of the batavian near leyden this isolation form in itself a powerful and perfect barrier between the inhabitant of the plain and those of the high grounds the first hold firm to they primitive custom and they ancient language the second finish by speak latin and borrow all the manners and usage of italy the moral effect of this contrast be that the people once so famous for they bravery lose with they liberty they energy and they courage one of the batavian chieftain name civili form a exception to this degeneracy and about the year 70 of we era bravely take up arm for the expulsion of the roman he effect prodigy of valor and perseverance and boldly meet and defeat the enemy both by land and sea reverse follow he first success and he finally conclude a honorable treaty by which he countryman once more become the ally of rome but after this expire effort of valor the batavian even though choose from all nation for the bodyguard of the roman emperor become rapidly degenerate and when tacitus write ninety year after christ they be already look on as less brave than the frison and the other people beyond the rhine a century and a half later see they confound with the gaul and the barbarian conqueror say that they be not a nation but merely a _ prey _ reduce into a roman province the southern portion of the netherland be at this period call belgic gaul and the name of belgium preserve to we day have until lately be apply to distinguish that part of the country situate to the south of the rhine and the meuse or nearly that which form the austrian netherland during the establishment of the roman power in the north of europe observation be not much excite toward the rapid effect of this degeneracy compare with the fast-growing vigor of the people of the low land the fact of the frison have on one occasion near the year 47 of we era beat a whole army of roman have confirm they character for intrepidity but the long stagnation produce in these remote country by the colossal weight of the empire be break about the year 250 by a irruption of german or salian frank who pass the rhine and the meuse establish themselves in the vicinity of the menapian near antwerp breda and bois-le-duc all the nation that have be subjugate by the roman power appear to have take arm on this occasion and oppose the intruder but the menapian unite themselves with these newcomer and aid they to meet the shock of the imperial army carausius originally a menapian pilot but promote to the command of a roman fleet make common cause with he fellow-citizen and proclaim himself emperor of great britain where the naval superiority of the menapian leave he no fear of a competitor in recompense of the assistance give he by the frank he cross the sea again from he new empire to aid they in they war with the batavian the ally of rome and have seize on they island and massacre nearly the whole of its inhabitant he there establish he faithful friend the salian constantius and he son constantine the great vainly strive even after the death of the brave carausius to regain possession of the country but they be force to leave the new inhabitant in quiet possession of they conquest chapter ii from the settlement of the frank to the subjugation of friesland ad 250 -- 800 from this epoch we must trace the progress of a totally new and distinct population in the netherland the batavian be annihilate almost without resistance the low country contain only the free people of the german race but these people do not completely sympathize together so as to form one consolidated nation the salian and the other petty tribe of frank they ally be essentially warlike and appear precisely the same as the original inhabitant of the high grounds the menapian and the frison on the contrary lose nothing of they spirit of commerce and industry the result of this diversity be a separation between the frank and the menapian while the latter under the name of armorican join themselves more closely with the people who border the channel the frison associate themselves with the tribe settle on the limit of the german ocean and form with they a connection celebrate under the title of the saxon league thus be form on all point a union between the maritime race against the inland inhabitant and they mutual antipathy become more and more develop as the decline of the roman empire end the former struggle between liberty and conquest the netherland now become the earliest theater of a entirely new movement the consequence of which be destine to affect the whole world this country be occupy toward the sea by a people wholly maritime except the narrow space between the rhine and the vahal of which the salian frank have become possess the nature of this marshy soil in comparison with the sand of westphalium guelder and north brabant be not more strikingly contrast than be the character of they population the frank who have be for a while under the roman sway show a compound of the violence of savage life and the corruption of civilized society they be covetous and treacherous but make excellent soldier and at this epoch which intervene between the power of imperial rome and that of germany the frank might be morally consider as a borderer on the frontier of the middle age the saxon -lrb- and this name comprehend all the tribe of the coast from the rhine as far north as denmark -rrb- unite in himself the distinctive quality of german and navigator be moderate and sincere but implacable in he rage neither of these two race of man be excel in point of courage but the number of frank who still enter into the service of the empire diminish the real force of this nation and naturally tend to disunite it therefore in the subsequent shock of people against people the saxon invariably gain the final advantage they have no doubt often measure they strength in the most remote time since the frank be but the descendant of the ancient tribe of sicamber and other against whom the batavian have offer they assistance to cæsar under augustus the inhabitant of the coast have in the same way join themselves with drusus to oppose these they old enemy it be also after have be expel by the frison from guelder that the salian have pass the rhine and the meuse but in the fourth century the two people recover they strength the struggle recommence never to terminate -- at least between the direct descendant of each it be believe that it be the varnus a race of saxon nearly connect with those of england -lrb- and come like they from the coast of denmark -rrb- who on this occasion strike the decisive blow on the side of the saxon embark on board a numerous fleet they make a descent in the ancient isle of the batavian at that time inhabit by the salian whom they completely destroy julian the apostate who be then with a numerous army pursue he career of early glory in these country interfere for the purpose of prevent the expulsion or at least the utter destruction of the vanquish but he effort be unavail the salian appear to have figure no more in this part of the low country the defeat of the salian by a saxon tribe be a fact on which no doubt rest the name of the victor be however questionable the varnus have remain settle near the mouth of the rhine till near the year 500 there be strong probability that they be the people allude to but name and history which may on this point appear of such little importance acquire considerable interest when we reflect that these salian drive from they settlement become the conqueror of france that those saxon who force they on they career of conquest be destine to become the master of england and that these two petty tribe who battle so long for a corner of marshy earth carry with they they reciprocal antipathy while involuntarily decide the destiny of europe the defeat of the frank be fatal to those people who have become incorporate with the roman for it be from they that the exile wanderer still fierce in they ruin and with arm in they hand demand land and herd all in short which they themselves have lose from the middle of the fourth century to the end of the fifth there be a succession of invasion in this spirit which always end by the subjugation of a part of the country and which be complete about the year 490 by clovi make himself master of almost the whole of gaul under this new empire not a vestige of the ancient nation of the ardenne be leave the civilized population either perish or be reduce to slavery and all the high grounds be add to the previous conquest of the salian but the maritime population when once possess of the whole coast do not seek to make the slightest progress toward the interior the element of they enterprise and the object of they ambition be the ocean and when this hardy and intrepid race become too numerous for they narrow limit expedition and colony beyond the sea carry off they redundant population the saxon warrior establish themselves near the mouth of the loire other conduct by hengist and horsa settle in great britain it will always remain problematical from what point of the coast these adventurer depart but many circumstance tend to give weight to the opinion which pronounce those old saxon to have start from the netherland paganism not be yet banish from these country the obscurity which would have envelop they be in some degree dispel by the recital of the monk who go among they to preach christianity we see in those record and by the text of some of they early law that this maritime people be more industrious prosperous and happy than those of france the man be handsome and richly clothed and the land well cultivate and abound in fruit milk and honey the saxon merchant carry they trade far into the southern country in the meantime the part of the netherland which belong to france resemble a desert the monastery which be there found be establish accord to the word of they charter amid immense solitude and the french noble only come into brabant for the sport of bear-hunting in its interminable forest thus while the inhabitant of the low land as far back as the light of history penetrate appear in a continual state of improvement those of the high grounds after frequent vicissitude seem to sink into utter degeneracy and subjugation the latter wish to denaturalize themselves and become as though they be foreigner even on they native soil the former remain firm and faithful to they country and to each other but the growth of french power menace utter ruin to this interesting race clovi have succeed about the year 485 of we era in destroy the last remnant of roman domination in gaul the successor of these conqueror soon extend they empire from the pyrenee to the rhine they have continual contest with the free population of the low country and they nearest neighbor in the commencement of the seventh century the french king clotaire ii exterminate the chief part of the saxon of hanover and westphalium and the historian of those barbarous time unanimously relate that he cause to be behead every inhabitant of the vanquish tribe who exceed the height of he sword the saxon name be thus nearly extinguish in those country and the remnant of these various people adopt that of frison -lrb- friesen -rrb- either because they become really incorporate with that nation or merely that they recognize it for the most powerful of they tribe friesland to speak in the language of that age extend then from the scheldt to the weser and form a considerable state but the ascendency of france be every year become more marked and king dagobert extend the limit of she power even as far as utrecht the descendant of the menapian know at that epoch by the different name of menapian fleming and toxandiran fall one after another directly or indirectly under the empire of the merovingian prince and the noblest family which exist among the french -- that which subsequently take the name of carlovingian -- comprise in its dominion nearly the whole of the southern and western part of the netherland between this family whose chief be call duke of the frontier marsh -lrb- _ dux_brabantioe _ -rrb- and the free tribe unite under the common name of frison the same struggle be maintain as that which formerly exist between the salian and the saxon toward the year 700 the french monarchy be tear by anarchy and under the lazy king lose much of its concentrated power but every dukedom form a independent sovereignty and of all those that of brabant be the most redoubtable nevertheless the frison under they king radbod assume for a moment the superiority and utrecht where the french have establish christianity fall again into the power of the pagan charle martell at that time young and but commence he splendid career be defeat by the hostile king in the forest of the ardenne and though in subsequent conquest he take a ample revenge radbod still remain a powerful opponent it be related of this fierce monarch that he be convert by a christian missionary but at the moment in which he put he foot in the water for the ceremony of baptism he suddenly ask the priest where all he old frison companion in arm have go after they death to hell reply the priest well then say radbod draw back he foot from the water i would rather go to hell with they than to paradise with you and you fellow foreigner and he refuse to receive the rite of baptism and remain a pagan after the death of radbod in 719 charle martell now become duke of the frank mayor of the palace or by whatever other of he several title he may be distinguish finally triumph over the long-resisting frison he labor to establish christianity among they but they do not understand the french language and the lot of convert they be consequently reserve for the english st willebrod be the first missionary who meet with any success about the latter end of the seventh century but it be not till toward the year 750 that this great mission be finally accomplish by st boniface archbishop of mayence and the apostle of germany yet the progress of christianity and the establishment of a foreign sway still meet the partial resistance which a conquer but not enervated people be always capable of oppose to they master st boniface fall a victim to this stubborn spirit he perish a martyr to he zeal but perhaps a victim as well to the violent measure of he colleague in friesland the very province which to this day preserve the name the last avenger of friesland liberty and of the national idol be the illustrious witikind to whom the chronicle of he country give the title of first azing or judge this intrepid chieftain be consider as a compatriot not only by the historian of friesland but by those of saxony both it would appear have equal claim to the honor for the union between the two people be constantly strengthen by intermarriage between the noblest family of each as long as witikind remain a pagan and a freeman some doubt exist as to the final fate of friesland but when by he conversion he become only a noble of the court of charlemagne the slavery of he country be consummate chapter iii from the conquest of friesland to the formation of holland ad 800 -- 1000 even at this advanced epoch of foreign domination there remain as great a difference as ever between the people of the high grounds and the inhabitant of the plain the latter be like the rest incorporate with the great monarchy but they preserve the remembrance of former independence and even retain they ancient name in flander menapian and fleming be still find and in the country of antwerp the toxandrian be not extinct all the rest of the coast be still call friesland but in the high grounds the name of the old inhabitant be lose nation be designate by the name of they river forest or town they be classify as accessory to inanimate thing and have no monument which remind they of they origin they become as it be without recollection or association and degenerate as may be almost say into a people without ancestry the physical state of the country have greatly change from the time of cæsar to those of charlemagne many part of the forest of the ardenne have be cut down or clear away civilization have only appear for a while among these wood to perish like a delicate plant in a ungenial clime but it seem to have suck the very sap from the soil and to have leave the people no remains of the vigor of man in he savage state nor of the desperate courage of the warrior of germany a race of serf now cultivate the domain of haughty lord and imperious priest the clergy have immense possession in this country a act of the following century recognize fourteen thousand family of vassal as belong to the single abbey of nivelle tournay and tongre both episcopal city be by that title somewhat less oppressed than the other ancient town found by the roman but they appear to have possess only a poor and degraded population the low land on the other hand announce a striking commencement of improvement and prosperity the marsh and fen which have arrest and repulse the progress of imperial rome have disappear in every part of the interior the meuse and the scheldt no longer join at they outlet to desolate the neighbor land whether this change be produce by the labor of man or merely by the accumulation of sand deposit by either stream and form barrier to both the town of courtraig bruge ghent antwerp berg-op-zoom and thiel have already a flourish trade the last-mentioned town contain in the following century fifty-five church a fact from which in the absence of other evidence the extent of the population may be conjecture the formation of dike for the protection of land formerly submerge be already well understand and regulate by uniform custom the plain thus reconquer from the water be distribute in portion accord to they labor by those who reclaim they except the part reserve for the chieftain the church and the poor this vital necessity for the construction of dike have give to the frison and flemish population a particular habit of union goodwill and reciprocal justice because it be necessary to make common cause in this great work for they mutual preservation in all other point the detail of the law and manners of this united people present a picture similar to that of the saxon of england with the sole exception that the people of the netherland be milder than the saxon race properly so call -- they long habit of laborious industry exercise its happy influence on the martial spirit original to both the manufacturing art be also somewhat more advance in this part of the continent than in great britain the frison for example be the only people who could succeed in make the costly mantle in use among the wealthy frank the government of charlemagne admit but one form borrow from that of the empire in the period of its decline -- a mixture of the spiritual and temporal power exercise in the first place by the emperor and at second-hand by the count and bishop the count in those time be not the head of noble family as they afterward become but officer of the government removable at will and possess no hereditary rights they income do not arise from salary pay in money but consist of land of which they have the revenue during the continuance of they authority these land be situate in the limit of they administration each regard they as he property only for the time be and consider himself as a tenant at will how unfavorable such a system be to culture and improvement may be well imagine the force of possession be however frequently oppose to the seigniorial rights of the crown and thus though all civil dignity and the revenue attach to it be but personal and reclaimable at will still many dignitary take advantage of the barbarous state of the country in which they isolate canton be place seek by every possible means to render they power and prerogative inalienable and real the force of the monarchical government which consist mainly in its centralization be necessarily weaken by the intervention of local obstacle before it could pass from the heart of the empire to its limit thus it be only by perpetually interpose he personal effort and fly as it be from one end to the other of he dominion that charlemagne succeed in preserve he authority as for the people without any sort of guarantee against the despotism of the government they be utterly at the mercy of the noble or of the sovereign but this state of servitude be quite incompatible with the union of social power necessary to a population that have to struggle against the tyranny of the ocean to repulse its attack with successful vigor a spirit of complete concert be absolutely require and the nation be thus unite and consequently strong the effort of foreign tyrant be shatter by its resistance as the wave of the sea that break against the dike by which it be defy from the time of charlemagne the people of the ancient menapium now become a prosperous commonwealth form political association to raise a barrier against the despotic violence of the frank these association be call gilden and in the latin of the time gildonium they comprise besides they covenant for mutual protection a obligation which bind every member to give succor to any other in case of illness conflagration or shipwreck but the grow force of these social compact alarm the quick-sighted despotism of charlemagne and they be consequently prohibit both by he and he successor to give a notion of the importance of this prohibition to the whole of europe it be only necessary to state that the most ancient corporation -lrb- all which have precede and engender the most valuable municipal rights -rrb- be nothing more than gilden thus to draw a example from great britain the corporative charter of berwick still bear the title of charta gildoniæ but the ban of the sovereign be without efficacy when oppose to the popular will the gilden stand they ground and within a century after the death of charlemagne all flander be cover with corporate town this popular opposition take however another form in the northern part of the country which still bear the common name of friesland for there it be not merely local but national the frison succeed in obtain the sanction of the monarch to consecrate as it be those rights which be establish under the ancient form of government the fact be undoubted but the means which they employ be uncertain it appear most probable that this great privilege be the price of they military service for they hold a high place in the victorious army of charlemagne and turpin the old french romancer allude to the popular tradition of he time represent the warrior of friesland as endowed with the most heroic valor these rights which the frison secure accord to they own statement from charlemagne but most undoubtedly from some one or other of the earliest emperor consist first in the freedom of every order of citizen secondly in the right of property -- a right which admit no authority of the sovereign to violate by confiscation except in case of downright treason thirdly in the privilege of trial by none but native judge and accord to they national usage fourthly in a very narrow limitation of the military service which they owe to the king fifthly in the hereditary title to feudal property in direct line on payment of certain due or rent these five principal article suffice to render friesland in its political aspect totally different from the other portion of the monarchy they privilege secure they property inviolable they duty limit the frison be altogether free from the servitude which weigh down france it will soon be see that these special advantage produce a government nearly analogous to that which magna charta be the means of found at a later period in england the successor of charlemagne chiefly signalize they authority by lavish donation of all kind on the church by such mean the ecclesiastical power become greater and greater and in those country under the sway of france be quite as arbitrary and enormous as that of the nobility the bishop of utrecht liege and tournay become in the course of time the chief personage on that line of the frontier they have the great advantage over the count of not be subject to capricious or tyrannical removal they therefore even in civil affair play a more considerable part than the latter and begin to render themselves more and more independent in they episcopal city which be soon to become so many principality the count on they part use they best exertion to wear out if they have not the strength to break the chain which bind they to the footstool of the monarch they be not all now dependent on the same sovereign for the empire of charlemagne be divide among he successor : france properly so call be bound by the scheldt the country to the eastward of that river that be to say nearly the whole of the netherland belong to lorraine and germany in the state of thing it happen that in the year 864 judith daughter of charle the bald king of france have survive she husband ethelwolf king of england become attach to a powerful flemish chieftain call baldwin it be not quite certain whether he be count forester marquis or protector of the frontier but he certainly enjoy no matter under what title considerable authority in the country since the pope on one occasion write to charle the bald to beware of offend he lest he should join the norman and open to they a entrance into france he carry off judith to he possession in flander the king she father after many ineffectual threat be force to consent to they union and confirm to baldwin with the title of count the hereditary government of all the country between the scheldt and the somme a river of picardy this be the commencement of the celebrated county of flander and this baldwin be designate in history by the surname of bras-de-fer -lrb- iron-handed -rrb- to which he courage have justly entitle he the belgian historian be also desirous of place about this epoch the first count of hainault and even of holland but though it may be true that the chief family of each canton seek then as at all time to shake off the yoke the epoch of they independence can only be fix at the later period at which they obtain or enforce the privilege of not be deprive of they title and they feudal estate the count of the high grounds and those of friesland enjoy at the utmost but a fortuitous privilege of continuance in they rank several foreigner have gain a footing and a authority in the country among other wickmand from whom descend the chatelain of ghent and the count of holland and heriold a norman prince who have be banish from he own country this name of norman hardly know before the time of charlemagne soon become too celebrated it designate the pagan inhabitant of denmark norway and sweden who drive by rapacity and want infested the neighbor sea the asylum allow in the dominion of the emperor to some of those exile outlaw and the imprudent provocation give by these latter to they adventurous countryman attract various band of norman pirate to the shore of guelder and from desultory descent upon the coast they soon come to inundate the interior of the country flander alone successfully resist they during the life of baldwin bras-de-fer but after the death of this brave chieftain there be not a province of the whole country that be not ravage by these invader they multiply expedition throw back the netherland at least two century if indeed any calculation of the kind may be fairly form respect the relative state of population and improvement on the imperfect datum that be leave we several canton become desert the chief city be reduce to heap of ruin the german emperor vainly interpose for the relief of they unfortunate vassal finally a agreement be enter into in the year 882 with godfrey the king or leader of the norman by which a peace be purchase on condition of pay he a large subsidy and cede to he the government of friesland but in about two year from this period the fierce barbarian begin to complain that the country he have thus gain do not produce grape and the present inspiration of he rapacity seem to be the bloom vineyard of france the emperor charle the fat anticipate the consequence of a rupture with godfrey entice he to a interview in which he cause he to be assassinate he follower attack on all point by the people of friesland perish almost to a man and they destruction be complete in 891 by arnoul the germanic from that period the scourge of norman depredation become gradually less feel they now make but short and desultory attempt on the coast and they last expedition appear to have take place about the year 1000 when they threaten but do not succeed in seize on the city of utrecht it be remarkable that although for the space of one hundred and fifty year the netherland be continually the scene of invasion and devastation by these northern barbarian the political state of the country undergo no important change the emperor of germany be sovereign of the whole country with the exception of flander these portion of the empire be still call lorraine as well as all which they possess of what be now call france and which be that part form the appanage of lothaire and of the lotheringian king the great difficulty of maintain subordination among the numerous chieftain of this country cause it in 958 to be divide into two government which be call higher and lower lorraine the latter portion comprise nearly the whole of the netherland which thus become govern by a lieutenant of the emperor godfrey count of ardenne be the first who fill this place and he soon feel all the peril of the situation the other count see with a jealous eye they equal now promote into a superior two of the most powerful lambert and reginald be brother they make common cause against the new duke and after a desperate struggle which do not cease till the year 985 they gain a species of imperfect independence -- lambert become the root from which spring the count of louvain and reginald that of the count of hainault the emperor othon ii who uphold the authority of he lieutenant godfrey become convinced that the imperial power be too weak to resist singly the opposition of the noble of the country he have therefore transfer about the year 980 the title of duke to a young prince of the royal house of france and we thus see the duchy of lower lorraine govern in the name of the emperor by the last two shoot of the branch of charlemagne the duke charle and othon of france son and grandson of loui d'outremer the first be a gallant prince : he may be look on as the founder of the greatness of brussels where he fix he residence after several year of tranquil government the death of he brother call he to the throne of france and from that time he bravely contend for the crown of he ancestor against the usurpation of hugue capet whom he frequently defeat in battle but he be at length treacherously surprise and put to death in 990 othon he son do not signalize he name nor justify he descent by any memorable action and in he ingloriously perish the name of the carlovingian the death of othon set the emperor and the great vassal once more in opposition the german monarch insist on name some creature of he own to the dignity of duke but lambert ii count of louvain and robert count of namur have marry the sister of othon respectively claim the right of inheritance to he title baldwin of the comely beard count of flander join himself to they league hope to extend he power to the eastward of the scheldt and in fact the emperor as the only means of disunit he two powerful vassal feel himself oblige to cede valencienne and the island of zealand to baldwin the imperial power thus lose ground at every struggle amid the confusion of these event a power well calculate to rival or even supplant that of the fierce count be grow up many circumstance be combine to extend and consolidate the episcopal sway it be true that the bishop of tournay have no temporal authority since the period of they city be ruin by the norman but those of liege and utrecht and more particularly the latter have accumulate immense possession and they power be inalienable they have nothing to fear from the caprice of sovereign favor which so often ruin the family of the aristocracy those bishop who be warrior and huntsman rather than ecclesiastic possess however in addition to the lance and the sword the terrible artillery of excommunication and anathema which they thunder forth without mercy against every laic opponent and when they have by conquest or treachery acquire new dominion and additional store of wealth they could not portion it among they child like the noble but it devolve to they successor who thus become more and more powerful and gain by degree a authority almost royal like that of the ecclesiastical elector of germany whenever the emperor war against he lay vassal he be sure of assistance from the bishop because they be at all time jealous of the power of the count and have much less to gain from a alliance with they than with the imperial despot on whose donation they thrive and who repay they effort by new privilege and extend possession so that when the monarch at length lose the superiority in he contest with the count little be want to make he authority be merge altogether in the overgrown power of these churchman nevertheless a first effort of the bishop of liege to seize on the rights of the count of louvain in 1013 meet with a signal defeat in a battle which take place at the little village of stongarde and five year later the count of the friesland marsh -lrb- _ comes_frisonum _ _ morsatenorum _ -rrb- give a still more severe lesson to the bishop of utrecht this last merit a more particular mention from the nature of the quarrel and the importance of its result chapter iv from the formation of holland to the death of loui de male ad 1018 -- 1384 the district in which dordrecht be situate and the grounds in its environs which be at present submerge form in those time a island just raise above the water and which be call holland or holtland -lrb- which mean _ wooded _ land or accord to some _ hollow _ land -rrb- the formation of this island or rather its recovery from the water be only of recent date the right to its possession be more disputable than that of long-established country all the bishop and abbot whose state border the rhine and the meuse have be equally covetous and grasp and mutually resolve to pounce on the prey make it they common property a certain count thierry descend from the count of ghent govern about this period the western extremity of friesland -- the country which now form the province of holland and with much difficulty maintain he power against the frison by whom he right be not acknowledged beat out of he own territory by these refractory insurgent he seek refuge in the ecclesiastical island where he intrench himself and found a town which be believe to have be the origin of dordrecht this count thierry like all the feudal lord take advantage of he position to establish and levy certain duty on all the vessel which sail past he territory dispossess in the meantime some vassal of the church and beating as we have state the bishop of utrecht himself complaint and appeal without number be lay at the foot of the imperial throne godfrey of eenham whom the emperor have create duke of lower lorraine be command to call the whole country to arm the bishop of liege though actually die put himself at the head of the expedition to revenge he brother prelate and punish the audacious spoiler of the church property but thierry and he fierce frison take godfrey prisoner and cut he army in piece the victor have the good sense and moderation to spare he prisoner and set they free without ransom he receive in return a imperial amnesty and from that period the count of holland and he posterity form a barrier against which the ecclesiastical power and the remains of the imperial supremacy continually struggle to be only shatter in each new assault john egmont a old chronicler say that the count of holland be a sword in the flank of the bishop of utrecht as the partial independence of the great vassal become consolidated the monarch be proportionally anxious to prevent its perpetuation in the same family in pursuance of this system godfrey of eenham obtain the preference over the count lambert and robert and frederick of luxemburg be name duke of lower lorraine in 1046 instead of a second godfrey who be nephew and expectant heir to the first but this godfrey uphold by baldwin of flander force the emperor to concede to he the inheritance of the dukedom baldwin secure for he share the country of alost and waa and the citadel of ghent and he also succeed in obtain in marriage for he son the countess richilde heiress of hainault and namur thus be flander incessantly gain new aggrandizement while the duchy of lorraine be crumble away on every side in the year 1066 this state of flander even then flourish and powerful furnished assistance both in man and ship to william the bastard of normandy for the conquest of england william be son-in-law to count baldwin and recompense the assistance of he wife 's father by a annual payment of three hundred silver mark it be mathilda the flemish princess and wife of the conqueror who work with she own hand the celebrated tapestry of bayeux on which be embroider the whole history of the conquest and which be the most curious monument of the state of the art in that age flander acquire a positive and considerable superiority over all the other part of the netherland from the first establishment of its count or earl the descendant of baldwin bras-de-fer after have valiantly repulse the norman toward the end of the ninth century show themselves worthy of rule over a industrious and energetic people they have build town cut down and clear away forest and reclaim inundate land : above all thing they have understand and guard against the danger of parcel out they state at every succeed generation and the county of flander pass entire into the hand of the first-born of the family the stability produce by this state of thing have allow the people to prosper the norman now visit the coast not as enemy but as merchant and bruge become the mart of the booty acquire by these bold pirate in england and on the high sea the fishery have begin to acquire a importance sufficient to establish the herr as one of the chief aliment of the population maritime commerce have make such stride that spain and portugal be well know to both sailor and trader and the voyage from flander to lisbon be estimate at fifteen day ' sail woollen stuff form the principal wealth of the country but salt corn and jewelry be also important branch of traffic while the youth of flander be so famous for they excellence in all martial pursuit that foreign sovereign be at all time desirous of obtain body of troops from this nation the greatest part of flander be attach as have be see to the king of france and not to lorraine but the dependence be little more than nominal in 1071 the king of france attempt to exercise he authority over the country by name to the government the same countess richilde who have receive hainault and namur for she dower and who be leave a widow with son still in they minority the people assemble in the principal town and protest against this intervention of the french monarch but we must remark that it be only the population of the low land -lrb- whose sturdy ancestor have ever resist foreign domination -rrb- that now take part in this opposition the vassal which the count of flander possess in the gallic province -lrb- the high grounds -rrb- and in general all the nobility pronounce strongly for submission to france for the principle of political freedom have not yet be fix in the mind of the inhabitant of those part of the country but the lowlander join together under robert surname the frison brother of the deceased count and they so completely defeat the french the noble and they unworthy associate of the high ground that they despoil the usurp countess richilde of even she hereditary possession in this war perish the celebrated norman william fitz-osborn who have fly to the succor of the defeat countess of whom he be enamored robert the frison not satisfy with have beat the king of france and the bishop of liege reinstate in 1076 the grandson of thierry of holland in the possession which have be force from he by the duke of lower lorraine in the name of the emperor and the bishop of utrecht so that it be this valiant chieftain who above all other be entitle to the praise of have successfully oppose the system of foreign domination on all the principal point of the country four year later othon of nassau be the first to unite in one county the various canton of guelder finally in 1086 henry of louvain the direct descendant of lambert join to he title that of count of brabant and from this period the country be partition pretty nearly as it be destine to remain for several century in the midst of this gradual organization of the various county history for some time lose sight of those frison the maritime people of the north who take little part in the civil war of two century but still there be no portion of europe which at that time offer a finer picture of social improvement than these damp and unhealthy coast the name of frison extend from the weser to the westward of the zuyder zee but not quite to the rhine and it become usual to consider no longer as frison the subject of the count of holland whom we may now begin to distinguish as hollander or dutch the frison race alone refuse to recognize the sovereign count they boast of be self-governed owning no allegiance but to the emperor and regard the count of he nomination as so many officer charge to require obedience to the law of the country but themselves oblige in all thing to respect they but the count of holland the bishop of utrecht and several german lord dignified from time to time with the title of count of friesland insist that it carry with it a personal authority superior to that of the sovereign they represent the descendant of the count thierry a race of man remarkably warlike be the most violent in this assumption of power defeat after defeat however punish they obstinacy and number of those prince meet death on the pike of they frison opponent the latter have no regular leader but at the approach of the enemy the inhabitant of each canton fly to arm like the member of a single family and all the feudal force bring against they fail to subdue this popular militia the frequent result of these collision be the refusal of the frison to recognize any authority whatever but that of the national judge each canton be govern accord to its own law if a difficulty arise the deputy of the nation meet together on the border of the em in a place call the tree of upstal -lrb- _ upstall-booman _ -rrb- where three old oak stand in the middle of a immense plain in this primitive council-place chieftain be choose who on swearing to maintain the law and oppose the common enemy be invest with a limited and temporary authority it do not appear that friesland possess any large town with the exception of staveren in this respect the frison resemble those ancient german who have a horror of shut themselves up within wall they live in a way completely patriarchal dwelling in isolate cabin and with habit of the utmost frugality we read in one of they old history that a whole convent of benedictine be terrify at the voracity of a german sculptor who be repair they chapel they implore he to look elsewhere for he food for that he and he son consume enough to exhaust the whole stock of the monastery in no part of europe be the good sense of the people so effectively oppose to the unreasonable practice of catholicism in those day the frison successfully resist the payment of tithe and as a punishment -lrb- if the monk be to be believe -rrb- the sea inflict upon they repeat inundation they force they priest to marry say that the man who have no wife necessarily seek for the wife of another they acknowledge no ecclesiastical decree if secular judge double the number of the priest do not bear a part in it thus the spirit of liberty burst forth in all they proceedings and they be justify in call themselves _ vri-vriesen _ free-frison no nation be more interested than england in the examination of all that concern this remote corner of europe so resolute in its opposition to both civil and religious tyranny for it be there that those saxon institution and principle be first develop without constraint while the time of they establishment in england be still distant restrain by we narrow limit we can merely indicate this curious state of thing nor may we enter on many mystery of social government which the most learn find a difficulty in solve what be the rights of the noble in they connection with these freeman what tie of reciprocal interest bind the different canton to each other what be the privilege of the town -- these be the minute but important point of detail which be overshadow by the grand and impose figure of the national independence but in fact the emperor themselves in these distant time have little knowledge of this province and speak of it vaguely and as it be at random in they diploma the chief monument of the history of the middle age the count of holland and the apostolic nuncio address they act and rescript indiscriminately to the noble clergy magistrate judge consul or common of friesland sometimes appear in those document the vague and impose title of the great frison apply to some popular leader all this confusion tend to prove on the authority of the historian of the epoch and the charter so carefully collect by the learn that this question now so impossible to solve be even then not rightly understand -- what be really those fierce and redoubtable frison in they popular and political relation the fact be that liberty be a matter so difficult to be comprehend by the writer of those time that froissart give as he opinion about the year 1380 that the frison be a most unreasonable race for not recognize the authority and power of the great lord the eleventh century have be for the netherland -lrb- with the exception of friesland and flander -rrb- a epoch of organization and have nearly fix the political existence of the province which be so long confound in the vast possession of the empire it be therefore important to ascertain under what influence and on what basis these province become consolidated at that period holland and zealand animated by the spirit which we may fairly distinguish under the mingled title of saxon and maritime country scarcely accessible and with a vigorous population possess in the descendant of thierry i a race of national chieftain who do not attempt despotic rule over so unconquerable a people in brabant the maritime town of berg-op-zoom and antwerp form in the flemish style so many republic small but not insignificant while the southern part of the province be under the sway of a nobility who crush trample on or sell they vassal at they pleasure or caprice the bishopric of liege offer also the same contrast the domain of the nobility be govern with the utmost harshness while those prince-prelate lavish on they plebeian vassal privilege which might have be suppose the fruit of generosity be it not clear that the object be to create a opposition in the lower order against the turbulent aristocracy whom they find it impossible to manage single-handed the war of these bishop against the petty noble who make they castle so many receptacle of robber and plunder be thus the foundation of public liberty and it appear tolerably certain that the paladin of ariosto be in reality nothing more than those brigand chieftain of the ardenne whose ruin residence preserve to this day the name which the poet borrow from the old romance writer but in all the rest of the netherland except the province already mention no form of government exist but that fierce feudality which reduce the people into serf and turn the social state of man into a cheerless waste of bondage it be then that the crusade with wild and stir fanaticism agitate in the common impulse give to all europe even those little state which seem to slumber in they isolate independence nowhere do the voice of peter the hermit find a more sympathizing echo than in these land still desolate by so many intestine struggle godfrey of bouillon duke of lower lorraine take the lead in this chivalric and religious frenzy with he set out the count of hainault and flander the latter of whom receive from the english crusader the honorable appellation of fitz st george but although the valor of all these prince be conspicuous from the foundation of the kingdom of jerusalem by godfrey of bouillon in 1098 until that of the latin empire of constantinople by baldwin of flander in 1203 still the simple gentleman and peasant of friesland do not less distinguish themselves they be on all occasion the first to mount the breach or lead the charge and the pope 's nuncio find himself force to prohibit the very woman of friesland from embark for the holy land -- so anxious be they to share the peril and glory of they husband and brother in combate the saracen the outlet give by the crusader to the overboiling ardor of these warlike country be a source of infinite advantage to they internal economy under the rapid progress of civilization the population increase and the field be cultivate the nobility reduce to moderation by the enfeeble consequence of extensive foreign war become comparatively impotent in they attempt effort against domestic freedom those of flander and brabant also be almost decimate in the terrible battle of bouvine fight between the emperor othon and philip augustus king of france on no occasion however have this reduce but not degenerate nobility show more heroic valor the flemish knight disdain to mount they horse or form they rank for the repulse of the french cavalry compose of common person contemptuously receive they shock on foot and in the disorder of individual resistance the brave buridan of ypre lead he comrade to the fight with the chivalric war-cry let each now think of she he love but the issue of this battle be ruinous to the belgian in consequence of the bad generalship of the emperor who have divide he army into small portion which be defeat in detail while the nobility thus decline the town begin rapidly to develop the element of popular force in 1120 a flemish knight who might descend so far as to marry a woman of the plebeian rank incur the penalty of degradation and servitude in 1220 scarcely a serf be to be find in all flander the countess jane have enfranchise all those belong to she as early as 1222 in 1300 the chief of the gilden or trade be more powerful than the noble these date and these fact must suffice to mark the epoch at which the great mass of the nation arise from the wretchedness in which it be plunge by the norman invasion and acquire sufficient strength and freedom to form a real political force but it be remarkable that the same result take place in all the county or dukedom of the lowland precisely at the same period in fact if we start from the year 1200 on this interesting inquiry we shall see the common attack in the first place the petty feudal lord and next the count and the duke themselves often as justice be deny they in 1257 the peasant of holland and the burgher of utrecht proclaim freedom and equality drive out the bishop and the noble and begin a memorable struggle which last full two hundred year in 1260 the townspeople of flander appeal to the king of france against the decree of they count who end the quarrel by the loss of he county in 1303 mechlin and louvain the chief town of brabant expel the patrician family a coincidence like this can not be attribute to trifling or partial cause such as the misconduct of a single count or other local evil but to a great general movement in the popular mind the progress of agriculture and industry in the whole country superinduce a increase of wealth and intelligence which when unrestrained by the influence of a corrupt government must naturally lead to the liberty and the happiness of a people the weave of woollen and linen cloth be one of the chief source of this grow prosperity a prodigious quantity of cloth and linen be manufacture in all part of the netherland the maritime prosperity acquire a equal increase by the carry trade both in import and export whole fleet of dutch and flemish merchant ship repair regularly to the coast of spain and languedoc flander be already become the great market for england and all the north of europe the great increase of population force all part of the country into cultivation so much so that land be in those time sell at a high price which be to-day left waste from imputed sterility legislation naturally follow the movement of those positive and material interest the earliest of the town after the invasion of the norman be in some degree but place of refuge it be soon however establish that the regular inhabitant of these bulwark of the country should not be subject to any servitude beyond they care and defense but the citizen who might absent himself for a longer period than forty day be consider a deserter and deprive of he rights it be about the year 1100 that the common begin to possess the privilege of regulate they internal affair they appoint they judge and magistrate and attach to they authority the old custom of order all the citizen to assemble or march when the summons of the feudal lord sound the signal for they assemblage or service by this mean each municipal magistracy have the disposal of a force far superior to those of the noble for the population of the town exceed both in number and discipline the vassal of the seigniorial land and these train band of the town make war in a way very different from that hitherto practice for the chivalry of the country make the trade of arm a profession for life the feud of the chieftain produce hereditary struggle almost always slow and mutually disastrous but the townsman force to tear themselves from every association of home and its manifold endearment advance boldly to the object of the contest never shrink from the danger of war from fear of that still greater to be find in a prolonged struggle it be this that it may be remark during the memorable conflict of the thirteenth century that when even the bravest of the knight advise they count or duke to grant or demand a truce the citizen militia never know but one cry -- to the charge evidence be soon give of the importance of this new nation when it become force to take up arm against enemy still more redoubtable than the count in 1301 the fleming who have abandon they own sovereign to attach themselves to philip the fair king of france begin to repent of they newly-formed allegiance and to be weary of the master they have choose two citizen of bruge peter de kon a draper and john breydel a butcher put themselves at the head of they fellow-townsmen and completely dislodge the french troops who garrison it the following year the militia of bruge and the immediate neighborhood sustain alone at the battle of courtraus the shock of one of the finest army that france ever send into the field victory soon declare for the gallant man of bruge upward of three thousand of the french chivalry besides common soldier be leave dead on the field in 1304 after a long contest battle the fleming force the king of france to release they count whom he have hold prisoner i believe it rain fleming say philip astonished to see they crowd on he from all side of the field but this multitude of warrior always ready to meet the foe be provide for the most part by the town in the seigniorial system a village hardly furnish more than four or five man and these only on important occasion but in that of the town every citizen be enrol as a soldier to defend the country at all time the same system establish in brabant force the duke of that province to sanction and guarantee the popular privilege and the superiority of the people over the nobility such be the result of the famous contract conclude in 1312 at cortenbergh by which the duke create a legislative and judicial assembly to meet every twenty-one day for the provincial business and to consist of fourteen deputy of whom only four be to be noble and ten be choose from the people the duke be bind by this act to hold himself in obedience to the legislative decision of the council and renounce all right of levy arbitrary tax or duty on the state thus be the local privilege of the people by degree secure and ratify but the various town make common cause for general liberty become strictly unite together and progressively extend they influence and power the confederation between flander and brabant be soon consolidate the burgher of bruge who have take the lead in the grand national union and have be the foremost to expel the foreign force take umbrage in 1323 at a arbitrary measure of they count loui -lrb- call of cressy by posthumous nomination from he have be kill at that celebrated fight -rrb- by which he cede to the count of namur he great-uncle the port of ecluse and authorize he to levy duty there in the style of the feudal lord of the high country it be but the affair of a day to the intrepid citizen to attack the fortress of ecluse carry it by assault and take prisoner the old count of namur they destroy in a short time almost all the strong castle of the noble throughout the province and have be join by all the town of western flander they finally make prisoner of count loui himself with almost the whole of the nobility who have take refuge with he in the town of courtraus but ghent actuate by the jealousy which at all time exist between it and bruge stand aloof at this crisis the latter town be oblige to come to a compromise with the count who soon afterward on a new quarrel break out and support by the king of france almost annihilate he sturdy opponent at the battle of cassel where the flemish infantry command by nichola zannekin and other be literally cut to piece by the french knight and man-at-arms this check prove the absolute necessity of union among the rival city ten year after the battle of cassel ghent set the example of general opposition this example be promptly follow and the chief town fly to arm the celebrated jame d'artaveldt commonly call the brewer of ghent put himself at the head of this formidable insurrection he be a man of a distinguished family who have himself enrol among the guild of brewer to entitle he to occupy a place in the corporation of ghent which he soon succeed in managing and lead at he pleasure the tyranny of the count and the french party which support he become so intolerable to artaveldt that he resolve to assail they at all hazard unappalled by the fate of he father-in-law sohier de courtrai who lose he head for a similar attempt and notwithstanding the hitherto devoted fidelity of he native city to the count one only object seem insurmountable the fleming have swear allegiance to the crown of france and they revolt at the idea of perjury even from a extort oath but to overcome they scruple artaveldt propose to acknowledge the claim of edward iii of england to the french crown the fleming readily accede to this arrangement quickly overwhelm count loui of cressy and he french partisan and then join with a army of sixty thousand man the english monarch who have land at antwerp these numerous auxiliary render edward 's army irresistible and soon afterward the french and english fleet both of formidable power but the latter of inferior force meet near sluy and engage in a battle mean to be decisive of the war : victory remain doubtful during a entire day of fight until a flemish squadron hasten to the aid of the english fix the fate of the combat by the utter defeat of the enemy a truce between the two king do not deprive artaveldt of he well-earned authority he be invest with the title of ruward or conservator of the peace of flander and govern the whole province with almost sovereign sway it be say that king edward use familiarly to call he he dear gossip and it be certain that there be not a feudal lord of the time whose power be not eclipse by this leader of the people one of the principal motive which cement the attachment of the fleming to artaveldt be the advantage obtain through he influence with edward for facilitate the trade with england whence they procure the chief supply of wool for they manufactory edward promise they seventy thousand sack as the reward of they alliance but though greatly influence by the stimulus of general interest the fleming love they domestic liberty better than english wool and when they find that they ruward degenerate from a firm patriot into the partisan of a foreign prince they become disgusted with he altogether and he perish in 1345 in a tumult raise against he by those by whom he have be so lately idolize the fleming hold firm nevertheless in they alliance with england only regulate the connection by a steady principle of national independence edward know well how to conciliate and manage these faithful and important auxiliary during all he continental war a flemish army cover the siege of calai in 1348 and under the command of gile de rypergherste a mere weaver of ghent they beat the dauphin of france in a pitched battle but calai once take and a truce conclude the english king abandon he ally these leave wholly to they own resource force the french and the heir of they count young loui de male to recognize they right to self-government accord to they ancient privilege and of not be force to give aid to france in any war against england flander may therefore be pronounce as form at this epoch both in right and fact a truly independent principality but such struggle as these leave a deep and immovable sentiment of hatred in the mind of the vanquish loui de male long for the re-establishment and extension of he authority and have the art to gain over to he view not only all the noble but many of the most influential guild or trade ghent which long resist he attempt be at length reduce by famine and the count project the ruin or at least the total subjection of this turbulent town a son of artaveldt start forth at this juncture when the popular cause seem lose and join with he fellow-citizen john lyon and peter du bois he lead seven thousand resolute burgher against forty thousand feudal vassal he completely defeat the count and take the town of bruge where loui de male only obtain safety by hide himself under the bed of a old woman who give he shelter thus once more feudality be defeat in a fresh struggle with civic freedom the consequence of this event be immense they reach to the very heart of france where the people bear in great discontent the feudal yoke and froissart declare that the success of the people of gheut have nearly overthrow the superiority of the nobility over the people in france but the king charle vi excite by he uncle philip the bold duke of burgundy take arm in support of the defeat count and march with a powerful army against the rebellious burgher though defeat in four successive combat in the latter of which that of roosbeke artaveldt be kill the fleming would not submit to they imperious count who use every persuasion with charle to continue he assistance for the punishment of these refractory subject but the duke of burgundy be aware that a too great perseverance would end either in drive the people to despair and the possible defeat of the french or the entire conquest of the country and its junction to the crown of france he be son-in-law to loui de male and consequently aspire to the inheritance of flander see with a keen glance the advantage of a present compromise on the death of loui who be state to have be murder by philip 's brother the duke of berrus be conclude a peace with the rebel burgher and enter at once upon the sovereignty of the country chapter v from the succession of philip the bold to the county of flander to the death of philip the fair ad 1384 -- 1506 thus the house of burgundy which soon after become so formidable and celebrated obtain this vast accession to its power the various change which have take place in the neighboring province during the continuance of these civil war have alter the state of flander altogether john d'avesne count of hainault have also succeed in 1299 to the county of holland the two province though separate by flander and brabant remain from that time under the government of the same chief who soon become more powerful than the bishop of utrecht or even than they formidable rival the frison during the war which desolate these opposing territory in consequence of the perpetual conflict for superiority the power of the various town insensibly become at least as great as that of the noble to whom they be constantly oppose the commercial interest of holland also be considerably advance by the influx of flemish merchant force to seek refuge there from the convulsion which agitate they province every day confirm and increase the privilege of the people of brabant while at liege the inhabitant gradually begin to gain the upper hand and to shake off the former subjection to they sovereign bishop although philip of burgundy become count of flander by the death of he father-in-law in the year 1384 it be not till the following year that he conclude a peace with the people of ghent and enter into quiet possession of the province in the same year the duchess of brabant the last descendant of the duke of that province die leave no nearer relative than the duchess of burgundy so that philip obtain in right of he wife this new and important accession to he dominion but the consequent increase of the sovereign 's power be not as be often the case injurious to the liberty or happiness of the people philip continue to govern in the interest of the country which he have the good sense to consider as identify with he own he augment the privilege of the town and negotiate for the return into flander of those merchant who have emigrate to germany and holland during the continuance of the civil war he thus by degree accustom he new subject so proud of they rights to submit to he authority and he peaceable reign be only disturb by the fatal issue of the expedition of he son john the fearless count of never against the turk this young prince fill with ambition and temerity be offer the command of the force send by charle iii of france to the assistance of sigismund of hungary in he war against bajazet follow by a numerous body of noble he enter on the contest and be defeat and take prisoner by the turk at the battle of nicopolis he army be totally destroy and himself only restore to liberty on the payment of a immense ransom john the fearless succeed in 1404 to the inheritance of all he father 's dominion with the exception of brabant of which he younger brother anthony of burgundy become duke john whose ambitious and ferocious character become every day more strongly develop now aspire to the government of france during the insanity of he cousin charle vi he occupy himself little with the affair of the netherland from which he only desire to draw supplies of man but the fleming take no interest in he personal view or private project and equally indifferent to the rivalry of england and france which now begin so fearfully to affect the latter kingdom force they ambitious count to declare they province a neutral country so that the english merchant be admit as usual to trade in all the port of flander and the fleming equally well receive in england while the duke make open war against great britain in he quality of a prince of france and sovereign of burgundy this be probably the earliest well-established instance of such a distinction between the prince and the people anthony duke of brabant the brother of philip be not so closely restricted in he authority and wish he lead all the noble of the province to take part in the quarrel of france and he suffer the penalty of he rashness in meet he death in the battle of agincourt but the duchy suffer nothing by this event for the militia of the country have not follow they duke and he noble to the war and a national council be now establish consist of eleven person two of whom be ecclesiastic three baron two knight and four commoner this council form on principle so fairly popular conduct the public affair with great wisdom during the minority of the young duke each province seem thus to have govern itself upon principle of republican independence the sovereign could not at discretion or by the want of it play the bloody game of war for they mere amusement and the emperor put in he claim at this epoch to he ancient rights of sovereignty over brabant as a imperial fief the council and the people treat the demand with derision the spirit of constitutional liberty and legal equality which now animated the various province be strongly mark in the history of the time by two striking and characteristic incident at the death of philip the bold he widow deposit on he tomb she purse and the key which she carry at she girdle in token of marriage and by this humiliating ceremony she renounce she rights to a succession overload with she husband 's debt in the same year -lrb- 1404 -rrb- the widow of albert count of holland and hainault finding herself in similar circumstance require of the bailiff of holland and the judge of he court permission to make a like renunciation the claim be grant and to fulfil the requisite ceremony she walk at the head of the funeral procession carry in she hand a blade of straw which she place on the coffin we thus find that in such case the reign family be hold liable to follow the common usage of the country from such instance there require but little progress in the principle of equality to reach the republican contempt for rank which make the citizen of bruge in the following century arrest they count for he private debt the spirit of independence have reach the same point at liege the family of the count of holland and hainault which be at this time distinguish by the name of bavarium because they be only descend from the ancient count of netherland extraction in the female line have sufficient influence to obtain the nomination to the bishopric for a prince who be at the period in he infancy john of bavarium -- for so he be call and to he name be afterward add the epithet of the pitiless -- on reach he majority do not think it necessary to cause himself to be consecrate a priest but govern as a lay sovereign the indignant citizen of liege expel he and choose another bishop but the house of burgundy and bavarium closely ally by intermarriage make common cause in he quarrel and john duke of burgundy and william iv count of holland and hainault brother of the bishop replace by force this cruel and unworthy prelate this union of the government over all the province in two family so closely connected render the preponderance of the ruler too strong for that balance hitherto keep steady by the popular force the former could on each new quarrel join together and employ against any particular town they whole unite resource whereas the latter could only act by isolate effort for the maintenance of they separate rights such be the cause of a considerable decline in public liberty during the fifteenth century it be true that john the fearless give almost he whole attention to he french political intrigue and to the fierce quarrel which he maintain with the house of orlean but he nephew john duke of brabant have marry in 1416 he cousin jacqueline daughter and heiress of william iv count of holland and hainault this branch of the house of burgundy seem to get the start of the elder in its progressive influence over the province of the netherland the duke of guelder who have change they title of count for one of superior rank acquire no accession of power proportion to they new dignity the bishop of utrecht become by degree weaker private dissension enfeebled friesland luxemburg be a poor unimportant dukedom but holland hainault and brabant form the very heart of the netherland while the elder branch of the same family under whom they be unite possess flander artoi and the two burgundy to complete the prosperity and power of this latter branch it be soon destine to inherit the entire dominion of the other a fact the consequence of which be so important for the entire of europe merit considerable attention but it be most difficult to explain at once concisely and clearly the series of accident maneuver trick and crime by which it be accomplish it must first be remark that this john of brabant become the husband of he cousin jacqueline countess of holland and hainault possess neither the moral nor physical quality suit to mate with the most lovely intrepid and talented woman of she time nor the vigor and firmness require for the maintenance of a increase and for those day a considerable dominion jacqueline thoroughly despise she insignificant husband first in secret and subsequently by those open avowal force from she by he revolting combination of weakness cowardice and tyranny he tamely allow the province of holland to be invade by the same ungrateful bishop of liege john the pitiless whom he wife 's father and he own uncle have re-establish in he justly forfeit authority but john of brabant revenge himself for he wife 's contempt by a series of domestic persecution so odious that the state of brabant interfere for she protection find it however impossible to remain in a perpetual contest with a husband whom she hate and despise she flee from brussels where he hold he ducal court and take refuge in england under the protection of henry v at that time in the plenitude of he fame and power england at this epoch enjoy the proudest station in european affair john the fearless after have cause the murder of he rival the duke of orlean be himself assassinate on the bridge of montereau by the follower of the dauphin of france and in he presence philip duke of burgundy the son and successor of john have form a close alliance with henry v to revenge he father 's murder and soon after the death of the king he marry he sister and thus unite himself still more nearly to the celebrated john duke of bedford brother of henry and regent of france in the name of he infant nephew henry vi but besides the share on which he reckon in the spoil of france philip also look with a covetous eye on the inheritance of jacqueline he cousin as soon as he have learn that this princess so well receive in england be take measure for have she marriage annul to enable she to espouse the duke of gloucester also the brother of henry v and subsequently know by the appellation of the good duke humphrey he be torment by a double anxiety he in the first place dread that jacqueline might have child by she project marriage with gloucester -lrb- a circumstance neither likely nor even possible in the opinion of some historian to result from she union with john of brabant : hume vol iii p 133 -rrb- and thus deprive he of he right of succession to she state and in the next he be jealous of the possible domination of england in the netherland as well as in france he therefore soon become self-absolved from all he vow of revenge in the cause of he murder father and labor solely for the object of he personal aggrandizement to break he connection with bedford to treat secretly with the dauphin he father 's assassin or at least the witness and warrant for he assassination and to shuffle from party to party as occasion require be movement of no difficulty to philip surnamed the good he openly espouse the cause of he infamous relative john of brabant send a powerful army into hainault which gloucester vainly strive to defend in right of he affianced wife and next seize on holland and zealand where he meet with a long but ineffectual resistance on the part of the courageous woman he so mercilessly oppress jacqueline deprive of the assistance of she stanch but ruin friend -lrb- 1 -rrb- and abandon by gloucester -lrb- who on the refusal of pope martin v to sanction she divorce have marry another woman and but feebly aid the effort of the former to maintain she rights -rrb- be now leave a widow by the death of john of brabant but philip without a shadow of justice pursue he design against she dominion and finally despoil she of she last possession and even of the title of countess which she forfeit by she marriage with vrank van borselen a gentleman of zealand contrary to a compact to which philip 's tyranny have force she to consent after a career the most checkered and romantic which be record in history the beautiful and hitherto unfortunate jacqueline find repose and happiness in the tranquillity of private life and she death in 1436 at the age of thirty-six remove all restraint from philip 's thirst for aggrandizement in the indulgence of which he drown he remorse as if fortune have conspire for the rapid consolidation of he greatness the death of philip count of st pol who have succeed he brother john in the dukedom of brabant give he the sovereignty of that extensive province and he dominion soon extend to the very limit of picardy by the peace of arras conclude with the dauphin now become charle vii and by he finally contract a strict alliance with france -lrb- footnote 1 : we must not omit to notice the existence of two faction which for near two century divide and agitate the whole population of holland and zealand one bear the title of _ hoek _ -lrb- fishing-hook -rrb- the other be call _ kaabel-jauws _ -lrb- cod-fish -rrb- the origin of these burlesque denomination be a dispute between two party at a feast as to whether the cod-fish take the hook or the hook the cod-fish this apparently frivolous dispute be make the pretext for a serious quarrel and the partisan of the noble and those of the town range themselves at either side and assume different badge of distinction the _ hoek _ partisan of the town wear red cap the _ kaabeljauw _ wear gray one in jacqueline 's quarrel with philip of burgundy she be support by the former and it be not till the year 1492 that the extinction of that popular and turbulent faction strike a final blow to the dissension of both -rrb- philip of burgundy thus become sovereign of dominion at once so extensive and compact have the precaution and address to obtain from the emperor a formal renunciation of he exist though almost nominal rights as lord paramount he next purchase the title of the duchess of luxemburg to that duchy and thus the state of the house of burgundy gain a extent about equal to that of the exist kingdom of the netherland for although on the north and east they do not include friesland the bishopric of utrecht guelder or the province of liege still on the south and west they comprise french flander the boulonnai artoi and a part of picardy besides burgundy but it have be already see how limited a authority be possess by the ruler of the maritime province flander in particular the most populous and wealthy strictly preserve its republican institution ghent and bruge be the two great town of the province and each maintain its individual authority over its respective territory with great indifference to the will or the wish of the sovereign duke philip however have the policy to divide most effectually these rival town after have fall into the hand of the people of bruge whom he make a vain attempt to surprise and who massacre number of he follower before he eye he force they to submission by the assistance of the citizen of ghent who sanction the banishment of the chief man of the vanquished town but some year later ghent be in its turn oppress and punish for have resist the payment of some new tax it find no support from the rest of flander nevertheless this powerful city singly maintain the war for the space of two year but the intrepid burgher finally yield to the veteran of the duke form to victory in the french war the principal privilege of ghent be on this occasion revoke and annul during these transaction the province of holland which enjoy a degree of liberty almost equal to flander have declare war against the hanseatic town on its own proper authority support by zealand which form a distinct country but be strictly unite to it by a common interest holland equip a fleet against the pirate which infested they coast and assail they commerce and soon force they to submission philip in the meantime contrived to manage the conflicting element of he power with great subtlety notwithstanding he ambitious and despotic character he conduct himself so cautiously that he people by common consent confirm he title of the good which be somewhat inappropriately give to he at the very epoch when he appear to deserve it least age and exhaustion may be adduce among the cause of the toleration which signalize he latter year and if he be the usurper of some part of he dominion he can not be pronounce a tyrant over any philip have a only son bear and rear in the midst of that ostentatious greatness which he look on as he own by divine right whereas he father remember that it have chiefly become he by fortuitous acquirement and much of it by mean not likely to look well in the sight of heaven this son be charle count of charoloi afterward celebrate under the name of charle the rash he give even in the lifetime of he father a striking specimen of despotism to the people of holland appoint stadtholder of that province in 1457 he appropriate to himself several important succession force the inhabitant to labor in the formation of dike for the security of the property thus acquire and in a word conduct himself as a absolute master soon afterward he break out into open opposition to he father who have complain of this undutiful and impetuous son to the state of the province vent he grief in lamentation instead of punish he people 's wrong but he private rage burst forth one day in a manner as furious as he public expression be tame he go so far as to draw he sword on charle and pursue he through he palace and a disgusting yet instructive spectacle it be to see this father and son in mutual and disgraceful discord like two bird of prey quarrel in the same eyry the old count outrageous to find he be no longer undisputed sovereign and the young one in feeling that he have not yet become so but philip be decline daily yet even when die he preserve he natural haughtiness and energy and be provoke by the insubordination of the people of liege he have himself carry to the scene of they punishment the refractory town of dinant on the meuse be utterly destroy by the two count and six hundred of the citizen drown in the river and in cold blood the following year philip expire leave to charle he long-wished-for inheritance the reign of philip have produce a revolution in belgian manners for he example and the great increase of wealth have introduce habit of luxury hitherto quite unknown he have also bring into fashion romantic notion of military honor love and chivalry which while they certainly soften the character of the nobility contain nevertheless a certain mixture of frivolity and extravagance the celebrated order of the golden fleece which be introduce by philip be less a institution base on grounds of rational magnificence than a puerile emblem of he passion for isabellum of portugal he third wife the verse of a contemporary poet induce he to make a vow for the conquest of constantinople from the turk he certainly never attempt to execute this senseless crusade but he do not omit so fair a opportunity for levy new tax on he people and it be undoubted that the splendor of he court and the immorality of he example be no slight source of corruption to the country which he govern in this respect at least a totally different kind of government be look for on the part of he son and successor who be by nature and habit a mere soldier charle begin he career by seize on all the money and jewel leave by he father he next dismiss the crowd of useless functionary who have feed upon under the pretence of manage the treasure of the state but this salutary and sweeping reform be only effect to enable the sovereign to pursue uncontrolled the most fatal of all passion that of war nothing can better paint the true character of this haughty and impetuous prince than he crest -lrb- a branch of holly -rrb- and he motto who touch it prick himself charle have conceive a furious and not ill-founded hatred for he base yet formidable neighbor and rival loui xi of france the latter have succeed in obtain from philip the restitution of some town in picardy cause sufficient to excite the resentment of he inflammable successor who during he father 's lifetime take open part with some of the vassal of france in a temporary struggle against the throne loui who have be worst in a combat where both he and charle bear a part be not behindhand in he hatred but inasmuch as one be haughty audacious and intemperate the other be cunning cool and treacherous charle be the proudest most daring and most unmanageable prince that ever make the sword the type and the guarantee of greatness loui the most subtle dissimulating and treacherous king that ever weave in he closet a tissue of hollow diplomacy and bad faith in government the struggle between these sovereign be unequal only in respect to this difference of character for france subdivide as it still be and exhaust by the war with england be not comparable either as regard man money or the other resource of the state to the compact and prosperous dominion of burgundy charle show some symptom of good sense and greatness of mind soon after he accession to power that give a false coloring to he disposition and encourage illusory hope as to he future career scarcely be he proclaim count of flander at ghent when the populace surround he hotel absolutely insist on and extort he consent to the restitution of they ancient privilege furious as charle be at this bold proof of insubordination he do not revenge it and he treat with equal indulgence the city of mechlin which have expel its governor and raze the citadel the people of liege have revolt against they bishop loui of bourbon who be closely connect with the house of burgundy be defeat by the duke in 1467 but he treat they with clemency and immediately after this event in February 1468 he conclude with edward iv of england a alliance offensive and defensive against france the real motive of this alliance be rivalry and hatred against loui the ostensible pretext be this monarch 's have make war against the duke of brittany charle 's old ally in the short contest in which he while yet but count have measure he strength with he rival after he become king the present union between england and burgundy be too powerful not to alarm loui he demand a explanatory conference with charle and the town of peronne in picardy be fix on for they meeting loui willing to imitate the boldness of he rival who have formerly come to meet he in the very midst of he army now come to the rendezvous almost alone but he be severely mortified and near pay a greater penalty than fright for this hazardous conduct the duke have receive intelligence of a new revolt at liege excite by some of the agent of france instantly make loui prisoner in defiance of every law of honor or fair deal the excess of he rage and hatred might have carry he to a more disgraceful extremity have not loui by force of bribery gain over some of he most influential counsellor who succeed in appease he rage he contented himself with humiliating when he be dispose to punish he force he captive to accompany he to liege and witness the ruin of this unfortunate town which he deliver over to plunder and have give this lesson to loui he set he at liberty from this period there be a marked and material change in the conduct of charle he have be previously move by sentiment of chivalry and notion of greatness but sully by he act of public treachery and violence toward the monarch who have at least in seem manifest unlimited confidence in he honor a secret sense of shame embittered he feeling and sour he temper he become so insupportable to those around he that he be abandon by several of he best officer and even by he natural brother baldwin of burgundy who pass over to the side of loui charle be at this time embarrass by the expense of entertaining and maintain edward iv and numerous english exile who be force to take refuge in the netherland by the success of the earl of warwick who have replace henry vi on the throne charle at the same time hold out to several prince in europe hope of bestow on they in marriage he only daughter and heiress mary while he privately assure he friend if he courtier and minister may be so call that he never mean to have a son-in-law until he be dispose to make himself a monk in a word he be no longer guide by any principle but that of fierce and brutal selfishness in this mood he soon become tired of the service of he noble and of the national militia who only maintain toward he a force and modify obedience found on the usage and rights of they several province and he take into he pay all sort of adventurer and vagabond who be willing to submit to he as they absolute master when the tax necessary for the support and pay of these band of mercenary cause the people to murmur charle laugh at they complaint and severely punish some of the most refractory he then enter france at the head of he army to assist the duke of brittany but at the moment when nothing seem to oppose the most extensive view of he ambition he lose by he hot-brained caprice every advantage within he easy reach : he choose to sit down before beauvai and thus make of this town which lay in he road a complete stumbling-block on he path of conquest the time he lose before its wall cause the defeat and ruin of he unsupported or as might be say he abandon ally who make the best term he could with loui and thus charle 's presumption and obstinacy paralyze all the effort of he courage and power but he soon afterward acquire the duchy of guelder from the old duke arnoul who have be temporarily despoil of it by he son adolphus it be almost a hereditary consequence in this family that the child should revolt and rebel against they parent adolphus have the effrontery to find he justification on the argument that he father have reign forty-four year he be fully entitle to he share -- a fine practical authority for greedy and expectant heir the old father reply to this reasoning by offer to meet he son in single combat charle cut short the affair by make adolphus prisoner and seize on the dispute territory for which he however pay arnoul the sum of two hundred and twenty thousand florin after this acquisition charle conceive and have much at heart the design of become king the first time that the netherland be consider sufficiently important and consolidated to entitle they possessor to that title to lead to this object he offer to the emperor of germany the hand of he daughter mary for he son maximilian the emperor accede to this proposition and repair to the city of treve to meet charle and countenance he coronation but the insolence and selfishness of the latter put a end to the project he humiliate the emperor who be of a niggardly and mean-spirited disposition by appear with a train so numerous and sumptuous as totally to eclipse the imperial retinue and deeply offend he by wish to postpone the marriage from he jealousy of create for himself a rival in a son-in-law who might embitter he old age as he have do that of he own father the mortified emperor quit the place in high dudgeon and the project kingdom be doom to a delay of some century charle urge on by the double motive of thirst for aggrandizement and vexation at he late failure attempt under pretext of some internal dissension to gain possession of cologne and its territory which belong to the empire and at the same time plan the invasion of france in concert with he brother-in-law edward iv who have recover possession of england but the town of nuy in the archbishopric of cologne occupy he a full year before its wall the emperor who come to its succor actually besiege the besieger in they camp and the dispute be terminate by leave it to the arbitration of the pope 's legate and place the contest town in he keep this half triumph gain by charle save loui wholly from destruction edward who have land in france with a numerous force see no appearance of he burgundian ally make peace with loui and charle who arrive in all haste but not till after the treaty be sign upbraid and abuse the english king and turn a warm friend into a inveterate enemy loui whose crooked policy have so far succeed on all occasion now seem to favor charle 's plan of aggrandizement and to recognize he pretended right to lorraine which legitimately belong to the empire and the invasion of which by charle would be sure to set he at variance with the whole of germany the infatuated duke blind to the ruin to which he be thus hurry abandon to loui in return for this insidious support the constable of st pol a nobleman who have long maintain he independence in picardy where he have large possession and who be fit to be a valuable friend or formidable enemy to either charle now march against and soon overcome lorraine thence he turn he army against the swiss who be ally to the conquer province but who send the most submissive dissuasion to the invader they beg for peace assure charle that they romantic but sterile mountain be not altogether worth the bridle of he splendidly equip cavalry but the more they humble themselves the higher be he haughtiness raise it appear that he have at this period conceive the project of unite in one common conquest the ancient dominion of lothaire i who have possess the whole of the country traverse by the rhine the rhone and the po and he even speak of pass the alp like hannibal for the invasion of italy switzerland be by moral analogy as well as physical fact the rock against which these extravagant project be shatter the army of charle which engage the hardy mountaineer in the gorge of the alp near the town of granson be literally crush to atom by the stone and fragment of granite detach from the height and hurl down upon they head charle after this defeat return to the charge six week later have rally he army and draw reinforcement from burgundy but loui have despatch a body of cavalry to the swiss -- a force in which they be before deficient and thus augment they army amount to thirty-four thousand man they take up a position skilfully choose on the border of the lake of morat where they be attack by charle at the head of sixty thousand soldier of all rank the result be the total defeat of the latter with the loss of ten thousand kill whose bone gather into a immense heap and bleaching in the wind remain for above three century a terrible monument of rashness and injustice on the one hand and of patriotism and valor on the other charle be now plunge into a state of profound melancholy but he soon burst from this gloomy mood into one of renew fierceness and fatal desperation nine month after the battle of morat he re-enter lorraine at the head of a army not compose of he faithful militia of the netherland but of those mercenary in whom it be madness to place trust the reinforcement mean to be despatch to he by those province be keep back by the artifice of the count of campo basso a italian who command he cavalry and who only gain he confidence basely to betray it rene duke of lorraine at the head of the confederate force offer battle to charle under the wall of nancy and the night before the combat campo basso go over to the enemy with the troops under he command still charle have the way open for retreat fresh troops from burgundy and flander be on they march to join he but he would not be dissuade from he resolution to fight and he resolve to try he fortune once more with he dispirited and shattered army on this occasion the fate of charle be decide and the fortune of loui triumphant the rash and ill-fated duke lose both the battle and he life he body mutilate with wound be find the next day and bury with great pomp in the town of nancy by the order of the generous victor the duke of lorraine thus perish the last prince of the powerful house of burgundy charle leave to he only daughter then eighteen year of age the inheritance of he extensive dominion and with they that of the hatred and jealousy which he have so largely excited external spoliation immediately commence and internal disunion quickly follow loui xi seize on burgundy and a part of artoi as fief devolve to the crown in default of male issue several of the province refuse to pay the new subsidy command in the name of mary flander alone show a disposition to uphold the rights of the young princess the state be assemble at ghent and ambassador send to the king of france in the hope of obtain peace on reasonable term loui true to he system of subtle perfidy place before one of those ambassador the burgomaster of ghent a letter from the inexperienced princess which prove she intention to govern by the counsel of she father 's ancient minister rather than by that of the deputy of the nation this be enough to decide the indignant fleming to render themselves at once master of the government and get rid of the minister whom they hate two burgundian noble hugonet and imbercourt be arrest accuse of treason and behead under the very eye of they agonize and outraged mistress who throw herself before the frenzied multitude vainly implore mercy for these innocent man the people have thus completely gain the upper hand over the burgundian influence mary be sovereign of the netherland but in name it would have now be easy for loui xi to have obtain for the dauphin he son the hand of this hitherto unfortunate but interesting princess but he think himself sufficiently strong and cunning to gain possession of she state without such a alliance mary however thus in some measure disdain if not actually reject by loui soon after marry she first-intended husband maximilian of austria son of the emperor frederick iii a prince so absolutely destitute in consequence of he father 's parsimony that she be oblige to borrow money from the town of flander to defray the expense of he suite nevertheless he seem equally acceptable to he bride and to he new subject they not only supply all he want but enable he to maintain the war against loui xi whom they defeat at the battle of guinegate in picardy and force to make peace on more favorable term than they have hope for but these wealthy province be not more zealous for the national defense than bent on the maintenance of they local privilege which maximilian little understood and sympathize with less he be breed in the school of absolute despotism and he duchess have meet with a too early death by a fall from she horse in the year 1484 he could not even succeed in obtain the nomination of guardian to he own child without pass through a year of civil war he power be almost nominal in the northern province he vainly attempt to suppress the violence of the faction of hoek and kaabeljauw in flander he authority be openly resist the turbulent town of that country and particularly bruge take umbrage at a government half german half burgundian and altogether hateful to the people rise up against maximilian seize on he person imprison he in a house which still exist and put to death he most faithful follower but the fury of ghent and other place become still more outrageous maximilian ask as a favor from he rebel subject of bruge to be guard while a prisoner by they alone he be then king of the roman and all europe become interested in he fate the pope address a brief to the town of bruge demand he deliverance but the burgher be as inflexible as factious and they at length release he but not until they have conclude with he and the assemble state a treaty which most amply secure the enjoyment of they privilege and the pardon of they rebellion but these kind of compact be never observe by the prince of those day beyond the actual period of they capacity to violate they the emperor have enter the netherland at the head of forty thousand man maximilian so support soon show he contempt for the obligation he have swear to and have recourse to force for the extension of he authority the valor of the fleming and the military talent of they leader philip of cleve thwart all he project and a new compromise be enter into flander pay a large subsidy and hold fast she rights the german troops be send into holland and employ for the extinction of the hoek who as they form by far the weaker faction be now soon destroy that province which have be so long distract by its intestine feud and which have consequently play but a insignificant part in the transaction of the netherland now resume its place and acquire thenceforth new honor till it at length come to figure in all the importance of historical distinction the situation of the netherland be now extremely precarious and difficult to manage during the unstable sway of a government so weak as maximilian 's but he have succeed he father on the imperial throne in 1493 and he son philip have be proclaim the following year duke and count of the various province at the age of sixteen a more please prospect be offer to the people philip young handsome and descend by he mother from the ancient sovereign of the country be joyfully hail by all the town he do not belie the hope so enthusiastically express he have the good sense to renounce all pretension to friesland the fertile source of many precede quarrel and sacrifice he re-establish the ancient commercial relation with england to which country maximilian have give mortal-offence by sustain the imposture of perkin warbeck philip also consult the states-general on he project of a double alliance between himself and he sister with the son and daughter of ferdinand king of aragon and isabellum queen of castile and from this wise precaution the project soon become one of national partiality instead of private or personal interest in this manner complete harmony be establish between the young prince and the inhabitant of the netherland all the ill produce by civil war disappear with immense rapidity in flander and brabant as soon as peace be thus consolidated even holland though it have particularly feel the scourge of these dissension and suffer severely from repeat inundation begin to recover yet for all this philip can be scarcely call a good prince : he merit be negative rather than real but that suffice for the nation which find in the nullity of its sovereign no obstacle to the resumption of that prosperous career which have be check by the despotism of the house of burgundy and the attempt of maximilian to continue the same system the reign of philip unfortunately a short one be render remarkable by two intestine quarrel one in friesland the other in guelder the frison who have be so isolate from the more important affair of europe that they be in a manner lose sight of by history for several century have nevertheless they full share of domestic dispute too long too multifarious and too minute to allow we to give more than this brief notice of they existence but finally about the period of philip 's accession eastern friesland have choose for its count a gentleman of the country surname edzart who fix the headquarters of he military government at embden the sight of such a elevation in a individual whose pretension he think far inferior to he own induce albert of saxony who have well serve maximilian against the refractory fleming to demand as he reward the title of stadtholder or hereditary governor of friesland but it be far easier for the emperor to accede to this request than for he favorite to put the grant into effect the frison true to they old character hold firm to they privilege and fight for they maintenance with heroic courage albert furious at this resistance have the horrid barbarity to cause to be impale the chief burgher of the town of leuwaarden which he have take by assault but he himself die in the year 1500 without succeed in he project of a ambition unjust in its principle and atrocious in its practice the war of guelder be of a totally different nature in this case it be not a question of popular resistance to a tyrannical nomination but of patriotic fidelity to the reign family adolphus the duke who have dethrone he father have die in flander leave a son who have be bring up almost a captive as long as maximilian govern the state of he inheritance this young man call charle of egmont and who be honor in the history of he country under the title of the achille of guelder fall into the hand of the french during the combat in which he make he first essay in arm the town of guelder unanimously join to pay he ransom and as soon as he be at liberty they one and all proclaim he duke the emperor philip and the germanic diet in vain protest against this measure and declare charle a usurper the spirit of justice and of liberty speak more loudly than the thunder of they ban and the people resolve to support to the last this scion of a ancient race glorious in much of its conduct though often criminal in many of its member charle of egmont find faithful friend in he devoted subject and he maintain he rights sometimes with sometimes without the assistance of france -- make up for he want of number by energy and enterprise we can not follow this warlike prince in the long series of adventure which consolidate he power nor stop to depict he daring adherent on land who cause the whole of holland to tremble at they deed nor he pirate -- the chief of whom long peter call himself king of the zuyder zee but amid all the consequent trouble of such a struggle it be marvellous to find charle of egmont uphold he country in a state of high prosperity and leave it at he death almost as rich as holland itself the incapacity of philip the fair doubtless contribute to cause he the loss of this portion of he dominion this prince after he first act of moderation and good sense be remarkable only as be the father of charle v the remainder of he life be wear out in undignified pleasure and he die almost suddenly in the year 1506 at burgo in castile whither he have repair to pay a visit to he brother-in-law the king of spain chapter vi from the government of margaret of austrium to the abdication of the emperor charle v ad 1506 -- 1555 philip be dead and he wife joanna of spain have become mad from grief at he loss after nearly lose she sens from jealousy during he life the regency of the netherland revert to maximilian who immediately name he daughter margaret stadtholderess of the country this princess scarcely twenty-seven year of age have be like the celebrated jacqueline of bavarium already three time married and be now again a widow she first husband charle viii of france have break from he contract of marriage before its consummation she second the infante of spain die immediately after they union and she third the duke of savoy leave she again a widow after three year of wed life she be a woman of talent and courage both prove by the couplet she compose for she own epitaph at the very moment of a dangerous accident which happen during she journey into spain to join she second affianced spouse ci-git margot la genre demoiselle qui eut deux maris et si mourut pucelle here gentle margot quietly be lay who have two husband and yet die a maid she be receive with the greatest joy by the people of the netherland and she govern they as peaceably as circumstance allow support by england she firmly maintain she authority against the threat of france and she carry on in person all the negotiation between loui xii maximilian the pope julius ii and ferdinand of aragon for the famous league of venice these negotiation take place in 1508 at cambray where margaret if we be to credit a expression to that effect in one of she letter be more than once on the point of have serious difference with the cardinal of amboise minister of loui xii but besides she attention to the interest of she father on this important occasion she also succeed in repress the rise pretension of charle of egmont and assist by the interference of the king of france she oblige he to give up some place in holland which he illegally hold from this period the alliance between england and spain raise the commerce and manufacture of the southern province of the netherland to a high degree of prosperity while the northern part of the country be still keep down by they various dissension holland be at war with the hanseatic town the frison continue to struggle for freedom against the heir of albert of saxony utrecht be at variance with its bishop and finally recognize charle of egmont as its protector the consequence of all these cause be that the south take the start in a course of prosperity which be however soon to become common to the whole nation a new rupture with france in 1513 unite maximilian margaret and henry viii of england in one common cause a english and belgian army in which maximilian figure as a spectator -lrb- take care to be pay by england -rrb- march for the destruction of therouenne and defeat and disperse the french at the battle of spur but loui xii soon persuade henry to make a separate peace and the unconquerable duke of guelder make margaret and the emperor pay the penalty of they success against france he pursue he victory in friesland and force the country to recognize he as stadtholder of groningen its chief town while the duke of saxony at length renounce to another he unjust claim on a territory which engulf both he army and he treasure about the same epoch -lrb- 1515 -rrb- young charle son of philip the fair have just attain he fifteenth year be inaugurate duke of brabant and count of flander and holland have purchase the presumed right of saxony to the sovereignty of friesland in the following year he be recognize as prince of castile in right of he mother who associate he with herself in the royal power -- a step which soon leave she merely the title of queen charle procure the nomination of bishop of utrecht for philip bastard of burgundy which make that province completely dependent on he but this event be also one of general and lasting importance on another account this philip of burgundy be deeply affect by the doctrine of the reformation which have burst forth in germany he hold in abhorrence the superstitious observance of the romish church and set he face against the celibacy of the clergy he example soon influence he whole diocese and the new notion on point of religion become rapidly popular it be chiefly however in friesland that the people embrace the opinion of luther which be quite conformable to many of the local custom of which we have already speak the celebrated edzard count of eastern friesland openly adopt the reformation while erasmus of rotterdam without actually pronounce himself a disciple of lutheranism effect more than all its advocate to throw the abuse of catholicism into discredit we may here remark that during the government of the house of burgundy the clergy of the netherland have fall into considerable disrepute intrigue and court favor alone have the disposal of the benefice while the career of commerce be open to the enterprise of every spirited and independent competitor the reformation therefore in the first instance find but a slight obstacle in the opposition of a slavish and ignorant clergy and its progress be all at once prodigious the refusal of the dignity of emperor by frederick the wise duke of saxony to whom it be offer by the elector be also a event highly favorable to the new opinion for franci i of france and charle already king of spain and sovereign of the netherland both claim the succession to the empire a sort of interregnum deprive the dispute dominion of a chief who might lay the heavy hand of power on the new-springing doctrine of protestantism at length the intrigue of charle and he pretension as grandson of maximilian have cause he to be choose emperor a desperate rivalry result between he and the french king which for a while absorb he whole attention and occupy all he power from the earliest appearance of the reformation the young sovereign of so many state have to establish he authority at the two extremity of europe could not efficiently occupy himself in resist the doctrine which despite they dishonor epithet of heresy be doom so soon to become orthodox for a great part of the continent while charle vigorously put down the revolt spaniard luther gain new proselyte in germany so that the very greatness of the sovereignty be the cause of he impotency and while charle 's extent of dominion thus foster the grow reformation he sense of honor prove the safeguard of its apostle the intrepid luther boldly venture to appear and plead its cause before the representative power of germany assemble at the diet of worm be protect by the guarantee of the emperor unlike the celebrated and unfortunate john huss who fall a victim to he own confidence and the bad faith of sigismund in the year 1415 charle be nevertheless a zealous and rigid catholic and in the low country where he authority be undisputed he proscribe the heretic and even violate the privilege of the country by appoint functionary for the express purpose of they pursuit and punishment this imprudent stretch of power foster a rise spirit of opposition for though entertain the best disposition to they young prince the people deeply feel and loudly complain of the government and thus the germ of a mighty revolution gradually begin to be develop charle v and franci i have be rival for dignity and power and they now become implacable personal enemy young ambitious and sanguine they could not without reciprocal resentment pursue in the same field object essential to both charle by a short but timely visit to england in 1520 have the address to gain over to he cause and secure for he purpose the powerful interest of cardinal wolsey and to make a most favorable impression on henry viii and thus strengthen

peace one year more see the term of this long-continued state of warfare by the peace of cambray between charle and franci which be sign on the 5th of August 1529 this peace once conclude the industry and perseverance of the inhabitant of the netherland repair in a short time the evil cause by so many war excite by the ambition of prince but in scarcely any instance for the interest of the country little however be want to endanger this tranquillity and to excite the people against each other on the score of religious dissension the sect of anabaptist whose wild opinion be subversive of all

very extremity of hainault put themselves into motion for munster and notwithstanding the cold of February they march along quite naked accord to the system of they sect the frenzy of these fanatic be increase by persecution they project attempt against several town and particularly against amsterdam they be easily defeat and massacre without mercy and it be only by multiply and horrible execution that they number be at length diminish john bokelszoon hold out at munster which be besiege by the bishop and the neighbor prince this profligate fanatic who have marry no less than seventeen woman have gain considerable influence over the insensate multitude but he be at length take and imprison in a iron cage -- a event which undeceive the greater number of those whom he have persuade of he superhuman power the prosperity of the southern province proceed rapidly and uninterruptedly in consequence of the great and valuable traffic of the merchant of flander and brabant who exchange they goods of native manufacture for the riches draw from america and indium by the spaniard and portuguese antwerp have succeed to bruge as the general mart of commerce and be the most opulent town of the north of europe the expense estimate at one hundred and thirty thousand golden crown which this city voluntarily incur to do honor to the visit of philip son of charle v be cite as a proof of its wealth the value of the wool annually import for manufacture into the low country from england and spain be calculate at four million piece of gold they herr fishery be unrivalled for even the scotch on whose coast these fish be take do not attempt a competition with the zealander but the chief seat of prosperity be the south flander alone be tax for one-third of the general burden of the state brabant pay only one-seventh less than flander so that these two rich province contribute thirteen out of twenty-one part of the general contribution and all the rest combine but eight a search for further or minuter proof of the comparative state of the various division of the country would be superfluous the perpetual quarrel of charle v with franci i and charle of guelder lead as may be suppose to a repeated state of exhaustion which force the prince to pause till the people recover strength and resource for each fresh encounter charle rarely appear in the netherland fix he residence chiefly in spain and leave to he sister the regulation of those distant province one of he occasional visit be for the purpose of inflict a terrible example upon they the people of ghent suspect a improper or improvident application of the fund they have furnish for a new campaign offer themselves to march against the french instead of be force to pay they quota of some further subsidy the government have reject this proposal a sedition be the result at the moment when charle and franci already negotiate one of they temporary reconciliation on this occasion charle form the daring resolution of cross the kingdom of france to promptly take into he own hand the settlement of this affair -- trust to the generosity of he scarcely reconcile enemy not to abuse the confidence with which he risk himself in he power ghent take by surprise do not dare to oppose the entrance of the emperor when he appear before the wall and the city be punish with extreme severity twenty-seven leader of the sedition be behead the principal privilege of the city be withdraw and a citadel build to hold it in check for the future charle meet with neither opposition nor complaint the province have so prosper under he sway and be so flattered by the greatness of the sovereign who be bear in the town he so severely punish that he act of despotic harshness be bear without a murmur but in the north the people do not view he measure so complacently and a wide separation in interest and opinion become manifest in the different division of the nation yet the dutch and the zealander signalize themselves beyond all he other subject on the occasion of two expedition which charle undertake against tuni and algier the two northern province furnish a greater number of ship than the unite quota of all the rest of he state but though charle 's gratitude do not lead he to do anything in return as peculiarly favorable to these province he obtain for they nevertheless a great advantage in make himself master of friesland and guelder on the death of charle of egmont he acquisition of the latter which take place in 1543 put a end to the domestic war of the northern province from that period they might fairly look for a futurity of union and peace and thus the latter year of charle promise better for he country than he early one though he obtain less success in he new war with france which be not however signalize by any grand event on either side toward the end of he career charle redouble he severity against the protestant and even introduce a modify species of inquisition into the netherland but with little effect toward the suppression of the reform doctrine the misunderstanding between he only son philip and mary of england whom he have induce he to marry and the unamiable disposition of this young prince torment he almost as much as he be humiliate by the victory of henry ii of france the successor of franci i and the successful dissimulation of maurice elector of saxony by whom he be completely outwit deceive and defeat impel by these motive and other perhaps which be and must ever remain unknown charle at length decide on abdicate the whole of he immense possession he choose the city of brussels as the scene of the solemnity and the day fix for it be the 25th of October 1555 it take place accordingly in the presence of the king of bohemia the duke of savoy the dowager queen of france and hungary the duchess of lorraine and a immense assemblage of nobility from various country charle resign the empire to he brother ferdinand already king of

estremadura he enter this retreat in February 1556 and die there on the 21st of September 1558 in the fifty-ninth year of he age the last six month of he existence contrast with the daring vigor of he former life form a melancholy picture of timidity and superstition the whole of the province of the netherland be now for the first time unite under one sovereign such a junction mark the limit of a second epoch in they history it would be a presumptuous and vain attempt to trace in a compass so confine as ours the various change in manners and custom which arise in these country during a period of one thousand year the extended and profound remark of many celebrated writer on the state of europe from the decline of the roman power to the epoch at which we be now arrive must be refer to to judge of the gradual progress of civilization through the gloom of the dark age till the dawn of enlightenment which lead to the grand system of european politics commence during the reign of charle v the amazing increase of commerce be above all other consideration the cause of the growth of liberty in the netherland the reformation open the mind of man to that intellectual freedom without which political enfranchisement be a worthless privilege the invention of printing open a thousand channel to the flow of erudition and talent and send they out from the reservoir of individual possession to fertilize the whole domain of human nature war which seem to be a instinct of man and which particular instance of heroism often raise to the dignity of a passion be reduce to a science and make subservient to those great principle of policy in which society begin to perceive its only chance of durable good manufacture attain a state of high perfection and go on progressively with the growth of wealth and luxury the opulence of the town of brabant and flander be without any previous example in the state of europe a merchant of bruge take upon himself alone the security for the ransom of

visit to bruge exclaim with astonishment not unmixed with envy i think myself the only queen here but i see six hundred other who appear more so than i the court of phillip the good seem to carry magnificence and splendor to they greatest possible height the dress of both man and woman at this chivalric epoch be of almost incredible expense velvet satin gold and precious stone seem the ordinary material for the dress of either sex while the very housing of the horse sparkle with brilliant and cost immense sum this absurd extravagance be carry so far that charle v find himself force at length to proclaim sumptuary law for its repression the style of the banquet give on grand occasion be regulate on a scale of almost puerile splendor the banquet of vow give at lille in the year 1453 and so call from the obligation enter into by some of the noble to accompany philip in a new crusade against the infidel show a succession of costly foolery most amusing in the detail give by a eye-witness -lrb- olivier de la marche -rrb- the minutest of the chronicler but unluckily too long to find a place in we page such excessive luxury naturally lead to great corruption of manners and the commission of terrible crime during the reign of philip de male there be commit in the city of ghent and its outskirts in less than a year above fourteen hundred murder in gambling-house and other resort of debauchery as early as the tenth century the petty sovereign establish on the ruin of the empire of charlemagne begin the independent coining of money and the various province be during the rest of this epoch inundate with a most embarrassing variety of gold silver and copper even in age of comparative darkness literature make feeble effort to burst through the entangled weed of superstition ignorance and war in the fourteenth and fifteenth century history be greatly cultivate and froissart monstrelet olivier de la marche and philip de comine give to they chronicle and memoirs a charm of style since they day almost unrivalled poetry begin to be follow with success in the netherland in the dutch flemish and french language and even before the institution of the floral game in france belgium possess its chamber of rhetoric -lrb- _ rederykkamer _ -rrb- which labor to keep alive the sacred flame of poetry with more zeal than success in the fourteenth and fifteenth century these society be establish in almost every burgh of flander and brabant the principal town possess several at once the art in they several branch make considerable progress in the netherland during this epoch architecture be greatly cultivate in the thirteenth and fourteenth century most of the cathedral and town house be construct in that age they vastness solidity and beauty of design and execution make they still speak monument of the stern magnificence and finish taste of the time the patronage of philip the good charle the rash and margaret of austrium bring music into fashion and lead to its cultivation in a remarkable degree the first musician of france be draw from flander and other professor from that country acquire great celebrity in italy for they scientific improvement in they delightful art painting which have languish before the fifteenth century spring at once into a new existence from the invention of john van eyck know better by the name of john of bruge he accidental discovery of the art of painting in oil quickly spread over europe and serve to perpetuate to all time the record of the genius which have bequeath its vivid impression to the world painting on glass polish diamond the carillon lace and tapestry be among the invention which owe they birth to the netherland in these age when the faculty of mankind seek so many new channel for mechanical development the discovery of a new world by columbus and other eminent navigator give a fresh and powerful impulse to european talent by afford a immense reservoir for its reward the town of antwerp be during the reign of charle v the outlet for the industry of europe and the receptacle for the production of all the nation of the earth its port be so often crowd with vessel that each successive fleet be oblige to wait long in the scheldt before it could obtain admission for the discharge of its cargo the university of louvain that great nursery of science be found in 1425 and serve greatly to the spread of knowledge although it degenerate into the hotb of those fierce dispute which stamp on theology the degradation of bigotry and draw down odium on a study that if purely practice ought only to inspire veneration charle v be the first to establish a solid plan of government instead of the constant fluctuation in the management of justice police and finance he cause the edict of the various sovereign and the municipal usage to be embody into a system of law and thus give stability and method to the enjoyment of the prosperity in which he leave he dominion chapter vii from the accession of philip ii of spain to the establishment of the inquisition in the netherland ad 1555 -- 1566 it have be show that the netherland be never in a more flourishing state than at the accession of philip ii the external relation of the country present a aspect of prosperity and peace england be closely ally to it by queen mary 's marriage with philip france fatigue with war have just conclude with it a five year truce germany paralyze by religious dissension exhaust itself in domestic quarrel the other state be too distant or too weak to inspire any uneasiness and nothing appear want for the public weal nevertheless there be something dangerous and alarming in the situation of the low country but the danger consist wholly in the connection between the monarch and the people and the alarm be not sound till the mischief be beyond remedy from the time that charle v be call to reign over spain he may be say to have be virtually lose to the country of he birth he be no longer a mere duke of brabant or limberg a count of flander or holland he be also king of castile aragon leon and navarre of naple and of sicily these various kingdom have interest evidently oppose to those of the low country and form of government far different it be scarcely to be doubt that the absolute monarch of so many people would look with a jealous eye on the institution of those province which place limit to he power and the natural consequence be that he who be a legitimate king in the south soon degenerate into a usurp master in the north but during the reign of charle the danger be in some measure lessen or at least conceal from public view by the apparent facility with which he submit to and observe the law and custom of he native country with philip the case be far different and the result too obvious uninformed on the belgian character despise the state of manners and ignorant of the language no sympathy attach he to the people he bring with he to the throne all the hostile prejudice of a foreigner without one of the kindly or considerate feeling of a compatriot spain where this young prince have hitherto pass he life be in some degree exclude from european civilization a contest of seven century between the mohammedan tribe and the descendant of the visigoth cruel like all civil war and like all those of religion not merely a contest of ruler but essentially of the people have give to the manners and feeling of this unhappy country a deep stamp of barbarity the ferocity of military chieftain have become the basis of the government and law the christian king have adopt the perfidious and bloody system of the despotic sultan they replace magnificence and tyranny power and cruelty wisdom and dissimulation respect and fear be inseparably associate in the mind of a people so govern they comprehend nothing in religion but a god arm with omnipotence and vengeance or in politics but a king as terrible as the deity he represent philip breed in this school of slavish superstition teach that he be the despot for whom it be form familiar with the degrading tactic of eastern tyranny be at once the most contemptible and unfortunate of man isolate from he kind and wish to appear superior to those beyond whom he station have place he he be insensible to the affection which soften and ennoble human nature he be perpetually fill with one idea -- that of he greatness he have but one ambition -- that of command but one enjoyment -- that of exciting fear victim to this revolting selfishness he heart be never free from care and the bitter melancholy of he character seem to nourish a desire of evil-doing which irritated suffering often produce in man deceit and blood be he greatest if not he only delight the religious zeal which he affect or feel show itself but in act of cruelty and the fanatic bigotry which inspire he form the strongest contrast to the divine spirit of christianity nature have endow this ferocious be with wonderful penetration and unusual self-command the first reveal to he the view of other and the latter give he the surest means of counteract they by enable he to control himself although ignorant he have a prodigious instinct of cunning he want courage but its place be supply by the harsh obstinacy of wounded pride all the corruption of intrigue be familiar to he yet he often fail in he most deep-laid design at the very moment of they apparent success by the recoil of the bad faith and treachery with which he plan be overcharge such be the man who now begin that terrible reign which menace utter ruin to the national prosperity of the netherland he father have already sap its foundation by encourage foreign manners and idea among the nobility and dazzling they with the hope of the honor and wealth which he have at he disposal abroad he severe edict against heresy have also begin to accustom the nation to religious discord and hatred philip soon enlarged on what charle have commence and he unmercifully sacrifice the well-being of a people to the worst object of he selfish ambition philip have only once visit the netherland before he accession to sovereign power be at that time twenty-two year of age he opinion be form and he prejudice deeply root everything that he observe on this visit be calculate to revolt both the frank cordiality of the people appear too familiar the expression of popular rights sound like the voice of rebellion even the magnificence display in he honor offend he jealous vanity from that moment he seem to have conceive a implacable aversion to the country in which alone of all he vast possession he could not display the power or inspire the terror of despotism the sovereign 's dislike be fully equal by the disgust of he subject he haughty severity and vexatious etiquette revolt they pride as well as they plain dealing and the moral quality of they new sovereign be consider with loathe the commercial and political connection between the netherland and spain have give the two people ample opportunity for mutual acquaintance the dark vindictive disposition of the latter inspire a deep antipathy in those whom civilization have soften and liberty render frank and generous and the new sovereign seem to embody all that be repulsive and odious in the nation of which he be the type yet philip do not at first act in a way to make himself more particularly hate he rather by a apparent consideration for a few point of political interest and individual privilege and particularly by the revocation of some of the edict against heretic remove the suspicion he earlier conduct have excite and he intended victim do not perceive that the despot seek to lull they to sleep in the hope of make they a easier prey philip know well that force alone be insufficient to reduce such a people to slavery he succeed in persuade the state to grant he considerable subsidy some of which be to be pay by instalment during a period of nine year that be gain a great step toward he design as it supersede the necessity of a yearly application to the three order the guardian of the public liberty at the same time he send secret agent to rome to obtain the approbation of the pope to he insidious but most effective plan for place the whole of the clergy in dependence upon the crown he also keep up the army of spaniard and german which he father have form on the frontier of france and although he do not remove from they employment the functionary already in place he take care to make no new appointment to office among the native of the netherland in the midst of these cunning preparation for tyranny philip be suddenly attack in two quarter at once by henry ii of france and by pope paul iv a prince less obstinate than philip would in such circumstance have renounce or at least postpone he design against the liberty of so important a part of he dominion as those to which he be oblige to have recourse for aid in support of this double war but he seem to make every foreign consideration subservient to the object of domestic aggression which he have so much at heart he however promptly meet the threaten danger from abroad he turn he first attention toward he contest with the pope and he extricate himself from it with a adroitness that prove the whole force and cunning of he character have first publicly obtain the opinion of several doctor of theology that he be justify in take arm against the pontiff -lrb- a point on which there be really no doubt -rrb- he prosecute the war with the utmost vigor by the means of the afterward notorious duke of alva at that time viceroy of he italian dominion paul soon yield to superior skill and force and demand term of peace which be grant with a readiness and seeming liberality that astonish no one more than the defeat pontiff but philip 's moderation to he enemy be far outdo by he perfidy to he ally he confirm alva 's consent to the confiscation of the domain of the noble roman who have espouse he cause and thus gain a stanch and powerful supporter to all he future project in the religious authority of the successor of st peter he conduct in the conclusion of the war with france be not less base he army under the command of philibert emmanuel duke of savoy consist of belgian german and spaniard with a considerable body of english send by mary to the assistance of she husband penetrate into picardy and gain a complete victory over the french force the honor of this brilliant affair which take place near st quintin be almost wholly due to the count d'egmont a belgian noble who command the light cavalry but the king unwilling to let anyone man enjoy the glory of the day piously pretend that he owe the entire obligation to st lawrence on whose festival the battle be fight he gratitude or hypocrisy find a fitting monument in the celebrated convent and palace of the escurial which he absurdly cause to be build in the form of a gridiron the instrument of the saint 's martyrdom when the news of the victory reach charle v in he retreat the old warrior inquire if philip be in pari but the cautious victor have no notion of such prompt manoeuvring nor would he risk against foreign enemy the exhaustion of force destine for the enslavement of he people the french in some measure retrieve they late disgrace by the capture of calais the only town remain to england of all its french conquest and which consequently have deeply interested the national glory of each people in the early part of the year 1558 one of the general of henry ii make a irruption into western flander but the gallant count of egmont once more prove he valor and skill by attack and totally defeat the invader near the town of graveline a general peace be conclude in April 1559 which bear the name of câteau-cambresis from that of the place where it be negotiate philip secure for himself various advantage in the treaty but he sacrifice the interest of england by consent to the retention of calai by the french king -- a cession deeply humiliating to the national pride of he ally and if general opinion be correct a proximate cause of he consort 's death the alliance of france and the support of rome the important result of the two war now bring to a close be counterbalance by the well-known hostility of elizabeth who have succeed to the throne of england and this latter consideration be a additional motive with philip to push forward the design of consolidate he despotism in the low country to lead he already deceive subject the more surely into the snare he announce he intended departure on a short visit to spain and create for the period of he absence a provisional government chiefly compose of the lead man among the belgian nobility he flatter himself that the state dazzle by the illustrious illusion thus prepare would cheerfully grant to this provisional government the right of levy tax during the temporary absence of the sovereign he also reckon on the influence of the clergy in the national assembly to procure the revival of the edict against heresy which he have gain the merit of suspend these with many minor detail of profound duplicity form the principal feature of a plan which if successful would have reduce the netherland to the wretched state of colonial dependence by which naple and sicily be hold in the tenure of spain as soon as the state have consent to place the whole power of government in the hand of the new administration for the period of the king 's absence the royal hypocrite believe he scheme secure and flattered himself he have establish a instrument of durable despotism the composition of this new government be a masterpiece of political machinery it consist of several council in which the most distinguished citizen be entitle to a place in sufficient number to deceive the people with a show of representation but not enough to command a majority which be sure on any important question to rest with the title creature of the court the edict against heresy soon adopt give to the clergy a almost unlimited power over the life and fortune of the people but almost all the dignitary of the church be man of great respectability and moderation choose by the body of the inferior clergy these extraordinary power excite little alarm philip 's project be suddenly to replace these virtuous ecclesiastic by other of he own choice as soon as the state break up from they annual meeting and for this intention he have procure the secret consent and authority of the court of rome in support of these combination the belgian troops be completely break up and scatter in small body over the country the whole of this force so redoubtable to the fear of despotism consist of only three thousand cavalry it be now divide into fourteen company -lrb- or squadron in the modern phraseology -rrb- under the command of as many independent chief so as to leave little chance of any principle of union reign among they but the german and spanish troops in philip 's pay be canton on the frontier ready to stifle any incipient effort in opposition to he plan in addition to these impose means for they execution he have secure a still more secret and more powerful support : a secret article in the treaty of câteau-cambresis oblige the king of france to assist he with the whole army of france against he belgian subject should they prove refractory thus the late war of which the netherland have bear all the weight and earn all the glory only bring about the junction of the defeat enemy with they own king for the extinction of they national independence to complete the execution of this system of perfidy philip convene a assembly of all the state at ghent in the month of July 1559 this meeting of the representative of the three order of the state offer no apparent obstacle to philip 's view the clergy alarm at the progress of the new doctrine gather more closely round the government of which they require the support the noble have lose much of they ancient attachment to liberty and have become in various way dependent on the royal favor many of the first family be then represent by man possess rather of courage and candor than of foresight and sagacity that of nassau the most distinguish of all seem the least interested in the national cause a great part of its possession be in germany and france where it have recently acquire the sovereign principality of orange it be only from the third order -- that of the common -- that philip have to expect any opposition already during the war it have show some discontent and have insist on the nomination of commissioner to control the account and the disbursement of the subsidy but it seem improbable that among this class of man any would be find capable of penetrate the manifold combination of the king and disconcert he design anthony perrenotte de granvelle bishop of arras who be consider as philip 's favorite counsellor but who be in reality no more than he docile agent be commission to address the assembly in the name of he master who speak only spanish he oration be one of cautious deception and contain the most flattering assurance of philip 's attachment to the people of the netherland it excuse the king for not have nominate he only son don carlo to reign over they in he name allege as a proof of he royal affection that he prefer give they as stadtholderess a belgian princess madame marguerite duchess of parma the natural daughter of charle v by a young lady a native of audenarde fair promise and fine word be thus lavish in profusion to gain the confidence of the deputy but notwithstanding all the talent the caution and the mystery of philip and he minister there be among the noble one man who see through all this individual endowed with many of the highest attribute of political genius and pre-eminently with judgment the most important of all enter fearlessly into the contest against tyranny -- despise every personal sacrifice for the country 's good without make himself suspiciously prominent he privately warn some member of the state of the come danger those in whom he confide do not betray the trust they spread among the other deputy the alarm and point out the danger to which they have be so judiciously awaken the consequence be a reply to philip 's demand in vague and general term without bind the nation by any pledge and a unanimous entreaty that he would diminish the tax withdraw the foreign troops and intrust no official employment to any but native of the country the object of this last request be the removal of granvelle who be bear in franche-comte philip be utterly astounded at all this in the first moment of he vexation he imprudently cry out would ye then also bereave _ I _ of my place i who be a spaniard but he soon recover he self-command and resume he usual mask express he regret at not have sooner learn the wish of the state promise to remove the foreign troops within three month and set off for zealand with assume composure but fill with the fury of a discover traitor and a humiliated despot a fleet under the command of count horn the admiral of the united province wait at flessingue to form he escort to spain at the very moment of he departure william of nassau prince of orange and governor of zealand wait on he to pay he official respects the king take he apart from the other attendant noble recommend he to hasten the execution of several gentleman and wealthy citizen attach to the newly introduce religious opinion then quite suddenly whether in the random impulse of suppress rage or that he pierce glance discover william 's secret feeling in he countenance he accuse he with have be the means of thwart he design sire reply nassau it be the work of the national state -- no cry philip grasp he furiously by the arm it be not do by the state but by you and you alone -- schiller the word of philip be : _ no_no_los_estados _ _ ma_vos_vos_vos _ vo thus use in spanish be a term of contempt equivalent to _ toi _ in french this glorious accusation be not repel he who have save he country in unmask the design of its tyrant admit by he silence he title to the hatred of the one and the gratitude of the other on the 20th of August philip embark and set sail turn he back forever on the country which offer the first check to he despotism and after a perilous voyage he arrive in that which permit a free indulgence to he ferocious and sanguinary career for some time after philip 's departure the netherland continue to enjoy considerable prosperity from the period of the peace of câteau-cambresis commerce and navigation have acquire new and increasing activity the fishery but particularly that of herring become daily more important that one alone occupy two thousand boat while holland zealand and friesland make this progress in they peculiar branch of industry the southern province be not less active or successful spain and the colony offer such a mart for the object of they manufacture that in a single year they receive from flander fifty large ship fill with article of household furniture and utensil the exportation of woollen goods amount to enormous sum bruge alone sell annually to the amount of four million florin of stuff of spanish and as much of english wool and the least value of the florin then be quadruple its present worth the commerce with england though less important than that with spain be calculate yearly at twenty-four million florin which be chiefly clear profit to the netherland as they exportation consist almost entirely of object of they own manufacture they commercial relation with france germany italy portugal and the levant be daily increase antwerp be the center of this prodigious trade several sovereign among other elizabeth of england have recognize agent in that city equivalent to consul of the present time and loan of immense amount be frequently negotiate by they with wealthy merchant who furnish they not in negotiable bill or for unredeemable debenture but in solid gold and on a simple acknowledgment flander and brabant be still the richest and most flourishing portion of the state some municipal fêtes give about this time afford a notion of they opulence on one of these occasion the town of mechlin send a deputation to antwerp consist of three hundred and twenty-six horseman dress in velvet and satin with gold and silver ornament while those of brussels consist of three hundred and forty as splendidly equip and accompany by seven huge triumphal chariot and seventy-eight carriage of various construction -- a prodigious number for those day but the splendor and prosperity which thus spring out of the national industry and independence and which a wise or a generous sovereign would have promote or at least have establish on a permanent basis be destine speedily to sink beneath the bigoted fury of philip ii the new government which he have establish be most ingeniously adapt to produce every imaginable evil to the state the king hundred of league distant could not himself issue a order but with a lapse of time ruinous to any object of press importance the stadtholderess who represent he have but a nominal authority be force to follow she instruction and liable to have all she act reverse besides which she have the king 's order to consult she private council on all affair whatever and the council of state on any matter of paramount importance these two council however contain the element of a serious opposition to the royal project in the person of the patriot noble sprinkle among philip 's devoted creature thus the influence of the crown be often thwart if not actually balanced and the proposal which emanate from it frequently oppose by the stadtholderess herself she although a woman of masculine appearance and habit -lrb- 2 -rrb- be possess of no strength of mind she prevailing sentiment seem to be dread of the king yet she be at time influence by a sense of justice and by the remonstrance of the well-judging member of she council but these be not all the difficulty that clog the machinery of the state after the king the government and the council have deliberate on any measure its execution rest with the provincial governor or stadtholder or the magistrate of the town almost everyone of these be strongly attach to the law and custom of the nation hesitate or refuse to obey the order convey to they when those order appear illegal some however yield to the authority of the government so it often happen that a edict which in one district be carry into full effect be in other defer reject or violate in a way productive of great confusion in the public affair -lrb- footnote 2 : strada -rrb- philip be conscious that he have himself to blame for the consequent disorder in nominate the member of the two council he have overreach himself in he plan for silently sap the liberty that be so obnoxious to he design but to neutralize the influence of the restive member he have leave granvelle the first place in the administration this man a immoral ecclesiastic a eloquent orator a supple courtier and a profound politician bloated with pride envy insolence and vanity be the real head of the government -lrb- 3 -rrb- next to he among the royalist party be viglius president of the privy council a erudite schoolman attach less to the broad principle of justice than to the letter of the law and thus carry pedantry into the very council of the state next in order come the count de berlaimont head of the financial department -- a stern and intolerant satellite of the court and a furious enemy to those national institution which operate as check upon fraud these three individual form the stadtholderess 's privy council the remain creature of the king be mere subaltern agent -lrb- footnote 3 : strada a royalist a jesuit and therefore a fair witness on this point use the follow word in portray the character of this odious minister : _ animum_avidum_invidumque_ac _ _ simultates_inter_principem_et_populos_occulti_foventum _ -rrb- a government so compose could scarcely fail to excite discontent and create danger to the public weal the first proof of incapacity be elicit by the measure require for the departure of the spanish troops the period fix by the king have already expire and these obnoxious foreigner be still in the country living in part on pillage and each day commit some new excess complaint be carry in successive gradation from the government to the council and from the council to the king the spaniard be remove to zealand but instead of be embark at any of its port they be detain there on various pretext money ship or on necessity a wind be profess to be still want for they final removal by those who find excuse for delay in every element of nature or subterfuge of art in the meantime those ferocious soldier ravage a part of the country the simple native at length declare they would open the sluice of they dike prefer to be swallow by the water rather than remain expose to the cruelty and rapacity of those spaniard still the embarkation be postpone until the king require he troops in spain for some domestic project they take they long-desired departure in the beginning of the year 1561 the public discontent at this just cause be soon however overwhelm by one infinitely more important and last the belgian clergy have hitherto form a free and powerful order in the state govern and represent by four bishop choose by the chapter of the town or elect by the monk of the principal abbey these bishop possess a independent territorial revenue and not directly subject to the influence of the crown have interest and feeling in common with the nation but philip have prepare and the pope have sanction the new system of ecclesiastical organization before allude to and the provisional government now put it into execution instead of four bishop it be intend to appoint eighteen they nomination be vest in the king by a wily system of trickery the subserviency of the abbey be also aim at the new prelate on a pretended principle of economy be endow with the title of abbot of the chief monastery of they respective diocese thus not only would they enjoy the immense wealth of these establishment but the political rights of the abbot whom they be to succeed and the whole of the ecclesiastical order become gradually represent -lrb- after the death of the then live abbot -rrb- by the creature of the crown the consequence of this vital blow to the integrity of the national institution be evident and the indignation of both clergy and laity be universal every legal means of opposition be resort to but the people be without leader the state be not in session while the authority of the pope and the king combine the reverence excite by the very name of religion and the address and perseverance of the government form too powerful a combination and triumph over the national discontent which have not yet be form into resistance the new bishop be appoint granvelle secure for himself the archiepiscopal see of mechlin with the title of primate of the low country at the same time paul iv put the crowning point to the capital of he ambition by present he with a cardinal 's hat the new bishop be to a man most violent intolerant and it may be conscientious opponent to the wide-spreading doctrine of reform the execution of the edict against heresy be confide to they the provincial governor and inferior magistrate be command to aid they with a strong arm and the most unjust and frightful persecution immediately commence but still some of these governor and magistrate consider themselves not only the officer of the prince but the protector of the people and the defender of the law rather than of the faith do not blindly conform to those harsh and illegal command the prince of orange stadtholder of holland zealand and utrecht and the count of egmont governor of flander and artoi permit no persecution in those five province but in various place the very people even when influence by they superior openly oppose it catholic as well as protestant be indignant at the atrocious spectacles of cruelty present on all side the public peace be endanger by isolate act of resistance and fear of a general insurrection soon become universal the apparent temporizing or seeming uncertainty of the champion of the new doctrine form the great obstacle to the reformation and tend to prolong the dreadful struggle which be now only commence in the low country it be a matter of great difficulty to convince the people that popery be absurd and at the same time to set limit to the absurdity have the change be from blind belief to total infidelity it would -lrb- as in a modern instance -rrb- have be much easier though less lasting man might in a time of such excitement have be persuade that _ all _ religion productive of abuse such as then abound be a farce and that common sense call for its abolition but when the boundary of belief become a question when the world be tell it ought to reject some doctrine and retain other which seem as difficult of comprehension when one tenet be pronounced idolatry and to doubt another declare damnation -- the world either explode or recoil : it go too far or it shrink back plunge into atheism or relapse into popery it be thus the reformation be check in the first instance its supporter be the strong-minded and intelligent and they never and least of all in those day form the mass superstition and bigotry have enervate the intellect of the majority and the high resolve of those with whom the great work commence be mix with a severity that materially retard its progress for though personal interest as with henry viii of england and rigid enthusiasm as with calvin strengthen the infant reformation the first lead to violence which irritated many the second to austerity which disgust they and it be soon discover that the change be almost confine to form of practice and that the essential of abuse be likely to be carefully preserve all these and other argument artfully modify to distract the people be urge by the new bishop in the netherland and by those whom they employ to arrest the progress of reform among the various cause of the general confusion the situation of brabant give to that province a peculiar share of suffer brussels its capital be the seat of government have no particular chief magistrate like the other province the executive power be therefore wholly confide to the municipal authority and the territorial proprietor but these though generally patriotic in they view be divide into a multiplicity of different opinion rivalry and resentment produce a total want of union end in anarchy and prepare the way for civil war william of nassau penetrate the cause and propose the remedy in move for the appointment of a provincial governor this proposition terrify granvelle who see as clearly as do he sagacious opponent in the council that the nomination of a special protector between the people and the government would have paralyze all he effort for hurry on the discord and resistance which be mean to be the plausible excuse for the introduction of arbitrary power he therefore energetically dissent from the propose measure and william immediately desist from he demand but he at the same time claim in the name of the whole country the convocation of the states-general this assembly alone be competent to decide what be just legal and obligatory for each province and every town governor magistrate and simple citizen would thus have some rule for they common conduct and the government would be at least endowed with the dignity of uniformity and steadiness the minister endeavor to evade a demand which they be at first unwilling openly to refuse but the firm demeanor and persuasive eloquence of the prince of orange carry before they all who be not actually buy by the crown and granvelle find himself at length force to avow that a express order from the king forbid the convocation of the state on any pretext during he absence the veil be thus rent asunder which have in some measure conceal the deformity of philip 's despotism the result be a powerful confederacy among all who hold it odious for the overthrow of granvelle to whom they choose to attribute the king 's conduct thus bring into practical result the sound principle of ministerial responsibility without which except in some peculiar case of local urgency or political crisis the name of constitutional government be but a mockery many of the royalist noble unite for the national cause and even the stadtholderess join she effort to theirs for a object which would relieve she from the tyranny which none feel more than she do those who compose this confederacy against the minister be actuate by a great variety of motive the duchess of parma hate he as a domestic spy rob she of all real authority the royalist noble as a insolent upstart at every instant mortify they pride the count egmont and horn with nobler sentiment oppose he as the author of they country 's grow misfortune but it be doubtful if any of the confederate except the prince of orange clearly see that they be put themselves in direct and personal opposition to the king himself william alone clear-sighted in politics and profound in he view know in thus devote himself to the public cause the adversary with whom he enter the list this great man for whom the national tradition still preserve the sacred title of father -lrb- vader-willem -rrb- and who be in truth not merely the parent but the political creator of the country be at this period in he thirtieth year he already join the vigor of manhood to the wisdom of age bring up under the eye of charle v whose sagacity soon discover he precocious talent he be admit to the council of the emperor at a time of life which be little advanced beyond mere boyhood he alone be choose by this powerful sovereign to be present at the audience which he give to foreign ambassador which prove that in early youth he well deserve by he discretion the surname of the taciturn it be on the arm of william then twenty year of age and already name by he to the command of the belgian troops that this powerful monarch lean for support on the memorable day of he abdication and he immediately afterward employ he on the important mission of bear the imperial crown to he brother ferdinand in whose favor he have resign it william 's grateful attachment to charle do not blind he to the demerit of philip he repair to france as one of the hostage on the part of the latter monarch for the fulfilment of the peace of câteau-cambresis and he then learn from the lip of henry ii who soon conceive a high esteem for he the measure reciprocally agree on by the two sovereign for the oppression of they subject from that moment he mind be make up on the character of philip and on the part which he have himself to perform and he never feel a doubt on the first point nor swerve from the latter but even before he patriotism be openly display philip have take a dislike to one in whom he shrewdness quickly discover a intellect of which he be jealous he could not actually remove william from all interference with public affair but he refuse he the government of flander and oppose in secret he project marriage with a princess of the house of lorraine which be calculate to bring he a considerable accession of fortune and consequently of influence it may be therefore say that william in he subsequent conduct be urge by motive of personal enmity against philip be it so we do not seek to raise he above the common feeling of humanity and we should risk the sink he below they if we suppose he insensible to the natural effect of just resentment the secret impulse of conduct can never be know beyond the individual 's own breast but action must however questionable be take as the test of motive in all those of william 's illustrious career we can detect none that might be suppose to spring from vulgar or base feeling if he hostility to philip be indeed increase by private dislike he have at least set a example of unparalleled dignity in he method of revenge but in calmly consider and weigh without decide on the question we see nothing that should deprive william of a unsullied title to pure and perfect patriotism the injury do to he by philip at this period be not of a nature to excite any violent hatred enough of public wrong be inflict to arouse the patriot but not of private ill to inflame the man neither be william of a vindictive disposition he be never know to turn the knife of a assassin against he royal rival even when the blade hire by the latter glance from he reek with he blood and though william 's enmity may have be keep alive or strengthen by the provocation he receive it be certain that if a foe to the king he be as long as it be possible the faithful counsellor of the crown he spare no pain to impress on the monarch who hate he the real means for prevent the come evil and have not a revolution be absolutely inevitable it be he who would have prevent it such be the chief of the patriot party choose by the silent election of general opinion and by that involuntary homage to genius which lead individual in the train of those master-mind who take the lead in public affair count egmont and horn and some other largely share with he the popular favor the multitude could not for some time distinguish the uncertain and capricious opposition of a offended courtier from the determine resistance of a great man william be still comparatively young he have live long out of the country and it be little by little that he eminent public virtue be develop and understand the great object of immediate good be the removal of cardinal granvelle william boldly put himself at the head of the confederacy he write to the king conjointly with count egmont and horn faithfully portray the state of affair the duchess of parma back this remonstrance with a strenuous request for granvelle 's dismission philip 's reply to the three nobleman be a mere tissue of duplicity to obtain delay accompany by a invitation to count egmont to repair to madrid to hear he sentiment at large by word of mouth he only answer to the stadtholderess be a positive recommendation to use every possible means to disunite and breed ill-will among the three confederate lord it be difficult to deprive william of the confidence of he friend and impossible to deceive he he see the trap prepare by the royal intrigue restrain egmont for a while from the fatal step he be but too well incline to take and persuade he and horn to renew with he they firm but respectful representation at the same time beg permission to resign they various employment and simultaneously cease to appear at the court of the stadtholderess in the meantime every possible indignity be offer to the cardinal by private pique and public satire several lord follow count egmont 's example have a kind of capuchon or fool 's - cap embroider on the livery of they varlet and it be generally know that this be mean as a practical parody on the cardinal 's hat the crowd laugh heartily at this stupid pleasantry and the coarse satire of the time may be judge by a caricature which be forward to the cardinal 's own hand represent he in the act of hatch a nest full of egg from which a crowd of bishop escape while overhead be the devil _ in_propriâ _ _ personâ _ with the follow scroll : this be my well-beloved son -- listen to he philip thus drive before the popular voice find himself force to the choice of throw off the mask at once or of sacrifice granvelle a invincible inclination for manoeuvring and deceit decide he on the latter measure and the cardinal recall but not disgraced quit the netherland on the 10th of march 1564 the secret instruction to the stadtholderess remain unrevoked the president viglius succeed to the post which granvelle have occupy and it be clear that the project of the king have suffer no change nevertheless some good result from the departure of the unpopular minister the public fermentation subside the patriot lord reappear at court and the prince of orange acquire a increase influence in the council and over the stadtholderess who by he advice adopt a conciliatory line of conduct -- a fallacious but still a temporary hope for the nation but the calm be of short duration scarcely be this moderation evince by the government when philip obstinate in he design and outrageous in he resentment send a order to have the edict against heresy put into most rigorous execution and to proclaim throughout the seventeen province the furious decree of the council of trent the revolting cruelty and illegality of the first edict be already admit as to the decree of this memorable council they be only adapt for country in submission to a absolute despotism they be receive in the netherland with general reprobation even the new bishop loudly denounce they as unjust innovation and thus philip find zealous opponent in those on whom he have reckon as he most servile tool the stadtholderess be not the less urge to implicit obedience to the order of the king by viglius and de berlaimont who take upon themselves a almost menacing tone the duchess assemble a council of state and ask its advice as to she proceedings the prince of orange at once boldly propose disobedience to measure fraught with danger to the monarchy and ruin to the nation the council could not resist he appeal to they best feeling he proposal that fresh remonstrance should be address to the king meet with almost general support the president viglius who have speak in the opening of the council in favor of the king 's order be overwhelm by william 's reasoning and demand time to prepare he reply he agitation during the debate and he despair of carry the measure against the patriot party bring on in the night a attack of apoplexy it be resolve to despatch a special envoy to spain to explain to philip the view of the council and to lay before he a plan propose by the prince of orange for form a junction between the two council and that of finance and form they into one body the object of this measure be at once to give greater union and power to the provisional government to create a central administration in the netherland and to remove from some obscure and avaricious financier the exclusive management of the national resource the count of egmont choose by the council for this important mission set out for madrid in the month of February 1565 philip receive he with profound hypocrisy load he with the most flattering promise send he back in the utmost elation : and when the credulous count return to brussels he find that the write order of which he be the bearer be in direct variance with every word which the king have utter these order be chiefly concern the reiterate subject of the persecution to be inflexibly pursue against the religious reformer not satisfy with the hitherto established form of punishment philip now expressly command that the more revolting means decree by he father in the rigor of he early zeal such as burn live burial and the like should be adopt and he somewhat more obscurely direct that the victim should be no longer publicly immolate but secretly destroy he endeavor by this vague phraseology to avoid the actual utterance of the word inquisition but he thus virtually establish that atrocious tribunal with attribute still more terrific than even in spain for there the condemn have at least the consolation of die in open day and of display the fortitude which be rarely proof against the horror of a private execution philip have thus consummate he treason against the principle of justice and the practice of jurisprudence which have heretofore characterize the country and against the most vital of those privilege which he have solemnly swear to maintain he design of establish this horrible tribunal so impiously name holy by its founder have be long suspect by the people of the netherland the expression of those fear have reach he more than once he as often reply by assurance that he have form no such project and particularly to count d'egmont during he recent visit to madrid but at that very time he assemble a conclave of he creature doctor of theology of whom he formally demand a opinion as to whether he could conscientiously tolerate two sort of religion in the netherland the doctor hope to please he reply that he might for the avoidance of a greater evil philip tremble with rage and exclaim with a threatening tone i ask not if i _ can _ but if i _ ought _ the theologian read in this question the nature of the expected reply and it be amply conformable to he wish he immediately throw himself on he knee before a crucifix and raise he hand toward heaven put up a prayer for strength in he resolution to pursue as deadly enemy all who view that effigy with feeling different from he own if this be not really a sacrilegious farce it must be that the blaspheme bigot believe the deity to be a monster of cruelty like himself even viglius be terrify by the nature of philip 's command and the patriot lord once more withdraw from all share in the government leave to the duchess of parma and she minister the whole responsibility of the new measure they be at length put into actual and vigorous execution in the beginning of the year 1566 the inquisitor of the faith with they familiar stalk abroad boldly in the devoted province carry persecution and death in they train numerous but partial insurrection oppose these odious intruder every district and town become the scene of frightful execution or tumultuous resistance the convert to the new doctrine multiply as usual under the effect of persecution there be nowhere to be see say a contemporary author the meanest mechanic who do not find a weapon to strike down the murderer of he compatriot holland zealand and utrecht alone escape from those fast accumulate horror william of nassau be there chapter viii commencement of the revolution ad 1566 the stadtholderess and she minister now begin to tremble philip 's favorite counsellor advise he to yield to the popular despair but nothing could change he determination to pursue he bloody game to the last chance he have foresee the impossibility of reduce the country to slavery as long as it maintain its tranquillity and that union which form in itself the element and the cement of strength it be from deep calculation that he have excite the trouble and now keep they alive he know that the structure of illegal power could only be raise on the ruin of public rights and national happiness and the material of desolation find sympathy in he congenial mind and now in reality begin the awful revolution of the netherland against they tyrant in a few year this so lately flourish and happy nation present a frightful picture and in the midst of european peace prosperity and civilization the wickedness of one prince draw down on the country he misgovern more evil than it have suffer for century from the worst effect of its foreign foe william of nassau have be accuse of have at length urge on the stadtholderess to promulgate the final edict and the resolution of the council of trent and then retire from the council of state this line of conduct may be safely admit and fairly defend by he admirer he have see the uselessness of remonstrance against the intention of the king every possible means have be try without effect to soften he pitiless heart to the suffering of the country at length the moment come when the people have reach that pitch of despair which be the great force of the oppressed and william feel that they strength be now equal to the contest he have long foresee it be therefore absurd to accuse he of artifice in the exercise of that wisdom which rarely fail he on any important crisis a change of circumstance give a new name to action and motive and it would be hard to blame william of nassau for the only point in which he bear the least resemblance to philip of spain -- that depth of penetration which the latter turn to every base and the former to every noble purpose up to the present moment the prince of orange and the count egmont and horn with they partisan and friend have sincerely desire the public peace and act in the common interest of the king and the people but all the noble have not act with the same constitutional moderation many of those disappoint on personal account other profess the new doctrine and the rest variously affect by manifold motive form a body of violent and sometimes of imprudent malcontent the marriage of alexander prince of parma son of the stadtholderess which be at this time celebrate at brussels bring together a immense number of these dissatisfied noble who become thus draw into closer connection and whose national candor be more than usually bring out in the confidential intercourse of society politics and patriotism be the common subject of conversation in the various convivial meeting that take place two german noble count holle and schwarzemberg at that period in the netherland loudly proclaim the favorable disposition of the prince of the empire toward the belgian it be suppose even thus early that negotiation have be open with several of those sovereign in short nothing seem want but a leader to give consistency and weight to the confederacy which be as yet but in embryo this be doubly furnished in the person of loui of nassau and henry de brederode the former brother of the prince of orange be possess of many of those brilliant quality which mark man as worthy of distinction in time of peril educate at geneva he be passionately attach to the reform religion and identify in he hatred the catholic church and the tyranny of spain brave and impetuous he be to he elder brother but as a adventurous partisan compare with a sagacious general he love william as well as he do they common cause and he life be devote to both henry de brederode lord of vienen and marquis of utrecht be descend from the ancient count of holland this illustrious origin which in he own eye form a high claim to distinction have not procure he any of those employment or dignity which he consider he due he be presumptuous and rash and rather a fluent speaker than a eloquent orator loui of nassau be thoroughly inspire by the justice of the cause he espouse de brederode espouse it for the glory of become its champion the first only wish for action the latter long for distinction but neither the enthusiasm of nassau nor the vanity of de brederode be ally with those superior attribute require to form a hero the confederation acquire its perfect organization in the month of February 1566 on the tenth of which month its celebrated manifesto be sign by its numerous adherent the first name affix to this document be that of philip de marnix lord of st aldegonde from whose pen it emanate a man of great talent both as soldier and writer number of the nobility follow he on this muster-roll of patriotism and many of the most zealous royalist be among they this remarkable proclamation of general feeling consist chiefly in a powerful reprehension of the illegal establishment of the inquisition in the low country and a solemn obligation on the member of the confederacy to unite in the common cause against this detest nuisance man of all rank and class offer they signature and several catholic priest among the rest the prince of orange and the count egmont horn and meghem decline become actual party to this bold measure and when the question be debate as to the most appropriate way of present a address to the stadtholderess these nobleman advise the mildest and most respectful demeanor on the part of the purpose deputation at the first intelligence of these proceedings the duchess of parma absorb by terror have no resource but to assemble hastily such member of the council of state as be at brussels and she entreat by the most pressing letter the prince of orange and count horn to resume they place at this council but three course of conduct seem applicable to the emergency : to take up arm to grant the demand of the confederate or to temporize and to amuse they with a feint of moderation until the order of the king might be obtain from spain it be not however till after a lapse of four month that the council finally meet to deliberate on these important question and during this long interval at such a crisis the confederate gain constant accession to they number and completely consolidate they plan the opinion in the council be greatly divide as to the mode of treatment toward those whom one party consider as patriot act in they constitutional rights and the other as rebel in open revolt against the king the prince of orange and de berlaimont be the principal leader and chief speaker on either side but the reasoning of the former back by the urgency of event carry the majority of the suffrage and a promise redress of grievance be agree on beforehand as the anticipated answer to the come demand even while the council of state hold its sitting the report be spread through brussels that the confederate be approach and at length they do enter the city to the amount of some hundred of the representative of the first family in the country on the follow day the 5th of April 1566 they walk in solemn procession to the palace they demeanor be highly impose from they mingled air of forbearance and determination all brussels throng out to gaze and sympathize with this extraordinary spectacle of man whose resolute step show they be no common suppliant but whose modest bearing have none of the seditious air of faction the stadtholderess receive the distinguished petitioner with courtesy listen to they detail of grievance and return a moderate conciliatory but evasive answer the confederation which owe its birth to and be cradle in social enjoyment be consolidate in the midst of a feast the day follow this first deputation to the stadtholderess de brederode give a grand repast to he associate in the hotel de culembourg three hundred guest be present inflamed by joy and hope they spirit rise high under the influence of wine and temperance give way to temerity in the midst of they carouse some of the member remark that when the stadtholderess receive the write petition count berlaimont observe to she that she have nothing to fear from such a band of beggar -lrb- _ tas_de_gueux _ -rrb- the fact be that many of the confederate be from individual extravagance and mismanagement reduce to such a state of poverty as to justify in some sort the sarcasm the chief of the company be at that very moment debate on the name which they should choose for this patriotic league the title of gueux be instantly propose and adopt with acclamation the reproach it be originally intend to convey become neutralize as its general application to man of all rank and fortune conceal its effect as a stigma on many to whom it might be seriously applied neither be example want of the most absurd and apparently dishonor nickname be elsewhere adopt by powerful political party long live the gueux be the toast give and tumultuously drunk by this mad-brained company and brederode setting no bound to the boisterous excitement which follow procure immediately and sling across he shoulder a wallet such as be worn by pilgrim and beggar drink to the health of all present in a wooden cup or porringer and loudly swear that he be ready to sacrifice he fortune and life for the common cause each man pass round the bowl which he first put to he lip repeat the oath and thus pledge himself to the compact the wallet next go the round of the whole assembly and be finally hang upon a nail drive into the wall for the purpose and gaze on with such enthusiasm as the emblem of political or religious faith however worthless or absurd never fail to inspire in the mind of enthusiast the tumult cause by this ceremony so ridiculous in itself but so sublime in its result attract to the spot the prince of orange and count egmont and horn whose presence be universally attribute by the historian to accident but which be probably that kind of chance that lead medical practitioner in we day to the field where a duel be fight they enter and brederode who do the honor of the mansion force they to be seat and to join in the festivity the following be egmont 's account of they conduct : we drink a single glass of wine each to shout of ` long live the king long live the gueux ' it be the first time i have hear the confederacy so name and i avow that it displeased I but the time be so critical that people be oblige to tolerate many thing contrary to they inclination and i believe myself on this occasion to act with perfect innocence the appearance of three such distinguished personage heighten the general excitement and the most important assemblage that have for century meet together in the netherland mingle the discussion of affair of state with all the burlesque extravagance of a debauch but this frantic scene do not finish the affair what they resolve on while drunk they prepare to perform when sober rally sign and watchword be adopt and soon display it be think that nothing better suit the occasion than the immediate adoption of the costume as well as the title of beggary in a very few day the city street be fill with man in gray cloak fashion on the model of those use by mendicant and pilgrim each confederate cause this uniform to be worn by every member of he family and replace with it the livery of he servant several fasten to they girdle or they sword-hilt small wooden drinking-cup clasp-knife and other symbol of the beg fraternity while all soon wear on they breast a medal of gold or silver represent on one side the effigy of philip with the word faithful to the king and on the reverse two hand clasp with the motto jusqu ' à la besace -lrb- even to the wallet -rrb- from this origin arise the application of the word gueux in its political sense as common to all the inhabitant of the netherland who embrace the cause of the reformation and take up arm against they tyrant have present two subsequent remonstrance to the stadtholderess and obtain some console promise of moderation the chief confederate quit brussels leave several director to sustain they cause in the capital while they themselves spread into the various province exciting the people to join the legal and constitutional resistance with which they be resolve to oppose the march of bigotry and despotism a new form of edict be now decide on by the stadtholderess and she council and after various insidious and illegal but successful trick the consent of several of the province be obtain to the adoption of measure that under a guise of comparative moderation be little less abominable than those command by the king these be formally sign by the council and despatch to spain to receive philip 's sanction and thus acquire the force of law the embassy to madrid be confide to the marquis of bergen and the baron de montigny the latter of whom be brother to count horn and have formerly be employ on a like mission montigny appear to have have some qualm of apprehension in undertake this new office he good genius seem for a while to stand between he and the fate which await he a accident which happen to he colleague allow a excuse for retard he journey but the stadtholderess urge he away : he set out and reach he destination not to defend the cause of he country at the foot of the throne but to perish a victim to he patriotism the situation of the patriot lord be at this crisis peculiarly embarrass the conduct of the confederate be so essentially tantamount to open rebellion that the prince of orange and he friend find it almost impossible to preserve a neutrality between the court and the people all they wish urge they to join at once in the public cause but they be restrain by a linger sense of loyalty to the king whose employment they still hold and whose confidence they be therefore nominally suppose to share they seem reduce to the necessity of come to a explanation and perhaps a premature rupture with the government of join in the harsh measure it be likely to adopt against those with whose proceedings they sympathize or as a last alternative to withdraw as they have do before wholly from all interference in public affair still they presence in the council of state be even though they influence have greatly decrease of vast service to the patriot in check the hostility of the court and the confederate on the other hand be restrain from act of open violence by fear of the disapprobation of these they best and most powerful friend be they individual motive of reasoning what they might they at length adopt the alternative above allude to and resign they place count horn retire to he estate count egmont repair to aix-la-chapelle under the pretext of be order thither by he physician the prince of orange remain for a while at brussels in the meanwhile the confederation gain ground every day its measure have totally change the face of affair in all part of the nation the general discontent now acquire stability and consequent importance the chief merchant of many of the town enrol themselves in the patriot band many active and ardent mind hitherto withhold by the doubtful construction of the association now freely enter into it when it take the form of union and respectability energy if not excess seem legitimatize the vanity of the leader be flatter by the consequence they acquire and weak mind gladly embrace a occasion of mix with those whose importance give both protection and concealment to they insignificance a occasion so favorable for the rapid promulgation of the new doctrine be promptly take advantage of by the french huguenot and they protestant brethren of germany the disciple of reform pour from all quarter into the low country and make prodigious progress with all the energy of proselyte and too often with the fury of fanatic the three principal sect into which the reformer be divide be those of the anabaptist the calvinist and the lutheran the first and least numerous be chiefly establish in friesland the second be spread over the eastern province they doctrine be already admit into some kingdom of the north they be protect by the most powerful prince of the empire the third and by far the most numerous and wealthy abound in the southern province and particularly in flander they be support by the zealous effort of french swiss and german minister and they dogma be nearly the same with those of the established religion of england the city of antwerp be the central point of union for the three sect but the only principle they hold in common be they hatred against popery the inquisition and spain the stadtholderess have now issue order to the chief magistrate to proceed with moderation against the heretic order which be obey in they most ample latitude by those to whose sympathy they be so congenial until then the protestant be satisfy to meet by stealth at night but under this negative protection of the authority they now boldly assemble in public field-preaching commence in flander and the minister who first set this example be herman stricker a convert monk a native of overyssel a powerful speaker and a bold enthusiast he soon draw together a audience of seven thousand person a furious magistrate rush among this crowd and hope to disperse they sword in hand but he be soon strike down mortally wound with a shower of stone irritated and embolden by this rash attempt the protestant assemble in still greater number near alost but on this occasion they appear with poniard gun and halberd they intrench themselves under the protection of wagon and all sort of obstacle to a sudden attack place outpost and vidette and thus take the field in the doubly dangerous aspect of fanaticism and war similar assembly soon spread over the whole of flander inflamed by the exhortation of stricker and another preacher call peter dathen of poperingue it be calculate that fifteen thousand man attend at some of these preaching while a third apostle of calvinism ambrose ville a frenchman successfully excite the inhabitant of tournay valencienne and antwerp to form a common league for the promulgation of they faith the sudden appearance of de brederode at the latter place decide they plan and give the courage to fix on a day for its execution a immense assemblage simultaneously quit the three city at a pre-concerted time and when they unite they force at the appoint rendezvous the preaching exhortation and psalm-singing commence under the auspices of several huguenot and german minister and continue for several day in all the zealous extravagance which may be well imagine to characterize such a scene the citizen of antwerp be terrify for the safety of the place and courier after courier be despatch to the stadtholderess at brussels to implore she presence the duchess not daring to take such a step without the authority of the king send count meghem as she representative with proposal to the magistrate to call out the garrison the populace soon understand the object of this messenger and assail he with a violent outcry force he to fly from the city then the calvinist petition the magistrate for permission to openly exercise they religion and for the grant of a temple in which to celebrate its rite the magistrate in this conjuncture renew they application to the stadtholderess and entreat she to send the prince of orange as the only person capable of save the city from destruction the duchess be force to adopt this bitter alternative and the prince after repeat refusal to mix again in public affair yield at length less to the supplication of the stadtholderess than to he own wish to do another service to the cause of he country at half a league from the city he be meet by de brederode with a immense concourse of people of all sect and opinion who hail he as a protector from the tyranny of the king and a savior from the danger of they own excess nothing could exceed the wisdom the firmness and the benevolence with which he manage all conflict interest and preserved tranquillity amid a chaos of oppose prejudice and passion from the first establishment of the field-preaching the stadtholderess have implore the confederate lord to aid she for the re-establishment of order de brederode seize this excuse for convoke a general meeting of the associate which consequently take place at the town of st trond in the district of liege full two thousand of the member appear on the summons the language hold in this assembly be much stronger and less equivocal than that formerly use the delay in the arrival of the king 's answer presage ill as to he intention while the rapid growth of the public power seem to mark the present as the time for successfully demand all that the people require several of the catholic member still royalist at heart be shock to hear a total liberty of conscience speak of as one of the privilege seek for the young count of mansfield among other withdraw immediately from the confederation and thus the first stone seem to be remove from this imperfectly construct edifice the prince of orange and count egmont be apply to and appoint by the stadtholderess with full power to treat with the confederate twelve of the latter among whom be loui of nassau de brederode and de culembourg meet they by appointment at duffle a village not far from mechlin the result of the conference be a respectful but firm address to the stadtholderess repel she accusation of have enter into foreign treaty declare they readiness to march against the french troops should they set foot in the country and claim with the utmost force of reasoning the convocation of the states-general this be reply to by a entreaty that they would still wait patiently for

then at segovium assemble he council consist of the duke of alva and eight other grandee the two deputy from the netherland attend at the deliberation which be hold for several successive day but the king be never present the whole state of affair be debate with what appear a calm and dispassionate view consider the hostile prejudice of this council it be decide to advise the king to adopt generally a more moderate line of conduct in the netherland and to abolish the inquisition at the same time prohibit under the most awful threat all confederation assemblage or public preaching under any pretext whatever the king 's first care on receive this advice be to order in all the principal town of spain and the netherland prayer and procession to implore the divine approbation on the resolution which he have form he appear then in person at the council of state and issue a decree by which he refuse he consent to the convocation of the states-general and bind himself to take several german regiment into he pay he order the duchess of parma by a private letter to immediately cause to be raise three thousand cavalry and ten thousand foot and he remit to she for this purpose

the adoption of the moderation recommend to he but he consent to the abolition of the inquisition in its most odious sense re-establish that modify species of ecclesiastical tyranny which have be introduce into the netherland by charle v the people of that devoted country be thus successful in obtain one important concession from the king and in meeting unexpected consideration from this spanish council whether these measure have be calculate with a view to they failure it be not now easy to determine at all event they come too late when philip 's letter reach brussels the iconoclast or image-breaker be abroad it require no profound research to comprehend the impulse which lead a horde of fanatic to the most monstrous excess that the deed of the iconoclast arise from the spontaneous outburst of mere vulgar fury admit of no doubt the aspersion which would trace those deed to the meeting of st trond and fix the infamy on the body of nobility there assemble be scarcely worthy of refutation the very lowest of the people be the actor as well as the author of the outrage which be at once shocking to every friend of liberty and injurious to that sacred cause artoi and western flander be the scene of the first exploit of the iconoclast a band of peasant intermix with beggar and various other vagabond to the amount of about three hundred urge by fanaticism and those baser passion which animate every lawless body of man arm with hatchet club and hammer force open the door of some of the village church in the neighborhood of st omer and tear down and destroy not only the image and relic of saint but those very ornament which christian of all sect hold sacred and essential to the most simple rite of religion the city of ypre lille and other place of importance be soon subject to similar visitation and the whole of flander be in a few day ravage by furious multitude whose frantic energy spread terror and destruction on they route antwerp be protect for a while by the presence of the prince of orange but a order from the stadtholderess have oblige he to repair to brussels a few night after he departure the celebrated cathedral share the fate of many a minor temple and be utterly pillage the blind fury of the spoiler be not confine to the mere effigy which they consider the type of idolatry nor even to the picture the vase the sixty-six altar and they richly work accessory but it be equally fatal to the splendid organ which be consider the finest at that time in existence the rapidity and the order with which this torch-light scene be act without a single accident among the numerous doer have excite the wonder of almost all its early historian one of they do not hesitate to ascribe the miracle to the absolute agency of demon for three day and night these revolting scene be act and every church in the city share the fate of the cathedral which next to st peter 's at rome be the most magnificent in christendom ghent tournay valencienne mechlin and other city be next the theater of similar excess and in a incredibly short space of time above four hundred church be pillage in flander and brabant zealand utrecht and other of the northern province suffer more or less friesland guelder and holland alone escape and even the latter but in partial instance these terrible scene extinguish every hope of reconciliation with the king a inveterate and interminable hatred be now establish between he and the people for the whole nation be identify with deed which be in reality only share by the most base and be loathsome to all who be enlighten it be in vain that the patriot noble might hope or strive to exclupate themselves they be sure to be hold criminal either in fact or by implication no show of loyalty no effort to restore order no personal sacrifice could save they from the hatred or screen they from the vengeance of philip the affright of the stadtholderess during the short reign of anarchy and terror be without bound she strive to make she escape from brussels and be restrain from so do only by the joint solicitation of viglius and the various knight of the order of the golden fleece consist of the first among the noble of all party but in fact a species of violence be use to restrain she from this most fatal step for viglius give order that the gate of the city should be shut and egress refuse to anyone belong to the court the somewhat less terrify duchess now name count mansfield governor of the town reinforce the garrison order arm to be distribute to all she adherent and then call a council to deliberate on the measure to be adopt a compromise with the confederate and the reformer be unanimously agree to the prince of orange and count egmont and horn be once more appoint to this arduous arbitration between the court and the people necessity now extort almost every concession which have be so long deny to justice and prudence the confederate be declare absolved from all responsibility relative to they proceedings the suppression of the inquisition the abolition of the edict against heresy and a permission for the preaching be simultaneously publish the confederate on they side undertake to remain faithful to the service of the king to do they best for the establishment of order and to punish the iconoclast a regular treaty to this effect be draw up and execute by the respective plenipotentiary and formally approve by the stadtholderess who affix she sign-manual to the instrument she only consent to this measure after a long struggle and with tear in she eye and it be with a tremble hand that she write a account of these transaction to the king soon after this the several governor repair to they respective province and they effort for the re-establishment of tranquillity be attend with various degree of success several of the ringleader in the late excess be execute and this severity be not confine to the partisan of the catholic church the prince of orange and count egmont with other of the patriot lord set the example of this just severity john casambrot lord of beckerzeel egmont 's secretary and a lead member of the confederation put himself at the head of some other of the associate gentleman fall upon a refractory band of iconoclast near gramont in flander and take thirty prisoner of whom he order twenty-eight to be hang on the spot chapter ix to the administration of requesen ad 1566 -- 1573 all the service just relate in the common cause of the country and the king produce no effect on the vindictive spirit of the latter neither the lapse of time the proof of repentance nor the fulfilment of they duty could efface the hatred excite by a conscientious opposition to even one design of despotism philip be ill at segovium when he receive account of the excess of the image-breaker and of the convention conclude with the heretic despatch from the stadtholderess with private advice from viglius egmont mansfield meghem de berlaimont and other give he ample information as to the real state of thing and they thus strive to palliate they have accede to the convention the emperor even write to he royal nephew implore he to treat he wayward subject with moderation and offer he mediation between they philip though severely suffer give great attention to the detail of this correspondence which he minutely examine and lay before he council of state with note and observation take by himself but he take special care to send to they only such part as he choose they to be well inform upon he natural distrust not suffer he to have any confidential communication with man again the spanish council appear to have interfere between the people of the netherland and the enmity of the monarch and the offer mediation of the emperor be recommend to he acceptance to avoid the appearance of a forced concession to the popular will philip be also strongly urge to repair to the scene of the disturbance and a main question of debate be whether he should march at the head of a army or confide himself to the loyalty and good faith of he belgian subject but the indolence or the pride of philip be too strong to admit of he take so vigorous a measure and all these consultation end in two letter to the stadtholderess in the first he declare he firm intention to visit the netherland in person refuse to convoke the states-general pass in silence the treaty conclude with the protestant and the confederate and finish by a declaration that he would throw himself wholly on the fidelity of the country in he second letter mean for the stadtholderess alone he authorize she to assemble the states-general if public opinion become too powerful for resistance but on no account to let it transpire that he have under any circumstance give he consent during these deliberation in spain the protestant in the netherland amply avail themselves of the privilege they have gain they erect numerous wooden church with incredible activity young and old noble and plebeian of these energetic man assist in the manual labor of these occupation and the woman freely apply the produce of they ornament and jewel to forward the pious work but the furious outrage of the iconoclast have do infinite mischief to both political and religious freedom many of the catholic and particularly the priest gradually withdraw themselves from the confederacy which thus lose some of its most firm supporter and on the other hand the severity with which some of its member pursue the guilty offended and alarm the body of the people who could not distinguish the shades of difference between the love of liberty and the practice of licentiousness the stadtholderess and she satellite adroitly take advantage of this state of thing to sow dissension among the patriot autograph letter from philip to the principal lord be distribute among they with such artful and mysterious precaution as to throw the rest into perplexity and give each suspicion of the other 's fidelity the report of the immediate arrival of philip have also considerable effect over the less resolute or more selfish and the confederation be dissolve rapidly under the operation of intrigue self-interest and fear even the count of egmont be not proof against the subtle seduction of the wily monarch whose severe yet flattering letter half frightened and half soothe he into a relapse of royalism but with the prince of orange philip have no chance of success it be unquestionable that be he means of acquire information what they might he do succeed in procure minute intelligence of all that be go on in the king 's most secret council he have from time to time procured copy of the stadtholderess 's despatch but the document which throw the most important light upon the real intention of philip be a confidential epistle to the stadtholderess from d'alava the spanish minister at paris in which he speak in term too clear to admit any doubt as to the terrible example which the king be resolve to make among the patriot lord bergen and montigny confirm this by the account they send home from madrid of the alteration in the manner with which they be treat by philip and he courtier and the prince of orange be more firmly decide in he opinion of the come vengeance of the tyrant william summon he brother loui the count egmont horn and hoogstraeten to a secret conference at termonde and he there submit to they this letter of alava 's with other which he have receive from spain confirmatory of he worst fear loui of nassau vote for open and instant rebellion william recommend a cautious observance of the project of government not doubt but a fair pretext would be soon give to justify the most vigorous overt act of revolt but egmont at once strike a death-blow to the energetic project of one brother and the cautious amendment of the other by declare he present resolution to devote himself wholly to the service of the king and on no inducement whatever to risk the peril of rebellion he express he perfect reliance on the justice and the goodness of philip when once he should see the determine loyalty of those whom he have hitherto have so much reason to suspect and he extort the other to follow he example the two brother and count horn implore he in they turn to abandon this blind reliance on the tyrant but in vain he new and unlooked-for profession of faith completely paralyze they plan he possess too largely the confidence of both the soldiery and the people to make it possible to attempt any serious measure of resistance in which he would not take a part the meeting break up without come to any decision all those who bear a part in it be expect at brussels to attend the council of state egmont alone repair thither the stadtholderess question he on the object of the conference at termonde : he only reply by a indignant glance at the same time present a copy of alava 's letter the stadtholderess now apply she whole effort to destroy the union among the patriot lord she in the meantime order levy of troops to the amount of some thousand the command of which be give to the noble on whose attachment she could reckon the most vigorous measure be adopt noircarme governor of hainault appear before valencienne which be in the power of the calvinist have assume a most determine attitude of resistance he vainly summon the place to submission and to admit a royalist garrison and on receive a obstinate refusal he commence the siege in form a undisciplined rabble of between three thousand and four thousand gueux under the direction of john de soreas gather together in the neighborhood of lille and tournay with a show of attack these place but the governor of the former town disperse one party of they and noircarme surprise and almost destroy the main body -- they leader fall in the action these be the first encounter of the civil war which rage without cessation for upward of forty year in these devoted country and which be universally allow to be the most remarkable that ever desolate any isolate portion of europe the space which we have already give to the cause which produce this memorable revolution now actually commence will not allow we to do more than rapidly sketch the fierce event that succeed each other with frightful rapidity while valencienne prepare for a vigorous resistance a general synod of the protestant be hold at antwerp and de brederode undertake a attempt to see the stadtholderess and lay before she the complaint of this body but she refuse to admit he into the capital he then address to she a remonstrance in write in which he reproach she with she violation of the treaty on the faith of which the confederate have disperse and the majority of the protestant lay down they arm he implore she to revoke the new proclamation by which she prohibit they from the free exercise of they religion and above all thing he insist on the abandonment of the siege of valencienne and the disbanding of the new levy the stadtholderess 's reply be one of haughty reproach and defiance the gauntlet be now throw down no possible hope of reconciliation remain and the whole country fly to arm a sudden attempt on the part of the royalist under count meghem against bois-le-duc be repulse by eight hundred man command by a officer name bomberg in the immediate service of de brederode who have fortify himself in he garrison town of vienen the prince of orange maintain at antwerp a attitude of extreme firmness and caution he time for action have not yet arrive but he advice and protection be of infinite importance on many occasion john de marnix lord of toulouse brother of philip de st aldegonde take possession of osterweel on the scheldt a quarter of a league from antwerp and fortify himself in a strong position but he be impetuously attack by the count de lannoy with a considerable force and perish after a desperate defense with full one thousand of he follower three hundred who lay down they arm be immediately after the action butcher in cold blood antwerp be on this occasion save from the excess of its divide and furious citizen and preserve from the horror of pillage by the calmness and intrepidity of the prince of orange valencienne at length capitulate to the royalist dishearten by the defeat and death of de marnix and terrify by a bombardment of thirty-six hour the governor two preacher and about forty of the citizen be hang by the victor and the reform religion prohibit noircarme promptly follow up he success maestricht turnhout and bois-le-duc submit at he approach and the insurgent be soon drive from all the province holland alone except brederode flee to germany where he die the following year the stadtholderess show in she success no small proof of decision she and she counsellor act under order from the king be resolve on embarrassing to the utmost the patriot lord and a new oath of allegiance to be propose to every functionary of the state be consider as a certain means for attain this object without the violence of a unmerited dismissal the term of this oath be strongly oppose to every principle of patriotism and toleration count mansfield be the first of the noble who take it the duke of arschot count meghem berlaimont and egmont follow he example the count of horn hoogstraeten de brederode and other refuse on various pretext every artifice and persuasion be try to induce the prince of orange to subscribe to this new test but he resolution have be for some time form he see that every chance of constitutional resistance to tyranny be for the present at a end the time for petition be go by the confederation be dissolve a royalist army be in the field the duke of alva be notoriously approach at the head of another more numerous it be worse than useless to conclude a hollow convention with the stadtholderess of mock loyalty on he part and mock confidence on hers many other important consideration convinced william that he only honorable safe and wise course be to exile himself from the netherland altogether until more propitious circumstance allow of he act openly boldly and with effect before he put this plan of voluntary banishment into execution he and egmont have a parting interview at the village of willebroek between antwerp and brussels count mansfield and bertus secretary to the stadtholderess be present at this memorable meeting the detail of what pass be report to the confederate by one of they party who contrived to conceal himself in the chimney of the chamber nothing could exceed the energetic warmth with which the two illustrious friend reciprocally endeavor to turn each other from they respective line of conduct but in vain egmont 's fatal confidence in the king be not to be shake nor be nassau 's penetrate mind to be deceive by the romantic delusion which lead away he friend they separate with most affectionate expression and nassau be even move to tear he parting word be to the following effect : confide then since it must be so in the gratitude of the king but a painful presentiment -lrb- god grant it may prove a false one -rrb- tell I that you will serve the spaniard as the bridge by which they will enter the country and which they will destroy as soon as they have pass over it on the 11th of April a few day after this conference the prince of orange set out for germany with he three brother and he whole family with the exception of he eldest son philip william count de beuren whom he leave behind a student in the university of louvain he believe that the privilege of the college and the franchise of brabant would prove a sufficient protection to the youth and this appear the only instance in which william 's vigilant prudence be deceive the departure of the prince seem to remove all hope of protection or support from the unfortunate protestant now leave the prey of they implacable tyrant the confederation of the noble be completely break up the count of hoogstraeten bergen and culembourg follow the example of the prince of orange and escape to germany and the greater number of those who remain behind take the new oath of allegiance and become reconcile to the government this total dispersion of the confederacy bring all the town of holland into obedience to the king but the emigration which immediately commence threaten the country with ruin england and germany swarm with dutch and belgian refugee and all the effort of the stadtholderess could not restrain the thousand that take to flight she be not more successful in she attempt to influence the measure of the king she implore he in repeat letter to abandon he design of send a foreign army into the country which she represent as be now quite reduce to submission and tranquillity she add that the mere report of this royal invasion -lrb- so to call it -rrb- have already deprive the netherland of many thousand of its best inhabitant and that the appearance of the troops would change it into a desert these argument mean to dissuade be the very mean of encourage philip in he design he conceive he project to be now ripe for the complete suppression of freedom and alva soon begin he march on the 5th of may 1567 this celebrated captain whose reputation be so quickly destine to sink into the notoriety of a executioner begin he memorable march and on the 22d of August he with he two natural son and he veteran army consist of about fifteen thousand man arrive at the wall of brussels the discipline observe on this march be a terrible forewarning to the people of the netherland of the influence of the general and the obedience of the troops they have little chance of resistance against such soldier so command several of the belgian nobility go forward to meet alva to render he the accustomed honor and endeavor thus early to gain he good grace among they be the infatuated egmont who make a present to alva of two superb horse which the latter receive with a disdainful air of condescension alva 's first care be the distribution of he troops -- several thousand of whom be place in antwerp ghent and other important town and the remainder reserve under he own immediate order at brussels he approach be celebrate by universal terror and he arrival be thoroughly humiliating to the duchess of parma he immediately produce he commission as commander-in-chief of the royal army in the netherland but he next show she another which confide to he power infinitely more extended than any marguerite herself have enjoy and which prove to she that the almost sovereign power over the country be virtually vest in he alva first turn he attention to the seizure of those patriot lord whose pertinacious infatuation leave they within he reach he summon a meeting of all the member of the council of state and the knight of the order of the golden fleece to deliberate on matter of great importance count egmont and horn attend among many other and at the conclusion of the council they be both arrest -lrb- some historian assert by the hand of alva and he eldest son -rrb- as be also van straeten burgomaster of antwerp and casambrot egmont 's secretary the young count of mansfield appear for a moment at this meeting but warn by he father of the fate intend he as a original member of the confederation he have time to fly the count of hoogstraeten be happily detain by illness and thus escape the fate of he friend egmont and horn be transfer to the citadel of ghent under a escort of three thousand spanish soldier several other person of the first family be arrest and those who have originally be take in arm be execute without delay -lrb- illustration : storm the barricade at brussels during the revolution of 1848 -rrb- the next measure of the new governor be the reestablishment of the inquisition the promulgation of the decree of the council of trent the revocation of the duchess of parma 's edict and the royal refusal to recognize the term of she treaty with the protestant he immediately establish a special tribunal compose of twelve member with full power to inquire into and pronounce judgment on every circumstance connect with the late trouble he name himself president of this council and appoint a spaniard name varga as vice-president -- a wretch of the most diabolical cruelty several other of the judge be also spaniard in direct infraction of the fundamental law of the country this council immortalize by its infamy be name by the new governor -lrb- for so alva be in fact though not yet in name -rrb- the council of trouble by the people it be soon design the council of blood in its atrocious proceedings no respect be pay to title contract or privilege however sacred its judgment be without appeal every subject of the state be amenable to its summons clergy and laity the first individual of the country as well as the most wretched outcast of society its decree be pass with disgusting rapidity and contempt of form contumacy be punish with exile and confiscation those who strong in innocence dare to brave a trial be lose without resource the accuse be force to its bar without previous warn many a wealthy citizen be drag to trial four league ' distance tie to a horse 's tail the number of victim be appalling on one occasion the town of valencienne alone see fifty-five of its citizen fall by the hand of the executioner hang beheading quartering and burning be the every-day spectacles the enormous confiscation only add to the thirst for gold and blood by which alva and he satellite be parched history offer no example of parallel horror for while party vengeance on other occasion have lead to scene of fury and terror they arise in this instance from the vilest cupidity and the most cold-blooded cruelty after three month of such atrocity alva fatigue rather than satiated with butchery resign he hateful function wholly into the hand of varga who be chiefly aid by the member delrio and delum torre even at this remote period we can not repress the indignation excite by the mention of those monster and it be impossible not to feel satisfaction in fix upon they name the brand of historic execration one of these wretch call hesselt use at length to sleep during the mock trial of the already doom victim and as often as he be rouse up by he colleague he use to cry out mechanically to the gibbet to the gibbet so familiar be he tongue with the sound of condemnation the despair of the people may be imagine from the fact that until the end of the year 1567 they only consolation be the prospect of the king 's arrival he never dream of come even the delight of feast in horror like these could not conquer he indolence the good duchess of parma -- for so she be in comparison with she successor -- be not long leave to oppose the feeble barrier of she prayer between alva and he victim she demand she dismissal from the nominal dignity which be now but a title of disgrace philip grant it readily accompany by a hypocritical letter a present of thirty thousand crown and the promise of a annual pension of twenty thousand more she leave brussels in the month of April 1568 raise to a high place in the esteem and gratitude of the people less by any actual claim from she own conduct than by its fortuitous contrast with the infamy of she successor she retire to italy and die at naple in the month of February 1586 ferdinand alvarez de toledo duke of alva be of a distinguished family in spain and even boast of he descent from one of the moorish monarch who have reign in the insignificant kingdom of toledo when he assume the chief command in the netherland he be sixty year of age have grow old and obdurate in pride ferocity and avarice he deed must stand instead of a more detailed portrait which to be thoroughly striking should be trace with a pen dip in blood he be a fierce and clever soldier bring up in the school of charle v and train to he profession in the war of that monarch in germany and subsequently in that of philip ii against france in addition to the horror act by the council of blood alva commit many deed of collateral but minor tyranny among other he issue a decree forbid under severe penalty any inhabitant of the country to marry without he express permission he furious edict against emigration be attempt to be enforce in vain elizabeth of england open all the port of she kingdom to the flemish refugee who carry with they those abundant store of manufacture knowledge which she wisely know to be the element of national wealth alva soon summon the prince of orange he brother and all the confederate lord to appear before the council and answer to the charge of high treason the prince give a prompt and contemptuous answer deny the authority of alva and he council and acknowledge for he judge only the emperor whose vassal he be or the king of spain in person as president of the order of the golden fleece the other lord make reply nearly similar the trial of each be therefore proceed on by contumacy confiscation of property be a object almost as dear to the tyrant viceroy as the death of he victim judgment be promptly pronounce against those present or absent alive or dead witness the case of the unfortunate marquess of bergue who have previously expire at madrid as be universally believe by poison and he equally ill-fated colleague in the embassy the baron montigny be for a while imprison at segovium where he be soon after secretly behead on the base pretext of former disaffection the departure of the duchess of parma have leave alva undisputed as well as unlimited authority he proceed rapidly in he terrible career the count of beuren be seize at louvain and send prisoner to madrid and wherever it be possible to lay hand on a suspect patriot the occasion be not neglect it would be a revolting task to enter into a minute detail of all the horror commit and impossible to record the name of the victim who so quickly fall before alva 's insatiate cruelty the people be drive to frenzy band of wretch flee to the wood and marsh whence

make himself master of the town of tongre and st trond and the whole province of liege be in he power he advance boldly against alva and for several month do all that manoeuvring could do to force he to a battle but the wily veteran know he trade too well he feel sure that in time the prince 's force would disperse for want of pay and supplies and he manage he resource so ably that with little risk and scarcely any loss he finally succeed in he object in the month of October the prince find himself force to disband he large but undisciplined force and he retire into france to recruit he fund and consider on the best measure for some future enterprise the insolent triumph of alva know no bound the rest of the year be consume in new execution the hotel of culembourg the early cradle of

in brass form of the cannon take at jemminghem set up in the citadel of antwerp with various symbol of power and a inscription of inflated pride the following year be usher in by a demand of unwonted and extravagant rapacity the establishment of two tax on property personal and real to the amount of the hundredth penny -lrb- or denier -rrb- on each kind and at every transfer or sale ten per cent on personal and five per cent for real property the states-general of whom this demand be make be unanimous in they opposition as well as the minister but particularly de berlaimont and viglius alva be so irritated that he even menace the venerable president of the council but could not succeed in intimidate he he obstinately persist in he design for a considerable period resist argument and prayer and even the more likely means try for soften he cupidity by furnish he with sum from other source equivalent to those which the new tax be calculate to produce to he repeated threat against viglius the latter reply that he be convince the king would not condemn he unheard but that at any rate he gray hair save he from any ignoble fear of death a deputation be send from the states-general to philip explain the impossibility of persevere in the attempted tax which be incompatible with every principle of commercial liberty but alva would not abandon he design till he have force every province into resistance and the king himself command he to desist the event of this and the following year 1570 may be shortly sum up none of any striking interest or eventual importance have occur the suffering of the country be increase from day to day under the intolerable tyranny which bear it down the patriot attempt nothing on land but they naval force begin from this time to acquire that consistency and power which be so soon to render it the chief mean of resistance and the great source of wealth the privateer or corsair which begin to swarm from every port in holland and zealand and which find refuge in all those of england sully many gallant exploit by instance of culpable excess so much so that the prince of orange be force to withdraw the command which he have delegate to the lord of dolhain and to replace he by gislain de fienne : for already several of the exile noble and ruin merchant of antwerp and amsterdam have join these bold adventurer and purchase or build with the remnant of they fortune many vessel in which they carry on a most productive warfare against spanish commerce through the whole extent of the english channel from the mouth of the emb to the harbor of la rochelle one of those frightful inundation to which the northern province be so constantly expose occur this year carry away the dike and destroy life and properly to a considerable amount in friesland alone twenty thousand man be victim to this calamity but no suffering could affect the inflexible sternness of the duke of alva and to such excess do he carry he persecution that philip himself begin to be discontented and think he representative be overstep the bound of delegated tyranny he even reproach he sharply in some of he despatch the governor reply in the same strain and such be the effect of this correspondence that philip resolve to remove he from he command but the king 's marriage with anne of austrium daughter of the emperor maximilian oblige he to defer he intention for a while and he at length name john de la cerda duke of medina-celi for alva 's successor upward of a year however elapse before this new governor be finally appoint and he make he appearance on the coast of flander with a considerable fleet on the 11th of may 1572 he be afford on this very day a specimen of the sort of people he come to contend with for he fleet be suddenly attack by that of the patriot and many of he vessel burn and take before he eye with they rich cargo and considerable treasure intend for the service of the state the duke of medina-celi proceed rapidly to brussels where he be ceremoniously receive by alva who however refuse to resign the government under the pretext that the term of he appointment have not expire and that he be resolve first to completely suppress all symptom of revolt in the northern province he succeed in effectually disgust la cerda who almost immediately demand and obtain he own recall to spain alva leave once more in undisputed possession of he power turn it with increase vigor into new channel of oppression he be soon again employ in effort to effect the levying of he favorite tax and such be the resolution of the tradesman of brussels that sooner than submit they almost universally close they shop altogether alva furious at this measure cause sixty of the citizen to be seize and order they to be hang opposite they own door the gibbet be actually erect when on the very morning of the day fix for the execution he receive despatch that wholly disconcert he and stop they completion to avoid a open rupture with spain the queen of england have just at this time interdict the dutch and flemish privateer from take shelter in she port william de la marck count of lunoy have now the chief command of this adventurous force he be distinguish by a inveterate hatred against the spaniard and have make a wild and romantic vow never to cut he hair or beard till he have avenge the murder of egmont and horn he be impetuous and terrible in all he action and bear the surname of the wild boar of the ardenne drive out of the harbor of england he resolve on some desperate enterprise and on the 1st of April he succeed in surprising the little town of brille in the island of voorn situate between zealand and holland this insignificant place acquire great celebrity from this event which may be consider the first successful step toward the establishment of liberty and the republic alva be confound by the news of this exploit but with he usual activity he immediately turn he whole attention toward the point of greatest danger he embarrassment however become every day more considerable lunoy 's success be the signal of a general revolt in a few day every town in holland and zealand

favorable moment now enter brabant at the head of twenty thousand man compose of french german and english and make himself master of several important place while he indefatigable brother loui with a minor force suddenly appear in hainault and join by a large body of french huguenot under de genlis he seize on mon the capital of the province on the 25th of may alva turn first toward the recovery of this important place and give the command of the siege to he son frederic of toledo who be assist by the counsel of noircarme and vitellus but loui of nassau hold out for upward of three month and only surrender on a honorable capitulation in the month of September he french ally have be first entirely defeat and they brave leader de genlis take prisoner the prince of orange have in the meantime secure possession of louvain ruremonde mechlin and other town carry termonde and oudenarde by assault and make demonstration which seem to court alva once more to try the fortune of the campaign in a pitched battle but such be not william 's real intention nor do the cautious tactic of he able opponent allow he to provoke such a risk he however order he son frederic to march with all he force into holland and he soon undertake the siege of haerlem by the time that mon fall again into the power of the spaniard sixty-five town and they territory chiefly in the northern province have throw off the yoke the single port of flessingue contain one hundred and fifty patriot vessel well arm and equip and from that epoch may be date the rapid growth of the first naval power in europe with the single exception of great britain it be here worthy of remark that all the horror of which the people of flander be the victim and in they full proportion have not the effect of exciting they to revolt but they rise up with fury against the payment of the new tax they sacrifice everything sooner than pay these unjust exaction -- _ omnia_dabant _ _ ne_decimam_darant _ the next important event in these war be the siege of haerlem before which place the spaniard be arrest in they progress for seven month and which they at length succeed in take with a loss of ten thousand man the detail of this memorable siege be calculate to arouse every feeling of pity for the heroic defender and of execration against the cruel assailant a widow name kenau hasselaer gain a niche in history by she remarkable valor at the head of a battalion of three hundred of she townswoman who bear a part in all the labor and peril of the siege after the surrender and in pursuance of alva 's common system he ferocious son cause the governor and the other chief officer to be behead and upward of two thousand of the worn-out garrison and burgher be either put to the sword or tie two and two and drown in the lake which give its name to the town tergo in south beveland mechlin naerden and other town be about the same period the scene of gallant action and of subsequent cruelty of the most revolting nature as soon as they fall into the power of the spaniard strada with all he bigotry to the spanish cause admit that these excess be atrocious crime rather than just punishment : _ non_poena_sed_flagitium _ horror like these be sure to force reprisal on the part of the maddened patriot de la marck carry on he daring exploit with a cruelty which excite the indignation of the prince of orange by whom he be remove from he command the contest be for a while prosecute with a decrease of vigor proportion to the serious loss on both side money and the munitions of war begin to fail and though the spaniard succeed in take the hague they be repulse before alkmaer with great loss and they fleet be almost entirely destroy in a naval combat on the zuyder zee the count bossu they admiral be take in this fight with about three hundred of he best sailor holland be now from one end to the other the theater of the most shocking event while the people perform deed of the greatest heroism the perfidy and cruelty of the spaniard have no bound the patriot see more danger in submission than in resistance each town which be in succession subdue endure the last extremity of suffer before it yield and victory be frequently the consequence of despair this unlooked-for turn in affair decide the king to remove alva whose barbarous and rapacious conduct be now object to even by

be the instruction give to he for he government he be a honest well-meaning and moderate man and the king of spain hope that by he influence and a total change of measure he might succeed in recall the netherland to obedience but happily for the country this change be adopt too late for success and the weakness of the new government complete the glorious result which the ferocity of the former have prepare requesen perform all that depend on he to gain the confidence of the people he cause alva 's statue to be remove and hope to efface the memory of the tyrant by dissolve the council of blood and abandon the obnoxious tax which they inventor have suspend rather than abolish a general amnesty be also promulgate against the revolted province they receive it with contempt and defiance nothing then be leave to requesen but to renew the war and this he find to be a matter of no easy execution the finances be in a state of the greatest confusion and the spanish troops be in many place seditious in some openly mutinous alva have leave large arrears of pay due to almost all notwithstanding the immense amount of he pillage and extortion middleburg which have long sustain a siege against all the effort of the patriot be now nearly reduce by famine notwithstanding the gallant effort of its governor mondragon requesen turn he immediate attention to the relief of this important place and he soon assemble at antwerp and berg-op-zoom a fleet of sixty vessel for that purpose but loui boisot admiral of zealand promptly repair to attack this force and after a severe action he totally defeat it and kill de glime one of its admiral under the eye of requesen himself who accompany by he suite stand during the whole affair on the dike of schakerloo this action take place the 29th of January 1574 and on the 19th of February follow middleburg surrender after a resistance of two year the prince of orange grant such condition as be due to the bravery of the governor and thus set a example of generosity and honor which greatly change the complexion of the war all zealand be now free and the intrepid admiral boisot gain another victory on the 30th of may -- destroy several of the spanish vessel and take some other with they admiral von haemstede frequent naval enterprise be also undertake against the frontier of flander and while the naval force thus harass the enemy on every vulnerable point the unfortunate province of the interior be ravage by the mutinous and revolt spaniard and by the native brigand who pillage both royalist and patriot with atrocious impartiality to these manifold evil be now add one more terrible in the appearance of the plague which break out at ghent in the month of October and devastate a great part of the netherland not however with that violence with which it rage in more southern climate requesen overwhelm by difficulty yet exert himself to the utmost to put the best face on the affair of government he chief care be to appease the mutinous soldiery : he even cause he plate to be melt and freely give the produce toward the payment of they arrears the patriot well inform of this state of thing labor to turn it to they best advantage they open the campaign in the province of guelder where loui of nassau with he younger brother henry and the prince palatine son of the elector frederick iii appear at the head of eleven thousand man the prince of orange prepare to join he with a equal number but requesen promptly despatch sanchez d'avilum to prevent this junction the spanish commander quickly pass the meuse near nimeguen and on the 14th of April he force count loui to a battle on the great plain call mookerheyde close to the village of mook the royalist attack with they usual valor and after two hour of hard fight the confederate be totally defeat the three gallant prince be among the slay and they body be never afterward discover it have be state on doubtful authority that loui of nassau after have lie some time among the heap of dead drag himself to the side of the river meuse and while wash he wound be inhumanly murder by some straggle peasant to whom he be unknown the unfortunate fate of this enterprising prince be a severe blow to the patriot cause and a cruel affliction to the prince of orange he have now already lose three brother in the war and remain alone to revenge they fate and sustain the cause for which they have perish d'avila soon find he victory to be as fruitless as it be brilliant the ruffian troops by whom it be gain become immediately self-disbanded throw off all authority hasten to possess themselves of antwerp and threaten to proceed to the most horrible extremity if they pay be longer withhold the citizen succeed with difficulty in appease they by the sacrifice of some money in part payment of they claim requesen take advantage of they temporary calm and despatch they promptly to take part in the siege of leyden this siege form another of those numerous instance which become so memorable from the mixture of heroism and horror jean vanderdo know in literature by the name of dousa and celebrate for he latin poem command the place valdez who conduct the siege urge dousa to surrender when the latter reply in the name of the inhabitant that when provision fail they they would devour they left hand reserve the right to defend they liberty a party of the inhabitant drive to disobedience and revolt by the excess of misery to which they be shortly reduce attempt to force the burgomaster vanderwerf to supply they with bread or yield up the place but he sternly make the celebrated answer which can not be remember without shudder -- bread i have none but if my death can afford you relief tear my body in piece and let those who be most hungry devour it but in this extremity relief at last be afford by the decisive measure of the prince of orange who order all the neighbor dike to be open and the sluice raise thus sweeping away the besieger on the wave of the ocean : the inhabitant of leyden be apprise of this intention by means of letter intrust to the safe carriage of pigeon train for the purpose the inundation be no sooner effect than hundred of flat-bottomed boat bring abundance of supplies to the half-famished town while a violent storm carry the sea across the country for twenty league around and destroy the spanish camp with above one thousand soldier who be overtake by the flood this deliverance take place on the 3d of October on which day it be still annually celebrate by the descendant of the grateful citizen it be now for the first time that spain would consent to listen to advice or mediation which have for its object the termination of this frightful war the emperor maximilian ii renew at this epoch he effort with philip and under such favorable auspices conference commence at breda where the count swartzenberg and hohenloe brother-in-law of the prince of orange meet on the part of the emperor the deputy from the king of spain and the patriot and hope of a complete pacification be generally entertain but three month of deliberation prove they fallacy the patriot demand toleration for the reform religion the king 's deputy obstinately refuse it the congress be therefore break up and both oppressor and oppressed resume they arm with increase vigor and tenfold desperation requesen have long fix he eye on zealand as the scene of a expedition by which he hope to repair the failure before leyden and he cause a attempt to be make on the town of zuriczee in the island of scauwen which merit record as one of the boldest and most original enterprise of the war the little island of zealand be separate from each other by narrow branch of the sea which be fordable at low water and it be by such a passage two league in breadth and till then untried that the spanish detachment of one thousand seven hundred and fifty man under ulloa and other veteran captain advance to they exploit in the midst of danger greatly increase by a night of total darkness each man carry round he neck two pound of gunpowder with a sufficient supply of biscuit for two day and hold they sword and musket high over they head they boldly wade forward three abreast in some place up to they shoulder in water the alarm be soon give and a shower of ball be pour upon the gallant band from upward of forty boat which the zealander send rapidly toward the spot the only light afford to either party be from the flash of they gun and while the adventurer advance with undaunted firmness they equally daring assailant jump from they boat into the water attack they with oar and hooked handspike by which many of the spaniard be destroy the rearguard in this extremity cut off from they companion be oblige to retreat but the rest after a considerable loss at length reach the land and thus gain possession of the island on the night of the 28th of September 1575 requesen quickly afterward repair to the scene of this gallant exploit and commence the siege of zuriczee which he do not live to see complete after have pass the winter month in preparation for the success of this object which he have so much at heart he be recall to brussels by account of new mutiny in the spanish cavalry and the very evening before he reach the city he be attack by a violent fever which carry he off five day afterward on the 5th of march 1516 the suddenness of requesen 's illness have not allow time for even the nomination of a successor to which he be authorize by letter patent from the king it be believe that he intention be to appoint count mansfield to the command of the army and de berlaimont to the administration of civil affair the government however now devolve entirely into the hand of the council of state which be at that period compose of nine member the principal of these be philip de croi duke of arschot the other lead member be viglius count mansfield and berlaimont and the council be degrade by numbering among the rest debris and de roda two of the notorious spaniard who have form part of the council of blood the king resolve to leave the authority in the hand of this incongruous mixture until the arrival of don john of austrium he natural brother whom he have already name to the office of governor-general but in the interval the government assume a aspect of unprecedented disorder and widespread anarchy embrace the whole country the royal troops openly revolt and fight against each other like deadly enemy the noble divide in they view arrogate to themselves in different place the title and power of command public faith and private probity seem alike destroy pillage violence and ferocity be the commonplace characteristic of the time circumstance like these may be well suppose to have revive the hope of the prince of orange who quickly see amid this chaos the element of order strength and liberty such have be he previous affliction at the harrowing event which he witness and despair of be able to relieve that he have propose to the patriot of holland and zealand to destroy the dike submerge the whole country and abandon to the wave the soil which refuse security to freedom but providence destine he to be the savior instead of the destroyer of he country the chief motive of this excessive desperation have be the apparent desertion by queen elizabeth of the cause which she have hitherto so mainly assist offend at the capture of some english ship by the dutch who assert that they carry supplies for the spaniard she withdraw from they she protection but by timely submission they appease she wrath and it be think by some historian that even thus early the prince of orange propose to place the revolted province wholly under she protection this however she for the time refuse but she strongly solicit philip 's mercy for these unfortunate country through the spanish ambassador at she court in the meantime the council of state at brussels seem disposed to follow up as far as possible the plan of requesen the siege of zuriczee be continue but speedy dissension among the member of the government render they authority contemptible if not utterly extinct in the eye of the people the exhaustion of the treasury deprive they of all power to put a end to the mutinous excess of the spanish troops and the latter carry they licentiousness to the utmost bound zuriczee admit to a surrender and save from pillage by the payment of a large sum be lose to the royalist within three month from the want of discipline in its garrison and the town and burgh of brabant suffer as much from the excess of they nominal protector as could have be inflict by the enemy the mutineer at length to the number of some thousand attack and carry by force the town of alost at equal distance between brussels ghent and antwerp imprison the chief citizen and levy contribution on all the country round it be then that the council of state find itself force to proclaim they rebel traitor and enemy to the king and the country and call on all loyal subject to pursue and exterminate they wherever they be find in arm this proscription of the spanish mutineer be follow by the convocation of the states-general and the government thus hope to maintain some show of union and some chance of authority but a new scene of intestine violence complete the picture of executive inefficiency on the 4th of September the grand bailiff of brabant as lieutenant of the baron de hesse governor of brussels enter the council chamber by force and arrest all the member present on suspicion of treacherously maintain intelligence with the spaniard count mansfield and berlaimont be imprison with some other viglius escape this indignity by be absent froth indisposition this bold measure be hail by the people with unusual joy as the signal for that total change in the government which they reckon on as the prelude to complete freedom the states-general be all at this time assemble with the exception of those of flander who join the other with but little delay the general reprobation against the spaniard procure a second decree of proscription and they desperate conduct justify the utmost violence with which they might be pursue they still hold the citadel of ghent and antwerp as well as maestricht which they have seize on sack and pillage with all the fury which a barbarous enemy inflict on a town carry by assault on the 3d of November the other body of mutineer in possession of alost march to the support of they fellow brigand in the citadel of antwerp and both simultaneously attack this magnificent city become master of it in all point in spite of a vigorous resistance on the part of the citizen they then begin a scene of rapine and destruction unequalled in the annals of these desperate war more than five hundred private mansion and the splendid town-house be deliver to the flame : seven thousand citizen perish by the sword or in the water of the scheldt for three day the carnage and the pillage go on with unheard-of fury and the most opulent town in europe be thus reduce to ruin and desolation by a few thousand frantic ruffian the loss be value at above two million golden crown varga and romero be the principal leader of this infernal exploit and de roda gain a new title to he immortality of shame by stand forth as its apologist the states-general assemble at ghent be solemnly open on the 14th of September be apprehensive of a sudden attack from the spanish troops in the citadel they propose a negotiation and demand a protect force from the prince of orange who immediately enter into a treaty with they envoy and send to they assistance eight company of infantry and seventeen piece of cannon under the command of the english colonel temple in the midst of this turmoil and apparent insecurity the states-general proceed in they great work and assume the rein of government in the name of the king they allow the council of state still nominally to exist but they restrict its power far within those it have hitherto exercise and the government thus absolutely assume the form of a republic issue manifesto in justification of its conduct and demand succor from all the foreign power to complete the union between the various province it be resolve to resume the negotiation commence the preceding year at breda and the 10th of October be fix for this new congress to be hold in the town-house of ghent on the day appoint the congress open its sitting and rapidly arrive at the termination of its important object the

artillery which batter the wall of the besiege citadel it be even intend to have deliver a general assault against the place at the moment of the proclamation but the mutineer demand a capitulation and finally surrender three day afterward it be the wife of the famous mondragon who command the place in she husband 's absence and by she heroism give a new proof of the capability of the sex to

the hero of lepanto the victor of the turk the idol of christendom be destine to have he reputation and well-won laurel tarnish in the service of the insidious despotism to which he now become a instrument don john be a natural son of charle v and to fine talent and a good disposition unite the advantage of hereditary courage and a liberal education he be bear at ratisbon on the 24th of February 1543 he reputed mother be a young lady of that place name barbara blomberg but one historian state that the real parent be of a condition too elevated to have she rank betray and that to

precaution of assemble a large body of troops at wavre between brussels and namur the command of which be give to the count of lalain a still more important measure be the despatch of a envoy to england to implore the assistance of elizabeth she act on this occasion with frankness and intrepidity give a distinguished reception to the envoy de sweveghem and advance a loan of one hundred thousand pound sterling on condition that the state make no treaty without she knowledge or participation to secure still more closely the federal union that now bind the different province a new compact be conclude by the deputy on the 9th of January 1577 know by the title of the union of brussels and sign by the prelate ecclesiastic lord gentleman magistrate and other represent the estate of the netherland a copy of this act of union be transmit to don john to enable he thoroughly to understand the present state of feeling among those with whom he be now about to negotiate he maintain a general tone of great moderation throughout the conference which immediately take place and after some month of cautious parleying in the latter part of which the candor of the prince seem doubtful and which the native historian do not hesitate to stigmatize as merely assume a treaty be sign at marche-en-famenne a place between namur and luxemburg in which every point insist on by the state be to the surprise and delight of the nation fully consent to and guarantee this important document be call the perpetual edict bear date the 12th of February 1577 and contain nineteen article they be all base on the acceptance of the pacification but one expressly stipulate that the count of beuren should be set at liberty as soon as the prince of orange he father have on he part ratify the treaty don john make he solemn entry into brussels on the 1st of may and assume the function of he limited authority the condition of the treaty be promptly and regularly fulfil the citadel occupy by the spanish soldier be give up to the flemish and walloon troops and the departure of these ferocious foreigner take place at once the large sum require to facilitate this measure make it necessary to submit for a while to the presence of the german mercenary but don john 's conduct soon destroy the temporary delusion which have deceive the country whether he project be hitherto only conceal or that they be now for the first time excite by the disappointment of those hope of authority hold out to he by philip and which he predecessor have share it be certain that he very early display he ambition and very imprudently attempt to put it in force he at once demand from the council of state the command of the troops and the disposal of the revenue the answer be a simple reference to the pacification of ghent and the prince 's rejoinder be a apparent submission and the immediate despatch of letter in cipher to the king demand a supply of troops sufficient to restore he ruin authority these letter be intercept by the king of navarre afterward henry iv of france who immediately transmit they to the prince of orange he old friend and fellow-soldier public opinion to the suspicion of which don john have be from the first obnoxious be now unanimous in attribute to design all that be unconstitutional and unfair he impetuous character could no longer submit to the restraint of dissimulation and he resolve to take some bold and decide measure a very favorable opportunity be present in the arrival of the queen of navarre marguerite of valois at namur on she way to spa the prince numerously attend hasten to the former town under pretence of pay he respects to the queen as soon as she leave the place he repair to the glaci of the town as if for the mere enjoyment of a walk admire the external appearance of the citadel and express a desire to be admit inside the young count of berlaimont in the absence of he father the governor of the place and a accomplice in the plot with don john freely admit he the prince immediately draw forth a pistol and exclaim that that be the first moment of he government take possession of the place with he immediate guard and instantly form they into a devoted garrison the prince of orange immediately make public the intercept letter and at the solicitation of the states-general repair to brussels into which city he make a truly triumphant entry on the 23d of September and be immediately nominate governor protector or _ ruward _ of brabant -- a dignity which have fall into disuse but be revive on this occasion and which be little inferior in power to that of the dictator of rome he authority now almost unlimited extend over every province of the netherland except namur and luxemburg both of which acknowledge don john the first care of the liberated nation be to demolish the various citadel render celebrated and odious by the excess of the spaniard this be do with a enthusiastic industry in which every age and sex bear a part and which promise well for liberty among the ruin of that of antwerp the statue of the duke of alva be discover drag through the filthiest street of the town and with all the indignity so well merit by the original it be finally break into a thousand piece the country in confer such extensive power on the prince of orange have certainly go too far not for he desert but for its own tranquillity it be impossible that such a elevation should not excite the discontent and awaken the enmity of the haughty aristocracy of flander and brabant and particularly of the house of crous the ancient rival of that of nassau the then representative of that family seem the person most suit to counterbalance william 's excessive power the duke of arschot be therefore name governor of flander and he immediately put himself at the head of a confederacy of the catholic party which quickly decide to offer the chief government of the country still in the name of philip to the archduke mathia brother of the emperor rodolf ii and cousin-german to philip of spain a youth but nineteen year of age a flemish gentleman name maelsted be intrust with the proposal mathia joyously consent and quit vienna with the greatest secrecy he arrive at maestricht without any previous announcement and expect only by the party that have invite he at the end of October 1577 the prince of orange instead of show the least symptom of dissatisfaction at this underhand proceeding aim at he personal authority announce he perfect approval of the nomination and be the foremost in recommend measure for the honor of the archduke and the security of the country he draw up the basis of a treaty for mathia 's acceptance on term which guarantee to the council of state and the states-general the virtual sovereignty and leave to the young prince little beyond the fine title which have dazzle he boyish vanity the prince of orange be appoint he lieutenant in all the branch of the administration civil military or financial and the duke of arschot who have hope to obtain a entire domination over the puppet he have bring upon the stage see himself totally foiled in he project and leave without a chance or a pretext for the least increase to he influence but a still greater disappointment attend this ambitious nobleman in the very stronghold of he power the fleming drive by persecution to a state of fury almost unnatural have in they antipathy to spain adopt a hatred against catholicism which have its source only in political frenzy while the convert imagine it to arise from reason and conviction two man have take advantage of this state of the public mind and gain over it a unbounded ascendency they be francis de kethulle lord of ryhove and john hembyse who each seem form to realize the beau-ideal of a factious demagogue they have acquire supreme power over the people of ghent and have at they command a body of twenty thousand resolute and well-armed supporter the duke of arschot vainly attempt to oppose he authority to that of these man and he on one occasion imprudently exclaim that he would have they hang even though they be protect by the prince of orange himself the same night ryhove summon the leader of he band and quickly assemble a considerable force they repair to the duke 's hotel make he prisoner and without allow he time to dress carry he away in triumph at the same time the bishop of bruge and ypre the high bailiff of ghent and courtraus the governor of oudenarde and other important magistrate be arrest -- accuse of complicity with the duke but of what particular offence the lawless demagogue do not deign to specify the two tribune immediately divide the whole honor and authority of administration ryhove as military and hembyse as civil chief the latter of these legislator completely change the form of the government he revive the ancient privilege destroy by charle v and take all preliminary measure for force the various province to join with the city of ghent in form a federative republic the states-general and the prince of orange be alarmed lest these trouble might lead to a renewal of the anarchy from the effect of which the country have but just obtain breathing-time ryhove consent at the remonstrance of the prince of orange to release the duke of arschot but william be oblige to repair to ghent in person in the hope of establish order he arrive on the 29th of December and enter on a strict inquiry with he usual calmness and decision he could not succeed in obtain the liberty of the other prisoner though he plead for they strongly have severely reprimand the factious leader and point out the danger of they illegal course he return to brussels leave the factious city in a temporary tranquillity which he firmness and discretion could alone have obtain the archduke mathia have visit antwerp and accede to all the condition require of he make he public entry into brussels on the 18th of January 1578 and be install in he dignity of governor-general amid the usual fete and rejoicing don john of austrium be at the same time declare a enemy to the country with a public order to quit it without delay and a prohibition be issue against any inhabitant acknowledge he forfeit authority war be now once more openly declare some fruitless negotiation have afford a fair pretext for hostility the rapid appearance of a numerous army under the order of don john give strength to the suspicion of he former dissimulation it be currently believe that large body of the spanish troops have remain conceal in the forest of luxemburg and lorraine while several regiment which have remain in france in the service of the league immediately re-enter the netherland alexander farnese prince of parma son of the former stadtholderess come to the aid of he uncle don john at the head of a large force of italian and these several reinforcement with the german auxiliary still in the country compose a army of twenty thousand man the army of the states-general be still larger but far inferior in point of discipline it be command by antoine de goigny a gentleman of hainault and a old soldier of the school of charle v after a sharp affair at the village of riminant in which the royalist have the worst the two army meet at gemblor on the 31st of January 1578 and the prince of parma gain a complete victory almost with he cavalry only take de goignies prisoner with the whole of he artillery and baggage the account of he victory be almost miraculous the royalist if we be to credit they most minute but not impartial historian have only one thousand two hundred man engage by whom six thousand be put to the sword with the loss of but twelve man and little more than a hour 's labor the news of this battle throw the state into the utmost consternation brussels be consider insecure the archduke mathia and he council retire to antwerp but the victor do not feel they force sufficient to justify a attack upon the capital they however take louvain tirlemont and several other town but these conquest be of little import in comparison with the loss of amsterdam which declare openly and unanimously for the patriot cause the states-general recover they courage and prepare for a new contest they send deputy to the diet of worm to ask succor from the prince of the empire the count palatine john casimir repair to they assistance with a considerable force of german and english all equip and pay by queen elizabeth the duke of alençon brother of henry iii of france hover on the frontier of hainault with a respectable army and the cause of liberty seem not quite desperate but all the various chief have separate interest and opposite view while the fanatic violence of the people of ghent sap the foundation of the pacification to which the town have give its name the walloon province deep-rooted in they attachment to religious bigotry which they love still better than political freedom gradually withdraw from the common cause and without yet openly become reconcile with spain they adopt a neutrality which be tantamount to it don john be however deprive of all chance of reap any advantage from these unfortunate dissension he be suddenly take ill in he camp at bougy and die after a fortnight 's suffering on the 1st of October 1578 in the thirty-third year of he age this unlooked-for close to a career which have be so brilliant and to a life from which so much be yet to be expect make we pause to consider for a moment the different opinion of he time and of history on the fate of a personage so remarkable the contemporary flemish memoirs say that he die of the plague those of spain call he disorder the purple fever the examination of he corpse cause a almost general belief that he be poison he lose he life say one author with great suspicion of poison acabo su vida con gran sospecho de veneno -- herrera another speak of the suspicious state of he intestine but without any direct opinion a english historian state the fact of he be poison without any reserve flemish writer do not hesitate to attribute he murder to the jealousy of philip ii who they assert have discover a secret treaty of marriage about to be conclude between don john and elizabeth of england secure they the joint sovereignty of the netherland a italian historian of credit assert that this ambitious design be attribute to the prince and admit that he death be not consider as have arise from natural cause e quindi nacque l'opinione dispersa allora ch ` egli mancasse di morte aiutata più tosto che naturale -- bentivoglio it be also believe that escovedo he confidential secretary be immediately call back to spain be secretly assassinate by antonio perez philip 's celebrated minister and by the special order of the king time have however cover the affair with impenetrable mystery and the death of don john be of little importance to the affair of the country he govern so briefly and so ingloriously if it be not that it add another motive to the natural hatred for he assumed murderer the prince of parma who now succeed by virtue of don john 's testament to the post of governor-general in the name of the king remain intrenched in he camp he expect much from the disunion of he various opponent and what he foresee very quickly happen the duke of alençon disband he troops and retire to france and the prince palatine follow he example withdraw to germany have first make a unsuccessful attempt to engage the queen of england as a principal in the confederacy in this perplexity the prince of orange saw that the real hope for safety be in unite still more closely the northern province of the union for he discover the fallacy of reckoning on the cordial and persevere fidelity of the walloon he therefore convoke a new assembly at utrecht and the deputy of holland guelder zealand utrecht and groningen sign on the 29th of January 1579 the famous act call the union of utrecht the real basis or fundamental pact of the republic of the united province it make no formal renunciation of allegiance to spain but this be virtually do by the omission of the king 's name the twenty-six article of this act consolidate the indissoluble connection of the united province each preserve its separate franchise and follow its own good pleasure on the subject of religion the town of ghent antwerp bruge and ypre soon after accede to and join the union the prince of parma now assume the offensive and march against maestricht with he whole army he take the place in the month of June 1579 after a gallant resistance and deliver it to sack and massacre for three entire day about the same time mechlin and bois-le-duc return to they obedience to the king hembyse have renew he attempt against the public peace at ghent the prince of orange repair to that place re-establish order frighten the inveterate demagogue into secret flight and flander be once more restore to tranquillity a attempt be make this year at a reconciliation between the king and the state the emperor rodolf ii and pope gregory xiii offer they mediation and on the 5th of April a congress assemble at cologne where a number of the most celebrated diplomatist in europe be collect but it be early see that no settlement would result from the apparently reciprocal wish for peace one point -- that of religion the main and indeed the only one in debate -- be now maintain by philip 's ambassador in the same unchristian spirit as if torrent of blood and million of treasure have never be sacrifice in the cause philip be inflexible in he resolution never to concede the exercise of the reform worship and after nearly a year of fruitless consultation and the expenditure of immense sum of money the congress separate on the 17th of November without have effect anything there be several other article intend for discussion have the main one be adjust on which philip be fully as determine to make no concession but he obstinacy be not put to these new test the time have now arrive for the execution of the great and decisive step for independence the means of effect which have be so long the object of exertion and calculation on the part of the prince of orange he now resolve to assemble the state of the united province solemnly abjure the dominion of spain and depose king philip from the sovereignty he have so justly forfeit much have be write both for and against this measure which involve every argument of natural rights and municipal privilege the natural rights of man may seem to comprise only those which he enjoy in a state of nature but he carry several of those with he into society which be base upon the very principle of they preservation the great precedent which so many subsequent revolution have acknowledge and confirm be that which we now record the states-general assemble at antwerp early in the year 1580 and in spite of all the opposition of the catholic deputy the authority of spain be revoke forever and the united province declare a free and independent state at the same time be debate the important question as to whether the protection of the new state should be offer to england or to france opinion be divide on this point but that of the prince of orange be in favor of the latter country from many motive of sound policy it be decide to offer the sovereignty to the duke of alençon the archduke mathia who be present at the deliberation be treat with little ceremony but he obtain the promise of a pension when the finances be in a situation to afford it the definite proposal to be make to the duke of alençon be not agree upon for some month afterward and it be in the month of August follow that st aldegonde and other deputy wait on the duke at the chateau of plessis-le-tour when he accept the offer sovereignty on the proposed condition which set narrow bound to he authority and give ample security to the united province the article be formally sign on the 29th day of September and the duke not only promise quickly to lead a numerous army to the netherland but he obtain a letter from he brother henry iii date December 26th by which the king pledge himself to give further aid as soon as he might succeed in quiet he own disturbed and unfortunate country the states-general assemble at delft ratify the treaty on the 30th of December and the year which be about to open seem to promise the consolidation of freedom and internal peace chapter xii to the murder of the prince of orange ad 1580 -- 1584 philip might be well excuse the utmost violence of resentment on this occasion have it be bound by fair and honorable effort for the maintenance of he authority but every general principle seem lose in the base inveteracy of private hatred the ruin of the prince of orange be he main object and he industry and ingenuity be tax to the utmost to procure he murder exist document prove that he first wish to accomplish this in such a way as that the responsibility and odium of the act might rest on the prince of parma but the mind of the prince be at that period too magnanimous to allow of a participation in the crime the correspondence on the subject be preserve in the archive and the date of philip 's first letter -lrb- 30th of November 1579 -rrb- prove that even before the final disavowal of he authority by the united province he have harbor he diabolical design the prince remonstrate but with no effect it even appear that philip 's anxiety would not admit of the delay necessary for the prince 's reply the infamous edict of proscription against william bear date the 15th of march and the most pressing letter command the prince of parma to make it public it be not however till the 15th of June that he send forth the fatal ban this edict under philip 's own signature be a tissue of invective and virulence the illustrious object of its abuse be accuse of have engage the heretic to profane the church and break the image of have persecute and massacre the catholic priest of hypocrisy tyranny and perjury and as the height of atrocity of have introduce liberty of conscience into he country for these cause and many other the king declare he proscribe and banish as a public pest and it be permit to all person to assail he in he fortune person and life as a enemy to human nature philip also for the recompense of virtue and the punishment of crime promise to whoever will deliver up william of nassau dead or alive in land or money at he choice the sum of twenty-five thousand golden crown to grant a free pardon to such person for all former offence of what kind soever and to invest he with letter patent of nobility in reply to this brutal document of human depravity william publish all over europe he famous apology of which it be enough to say that language could not produce a more splendid refutation of every charge or a more terrible recrimination against the guilty tyrant it be attribute to the pen of peter de villier a protestant minister it be universally pronounced one of the noblest monument of history william from the hour of he proscription become at once the equal in worldly station as he have ever be the superior in moral worth of he royal calumniator he take he place as a prince of a imperial family not less ancient or illustrious than that of the house of austrium and he stand forward at the supreme tribunal of public feeling and opinion as the accuser of a king who disgrace he lineage and he throne by a separate article in the treaty with the state the duke of alençon secure to william the sovereignty of holland and zealand as well as the lordship of friesland with he title of stadtholder retain to the duke he claim on the prince 's faith and homage the exact nature of william 's authority be finally ratify on the 24th of July 1581 on which day he take the prescribe oath and enter on the exercise of he well-earned rights philip now form the design of send back the duchess of parma to resume she former situation as stadtholderess and exercise the authority conjointly with she son but the latter positively decline this proposal of divide power and he consequently be leave alone to its entire exercise military affair make but slow progress this year the most remarkable event be the capture of la noue a native of bretagne one of the bravest and certainly the cleverest officer in the service of the state into which he have pass after have give important aid to the huguenot of france he be consider so important a prize that philip refuse all proposal for he exchange and detain he in the castle of limburg for five year the siege of cambray be now undertake by the prince of parma in person while the duke of alençon at the head of a large army and the flower of the french nobility advance to its relief and soon force he rival to raise the siege the new sovereign of the netherland enter the town and be receive with tumultuous joy by the half-starved citizen and garrison the prince of parma seek a equivalent for this check in the attack of tournay which he immediately afterward invest the town be but feebly garrison but the protestant inhabitant prepare for a desperate defense under the exciting example of the princess of epinoi wife of the governor who be himself absent this remarkable woman furnish another proof of the female heroism which abound in these war though wound in the arm she fight in the breach sword in hand brave peril and death and when at length it be impossible to hold out longer she obtain a honorable capitulation and march out on the 29th of November on horseback at the head of the garrison with a air of triumph rather than of defeat the duke of alençon now create duke of anjou by which title we shall hereafter distinguish he have repair to england in hope of complete he project of marriage with elizabeth after three month of almost confident expectation the virgin queen at this time fifty year of age with a caprice not quite justifiable break all she former engagement and happily for herself and she country decline the marriage anjou burst out into all the violence of he turbulent temper and set sail for the netherland elizabeth make all the reparation in she power by the honor pay he on he dismissal she accompany he as far as canterbury and send he away under the convoy of the earl of leicester she chief favorite and with a brilliant suite and a fleet of fifteen sail anjou be receive at antwerp with equal distinction and be inaugurate there on the 19th of February as duke of brabant lothier limburg and guelder with many other title of which he soon prove himself unworthy when the prince of orange at the ceremony place the ducal mantle on he shoulder anjou say to he fasten it so well prince that they can not take it off again during the rejoicing which follow this inauspicious ceremony philip 's proscription against the prince of orange put forth its first fruit the latter give a grand dinner in the chateau of antwerp which he occupy on the 18th of march the birthday of the duke of anjou and as he be quit the dining-room on he way to he private chamber a young man step forward and offer a pretended petition william be at all time of easy access for such a object while he read the paper the treacherous suppliant discharge a pistol at he head : the ball strike he under the left ear and pass out at the right cheek as he totter and fall the assassin draw a poniard to add suicide to the crime but he be instantly put to death by the attendant guard the young count maurice william 's second son examine the murderer 's body and the papers find on he and subsequent inquiry tell fully who and what he be he name be john jaureguay he age twenty-three year he be a native of biscay and clerk to a spanish merchant of antwerp call gaspar anastro this man have instigate he to the crime have receive a promise sign by king philip engage to give he twenty-eight thousand ducat and other advantage if he would undertake to assassinate the prince of orange the inducement hold out by anastro to he simple dupe be back strongly by the persuasion of antony timmerman a dominican monk and by venero anastro 's cashier who have from fear decline become himself the murderer jaureguay have duly hear mass and receive the sacrament before execute he attempt and in he pocket be find a catechism of the jesuit with tablet fill with prayer in the spanish language one in particular be address to the angel gabriel implore he intercession with god and the virgin to aid he in the consummation of he object other accompany absurdity seem to pronounce this miserable wretch to be as much a instrument in the hand of other as the weapon of he crime be in he own timmerman and venero make a full avowal of they criminality and suffer death in the usual barbarous manner of the time the jesuit some year afterward solemnly gather the remains of these three pretend martyr and expose they as holy relic for public veneration anastro effect he escape the alarm and indignation of the people of antwerp know no bound they suspicion at first fall on the duke of anjou and the french party but the truth be soon discover and the rapid recovery of the prince of orange from he desperate wound set everything once more to rights but a premature report of he death fly rapidly abroad and he have anticipate proof of he importance in the eye of all europe in the frantic delight of the base and the deep affliction of the good within three month william be able to accompany the duke of anjou in he visit to ghent bruge and the other chief town of flander in each of which the ceremony of inauguration be repeat several military exploit now take place and various town fall into the hand of the oppose party change master with a rapidity as well as a previous endurance of suffer that must have carry confusion and change on the contend principle of allegiance into the heart and head of the harass inhabitant the duke of anjou intemperate inconstant and unprincipled saw that he authority be but the shadow of power compare to the deep-fixed practice of despotism which govern the other nation of europe the french officer who form he suite and possess all he confidence have no difficulty in raise he discontent into treason against the people with whom he have make a solemn compact the result of they council be a deep-laid plot against flemish liberty and its execution be ere-long attempt he send secret order to the governor of dunkirk bruge termonde and other town to seize on and hold they in he name reserve for himself the infamy of the enterprise against antwerp to prepare for its execution he cause he numerous army of french and swiss to approach the city and they be encamp in the neighborhood at a place call borgerhout on the 17th of January 1583 the duke dine somewhat earlier than usual under the pretext of proceeding afterward to review he army in they camp he set out at noon accompany by he guard of two hundred horse and when he reach the second drawbridge one of he officer give the preconcerted signal for a attack on the flemish guard by pretend that he have fall and break he leg the duke call out to he follower courage courage the town be ours the guard at the gate be all soon despatched and the french troops which wait outside to the number of three thousand rush quickly in furiously shout the war-cry town take town take kill kill the astonished but intrepid citizen recover from they confusion instantly fly to arm all difference in religion or politics be forget in the common danger to they freedom catholic and protestant man and woman rush alike to the conflict the ancient spirit of flander seem to animate all workman arm with the instrument of they various trade start from they shop and fling themselves upon the enemy a baker spring from the cellar where he be knead he dough and with he oven shovel strike a french dragoon to the ground those who have firearm after expend they bullet take from they pouch and pocket piece of money which they bent between they tooth and use for charge they arquebus the french be drive successively from the street and rampart and the cannon plant on the latter be immediately turn against the reinforcement which attempt to enter the town the french be everywhere beat the duke of anjou save himself by flight and reach termonde after the perilous necessity of pass through a large tract of inundate country he loss in this base enterprise amount to one thousand five hundred while that of the citizen do not exceed eighty man the attempt simultaneously make on the other town succeed at dunkirk and termonde but all the other fail the character of the prince of orange never appear so thoroughly great as at this crisis with wisdom and magnanimity rarely equal and never surpass he throw himself and he authority between the indignation of the country and the guilt of anjou save the former from excess and the latter from execration the disgraced and discomfited duke proffer to the state excuse as mean as they be hypocritical and he brother the king of france send a special envoy to intercede for he but it be the influence of william that screen the culprit from public reprobation and ruin and regain for he the place and power which he might easily have secure for himself have he not prize the welfare of he country far above all object of private advantage a new treaty be negotiate confirm anjou in he former station with renew security against any future treachery on he part he in the meantime retire to france to let the public indignation subside but before he could assume sufficient confidence again to face the country he have so basely injure he worthless existence be suddenly terminate some think by poison -- the common solution of all such doubtful question in those day -- in the month of June in the following year he expire in he twenty-ninth year a disgusting proof of public ingratitude and want of judgment be previously furnish by the conduct of the people of antwerp against he who have be so often they deliverer from such various danger unable to comprehend the greatness of he mind they openly accuse the prince of orange of have join with the french for they subjugation and of have conceal a body of that detest nation in the citadel the populace rush to the place and have minutely examine it be convince of they own absurdity and the prince 's innocence he scorn to demand they punishment for such a outrageous calumny but he be not the less afflict at it he take the resolution of quit flander as it turn out forever and he retire into zealand where he be better know and consequently better trust in the midst of the consequent confusion in the former of these province the prince of parma with indefatigable vigor make himself master of town after town and turn he particular attention to the creation of a naval force which be greatly favor by the possession of dunkirk nieuport and graveline native treachery be not idle in this time of tumult and confusion the count of renneberg governor of friesland and groningen have set the basest example and go over to the spaniard the prince of chimay son of the duke of arschot and governor of bruge yield to the persuasion of he father and give up the place to the prince of parma hembyse also amply confirm the bad opinion in which the prince of orange always hold he return to ghent where he regain a great portion of he former influence and immediately commence a correspondence with the prince of parma offering to deliver up both ghent and termonde a attempt be consequently make by the spaniard to surprise the former town but the citizen be prepare for this have intercept some of the letter of hembyse and the traitor be seize try condemn and execute on the 4th of August 1584 he be upward of seventy year of age ryhove he celebrated colleague die in holland some year later but the fate of so insignificant a person as hembyse pass almost unnoticed in the agitation cause by a event which shortly precede he death from the moment of they abandonment by the duke of anjou the united province consider themselves independent and although they consent to renew he authority over the country at large at the solicitation of the prince of orange they be resolve to confirm the influence of the latter over they particular interest which they be now sensible could acquire stability only by that mean the death of anjou leave they without a sovereign and they do not hesitate in the choice which they be now call upon to make on whom indeed could they fix but william of nassau without the utmost injustice to he and the deepest injury to themselves to whom could they turn in preference to he who have give consistency to the early explosion of they despair to he who first give the country political existence then nurse it into freedom and now behold it in the vigor and prime of independence he have see the necessity but certainly overrate the value of foreign support to enable the new state to cope with the tremendous tyranny from which it have break he have try successively germany england and france from the first and the last of these power he have receive two governor to whom he cheerfully resign the title the incapacity of both and the treachery of the latter prove to the state that they only chance for safety be in the consolidation of william 's authority and they contemplate the noblest reward which a grateful nation could bestow on a glorious liberator and be it to be believe that he who for twenty year have sacrifice he repose lavish he fortune and risk he life for the public cause now aim at absolute dominion or covet a despotism which all he action prove he to have abhor defeat bigotry have put forward such vapid accusation he have be also hold responsible for the early cruelty which it be notorious he use every means to avert and frequently punish but while these revolting act can only be view in the light of reprisal against the bloodiest persecution that ever exist by exasperated man drive to vengeance by a bad example not one single act of cruelty or bad faith have ever be make good against william who may be safely pronounced one of the wisest and best man that history have hold up as example to the species the authority of one author have be produce to prove that during the lifetime of he brother loui offer be make to he by france of the sovereignty of the northern province on condition of the southern be join to the french crown that he ever accept those offer be without proof that he never act on they be certain but he might have be justify in purchase freedom for those state which have so well earn it at the price even of a qualify independence under another power to the exclusion of those which have never heartily struggle against spain the best evidence however of william 's real view be to be find in the capitulation as it be call that be to say the act which be on the point of be execute between he and the state when a base fanatic instigate by a bloody tyrant put a period to he splendid career this capitulation exist at full length but be never formally execute its condition be found on the same principle and conceive in nearly the same term as those accept by the duke of anjou and the whole compact be one of the most thoroughly liberal that history have on record the prince repair to delft for the ceremony of he inauguration the price of he long labor but there instead of anticipated dignity he meet the sudden stroke of death on the 10th of July as he leave he dining-room and while he place he foot on the first step of the great stair lead to the upper apartment of he house a man name balthazar gerard -lrb- who like the former assassin wait for he at the moment of convivial relaxation -rrb- discharge a pistol at he body three ball enter it he fall into the arm of a attendant and cry out faintly in the french language god pity I i be sadly wound -- god have mercy on my soul and on this unfortunate nation he sister the countess of swartzenberg who now hasten to he side ask he in german if he do not recommend he soul to god he answer yes in the same language but with a feeble voice he be carry into the dining-room where he immediately expire he sister close he eye he wife too be on the spot -- louisa daughter of the illustrious coligny and widow of the gallant count of teligny both of whom be also murder almost in she sight in the frightful massacre of st bartholomew we may not enter on a description of the afflict scene which follow but the mind be please in picture the bold solemnity with which prince maurice then eighteen year of age swear -- not vengeance or hatred against he father 's murderer -- but that he would faithfully and religiously follow the glorious example he have give he whoever would really enjoy the spirit of historical detail should never omit a opportunity of see place render memorable by association connect with the deed and especially with the death of great man the spot for instance where william be assassinate at delft the old staircase he be just on the point of ascend the narrow pass between that and the dining-hall whence he come out of scarcely sufficient extent for the murderer to hold forth he arm and he pistol two and a half foot long this weapon and its fellow be both preserve in the museum of the hague together with two of the fatal bullet and the very clothes which the victim wear the leathern doublet pierce by the ball and burn by the powder lie beside the other part of the dress the simple gravity of which in fashion and color irresistibly bring the wise great man before we and add a hundred-fold to the interest excite by a recital of he murder there be but one important feature in the character of william which we have hitherto leave untouched but which the circumstance of he death seem to sanctify and point out for record in the same page with it we mean he religious opinion and we shall despatch a subject which be in regard to all man so delicate indeed so sacred in a few word he be bear a lutheran when he arrive a boy at the court of charle v he be initiate into the catholic creed in which he be thenceforward bring up afterward when he could think for himself and choose he profession of faith he embrace the doctrine of calvin he whole public conduct seem to prove that he view sectarian principle chiefly in the light of political instrument and that himself a conscientious christian in the broad sense of the term he be deeply imbue with the spirit of universal toleration and consider the various shades of belief as subservient to the one grand principle of civil and religious liberty for which he have long devoted and at length lay down he life he assassin be take alive and four day afterward execute with terrible circumstance of cruelty which he bear as a martyr might have bear they he be a native of burgundy and have for some month linger near he victim and insinuate himself into he confidence by a feigned attachment to liberty and a apparent zeal for the reform faith he be nevertheless a bigoted catholic and by he own confession he have communicate he design to and receive encouragement to its execution from more than one minister of the sect to which he belong but he avowal criminate a more important accomplice and one whose character stand so high in history that it behoove we to examine thoroughly the truth of the accusation and the nature of the collateral proof by which it be support most writer on this question have lean to the side which all would wish to adopt for the honor of human nature and the integrity of a celebrated name but a original letter exist in the archive of brussels from the prince of parma himself to philip of spain in which he admit that balthazar gerard have communicate to he he intention of murder the prince of orange some month before the deed be do and he mix phrase of compassion for the poor man -lrb- the murderer -rrb- and of praise for the act which if the document be really authentic sink alexander of parma as low as the wretch with whom he sympathize chapter xiii to the death of alexander prince of parma ad 1584 -- 1592 the death of william of nassau not only close the scene of he individual career but throw a deep gloom over the history of a revolution that be seal by so great a sacrifice the animation of the story seem suspend its event lose for a time they excitement the last act of the political drama be perform the great hero of the tragedy be no more the other most memorable actor have one by one pass away a whole generation have fall in the contest and it be with exhaust interest and feeling less intense that we resume the detail of war and blood which seem no longer sanctify by the grander movement of heroism the stir impulse of slavery break its chain yield to the colder inspiration of independence maintain its rights the man we have now to depict be bear free and the deed they do be those of stern resolve rather than of frantic despair the present picture may be as instructive as the last but it be less thrilling passion give place to reason and that which wear the air of fierce romance be supersede by what bear the stamp of calm reality the consternation cause by the news of william 's death soon yield to the firmness natural to a people inure to suffer and calamity the united province reject at once the overture make by the prince of parma to induce they to obedience they seem proud to show that they fate do not depend on that of one man he therefore turn he attention to the most effective means of obtain result by force which he find it impossible to secure by persuasion he proceed vigorously to the reduction of the chief town of flander the conquest of which would give he possession of the entire province no army now remain to oppose he in the field he soon oblige ypre and termonde to surrender and ghent force by famine at length yield on reasonable term the most severe be the utter abolition of the reform religion by which a large portion of the population be drive to the alternative of exile and they pass over in crowd to holland and zealand not half of the inhabitant remain behind mechlin and finally brussels wear out by a fruitless resistance follow the example of the rest and thus within a year after the death of william of nassau the power of spain be again establish in the whole province of flander and the other which comprise what be in modern day generally denominate belgium but these domestic victory of the prince of parma be barren in any of those result which humanity would love to see in the train of conquest the reconcile province present the most deplorable spectacle the chief town be almost depopulate the inhabitant have in a great measure fall victim to war pestilence and famine little inducement exist to replace by marriage the ravages cause by death for few man wish to propagate a race which divine wrath seem to have mark for persecution the thousand of village which have cover the face of the country be absolutely abandon to the wolf which have so rapidly increase that they attack not merely cattle and child but grown-up person the dog drive abroad by hunger have become as ferocious as other beast of prey and join in large pack to hunt down brute and man neither field nor wood nor road be now to be distinguish by any visible limit all be a entangled mass of tree weed and grass the price of the necessaries of life be so high that people of rank after sell everything to buy bread be oblige to have recourse to open beggary in the street of the great town from this frightful picture and the numerous detail which imagination may readily supply we gladly turn to the contrast afford by the northern state those we have just describe have a feeble hold upon we sympathy we can not pronounce they suffering to be unmerited the want of firmness or enlightenment which prefer such a existence to the risk of entire destruction only heighten the glory of the people whose unyielding energy and courage gain they so proud a place among the independent nation of europe the murder of william seem to carry to the united province conviction of the weakness as well as the atrocity of spain and the indecent joy excite among the royalist add to they courage a immediate council be create compose of eighteen member at the head of which be unanimously place prince maurice of nassau -lrb- who even then give striking indication of talent and prudence -rrb- he elder brother the count of beuren now prince of orange be still keep captive in spain count hohenloe be appoint lieutenant-general and several other measure be promptly adopt to consolidate the power of the infant republic the whole of its force amount but to five thousand five hundred man the prince of parma have eighty thousand at he command with such means of carry on he conquest he sit down regularly before antwerp and commence the operation of one of the most celebrated among the many memorable siege of those time he completely surround the city with troops place a large portion of he army on the left bank of the scheldt the other on the right and cause to be attack at the same time the two strong fort of liefkinshoek and lillo repulse on the latter important point he only hope of gain the command of the navigation of the river on which the success of the siege depend be by throw a bridge across the stream neither its great rapidity nor its immense width nor the want of wood and workman could deter he from this vast undertaking he be assist if not guide in all he project on the occasion by barroccio a celebrated italian engineer send to he by philip and the merit of all that be do ought fairly to be at least divide between the general and the engineer if enterprise and perseverance belong to the first science and skill be the portion of the latter they first cause two strong fort to be erect at opposite side of the river and add to they resource by every possible means they throw forward a pier on each side of and far into the stream the stake drive firmly into the bed of the river and cement with mass of earth and stone be at a proper height cover with plank and defend by parapet these estoccade as they be call reduce the river to half its original breadth and the cannon with which they be mount render the passage extremely dangerous to hostile vessel but to fill up this strait a considerable number of boat be fasten together by chain-hook and anchor and be man and arm with cannon they be moor in the interval between the estoccade during these operation a canal be cut between the moer and calloo by which mean a communication be form with ghent which insure a supply of ammunition and provision the work of the bridge which be two thousand four hundred foot in length be construct with such strength and solidity that they brave the wind the flood and the ice of the whole winter the people of antwerp at first laugh to scorn the whole of these stupendous preparation but when they find that the bridge resist the natural element by which they doubt not it would have be destroy they begin to tremble in the anticipation of famine yet they vigorously prepare for they defense and reject the overture make by the prince of parma even at this advanced stage of he proceedings ninety-seven piece of cannon now defend the bridge besides which thirty large barge at each side of the river guard its extremity and forty ship of war form a fleet of protection constantly ready to meet any attack from the besiege they see the scheldt thus really close up and all communication with zealand impossible feel they whole safety to depend on the destruction of the bridge the state of zealand now send forward a expedition which join with some ship from lillo give new courage to the besiege and everything be prepare for they great attempt a italian engineer name giambellus be at this time in antwerp and by he talent have long protracted the defense he have the chief merit of be the inventor of those terrible fire-ship which gain the title of infernal machine and with some of these formidable instrument and the zealand fleet the long-projected attack be at length make early on the night of the 4th of April the prince of parma and he army be amaze by the spectacle of three huge mass of flame float down the river accompany by numerous lesser appearance of a similar kind and bearing directly against the prodigious barrier which have cost month of labor to he and he troops and immense sum of money to the state the whole surface of the scheldt present one sheet of fire the country all round be as visible as at noon the flag the arm of the soldier and every object on the bridge in the fleet or the fort stand out clearly to view and the pitchy darkness of the sky give increase effect to the marked distinctness of all astonishment be soon succeed by consternation when one of the three machine burst with a terrific noise before they reach they intended mark but time enough to offer a sample of they nature the prince of parma with numerous officer and soldier rush to the bridge to witness the effect of this explosion and just then a second and still larger fire-ship have burst through the fly bridge of boat strike against one of the estoccade alexander unmindful of danger use every exertion of he authority to stimulate the sailor in they attempt to clear away the monstrous machine which threaten destruction to all within its reach happily for he a ensign who be near forget in he general 's peril all rule of discipline and form of ceremony actually force he from the estoccade he have not put he foot on the river bank when the machine blow up the effect be such as really baffle description the bridge be burst through the estoccade be shatter almost to atom and with all that it support -- man cannon and the huge machinery employ in the various work -- disperse in the air the cruel marquis of roubai many other officer and eight hundred soldier perish in all variety of death -- by flood or flame or the horrid wound from the missile with which the terrible machine be overcharge fragment of body and limb be fling far and wide and many gallant soldier be destroy without a vestige of the human form be leave to prove that they have ever exist the river force from its bed at either side rush into the fort and drown number of they garrison while the ground far beyond shake as in a earthquake the prince be strike down by a beam and lay for some time senseless together with two general delvasto and gajitanus both more seriously wounded than he and many of the soldier be burn and mutilate in the most frightful manner alexander soon recover and by he presence of mind humanity and resolution he endeavor with incredible quickness to repair the mischief and raise the confidence of he army as high as ever have the zealand fleet come in time to the spot the whole plan might have be crown with success but by some want of concert or accidental delay it do not appear and consequently the beleaguered town receive no relief one last resource be leave to the besiege that which have formerly be resort to at leyden and by which the place be save to enable they to inundate the immense plain which stretch between lillo and strabrock up to the wall of antwerp it be necessary to cut through the dike which defend it against the irruption of the eastern scheldt this plain be traverse by a high and wide counter-dike call the dike of couvestien and alexander know its importance have early take possession of and strongly defend it by several fort two attack be make by the garrison of antwerp on this important construction the latter of which lead to one of the most desperate encounter of the war the prince see that on the result of this day depend the whole consequence of he labor fight with a valor that even he have never before display and he be finally victorious the confederate be force to abandon the attack leave three thousand dead upon the dike or at its base and the spaniard lose full eight hundred man one more fruitless attempt be make to destroy the bridge and raise the siege by means of a enormous vessel bear the presumptuous title of the end of the war but this float citadel run aground without produce any effect and the gallant governor of antwerp the celebrated philip de saint aldegonde be force to capitulate on the 16th of August after a siege of fourteen month the reduction of antwerp be consider a miracle of perseverance and courage the prince of parma be elevated by he success to the highest pinnacle of renown and philip on receive the news display a burst of joy such as rarely vary he cold and gloomy reserve even while the fate of antwerp be undecided the united province see that they be still too weak to resist alone the undivided force of the spanish monarchy have open negotiation with france and england at once in the hope of gain one or the other for a ally and protector henry iii give a most honorable reception to the ambassador send to he court and be evidently dispose to accept they offer have not the distract state of he own country still tear by civil war quite disabled he from any effective co-operation the deputy send to england be also well receive elizabeth listen to the proposal of the state send they a ambassador in return and hold out the most flattering hope of succor but she cautious policy would not suffer she to accept the sovereignty and she declare that she would in nowise interfere with the negotiation which might end in its be accept by the king of france she give prompt evidence of she sincerity by a advance of considerable sum of money and by send to holland a body of six thousand troops under the command of she favorite robert dudley earl of leicester and as security for the repayment of she loan the town of flushing and brille and the castle of rammekin be give up to she the earl of leicester be accompany by a splendid retinue of nobleman and a select troop of five hundred follower he be receive at flushing by the governor sir philip sidney he nephew the model of manners and conduct for the young man of he day but leicester possess neither courage nor capacity equal to the trust repose in he and he arbitrary and indolent conduct soon disgust the people whom he be send to assist they have in the first impulse of they gratitude give he the title of governor and captain-general of the province in the hope of flattering elizabeth but this have a far contrary effect : she be equally displeased with the state and with leicester and it be with difficulty that after many humble submission they be able to appease she to form a counterpoise to the power so lavishly confer on leicester prince maurice be accord to the wise advice of olden barnevelt raise to the dignity of stadtholder captain-general and admiral of holland and zealand this be the first instance of these state take on themselves the nomination to the dignity of stadtholder for even william have hold he commission from philip or in he name but friesland groningen and guelder have already appoint they local governor under the same title by the authority of the states-general the archduke mathia or even of the provincial state holland have now also at the head of its civil government a citizen full of talent and probity who be thus able to contend with the insidious design of leicester against the liberty he nominally come to protect this be barnevelt who be promote from he office of pensionary of rotterdam to that of holland and who accept the dignity only on condition of be free to resign it if any accommodation of difference should take place with spain alexander of parma have by the death of he mother in February 1586 exchange he title of prince for the superior one of duke of parma and soon resume he enterprise with he usual energy and success various operation take place in which the english on every opportunity distinguish themselves particularly in a action near the town of grave in brabant and in the taking of axel by escalade under the order of sir philip sidney a more important affair occur near zutphen at a place call warnsfeld both of which town have give name to the action on this occasion the veteran spaniard under the marquis of guasto be warmly attack and completely defeat by the english but the victory be dearly purchase by the death of sir philip sidney who be mortally wound in the thigh and expire a few day afterward at the early age of thirty-two year in addition to the valor talent and conduct which have unite to establish he fame he display on this last opportunity of he short career a instance of humanity that shed a new lustre on even a character like he stretch on the battlefield in all the agony of he wound and parch with thirst he afflict follower bring he some water procure with difficulty at a distance and during the heat of the fight but sidney see a soldier lie near mangled like himself and apparently expire refuse the water say give it to that poor man he suffering be greater than mine leicester 's conduct be now become quite intolerable to the state he incapacity and presumption be every day more evident and more revolting he seem to consider himself in a province wholly reduce to english authority and pay no sort of attention to the very opposite character of the people a eminent dutch author account for this in term which may make a englishman of this age not a little proud of the contrast which he character present to what it be then consider the englishman say grotius obey like a slave and govern like a tyrant while the belgian know how to serve and to command with equal moderation the dislike between leicester and those he insult and misgovern soon become mutual he retire to the town of utrecht and push he injurious conduct to such a extent that he become a object of utter hatred to the province all the friendly feeling toward england be gradually change into suspicion and dislike conference take place at the hague between leicester and the state in which barnevelt overwhelm he contemptible shuffling by the force of irresistible eloquence and well-deserved reproach and after new act of treachery still more odious than he former this unworthy favorite at last set out for england to lay a account of he government at the foot of the queen the grow hatred against england be foment by the true patriot who aim at the liberty of they country and may be excuse from the various instance of treachery display not only by the commander-in-chief but by several of he inferior in command a strong fort near zutphen under the government of roland york the town of deventer under that of william starily and subsequently guelder under a scotchman name pallot be deliver up to the spaniard by these man and about the same time the english cavalry commit some excess in guelder and holland which add to the prevalent prejudice against the nation in general this enmity be no longer to be conceal the partisan of leicester be one by one under plausible pretext remove from the council of state and elizabeth have require from holland the exportation into england of a large quantity of rye it be firmly but respectfully refuse as inconsistent with the want of the province prince maurice from the caprice and jealousy of leicester now unite in himself the whole power of command and commence that brilliant course of conduct which consolidate the independence of he country and elevate he to the first rank of military glory he early effort be turn to the suppression of the partiality which in some place exist for english domination and he never allow himself to be deceive by the hope of peace hold out by the emperor and the king of denmark and poland without refuse they mediation he labor incessantly to organize every possible means for maintain the war he effort be considerably favor by the measure of philip for the support of the league form by the house of guise against henry iii and henry iv of france but still more by the formidable enterprise which the spanish monarch be now prepare against england irritated and mortified by the assistance which elizabeth have give to the revolted province philip resolve to employ he whole power in attempt the conquest of england itself hope afterward to effect with ease the subjugation of the netherland he cause to be build in almost every port of spain and portugal galleon carrick and other ship of war of the largest dimension and at the same time give order to the duke of parma to assemble in the harbor of flander as many vessel as he could collect together the spanish fleet consist of more than one hundred and forty ship of the line and man by twenty thousand sailor assemble at lisbon under the order of the duke of medina sidonia while the duke of parma unite he force hold himself ready on the coast of flander with a army of thirty thousand man and four hundred transport this prodigious force obtain in spain the ostentatious title of the invincible armada its destination be for a while attempt to be conceal under pretext that it be mean for indium or for the annihilation of the united province but the mystery be soon discover at the end of may the principal fleet sail from the port of lisbon and be reinforce off corunna by a considerable squadron the whole armament steer its course for the shore of england the detail of the progress and the failure of this celebrated attempt be so thoroughly the province of english history that they would be in this place superfluous but it must not be forget that the glory of the proud result be amply share by the new republic whose existence depend on it while howard and drake hold the british fleet in readiness to oppose the spanish armada that of holland consist of but twenty-five ship under the command of justin of nassau prepare to take a part in the conflict this gallant though illegitimate scion of the illustrious house whose name he uphold on many occasion prove himself on the present worthy of such a father as william and such a brother as maurice while the duke of medina sidonia ascend the channel as far as dunkirk there expect the junction of the duke of parma with he important reinforcement justin of nassau by a constant activity and a display of intrepid talent contrived to block up the whole expect force in the port of flander from lillo to dunkirk the duke of parma find it impossible to force a passage on any one point and be doom to the mortification of know that the attempt be frustrated and the whole force of spain fritter away discomfited and disgraced from the want of a co-operation which he could not however reproach himself for have withhold the issue of the memorable expedition which cost spain year of preparation thousand of man and million or treasure be receive in the country which send it forth with consternation and rage philip alone possess or affect a apathy which he cover with a veil of mock devotion that few be deceive by at the news of the disaster he fall on he knee and render thanks for that gracious dispensation of providence express he joy that the calamity be not greater the people the priest and the commander of the expedition be not so easily appease or so clever as they hypocritical master in conceal they mortification the priest account for this triumph of heresy as a punishment on spain for suffer the existence of the infidel moor in some part of the country the defeat admiral throw the whole blame on the duke of parma he on he part send a ample remonstrance to the king and philip declare that he be satisfy with the conduct of he nephew leicester die four day after the final defeat and dispersion of the armada the war in the netherland have be necessarily suffer to languish while every eye be fix on the progress of the armada from formation to defeat but new effort be soon make by the duke of parma to repair the time he have lose and soothe by he success the disappointed pride of spain several officer now come into notice remarkable for deed of great gallantry and skill none among those be so distinguish as martin schenck a soldier of fortune a man of ferocious activity who begin he career in the service of tyranny and end it by chance in that of independence he change side several time but no matter who he fight for he do he duty well from that unconquerable principle of pugnacity which seem to make he sword a part of himself schenck have lately for the last time go over to the side of the state and have cause a fort to be build in the isle of betewe -- that possess of old by the batavian -- which be call by he name and be consider the key to the passage of the rhine from this stronghold he constantly harass the archbishop of cologne and have as he latest exploit surprised and take the strong town of bonn while the duke of parma take prompt measure for the relief of the prelate make himself master in the meantime of some place of strength the indefatigable schenck resolve to make a attempt on the important town of nimeguen he with great caution embark a choose body of troops on the wahal and arrive under the wall of nimeguen at sunrise on the morning choose for the attack he enterprise seem almost crown with success when the inhabitant recover from they fright precipitate themselves from the town force the assailant to retreat to they boat and carry the combat into those overcharge and fragile vessel upset several and among other that which contain schenck himself who cover with wound and fight to the last gasp be drown with the greater part of he follower he body when recover be treat with the utmost indignity quarter and hang in portion over the different gate of the city the following year be distinguish by another daring attempt on the part of the hollander but follow by a different result a captain name haranguer concerted with one adrien vandenberg a plan for the surprise of breda on the possession of which prince maurice have set a great value the associate contrived to conceal in a boat laden with turf -lrb- which form the principal fuel of the inhabitant of that part of the country -rrb- and of which vandenberg be master eighty determine soldier and succeed in arrive close to the city without any suspicion be excite one of the soldier name matthew helt be suddenly afflict with a violent cough implore he comrade to put he to death to avoid the risk of a discovery but a corporal of the city guard have inspect the cargo with unsuspecting carelessness the immolation of the brave soldier become unnecessary and the boat be drag into the basin by the assistance of some of the very garrison who be so soon to fall victim to the stratagem at midnight the conceal soldier quit they hiding-place leap on shore kill the sentinel and easily become master of the citadel prince maurice follow close with he army soon force the town to submit and put it into so good a state of defense that count mansfield who be send to retake it be oblige to retreat after useless effort to fulfil he mission the duke of parma whose constitution be severely injure by the constant fatigue of war and the anxiety attend on the late transaction have snatch a short interval for the purpose of recruit he health at the water of spa while at that place he receive urgent order from philip to abandon for a while all he proceedings in the netherland and to hasten into france with he whole disposable force to assist the army of the league the battle of yvrus -lrb- in which the son of the unfortunate count egmont meet he death while fight in the service of he father 's royal murderer -rrb- have raise the prospects and hope of henry iv to a high pitch and pari which he closely besiege be on the point of yield to he arm the duke of parma receive he uncle 's order with great repugnance and lament the necessity of leave the field of he former exploit open to the enterprise and talent of prince maurice he nevertheless obey and leave count mansfield at the head of the government he conduct he troops against the royal opponent who alone seem fully worthy of cope with he the attention of all europe be now fix on the exciting spectacle of a contest between these two greatest captain of the age the glory of success the fruit of consummate skill be gain by alexander who by a admirable maneuver get possession of the town of lagny-sur-seine under the very eye of henry and he whole army and thus acquire the means of provide pari with everything requisite for its defense the french monarch see all he project baffle and he hope frustrate while he antagonist have fully complete he object draw off he army through champagne and make a fine retreat through a enemy 's country harass at every step but with scarcely any loss but while this expedition add greatly to the renown of the general it considerably injure the cause of spain in the low country prince maurice take prompt advantage of the absence of he great rival have make himself master of several fortress and some spanish regiment have mutiny against the commander leave behind by the duke of parma other encourage by the impunity they enjoy be ready on the slightest pretext to follow they example maurice do not lose a single opportunity of profit by circumstance so favorable and even after the return of alexander he seize on zutphen deventer and nimeguen despite all the effort of the spanish army the duke of parma daily break down under the progress of disease and agitate by these reverse repair again to spa take at once every possible means for the recruitment of he army and the recovery of he health on which its discipline and the chance of success now so evidently depend but all he plan be again frustrate by a renewal of philip 's peremptory order to march once more into france to uphold the fail cause of the league against the intrepidity and talent of henry iv at this juncture the emperor rodolf again offer he mediation between spain and the united province but it be not likely that the confederated state at the very moment when they cause begin to triumph and they commerce be every day become more and more flourish would consent to make any compromise with the tyranny they be at length in a fair way of crush the duke of parma again appear in france in the beginning of the year 1592 and have form he communication with the army of the league march to the relief of the city of rouen at that period press to the last extremity by the huguenot force after some sharp skirmish -- and one in particular in which henry iv suffer he valor to lead he into a too rash exposure of he own and he army 's safety -- a series of maneuver take place which display the talent of the rival general in the most brilliant aspect alexander at length succeed in raise the siege of rouen and make himself master of condebec which command the navigation of the seine henry take advantage of what appear a irreparable fault on the part of the duke invest he army in the hazardous position he have choose but while believe that he have the whole of he enemy in he power he find that alexander have pass the seine with he entire force -- raise he military renown to the utmost possible height by a retreat which it be deem utterly impossible to effect on he return to the netherland the duke find himself again under the necessity of repair to spa in search of some relief from the suffering which be considerably increase by the effect of a wound receive in this last campaign in spite of he shattered constitution he maintain to the latest moment the most active endeavor for the reorganization of he army and he be prepare for a new expedition into france when fortunately for the good cause in both country he be surprise by death on the 3d of December 1592 at the abbey of st vaast near arras at the age of forty-seven year as it be hard to imagine that philip would suffer anyone who have excite he jealousy to die a natural death that of the duke of parma be attribute to slow poison alexander of parma be certainly one of the most remarkable and it may be add one of the greatest character of he day most historian have uphold he even higher perhaps than he should be place on the scale assert that he can be reproach with very few of the vice of the age in which he live other consider this judgment too favorable and accuse he of participation in all the crime of philip whom he serve so zealously he have excite the jealousy of the tyrant or even have he be put to death by he order would little influence the question for philip be quite capable of ingratitude or murder to either a accomplice or a opponent of he baseness but even allow that alexander 's fine quality be sully by he complicity in these odious measure we must still in justice admit that they be too much in the spirit of the time and particularly of the school in which he be train and while we lament that he political or private fault place he on so low a level we must rank he as one of the very first master in the art of war in he own or any other age chapter xiv to the independence of belgium and the death of philip ii ad 1592 -- 1599 the duke of parma have choose the count of mansfield for he successor and the nomination be approve by the king he enter on he government under most disheartening circumstance the rapid conquest of prince maurice in brabant and flander be scarcely less mortifying than the total disorganization into which those two province have fall they be ravage by band of robber call picaroon whose audacity reach such a height that they oppose in large body the force send for they suppression by the government they on one occasion kill the provost of flander and burn he lieutenant in a hollow tree and on another they mutilate a whole troop of the national militia and they commander with circumstance of most revolting cruelty the authority of governor-general though not the title be now fully share by the count of fuente who be send to brussels by the king of spain and the ill effect of this double viceroyalty be soon see in the brilliant progress of prince maurice and the continual reverse sustain by the royalist army the king still bent on project of bigotry sacrifice without scruple man and treasure for the overthrow of henry iv and the success of the league the affair of the netherland seem now a secondary object and he draw largely on he force in that country for reinforcement to the rank of he totter ally a final blow be however strike against the hope of intolerance in france and to the existence of the league by the conversion of henry iv to the catholic religion he deem theological dispute which put the happiness of a whole kingdom in jeopardy as quite subordinate to the public good such be the prosperity of the united province that they have be enable to send a large supply both of money and man to the aid of henry they constant and generous ally and notwithstanding this they army and fleet so far from suffer diminution be augmented day by day philip resolve to summon up all he energy for the revival of the war against the republic now appoint the archduke ernest brother of the emperor rodolf to the post which the disunion of mansfield and fuente render as embarrassing as it have become inglorious this prince of a gentle and conciliatory character be receive at brussels with great magnificence and general joy he presence revive the deep-felt hope of peace entertain by the suffer people such be also the cordial wish of the prince but more than one design form at this period against the life of prince maurice frustrated every expectation of the kind a priest of the province of namur name michael renichon disguise as a soldier be the new instrument mean to strike another blow at the greatness of the house of nassau in the person of its gallant representative prince maurice as also in that of he brother frederic henry then ten year of age on the confession of the intended assassin he be employ by count berlaimont to murder the two prince renichon happily mismanage the affair and betray he intention he be arrest at breda conduct to the hague and there try and execute on the 3d of June 1594 this miserable wretch accuse the archduke ernest of have countenance he attempt but nothing whatever tend to criminate while every probability acquit that prince of such a participation in this same year a soldier name peter dufor embark in a like atrocious plot he too be seize and execute before he could carry it into effect and to he die hour persist in accuse the archduke of be he instigator but neither the judge who try nor the best historian who record he intended crime give any belief to this accusation the mild and honorable disposition of the prince hold a sufficient guarantee against its likelihood and it be not less please to be able fully to join in the prevalent opinion than to mark a spirit of candor and impartiality break forth through the mass of bad and violent passion which crowd the record of that age but all the esteem inspire by the personal character of ernest could not overcome the repugnance of the united province to trust to the apparent sincerity of the tyrant in whose name he make he overture for peace they be all respectfully and firmly reject and prince maurice in the meantime with he usual activity pass the meuse and the rhine and invest and quickly take the town of groningen by which he consummate the establishment of the republic and secure its rank among the principal power of europe the archduke ernest find all he effort for peace frustrated and all hope of gain he object by hostility to be vain become a prey to disappointment and regret and die from the effect of a slow fever on the 21st of February 1595 leave to the count of fuente the honor and anxiety of the government subject to the ratification of the king this nobleman begin the exercise of he temporary function by a irruption into france at the head of a small army war have be declare against spain by henry iv who on he side have despatch the admiral de villars to attack philip 's possession in hainault and artoi this gallant officer lose a battle and he life in the contest and fuente encourage by the victory take some frontier town and lay siege to cambray the great object of he plan the citizen who detest they governor the marquis of bolognus who have for some time assume a independent tyranny over they give up the place to the besieger and the citadel surrender some day later after this exploit fuente return to brussels where notwithstanding he success he be extremely unpopular he have place a part of he force under the command of mondragon one of the oldest and cleverest officer in the service of spain some trifling affair take place in brabant but the arrival of the archduke albert whom the king have appoint to succeed he brother ernest in the office of governor-general deprive fuente of any further opportunity of signalize he talent for supreme command albert arrive at brussels on the 11th of February 1596 accompany by the prince of orange who when count of beuren have be carry off from the university of louvain twenty-eight year previously and hold captive in spain during the whole of that period the archduke albert fifth son of the emperor maximilian ii and brother of rodolf stand high in the opinion of philip he uncle and merit he reputation for talent bravery and prudence he have be early make archbishop of toledo and afterward cardinal but he profession be not that of these nominal dignity he be a warrior and politician of considerable capacity and have for some year faithfully serve the king as viceroy of portugal but philip mean he for the more independent situation of sovereign of the netherland and at the same time destine he to be the husband of he daughter isabellum he now send he in the capacity of governor-general to prepare the way for the important change at once to gain the good grace of the people and soothe by this removal from philip 's too close neighborhood the jealousy of he son the hereditary prince of spain albert bring with he to brussels a small reinforcement for the army with a large supply of money more want at this conjuncture than man he highly praise the conduct of fuente in the operation just finish and resolve to continue the war on the same plan but with force much superior he open he first campaign early and by a display of clever manoeuvring which threaten a attempt to force the french to raise the siege of la fere in the heart of picardy he conceal he real design -- the capture of calai and he succeed in its completion almost before it be suspect the spanish and walloon troops lead on by rone a distinguished officer carry the first defence : after nine day of siege the place be force to surrender and in a few more the citadel follow the example the archduke soon after take the town of ardre and hulst and by prudently avoid a battle to which he be constantly provoke by henry iv who command the french army in person he establish he character for military talent of no ordinary degree he at the same time make overture of reconciliation to the united province and hope that the return of the prince of orange would be a means of effect so desirable a purpose but the dutch be not to be deceive by the apparent sincerity of spanish negotiation they even doubt the sentiment of the prince of orange whose attachment and principle bad be form in so hate a school and nothing pass between they and he but mutual civility they clearly evince they disapprobation of he intended visit to holland and he consequently fix he residence in brussels pass he life in a inglorious neutrality a naval expedition form in this year by the english and dutch against cadiz command by the earl of essex and count loui and william of nassau cousin of prince maurice be crown with brilliant success and somewhat console the province for the contemporary exploit of the archduke but the following year open with a affair which at once prove he unceasing activity and add largely to the reputation of he rival prince maurice the former have detach the count of vara with about six thousand man for the purpose of invade the province of holland but maurice with equal energy and superior talent follow big movement come up with he near turnhout on the 24th of January 1597 and after a sharp action of which the dutch cavalry bear the whole brunt vara be kill and he troops defeat with considerable loss this action may be take as a fair sample of the difficulty with which any estimate can be form of the relative loss on such occasion the dutch historian state the loss of the royalist in kill at upward of two thousand meteren a good authority say the peasant bury two thousand two hundred and fifty while bentivoglio a italian writer in the interest of spain make the number exactly half that amount grotius say that the loss of the dutch be four man kill bentivoglio state it at one hundred but at either computation it be clear that the affair be a brilliant one on the part of prince maurice this be in its consequence a most disastrous affair to the archduke he army be disorganize and he finances exhaust while the confidence of the state in they troops and they general be considerably raise but the taking of amien by portocarrero one of the most enterprising of the spanish captain give a new turn to the fail fortune of albert this gallant officer whose greatness of mind accord to some historian be much disproportioned to the smallness of he person gain possession of that important town by a well-conducted stratagem and maintain he conquest valiantly till he be kill in its defense henry iv make prodigious effort to recover the place the chief bulwark on that side of france and have force montenegro the worthy successor of portocarrero to capitulate grant he and he garrison most honorable condition henry have secure amien against any new attack return to pari and make a triumphal entry into the city during this year prince maurice take a number of town in rapid succession and the state accord to they custom cause various medal in gold silver and copper to be strike to commemorate the victory which have signalize they arm philip ii feel himself approach the termination of he long and agitating career now wholly occupied himself in negotiation for peace with france henry iv desire it as anxiously the pope clement viii encourage by he exhortation this mutual inclination the king of poland send ambassador to the hague and to london to induce the state and queen elizabeth to become party in a general pacification these overture lead to no conclusion but the conference between france and spain go on with apparent cordiality and great promptitude and a peace be conclude between these power at vervin on the 2d of may 1598 shortly after the publication of this treaty another important act be make know to the world by which philip cede to albert and isabella on they be formally affianced -- a ceremony which now take place -- the sovereignty of burgundy and the netherland this act bear date the 6th of may and be proclaim with all the solemnity due to so important a transaction it contain thirteen article and be base on the misfortune which the absence of the sovereign have hitherto cause to the low country the catholic religion be declare that of the state in its full integrity the province be guarantee against dismemberment the archduke by which title the joint sovereign be designate without any distinction of sex be secure in the possession with right of succession to they child and a provision be add that in default of posterity they possession should revert to the spanish crown the infanta isabellum soon send she procuration to the archduke she affianced husband give he full power and authority to take possession of the cede dominion in she name as in he own and albert be inaugurate with great pomp at brussels on the 22d of August have put everything in order for the regulation of the government during he absence he set out for spain for the purpose of accomplish he spousal and bring back he bride to the chief seat of they joint power but before he departure he write to the various state of the republic and to prince maurice himself strongly recommend submission and reconciliation these letter receive no answer a new plot against the life of prince maurice by a wretched individual name peter pann have arouse the indignation of the country and determine it to treat with suspicion and contempt every insidious proposition from the tyranny it defy albert place he uncle the cardinal andrew of austrium at the head of the temporary government and set out on he journey take the little town of halle in he route and place at the altar of the virgin who be there hold in particular honor he cardinal 's hat as a token of he veneration he have not make much progress when he receive account of the demise of philip ii who die after long suffering and with great resignation on the 13th of September 1598 at the age of seventy-two albert be several month on he journey through germany and the ceremonial of he union with the infanta do not take place till the 18th of April 1599 when it be finally solemnize in the city of valencium in spain this transaction by which the netherland be positively erect into a separate sovereignty seem naturally to make the limit of another epoch in they history it completely decide the division between the northern and southern province which although it have virtually take place long previous to this period could scarcely be consider as formally consummate until now here then we shall pause anew and take a rapid review of the social state of the netherland during the last half century which be beyond all doubt the most important period of they history from the earliest time till the present it have be see that when charle v resign he throne and the possession of he vast dominion to he son art commerce and manufacture have rise to a state of considerable perfection throughout the netherland the revolution of which we have trace the rise and progress naturally produce to those province which relapse into slavery a most lamentable change in every branch of industry and strike a blow at the general prosperity the effect of which be feel to this very day art science and literature be sure to be check and wither in the blaze of civil war and we have now to mark the retrograde movement of most of those charm and advantage of civilized life in which flander and the other southern state be so rich the rapid spread of enlightenment on religious subject soon convert the manufactory and workshop of flander into so many conventicle of reform and the clear-sighted artisan flee in thousand from the tyranny of alva into england germany and holland -- those happier country where the government adopt and go hand in hand with the progress of rational belief commerce follow the fate of manufacture the foreign merchant one by one abandon the theater of bigotry and persecution and even antwerp which have succeed bruge as the great mart of european traffic be ruin by the horrible excess of the spanish soldiery and never recover from the shock its trade its wealth and its prosperity be gradually transfer to amsterdam rotterdam and the town of holland and zealand and the growth of dutch commerce attain its proud maturity in the establishment of the indium company in 1596 the effect of which we shall have hereafter more particularly to dwell on the exciting and romantic enterprise of the portuguese and spanish navigator in the fifteenth and sixteenth century rouse all the ardor of other nation for those distant adventure and the people of the netherland be early influence by the general spirit of europe if they be not the discoverer of new world they be

labor for the discovery of new outlet for they commerce and navigation the government encourage the speculation of individual which promise fresh and fertile source of revenue so necessary for the maintenance of the war until the year 1581 the merchant of holland and zealand be satisfy to find the production of indium at lisbon which be the mart of that branch of trade ever since the portuguese discover the passage by the cape of good hope but philip ii have conquer portugal exclude the united province from the port of that country and they enterprising mariner be from that period drive to those effort which rapidly lead to private fortune and general prosperity the english have open the way in this career and the states-general have offer a large reward for the discovery of a northwest passage frequent and most adventurous voyage take place houtman le maire heemskirk ryp and other become celebrated for they enterprise and some for they perilous and interesting adventure the united province be soon without any rival on the sea in europe alone they have one thousand two hundred merchant ship in activity and upward of seventy thousand sailor constantly employ they build annually two thousand vessel in the year 1598 eighty ship sail from they port for the indy or america they carry on besides a extensive trade on the coast of guinea whence they bring large quantity of gold-dust and find in short in all quarter of the globe the reward of they skill industry and courage the spirit of conquest soon become graft on the habit of trade expedition succeed to expedition

finances be exhaust by payment make to the numerous spanish and italian mutineer have leave order with mendoza to secure some place on the rhine which might open a passage for free quarter in the enemy 's country but this unprincipled officer force he way into the neutral district of cleve and westphalium and with a body of executioner ready to hang up all who might resist and of priest to prepare they for death he carry such terror on he march that no opposition be venture the atrocious cruelty of mendoza and he troops baffle all description : on one occasion they murder in cold blood the count of walkenstein who surrender he castle on the express condition of he freedom and they commit every possible excess that may be imagine of ferocious soldiery encourage by a base commander prince maurice soon put into motion to oppose this army of brigand he small disposable force of about seven thousand man with these however and a succession of masterly maneuver he contrived to preserve the republic from invasion and to paralyze and almost destroy a army three time superior in number to he own the horror commit by the spaniard in the midst of peace and without the slightest provocation could not fail to excite the utmost indignation in a nation so fond of liberty and so proud as germany the duchy of cleve feel particularly aggrieved and sybillum the sister of the duke a real heroine in a glorious cause so work on the excited passion of the people by she eloquence and she tear that she persuade all the order of the state to unite against the odious enemy some troops be suddenly raise and a league be form between several prince of the empire to revenge the common cause the count de la lippe be choose general of they united force and the choice could not have fall on one more certainly incapable or more probably treacherous the german army with they usual want of activity do not open the campaign till the month of June it consist of fourteen thousand man and never be a army so badly conduct without money artillery provision or discipline it be at any moment ready to break up and abandon its incompetent general and on the very first encounter with the enemy and after a loss of a couple of hundred man it become self-disbanded and fly in every direction not a single man could be rally to clear away this disgrace the states-general cruelly disappoint at this result of measure from which they have look for so important a diversion in they favor now resolve on a vigorous exertion of they own energy and determine to undertake a naval expedition of a magnitude greater than any they have hitherto attempt the force of public opinion be at this period more powerful than it have ever yet be in the united province for a great number of the inhabitant who during the life of philip ii conscientiously believe that they could not lawfully abjure the authority once recognize and swear to become now liberate from those respectable although absurd scruple and the death of one unfeeling despot give thousand of new citizen to the state a fleet of seventy-three vessel carry eight thousand man be soon equip under the order of admiral vander go and after a series of attempt on the coast of spain portugal africa and the canary isle this expedition from which the most splendid result be expect be shatter dispersed and reduce to nothing by a succession of unheard-of mishap to these disappointment be now add domestic dissension in the republic in consequence of the new tax absolutely necessary for the exigency of the state the conduct of queen elizabeth greatly add to the general embarrassment : she call for the payment of she former loan insist on the recall of the english troops and declare she resolution to make peace with spain several german prince promise aid in man and money but never furnished either and in this most critical juncture henry iv be the only foreign sovereign who do not abandon the republic he send they one thousand swiss troops whom he have in he pay allow they to levy three thousand more in france and give they a loan of two hundred thousand crown -- a very convenient supply in they exhaust state the archduke albert and isabellum arrive in the netherland in September and make they entrance into brussels with unexampled magnificence they soon find themselves in a situation quite as critical as be that of the united province and both party display immense energy to remedy they mutual embarrassment the winter be extremely rigorous so much so as to allow of military operation be undertake on the

arrive on the 20th of that month under the wall of bruge some previous negotiation with that town have lead the prince to expect that it would have open its gate at he approach in this he be however disappointed and after take possession of some fort in the neighborhood he continue he march to nieuport which place he invest on the 1st of July at the news of this invasion the archduke though take by surprise display a promptness and decision that prove they worthy of the sovereignty which seem at stake with incredible activity they muster in a few day a army of twelve thousand man which they pass in review near ghent on this occasion isabellum prove she title to a place among those heroic woman with whom the age abound ride through the royalist rank and harangue they in a style of

come up on the morning of the 2d of July with a large body of those of the state consist of about three thousand man send forward under the command of count ernest of nassau to reconnoitre and judge of the extent of this most unexpected movement : for prince maurice be in he turn completely surprise and not merely by one of those maneuver of war by which the best general be sometimes deceive but by a exertion of political vigor and capacity of which history offer few more striking example such a circumstance however serve only to draw forth a fresh display of those uncommon talent which in so many various accident of war have place maurice on the highest rank for military talent the detachment under count ernest of nassau be chiefly compose of scottish infantry and this small force stand firmly oppose to the impetuous attack of the whole royalist army -- thus give time to the main body under the prince to take up a position and form in order of battle count ernest be at length drive back with the loss of eight hundred man kill almost all scottish and be cut off from the rest of the army be force to take refuge in ostend which town be in possession of the troops of the state the army of albert now march on flush with this first success and confident of final victory prince maurice receive they with the courage of a gallant soldier and the precaution of a consummate general he have cause the fleet of ship of war and transport which have sail along the coast from zealand and land supplies of ammunition and provision to retire far from the share so as to leave to he army no chance of escape but in victory the commissioner from the state who always accompany the prince as a council of observation rather than of war have retire to ostend in great consternation to wait the issue of the battle which now seem inevitable a scene of deep feeling and heroism be the next episode of this memorable day and throw the charm of natural affection over those circumstance in which glory too seldom leave a place for the softer emotion of the heart when the patriot army be in its position and firmly wait the advance of the foe prince maurice turn to he brother frederick henry then sixteen year of age and several young nobleman english french and german who like he attend on the great captain to learn the art of war : he point out in a few word the perilous situation in which he be place declare he resolution to conquer or perish on the battlefield and recommend the boyish band to retire to ostend and wait for some less desperate occasion to share he renown or revenge he fall frederick henry spurn the affectionate suggestion and swear to stand by he brother to the last and all he young companion adopt the same generous resolution the army of the state be place in order of battle about a league in front of nieuport in the sand hill with which the neighborhood abound its left wing rest on the seashore its loss of the morning and of the garrison leave in

other distinguished captain the archduke muster spaniard italian walloon and irish in he rank lead on by mendoza la berlotta and they fellow-veteran both army be in the highest state of discipline train to war by long service and enthusiastic in the several cause which they serve the two highest principle of enthusiasm urge they on -- religious fanaticism on the one hand and the love of freedom on the other the rival general ride along they respective line address a few brief sentence of encouragement to they man and presently the bloody contest begin it be three o'clock in the afternoon when the archduke commence the attack he advanced guard command by mendoza and compose of those former mutineer who now resolve to atone for they misconduct march across the sand-hill with desperate resolution they soon come into contact with the english contingent under franci vere who be desperately wound in the shock the assault be almost irresistible the english bear down by number be force to give way but the main body press on to they support horace vere step forward to supply he brother 's place not a inch of ground more be gain or lose the firing cease and pike and sword cross each other in the resolute conflict of man to man the action become general along the whole line the two commanders-in-chief be at all point nothing could exceed they mutual display of skill and courage at length the spanish cavalry break by the well-directed fire of the patriot artillery fall back on they infantry and throw it into confusion the archduke at the same instant be wound by a lance in the cheek unhorse and force to quit the field the report of he death and the sight of he war-steed gallop alone across the field spread alarm through the royalist rank prince maurice see and seize on the critical moment he who have so patiently maintain he position for three hour of desperate conflict now know the crisis for a prompt and general advance he give the word and lead on to the charge and the victory be at once he own the defeat of the royalist army be complete the whole of the artillery baggage standard and ammunition fall into the possession of the conqueror night come on save those who flee and the nature of the ground prevent the cavalry from consummate the destruction of the whole as far as the conflict account of the various historian may be compare and calculate on the

furnish with a fresh horse gain bruge in safety but he only wait there long enough to join he heroic wife with whom he proceed rapidly to ghent and thence to brussels mendoza be wound and take prisoner and with difficulty save by prince maurice from the fury of the german auxiliary the moral effect produce by this victory on the vanquisher and vanquish and on the state of public opinion throughout europe be immense but its immediate consequence be incredibly trifling not one result in a military point of view follow a event which appear almost decisive of the war nieuport be again invest three day after the battle but a strong reinforcement enter the place save it from all danger and maurice find himself force for want of supplies to abandon the scene of he greatest exploit he return to holland welcome by the acclamation of he grateful country and exciting the jealousy and hatred of all who envy he glory or fear he power among the sincere and conscientious republican who see danger to the public liberty in the grow influence of a successful soldier place at the head of affair and endear to the people by every hereditary and personal claim be olden barneveldt the pensionary and from this period may be trace the growth of the mutual antipathy which lead to the sacrifice of the most virtuous statesman of holland and the eternal disgrace of its hitherto heroic chief the state of the catholic province assemble at brussels now give the archduke to understand that nothing but peace could satisfy they wish or save the country from exhaustion and ruin albert see the reasonableness of they remonstrance and attempt to carry the great object into effect the states-general listen to he proposal commissioner be appoint on both side to treat of term they meet at berg-op-zoom but they conference be break up almost as soon as commence the spanish deputy insist on the submission of the republic to its ancient master such a proposal be worse than insulting it prove the inveterate insincerity of those with whom it originate and who know it could not be entertain for a moment preparation for hostility be therefore commence on both side and the whole of the winter be thus employ early in the spring prince maurice open the campaign at the head of sixteen thousand man chiefly compose of english and french who seem throughout the contest to forget they national animosity and to know no rivalry but that of emulation in the cause of liberty the town of rhinberg soon fall into the hand of the prince he next attempt be against bois-le-duc and the siege of this place be signalize by a event that flavor of the chivalric contest now go out of fashion a norman gentleman of the name of breaute in the service of prince maurice challenge the royalist garrison to meet he and twenty of he comrade in arm under the wall of the place the cartel be accept by a fleming name abramzoom but better know by the epithet leckerbeetje -lrb- savory bit -rrb- who with twenty more meet breaute and he friend the combat be desperate the flemish champion be kill at the first shock by he norman challenger but the latter fall into the hand of the enemy they treacherously and cruelly put he to death in violation of the strict condition of the fight prince maurice be force to raise the siege of bois-le-duc and turn he attention in another direction the archduke albert have now resolve to invest ostend a place of great importance to the united province but little worth to either party in comparison with the dreadful waste of treasure and human life which be the consequence of its memorable siege sir franci vere command in the place at the period of its final investment but governor garrison and besieging force be renew and replace with a rapidity which give one of the most frightful instance of the ravages of war the siege of ostend last upward of three year it become a school for the young nobility of all europe who repair to either one or the other party to learn the principle and the practice of attack and defense everything that the art of strategy could devise be resort to on either side the slaughter in the various assault sortie and bombardment be enormous squadron at sea give a double interest to the land operation and the celebrated brother frederick and ambrose spinolum found they reputation on these oppose element frederick be kill in one of the naval combat with the dutch galley and the fame of reduce ostend be reserve for ambrose this afterward celebrated general have undertake the command at the earnest entreaty of the archduke and the king of spain and by the firmness and vigor of he measure he revive the courage of the worn-out assailant of the place redouble attack and multiply mine at length reduce the town to a mere mass of ruin and scarcely leave its still undaunted garrison sufficient footing on which to prolong they desperate defense ostend at length surrender on the 22d of September 1604 and the victor march in over its crumble wall and shatter battery scarcely a vestige of the place remain beyond those terrible evidence of destruction its ditch fill up with the rubbish of rampart bastion and redoubt leave no distinct line of separation between the operation of its attack and its defense it resemble rather a vast sepulchre than a ruin town a mountain of earth and rubbish without a single house in which the wretched remnant of the inhabitant could hide they head -- a monument of desolation on which victory might have sit and weep during the progress of this memorable siege queen elizabeth of england have die after a long and it must be pronounce a glorious reign though the glory belong rather to the nation than to the monarch whose memory be mark with indelible stain of private cruelty as in the case of essex and mary queen of scot and of public wrong as in that of she whole system of tyranny in ireland with respect to the united province she be a harsh protectress and a capricious ally she in turn advise they to remain faithful to the old impurity of religion and to they intolerable king refuse to incorporate they with she own state and then use she best effort for subject they to she sway she seem to take pleasure in the uncertainty to which she reduce they by constant demand for payment of she loan and threat of make peace with spain thus the states-general be not much affect by the news of she death and so rejoiced be they at the accession of jame i to the throne of england that all the bell of holland ring out merry peal bonfire be set blaze all over the country a letter of congratulation be despatch to the new monarch and it be speedily follow by a solemn embassy compose of prince frederick henry the grand pensionary de barneveldt and other of the first dignitary of the republic these ambassador be grievously disappoint at the reception give to they by jame who treat they as little better than rebel to they lawful king but this first disposition to contempt and insult be soon overcome by the unite talent of barneveldt and the great duke of sully who be at the same period ambassador from france at the english court the result of the negotiation be a agreement between those two power to take the republic under they protection and use they best effort for obtain the recognition of its independence by spain the states-general consider themselves amply recompense for the loss of ostend by the taking of ecluse rhinberg and grave all of which have in the interval surrender to prince maurice but they be seriously alarmed on find themselves abandon by king jame who conclude a separate peace with philip iii of spain in the month of August this year this event give rise to a question very important to the honor of jame and consequently to england itself as the act of the absolute monarch of those day must be consider as those of the nation which submit to such a form of government historian of great authority have assert that it appear that by a secret agreement the king have expressly reserve the power of send assistance to holland other deny the existence of this secret article and lean heavily on the reputation of jame for he conduct in the transaction it must be consider a very doubtful point and be to be judge rather by subsequent event than by any direct testimony the two monarch stipulate in the treaty that neither be to give support of any kind to the revolted subject of the other it be nevertheless true that jame do not withdraw he troops from the service of the state but he authorize the spaniard to levy soldier in england the united province be at once afflict and indignant at this equivocal conduct they first impulse be to deprive the english of the liberty of navigate the scheldt they even arrest the progress of several of they merchant-ship but soon after gratify at find that jame receive they deputy with the title of ambassador they resolve to dissimulate they resentment prince maurice and spinolum now take the field with they respective army and a rapid series of operation place they in direct contact display they talent in the most striking point of view the first step on the part of the prince be a new invasion of flander and a attempt on antwerp which he hope to carry before the spanish army could arrive to its succor but the promptitude and sagacity of spinolum defeat this plan which maurice be oblige to abandon after some loss while the royalist general resolve to signalize himself by some important movement and ere he design be suspect he have penetrate into the province of overyssel and thus retort he rival 's favorite measure of carry the war into the enemy 's country several town be rapidly reduce but maurice fly toward the threaten province and by he active measure force spinolum to fall back on the rhine and take up a position near roeroord where he be impetuously attack by the dutch army but the cavalry have follow up too slowly the order of maurice he hope of surprising the royalist be frustrated and the spanish force gain time by this hesitation soon change the fortune of the day the dutch cavalry shamefully take to flight despite the gallant endeavor of both maurice and he brother frederick henry and at this juncture a large reinforcement of spaniard arrive under the command of velasco maurice now bring forward some company of english and french infantry under horatio vere and d'omerville also a distinguished officer the battle be again fiercely renew and the spaniard now give way and have be completely defeat have not spinola put in practice a old and generally successful stratagem he cause almost all the drum of he army to beat in one direction so as to give the impression that a still larger reinforcement be approach maurice apprehensive that the former panic might find a parallel in a fresh one prudently order a retreat which he be able to effect in good order in preference to risk the total disorganization of he troops the loss on each side be nearly the same but the glory of this hard-fought day remain on the side of spinolum who prove himself a worthy successor of the great duke of parma and a antagonist with whom maurice might contend without dishonor the naval transaction of this year restore the balance which spinolum 's success have begin to turn in favor of the royalist cause a squadron of ship command by hautain admiral of zealand attack a superior force of spanish vessel close to dover and defeat they with considerable loss but the victory be sully by a act of great barbarity all the soldier find on board the capture ship be tie two and two and mercilessly fling into the sea some contrived to extricate themselves and gain the shore by swim other be pick up by the english boat whose crew witness the scene and hasten to they relief the generous british seaman could not remain neuter in such a moment nor repress they indignation against those whom they have hitherto so long consider as friend the dutch vessel pursue those of spain which flee into dover harbor be fire on by the cannon of the castle and force to give up the chase the english loudly complain that the dutch have on this occasion violate they territory and this transaction lay the foundation of the quarrel which subsequently break out between england and the republic and which the jealousy of rival merchant in either state unceasingly foment in this year also the dutch succeed in capture the chief of the dunkirk privateer which have so long annoy they trade and they cruelly order sixty of the prisoner to be put to death but the people more humane than the authority rescue they from the executioner and set they free but these domestic instance of success and inhumanity be trifling in comparison with the splendid train of distant event accompany by a course of wholesale benevolence that redeem the trait of petty guilt the maritime enterprise of holland force by the imprudent policy of spain to seek a wider career than in the narrow sea of europe be day by day extend in the indy to ruin if possible they increase trade philip iii send out the admiral hurtado with a fleet of eight galleon and thirty-two galley the dutch squadron of five vessel command by wolfert hermanszoon attack they off the coast of malabar and he temerity be crown with great success he take two of they vessel and completely drive the remainder from the indian sea he then conclude a treaty with the native of the isle of banda by which he promise to support they against the spaniard and portuguese on condition that they be to give he fellow-countryman the exclusive privilege of purchase the spice of the island this treaty be the foundation of the influence which the dutch so soon succeed in form in the east indy and they establish it by a candid mild and tolerant conduct strongly contrast with the pride and bigotry which have signalize every act of the portuguese and spaniard the prodigious success of the indian trade occasion numerous society to be form all through the republic but by they great number they become at length injurious to each other the spirit of speculation be push too far and the merchant who pay enormous price for indium goods find themselves force to sell in europe at a loss many of those society be too weak in military force as well as in capital to resist the armed competition of the spaniard and to support themselves in they dispute with the native prince at length the states-general resolve to unite the whole of these scatter partnership into one grand company which be soon organize on a solid basis that lead ere long to incredible wealth at home and a rapid succession of conquest in the east chapter xvi to the synod at dort and the execution of barneveldt ad 1606 -- 1619 the states-general now resolve to confine they military operation to a war merely defensive spinolum have by he conduct during the late campaign completely revive the spirit of the spanish troops and excite at least the caution of the dutch he now threaten the united province with invasion and he exert he utmost effort to raise the supplies necessary for the execution of he plan he not only exhaust the resource of the king of spain and the archduke but obtain money on he private account from all those usurer who be tempt by he confident anticipation of conquest he soon equip two army of about twelve thousand man each at the head of one of those he take the field the other command by the count of bucquous be destine to join he in the neighborhood of utrecht and he be then resolve to push forward with the whole united force into the very heart of the republic prince maurice in the meantime concentrate he army amount to twelve thousand man and prepare to make head against he formidable opponent by a succession of the most prudent maneuver he contrived to keep spinolum in check disconcert all he project and force he to content himself with the capture of two or three town -- a comparatively insignificant conquest desire to wipe away the disgrace of this discomfiture and to risk everything for the accomplishment of he grand design spinolum use every method to provoke the prince to a battle even though a serious mutiny among he troops and the impossibility of form a junction with bucquous have reduce he force below that of maurice but the latter to the surprise of all who expect a decisive blow retreat from before the italian general -- abandon the town of groll which immediately fall into spinolum 's power and give rise to manifold conjecture and infinite discontent at conduct so little in unison with he wonted enterprise and skill even henry iv acknowledge it do not answer the expectation he have form from maurice 's splendid talent for war the fact seem to be that the prince much as he value victory dreaded peace more and that he be resolve to avoid a decisive blow which in put a end to the contest would at the same time have decrease the individual influence in the state which he ambition now urge he to augment by every possible mean the dutch naval expedition this year be not more brilliant than those on land admiral hautain with twenty ship be surprise off cape st vincent by the spanish fleet the formidable appearance of they galleon inspire on this occasion a perfect panic among the dutch sailor they hoist they sail and flee with the exception of one ship command by vice-admiral klaazoon whose desperate conduct save the national honor have hold out until he vessel be quite unmanageable and almost he whole crew kill or wound he prevail on the rest to agree to the resolution he have form kneel down on the deck and put up a brief prayer for pardon for the act thrust a light into the powder-magazine and be instantly blow up with he companion only two man be snatch from the sea by the spaniard and even these dreadfully burn and mangled die in the utterance of curse on the enemy this disastrous occurrence be soon however forget in the rejoicing for a brilliant victory gain the following year by heemskirk so celebrated for he voyage to nova zemblum and by he conduct in the east he set sail from the port of holland in the month of march determine to signalize himself by some great exploit now necessary to redeem the disgrace which have begin to sully the reputation of the dutch navy he soon get intelligence that the spanish fleet lay at anchor in the bay of gibraltar and he speedily prepare to offer they battle before the combat begin he hold a council of war and address the officer in a energetic speech in which he display the imperative call on they valor to conquer or die in the approach conflict he lead on to the action in he own ship and to the astonishment of both fleet he bear right down against the enormous galleon in which the flag of the spanish admiral-in-chief be hoist d'avilum could scarcely believe the evidence of he eye at this audacity : he at first burst into laughter at the notion but as heemskirk approach he cut he cable and attempt to escape under the shelter of the town the heroic dutchman pursue he through the whole of the spanish fleet and soon force he to action at the second broadside heemskirk have he left leg carry off by a cannon-ball and he almost instantly die exhort he crew to seek for consolation in the defeat of the enemy verhoef the captain of the ship conceal the admiral 's death and the whole fleet continue the action with a valor worthy the spirit in which it be commence the victory be soon decide : four of the spanish galleon be sink or burn the remainder flee and the citizen of cadiz tremble with the apprehension of sack and pillage but the death of heemskirk when make know to the survive victor seem completely to paralyze they they attempt nothing further but sailing back to holland with the body of they lament chief thus pay a greater tribute to he importance than be to be find in the mausoleum erect to he memory in the city of amsterdam -lrb- illustration : william the silent of orange -rrb- the news of this battle reach brussels before it be know in holland contribute not a little to quicken the anxiety of the archduke for peace the king of spain wear out by the war which drain he treasury have for some time ardently desire it the portuguese make loud complaint of the ruin that threaten they trade and they east indian colony the spanish minister be fatigue with the apparently interminable contest which baffle all they calculation spinola even in the midst of he brilliant career find himself so overwhelm with debt and so oppressed by the reproach of the numerous creditor who be ruin by he default of payment that he join in the general demand for repose in the month of may 1607 proposal be make by the archduke in compliance with the general desire and they two plenipotentiary van wittenhorst and gevaert repair to the hague public opinion in the united province be divide on this important question a instinctive hatred against the spaniard and long habit of warfare influence the great mass of the people to consider any overture for peace as some wily artifice aim at they religion and liberty war seem to open inexhaustible source of wealth while peace seem to threaten the extinction of the courage which be now as much a habit as war appear to be a want this reasoning be particularly convince to prince maurice whose fame with a large portion of he authority and revenue depend on the continuance of hostility : it be also strongly relish and support in zealand generally and in the chief town which dread the rivalry of antwerp but those who bear the burden of the war see the subject under a different aspect they fear that the present state of thing would lead to they conquest by the enemy or to the ruin of they liberty by the grow power of maurice they hope that peace would consolidate the republic and cause the reduction of the debt which now amount to twenty-six million florin at the head of the party who so reason be de barneveldt and he name be a guarantee with posterity for the wisdom of the opinion to allow the violent opposition to subside and to prevent any explosion of party feud the prudent barneveldt suggest a mere suspension of arm during which the permanent interest of both state might be calmly discuss he even undertake to obtain maurice 's consent to the armistice the prince listen to he argument and be apparently convince by they he at any rate sanction the proposal but he afterward complain that barneveldt have deceive he in represent the negotiation as a feint for the purpose of persuade the king of france and england to give greater aid to the republic it be more than likely that maurice reckon on the improbability of spain 's consent to the term of the propose treaty and on that chance withdraw a opposition which could scarcely be ascribe to any but motive of personal ambition it be however certain that he discontent at this transaction either with himself or barneveldt lay the foundation of that bitter enmity which prove fatal to the life of the latter and cover he own name otherwise glorious with undying reproach the united province positively refuse to admit even the commencement of a negotiation without the absolute recognition of they independence by the archduke a new ambassador be accordingly choose on the part of these sovereign and empower to concede this important admission this person attract considerable attention from he well-known quality as a able diplomatist he be a monk of the order of st franci name john de neyen a native of antwerp and a person as well verse in court intrigue as in the study of the cloister he in the first instance repair secretly to the hague and have several private interview with prince maurice and barneveldt before he be regularly introduce to the states-general in he official character two different journey be undertake by this agent between the hague and brussels before he could succeed in obtain a perfect understanding as to the specific view of the archduke the suspicion of the states-general seem fully justify by the dubious tone of the various communication which avoid the direct admission of the require preliminary as to the independence of the united province it be at length conclude in explicit term and a suspension of arm for eight month be the immediate consequence but the negotiation for peace be on the point of be completely break in consequence of the conduct of neyen who justify every doubt of he sincerity by a attempt to corrupt aarsen the greffier of the states-general or at least to influence he conduct in the progress of the treaty neyen present he in the name of the archduke and as a token of he esteem with a diamond of great value and a bond for fifty thousand crown aarsen accept these present with the approbation of prince maurice to whom he have confide the circumstance and who be no doubt delighted at what promise a rupture to the negotiation verreiken a councillor of state who assist neyen in he diplomatic labor be formally summon before the assemble states-general and there barneveldt hand to he the diamond and the bond and at the same time read he a lecture of true republican severity on the subject verreiken be overwhelm by the violent attack : he deny the authority of neyen for the measure he have take and remark that it be not surprising that monk naturally interested and avaricious judge other by themselves this repudiation of neyen 's suspicious conduct seem to have satisfy the stern resentment of barneveldt and the party which so earnestly labor for peace in spite of all the opposition of maurice and he partisan the negotiation go on in the month of January 1608 the various ambassador be assemble at the hague spinolum be the chief of the plenipotentiary appoint by the king of spain and jeannin president of the parliament of dijon a man of rare endowment represent france prince maurice accompany by he brother frederick henry the various count of nassau he cousin and a numerous escort advance some distance to meet spinolum convey he to the hague in he own carriage and lavish on he all the attention reciprocally due between two such renowned captain during the suspension of they rivalry the president richardst be with neyen and verreiken ambassador from the archduke but barneveldt and jeannin appear to have play the chief part in the important transaction which now fill all europe with anxiety every state be more or less concerned in the result and the three great monarchy of england france and spain have all a vital interest at stake the conference be therefore frequent and the debate assume a great variety of aspect which long keep the civilized world in suspense king jame be extremely jealous of the more prominent part take by the french ambassador and of the sub-altern consideration hold by he own envoy winwood and spencer in consequence of the disfavor in which he himself be hold by the dutch people it appear evident that whether deservedly or the contrary england be at this period unpopular in the united province while france be look up to with the greatest enthusiasm this be not surprising when we compare the character of henry iv and jame i bearing in mind how much of national reputation at the time depend on the personal conduct of king and how political situation influence if they do not create the virtue and vice of a people independent of the suspicion of he be altogether unfavorable to the declaration require by the united province from spain to which jame 's conduct have give rise he have establish some exaction which greatly embarrass they fishing expedition on the coast of england the main point for discussion and on which depend the decision for peace or war be those which concerned religion and the demand on the part of spain that the united province should renounce all claim to the navigation of the indian sea philip require for the catholic of the united province the free exercise of they religion this be oppose by the states-general : and the archduke albert see the impossibility of carry that point despatch he confessor fra inigo de briznellum to spain this dominican be furnish with the write opinion of several theologian that the king might conscientiously slur over the article of religion and he be the more successful with philip as the duke of lerma he prime minister be resolve to accomplish the peace at any price the conference at the hague be therefore not interrupt on this question but they go on slowly month be consume in discussion on article of trifling importance they be however resume in the month of August with greater vigor it be announce that the king of spain abandon the question respect religion but that it be in the certainty that he moderation would be recompense by ample concession on that of the indian trade on which he be inexorable this article become the rock on which the whole negotiation eventually split the court of spain on the one hand and the states-general on the other inflexibly maintain they opposing claim it be in vain that the ambassador turn and twist the subject with all the subtlety of diplomacy every possible expedient be use to shake the determination of the dutch but the influence of the east indium company the island of zealand and the city of amsterdam prevail over all report of the avowal on the part of the king of spain that he would never renounce he title to the sovereignty of the united province unless they abandon the indian navigation and grant the free exercise of religion throw the whole diplomatic corps into confusion and on the 25th of August the states-general announce to the marquis of spinolum and the other ambassador that the congress be dissolve and that all hope of peace be abandon nothing seem now likely to prevent the immediate renewal of hostility when the ambassador of france and england propose the mediation of they respective master for the conclusion of a truce for several year the king of spain and the archduke be well satisfy to obtain even this temporary cessation of the war but prince maurice and a portion of the province strenuously oppose the proposition the french and english ambassador however in concert with barneveldt who steadily maintain he influence labor incessantly to overcome those difficulty and finally succeed in overpower all opposition to the truce a new congress be agree on to assemble at antwerp for the consideration of the condition and the states-general agreed to remove from the hague to berg-or-zoom to be more within reach and ready to co-operate in the negotiation but before matter assume this favorable turn discussion and dispute have intervene on several occasion to render fruitless every effort of those who so incessantly labor for the great cause of humanity and the general good on one occasion barneveldt disgust with the opposition of prince maurice and he partisan have actually resign he employment but bring back by the solicitation of the states-general and reconcile to maurice by the intervention of jeannin the negotiation for the truce be resume and under the auspices of the ambassador they be happily terminate after two year ' delay this long-wished-for truce be conclude and sign on the 9th of April 1609 to continue for the space of twelve year this celebrated treaty contain thirty-two article and its fulfilment on either side be guarantee by the king of france and england notwithstanding the time take up in previous discussion the treaty be one of the most vague and unspecific state papers that exist the archduke in they own name and in that of the king of spain declare the united province to be free and independent state on which they renounce all claim whatever by the third article each party be to hold respectively the place which they possess at the commencement of the armistice the fourth and fifth article grant to the republic but in a phraseology obscure and even doubtful the right of navigation and free trade to the indy the eighth contain all that regard the exercise of religion and the remain clause be wholly relative to point of internal trade custom-house regulation and matter of private interest ephemeral and temporary as this peace appear it be receive with almost universal demonstration of joy by the population of the netherland in they two grand division everyone seem to turn toward the enjoyment of tranquillity with the animated composure of tired laborer look forward to a day of rest and sunshine this truce bring a calm of comparative happiness upon the country which a almost unremitting tempest have desolate for nearly half a century and after so long a series of calamity all the national advantage of social life seem about to settle on the land the attitude which the united province assume at this period be indeed a proud one they be not now compel to look abroad and solicit other state to become they master they have force they old tyrant to acknowledge they independence to come and ask for peace on they own ground and to treat with they on term of no doubtful equality they have already become so flourish so powerful and so envy that they who have so lately excited but compassion from the neighboring state be now regard with such jealousy as rival unequivocally equal may justly inspire in each other the ten southern province now confirm under the sovereignty of the house of austrium and from this period generally distinguish by the name of belgium immediately begin like the northern division of the country to labor for the great object of repair the dreadful suffering cause by they long and cruel war they success be considerable albert and isabellum they sovereign join to considerable probity of character and talent for government a fund of humanity which lead they to unceasing act of benevolence the whole of they dominion quickly begin to recover from the ravages of war agriculture and the minor operation of trade resume all they wonted activity but the manufacture of flander be no more and the grander exercise of commerce seem finally remove to amsterdam and the other chief town of holland this tranquil course of prosperity in the belgian province be only once interrupt during the whole continuance of the twelve year ' truce and that be in the year follow its commencement the death of the duke of cleve and julier in this year give rise to serious dispute for the succession to he state which be claim by several of the prince of germany the elector of brandenburg and the duke of neuburg be second both by france and the united province and a joint army of both nation command by prince maurice and the marshal de la chatre be march into the county of cleve after take possession of the town of julier the ally retire leave the two prince above mention in a partnership possession of the disputed state but this joint sovereignty do not satisfy the ambition of either and serious division arise between they each endeavor to strengthen himself by foreign alliance the archduke albert and isabellum be draw into the quarrel and they despatch spinolum at the head of twenty thousand man to support the duke of neuburg whose pretension they countenance prince maurice with a dutch army advance on the other hand to uphold the claim of the elector of brandenburg both general take possession of several town and this double expedition offer the singular spectacle of two oppose army act in different interest make conquest and divide a important inheritance without the occurrence of one act of hostility to each other but the interference of the court of madrid have nearly be the cause of a new rupture the greatest alarm be excite in the belgic province and nothing but the prudence of the archduke and the forbearance of the states-general could have succeed in avert the threaten evil with the exception of this bloodless mimicry of war the united province present for the space of twelve year a long-continued picture of peace as the term be generally receive but a peace so disfigured by intestine trouble and so stain by action of despotic cruelty that the period which should have be that of its greatest happiness become but a example of its worst disgrace the assassination of henry iv in the year 1609 be a new instance of the bigoted atrocity which reign paramount in europe at the time and while rob france of one of its best monarch it deprive the united province of they truest and most powerful friend henry have from he own day to the present find a ready eulogy in all who value king in proportion as they be distinguish by heroism without cease to evince the feeling of humanity henry seem to have go as far as man can go to combine wisdom dignity and courage with all those endearing quality of private life which alone give man a prominent hold upon the sympathy of they kind we acknowledge he error he fault he folly only to love he the better we admire he valor and generosity without be shock by cruelty or disgust by profusion we look on he greatness without envy and in trace he whole career we seem to walk hand in hand beside a dear companion rather than to follow the footstep of a mighty monarch but the death of this powerful supporter of they effort for freedom and the chief guarantee for its continuance be a trifling calamity to the united province in comparison with the rapid fall from the true point of glory so painfully exhibit in the conduct of they own domestic champion it have be well for prince maurice of nassau that the last shot fire by the defeat spaniard in the battle of nieuport have strike he dead in the moment of he greatest victory and on the summit of he fame from that celebrated day he have perform no deed of war that could raise he reputation as a soldier and all he act as stadtholder be calculate to sink he below the level of civil virtue and just government he two campaign against spinolum have redound more to the credit of he rival than to he own and he whole conduct during the negotiation for the truce too plainly betray the unworthy nature of he ambition found on despotic principle it be he misfortune to have be completely throw out of the career for which he have be design by nature and education war be he element by he genius he improve it as a science : by he valor he be one of those who raise it from the degradation of a trade to the dignity of a passion but when remove from the camp to the council room he become all at once a common man he frankness degenerate into roughness he decision into despotism he courage into cruelty he give a new proof of the melancholy fact that circumstance may transform the most apparent quality of virtue into those opposite vice between which human wisdom be baffle when it attempt to draw a decide and invariable line oppose to maurice in almost every one of he act be as we have already see barneveldt one of the truest patriot of any time or country and with the exception of william the great prince of orange the most eminent citizen to whom the affair of the netherland have give celebrity a hundred pen have labor to do honor to this truly virtuous man he greatness have find a record in every act of he life and he death like that of william though differently accomplish be equally a martyrdom for the liberty of he country we can not enter minutely into the train of circumstance which for several year bring maurice and barneveldt into perpetual concussion with each other long after the completion of the truce which the latter so mainly aid in accomplish every minor point in the domestic affair of the republic seem merge in the conflict between the stadtholder and the pensionary without attempt to specify these we may say generally that almost every one redound to the disgrace of the prince and the honor of the patriot but the main question of agitation be the fierce dispute which soon break out between two professor of theology of the university of leyden franci gomar and jame arminius we do not regret on this occasion that we confine limit spare we the task of recording in detail controversy on point of speculative doctrine far beyond the reach of the human understanding and therefore presumptuous and the decision of which can not be regard as of vital importance by those who justly estimate the grand principle of christianity the whole strength of the intellect which have long be engage in the conflict for national and religious liberty be now direct to metaphysical theology and waste upon interminable dispute about predestination and grace barneveldt enrol himself among the partisan of arminius maurice become a gomarist it be however scarcely to be wonder at that a country so recently deliver from slavery both in church and state should run into wild excess of intolerance before sectarian principle be thoroughly understand and definitively fix persecution of various kind be indulge in against papist anabaptist socinian and all the shades of doctrine into which christianity have split every minister who in the milder spirit of lutheranism strove to moderate the rage of calvinistic enthusiasm be openly denounce by its partisan and one name gaspard koolhaa be actually excommunicate by a synod and denounce in plain term to the devil arminius have be appoint professor at leyden in 1603 for the mildness of he doctrine which be join to most affable manners a happy temper and a purity of conduct which no calumny could successfully traduce he colleague gomar a native of bruge learn violent and rigid in sectarian point soon become jealous of the more popular professor 's influence a furious attack on the latter be answer by recrimination and the whole battery of theological authority be reciprocally discharge by one or other of the disputant the states-general interfere between they : they be summon to appear before the council of state and grave politician listen for hour to the dispute arminius obtain the advantage by the apparent reasonableness of he creed and the gentleness and moderation of he conduct he be meek while gomar be furious and many of the listener declare that they would rather die with the charity of the former than in the faith of the latter a second hearing be allow they before the state of holland again arminius take the lead and the controversy go on unceasingly till this amiable man wear out by he exertion and the presentiment of the evil which these dispute be engender for he country expire in he forty-ninth year piously persist in he opinion the gomarist now loudly call for a national synod to regulate the point of faith the arminian remonstrate on various grounds and thus acquire the name of remonstrant by which they be soon generally distinguish the most deplorable contest ensue serious riot occur in several of the town of holland and jame i of england could not resist the temptation of enter the polemical list as a champion of orthodoxy and a decide gomarist he hostility be chiefly direct against vorstius the successor and disciple of arminius he pretty strongly recommend to the states-general to have he burn for heresy he inveterate intolerance know no bound and it complete the melancholy picture of absurdity which the whole affair present to reasonable mind in this dispute which occupy and agitate all it be impossible that barneveldt should not choose the congenial temperance and toleration of arminius maurice with probably no distinct conviction or much interest in the abstract difference on either side join the gomarist he motive be purely temporal for the party he espouse be now decidedly as much political as religious king jame reward he by confer on he the ribbon of the order of the garter vacant by the death of henry iv of france the ceremony of investment be perform with great pomp by the english ambassador at the hague and jame and maurice enter from that time into a closer and more uninterrupted correspondence than before during the long continuance of the theological dispute the united province have nevertheless make rapid stride toward commercial greatness and the year 1616 witness the completion of a affair which be consider the consolidation of they independence this important matter be the recovery of the town of brille and flessingue and the fort of rammekin which have be place in the hand of the english as security for the loan grant to the republic by queen elizabeth the whole merit of the transaction be due to the perseverance and address of barneveldt act on the weakness and the embarrassment of king jame religious contention do not so fully occupy barneveldt but that he keep a constant eye on political concern he be well inform on all that pass in the english court he know the want of jame and be aware of he effort to bring about the marriage of he son with the infanta of spain the danger of such a alliance be evident to the penetrate barneveldt who see in perspective the probability of the wily spaniard obtain from the english monarch possession of the strong place in question he therefore resolve on obtain they recovery and he great care be to get they back with a considerable abatement of the enormous debt for which they stand pledge and which now amount to eight million florin barneveldt commence he operation by sound the needy monarch through the medium of noel caron the ambassador from the states-general and he next manage so as that jame himself should offer to give up the town thereby allow a fair pretext to the state for claim a diminution of the debt the english garrison be unpaid and they complaint bring down a strong remonstrance from jame and excuse from the state found on the poverty of they financial resource the negotiation rapidly go on in the same spirit of avidity on the part of the king and of good management on that of he debtor it be finally agree that the state should pay in full of the demand two million seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand florin -lrb- about two hundred and fifty thousand pound sterling -rrb- be about one-third of the debt prince maurice repair to the cautionary town in the month of June and receive they at the hand of the english governor the garrison at the same time enter into the service of the republic the accomplishment of this measure afford the highest

he show how great how independent how almost absolute he might continue without shocking the principle of republicanism by grasp at a empty dignity which could not virtually increase he authority and would most probably convulse the state to its foundation and lead to he own ruin the princess convince by he reasoning repair to maurice but instead of find he as ready a convert as she herself have be she receive as cold a answer as be compatible with a passionate temper wound pride and disappointed ambition the princess and barneveldt recount the whole affair to maurier the french ambassador

ill-fated country be the best feature of he political character and ought to irish feeling at least to be consider to redeem its many error but he take fire at the news that the state have prohibit the importation of cloth dye and dress in england it require the best exertion of barneveldt 's talent to pacify he and it be not easy to effect this through the jaundiced medium of the ambassador carleton but it be unanswerably argue by the pensionary that the manufacture of cloth be one of those ancient and natural source of wealth which england have ravish from the netherland and which the latter be justify in recover by every effort consistent with national honor and fair principle of government the influence of prince maurice have gain complete success for the calvinist party in its

on all side assail and persecute barneveldt frequently appeal to maurice without effect and all the effort of the former to obtain justice by means of the civil authority be paralyze by the inaction in which the prince retain the military force in this juncture the magistrate of various town spur on by barneveldt call out the national militia term waardegelder which possess the right of arm at its own expense for the protection of the public peace schism upon schism be the consequence and the whole country be reduce to that state of anarchy so favorable to the design of a ambitious soldier already in the enjoyment of almost absolute power maurice possess all the hardihood and vigor suit to such a occasion at the head of two company of infantry and accompany by he brother frederick henry he suddenly set out at night from the hague arrive at the brille and in defiance of the remonstrance of the magistrate and in violation of the rights of the town he place he devoted garrison in that important place to justify this measure report be spread that barneveldt intend to deliver it up to the spaniard and the ignorant insensate and ungrateful people swallow the calumny this and such minor effort be however all subservient to the one grand object of utterly destroy by a public proscription the whole of the patriot party now identify with arminianism a national synod be loudly clamor for by the gomarist and in spite of all opposition on constitutional grounds it be finally proclaimed uitenbogaard the enlighten pastor and friend of maurice who on all occasion labor for the general good now moderate as much as possible the violence of either party but he could not persuade barneveldt to render himself by compliance a tacit accomplice with a measure that he conceive fraught with violence to the public privilege he have a inflexible enemy in carleton the english ambassador he interference carry the question and it be at he suggestion that dordrecht or dort be choose for the assemble of the synod du maurier the french ambassador act on all occasion as a mediator but to obtain influence at such a time it be necessary to become a partisan several town -- leyden gouda rotterdam and some other -- make a last effort for they liberty and form a fruitless confederation barneveldt solicit the acceptance of he resignation of all he office the states-general implore he not to abandon the country at such a critical moment : he consequently maintain he post libel the most vindictive and atrocious be publish and circulate against he and at last force from he silence by these multiply calumny he put forward he apology address to the state of holland this dignified vindication only produce new outrage maurice now become prince of orange by the death of he elder brother without child employ he whole authority to carry he object and crush barneveldt at the head of he troops he seize on town displaced magistrate trample under foot all the ancient

militia formally invite foreign power to favor and protect the synod about to be hold at dort the return of carleton from england where he have go to receive the more positive promise of support from king jame be only want to decide maurice to take the final step and no sooner do the ambassador arrive at the hague than barneveldt and he most able friend grotius hoogerbeet and ledenberg be arrest in the name of the states-general the country be take by surprise no resistance be offer the conclude scene of the tragedy be hurry on violence be succeed by violence against public feeling and public justice maurice become completely absolute in everything but in name the supplication of ambassador the protest of individual the argument of statesman be alike unavailing to stop the torrent of despotism and injustice the synod of dort be open on the 13th of November 1618 theology be mystified religion disgraced christianity outraged and after one hundred and fifty-two sitting during six month ' display of ferocity and fraud the solemn mockery be close on the 9th of may 1619 by the declaration of its president that its miraculous labor have make hell tremble proscription banishment and death be the natural consequence of this synod the division which it have profess to extinguish be render a thousand time more violent than before its decree do incalculable ill to the cause they be mean to promote the anglican church be the first to reject the canon of dort with horror and contempt the protestant of france and germany and even geneva the nurse and guardian of calvinism be shocked and disgusted and unanimously soften down the rigor of they respective creed but the moral effect of this memorable conclave be too remote to prevent the sacrifice which almost immediately follow the celebration of its rite a trial by twenty-four prejudiced enemy by courtesy call judge which in its progress and its result throw judicial dignity into scorn end in the condemnation of barneveldt and he fellow patriot for treason against the liberty they have vainly labor to save barneveldt die on the scaffold by the hand of the executioner on the 13th of may 1619 in the seventy-second year of he age grotius and hoogerbeet be sentence to perpetual imprisonment ledenberg commit suicide in he cell sooner than brave the torture which he anticipate at the hand of he enemy many more page than we be able to afford sentence might be devote to the detail of these iniquitous proceedings and a account of they awful consummation the pious heroism of barneveldt be never excel by any martyr to the most holy cause he appeal to maurice against the unjust sentence which condemn he to death but he scorn to beg he life he meet he fate with such temperate courage as be to be expect from the dignified energy of he life he last word be worthy a philosopher whose thought even in he latest moment be superior to mere personal hope or fear and turn to the deep mystery of he be o god cry de barneveldt what then be man as he bent he head to the sword that sever it from he body and send the inquire spirit to learn the great mystery for which it long chapter xvii to the death of prince maurice ad 1619 -- 1625 the princess-dowager of orange and du maurier the french ambassador have vainly implored mercy for the innocent victim at the hand of the inexorable stadtholder maurice refuse to see he mother-in-law : he leave the ambassador 's appeal unanswered this be enough for the rigid justice of history that can not be blind by partiality but hand over to shame at the close of they career even those whom she nurse in the very cradle of heroism but a accusation have become current more fatal to the fame of prince maurice because it strike at the root of he claim to feeling which could not be impugn by a mere perseverance in severity that might have spring from mistaken view it be assert but only as general belief that he witness the execution of barneveldt the little window of a octagonal tower overlook the square of the binnenhof at the hague where the tragedy be act be still show as the spot from which the prince gaze on the scene almost conceal from view among the clustering building of the place it be well adapt to give weight to the tradition but it may not perhaps even now be too late to raise a generous incredulity as to a assertion of which no eye-witness attestation be record and which might have be the invention of malignity there be many statement of history which it be immaterial to substantiate or disprove splendid fiction of public virtue have often produce they good if once receive as fact but when private character be at stake every conscientious writer or reader will cherish he historic doubt when he reflect on the facility with which calumny be send abroad the avidity with which it be receive and the careless ease with which man credit what it cost little to invent and propagate but require a age of trouble and a almost impossible conjunction of opportunity effectually to refute grotius and hoogerbeet be confine in the castle of louvestein moersbergen a lead patriot of utrecht de haan pensionary of haarlem and uitenbogaard the choose confidant of maurice but the friend of barneveldt be next accuse and sentence to imprisonment or banishment and thus arminianism deprive of its chief be for the time completely stifle the remonstrant throw into utter despair look to emigration as they last resource gustavus adolphus king of sweden and frederick duke of holstein offer they shelter and protection in they respective state several avail themselves of these offer but the states-general alarmed at the progress of self-expatriation moderate they rigor and thus check the desolating evil several of the imprison arminian have the good fortune to elude the vigilance of they jailer but the escape of grotius be the most remarkable of all both from he own celebrity as one of the first writer of he age in the most varied walk of literature and from its peculiar circumstance which only find a parallel in european history after a lapse of two century we allude to the escape of lavalette from the prison of the conciergerie in paris in 1815 which so painfully excite the interest of all europe for the intended victim 's wife whose reason be the forfeit of she exertion grotius be freely allow during he close imprisonment all the relaxation of study he friend supply he with quantity of book which be usually bring into the fortress in a trunk two foot two inch long which the governor regularly and carefully examine during the first year but custom bring relaxation in the strictness of the prison rule and the wife of the illustrious prisoner he faithful and constant visitor propose the plan of he escape to which he give a ready and all hazard consider a courageous assent shut up in this trunk for two hour and with all the risk of suffocation and of injury from the rude handling of the soldier who carry it out of the fort grotius be bring clear off by the very agent of he persecutor and safely deliver to the care of he devoted and discreet female servant who know the secret and keep it well she attend the important consignment in the barge to the town of gorcum and after various risk of discovery providentially escape grotius at length find himself safe beyond the limit of he native land he wife whose torture suspense may be imagine the while conceal the stratagem as long as it be possible to impose on the jailer with the pardonable and praiseworthy fiction of she husband 's illness and confinement to he bed the government outrageous at the result of the affair at first propose to hold this interesting prisoner in place of the prey they have lose and to proceed criminally against she but after a fortnight 's confinement she be restore to liberty and the country save from the disgrace of so ungenerous and cowardly a proceeding grotius repair to pari where he be receive in the most flattering manner and distinguish by a pension of one thousand crown allow by the king he soon publish he vindication -- one of the most eloquent and unanswerable production of its kind in which those time of unjust accusation and illegal punishment be so fertile the expiration of the twelve year ' truce be now at hand and the united province after that long period of intestine trouble and disgrace have once more to recommence a more congenial struggle against foreign enemy for a renewal of the war with spain might be fairly consider a return to the regimen best suit to the constitution of the people the republic see however with considerable anxiety the approach of this new contest it be fully sensible of its own weakness exile have reduce its population patriotism have subside foreign friend be dead the troops be unused to warfare the hatred against spanish cruelty have lose its excitement the finances be in confusion prince maurice have no longer the activity of youth and the still more vigorous impulse of fight for he country 's liberty be change to the dishonor task of uphold he own tyranny the archduke encourage by these consideration have hope of bring back the united province to they domination they accordingly send a embassy to holland with proposal to that effect it be receive with indignation and the ambassador peckius be oblige to be escort back to the frontier by soldier to protect he from the insult of the people military operation be however for a while refrain from on either side in consequence of the death of philip iii of spain and the archduke albert philip iv succeed he father at the age of sixteen and the archduchess isabellum find herself alone at the head of the government in the belgian province olivarez become as sovereign a minister in spain as he predecessor the duke of lerma have be but the archduchess though now with only the title of stadtholderess of the netherland hold the rein of power with a firm and steady hand in the celebrated thirty year ' war which have commence between the protestant and catholic of germany the former have meet with considerable assistance from the united province barneveldt who foresee the embarrassment which the country would have to contend with on the expiration of that truce have strongly oppose its meddling in the quarrel but he ruin and death leave no restraint on the policy which prompt the republic to aid the protestant cause fifty thousand florin a month to the revolt protestant and a like sum to the prince of the union be for some time advance frederick the elector palatine son-in-law of the king of england and nephew of the prince be choose by the bohemian for they king but in spite of the enthusiastic wish of the english nation jame persist in refuse to interfere in frederick 's favor france govern by de luynes a favorite whose influence be deeply pledge and it be say dearly sell to spain abandon the system of henry iv and uphold the house of austrium thus the new monarch only aid by the united province and that feebly be soon drive from he temporary dignity he hereditary dominion in the palatinate be overrun by the spanish army under spinolum and frederick utterly defeat at the battle of prague be oblige to take refuge in holland jame 's abandonment of he son-in-law have be universally blame by almost every historian he certainly allow a few generous individual to raise a regiment in england of two thousand four hundred choose soldier who under the command of the gallant sir horace vere could only vainly regret the impossibility of opposition to ten time they number of veteran troops this contest be carry on at first with almost all the advantage on the side of the house of austrium two man of extraordinary character which present a savage parody of military talent and a courage chiefly remarkable for the ferocity into which it degenerate struggle for a while against the imperial arm these be the count of mansfield and christian of brunswick at the head of two desperate band which by dint of hard fight acquire something of the consistency of regular army they maintain a long resistance but the duke of bavarium command the troops of the emperor and count tilly at the head of those of spain complete in the year 1622 the defeat of they daring and semi-barbarous opponent spinolum be resolve to commence the war against the republic by some important exploit he therefore lay siege to berg-op-zoom a place of great consequence command the navigation of the meuse and the coast of all the island of zealand but maurice rouse from the lethargy of despotism which seem to have wholly change he character repair to the scene of threaten danger and succeed after a series of desperate effort on both side to raise the siege force spinolum to abandon he attempt with a loss of upward of twelve thousand man frederick henry in the meantime have make a incursion into brabant with a body of light troops and ravage the country up to the very gate of mechlin louvain and brussels levy contribution to the amount of six hundred thousand florin the state complete this series of good fortune by obtain the possession of west friesland by means of count mansfield whom they have despatch thither at the head of he formidable army and who have in spite of the opposition of count tilly successfully perform he mission we must now turn from these brief record of military affair the more please theme for the historian of the netherland in comparison with domestic event which claim attention but to create sensation of regret and censure prince maurice have enjoy without restraint the fruit of he ambitious daring he power be uncontrolled and unopposed but it be publicly odious and private resentment be only withhold by fear and perhaps in some measure by the moderation and patience which distinguish the disciple of arminianism in the midst however of the apparent calm a deep conspiracy be form against the life of the prince the motive the conduct and the termination of this plot excite feeling of many opposite kind we can not as in former instance wholly execrate the design and approve the punishment commiseration be mingle with blame when we mark the son of barneveldt urge on by the excess of filial affection to avenge they venerable father 's fate and despite we abhorrence for the object in view we sympathize with the conspirator rather than the intended victim william von stoutenbourg and renier de groeneveld be the name of these two son of the late pensionary the latter be the younger but of more impetuous character than he brother he be the principal in the plot instead of any effort to soften down the hatred of this unfortunate family these brother have be remove from they employment they property be confiscate and despair soon urge they to desperation in such a time of general discontent it be easy to find accomplice seven or eight determine man readily join in the plot of these two be catholic the rest arminian the chief of whom be henry slatius a preacher of considerable eloquence talent and energy it be first propose to attack the prince at rotterdam but the place be soon after change for ryswyk a village near the hague and afterward celebrate by the treaty of peace sign there and which bear its name ten other associate be soon engage by the exertion of slatius : these be arminian artisan and sailor to whom the actual execution of the murder be to be confide and they be persuade that it be plan with the connivance of prince frederick henry who be consider by the arminian as the secret partisan of they sect the 6th of February be fix on for the accomplishment of the deed the better to conceal the design the conspirator agree to go unarmed to the place where they be to find a box contain pistol and poniard in a spot agree upon the death of the prince of orange be not the only object intend during the confusion subsequent to the hoped-for success of that first blow the chief conspirator intend to excite simultaneous revolt at leyden gouda and rotterdam in which town the arminian be most numerous a general revolution throughout holland be firmly reckon on as the infallible result and success be enthusiastically look for to they country 's freedom and they individual fame but the plot however cautiously lay and resolutely persevere

glory of consolidate the country it have form two brother name blansaart and one parthy have procure a considerable sum of money from the lead conspirator repair to the hague as they assert for the purpose of betray the plot but they be forestall in this purpose : four of the sailor have go out to ryswyk the precede evening and lay the whole of the project together with the wages of they intended crime before the prince who it would appear then occupy the ancient chateau which no longer exist at ryswyk the box of arm be find in the place point out by the informer and measure be instantly take to arrest the various accomplice several be seize groeneveld have escape along the coast disguise as a fisherman and have nearly effect he passage to england when he be recognize and arrest in the island of vlieland slatius and other be also intercept in they attempt at escape -- stoutenbourg the most culpable of all be the most fortunate probably from the energy of character which mark the difference between a bold adventurer and a timid speculator he be believe to have pass from the hague in the same manner as grotius quit he prison and by the aid of a faithful servant he accomplish he escape through various peril and finally reach brussels where the archduchess isabellum take he under she special protection he for several year make effort to be allow to return to holland but find they hopeless even after the death of maurice he embrace the catholic religion and obtain the command of a troop of spanish cavalry at the head of which he make incursion into he native country carry before he a black flag with the effigy of a death 's head to announce the mournful vengeance which he come to execute fifteen person be execute for the conspiracy if ever mercy be become to a man it would have be pre-eminently so to maurice on this occasion but he be inflexible as adamant the mother the wife and the son of groeneveld throw themselves at he foot implore pardon prayer tear and sob be alike ineffectual it be even say that maurice ask the wretched mother why she beg mercy for she son have refuse to do as much for she husband to which cruel question she be report to have make the sublime answer -- because my son be guilty and my husband be not these bloody execution cause a deep sentiment of gloom the conspiracy excite more pity for the victim than horror for the intended crime maurice from be the idol of he countryman be now become a object of they fear and dislike when he move from town to town the people no longer hail he with acclamation and even the common token of outward respect be at time withhold the spaniard take advantage of the internal weakness consequent on this state of public feeling in the state make repeat incursion into the province which be now unite but in title not in spirit spinolum be once more in the field and have invest the important town of breda which be the patrimonial inheritance of the prince of orange maurice be oppress with anxiety and regret and for the sake of he better feeling it may be hope with remorse he could effect nothing against he rival and he see he own laurel wither from he careworn brow the only hope left of obtain the so much want supplies of money be in the completion of a new treaty with france and england cardinal richelieu desirous of set bound to the ambition and the success of the house of austrium readily come into the view of the state and a obligation for a loan of one million two hundred thousand livre during the year 1624 and one million more for each of the two succeed year be grant by the king of france on condition that the republic make no new truce with spain without he mediation a alliance nearly similar be at the same time conclude with england perpetual quarrel on commercial question loosen the tie which bind the state to they ancient ally the failure of he son 's intended marriage with the infanta of spain have open the eye of king jame to the way in which he be despise by those who seem so much to respect he he be highly indignant and he undertake to revenge himself by aid the republic he agree to furnish six thousand man and supply the fund for they pay with a provision for repayment by the state at the conclusion of a peace with spain prince maurice have no opportunity of reap the expect advantage from these treaty baffle in all he effort for relieve breda and be unsuccessful in a new attempt upon antwerp he return to the hague where a linger illness that have for some time exhaust he terminate in he death on the 23d of April 1625 in he fifty-ninth year most writer attribute this event to agitation at be unable to relieve breda from the attack of spinolum it be in any case absurd to suppose that the loss of a single town could have produce so fatal a effect on one whose life have be a almost continual game of the chance of war but cause enough for maurice 's death may be find in the wear effect of thirty year of active military service and the more waste ravages of half as many of domestic despotism chapter xviii to the treaty of munster ad 1625 -- 1648 frederick henry succeed to almost all he brother 's

prince-cardinal as ferdinand be call take advantage of this reverse to press the retire french recover several town and gain all the advantage as well as glory of the campaign the remains of the french army reduce by continual combat and still more by sickness finally embark at rotterdam to return to france in the ensue spring a sad contrast to its brilliant appearance at the commencement of the campaign the military event for several ensue year present nothing of sufficient interest to induce we to record they in detail a perpetual succession of siege and skirmish afford a monotonous picture of isolate courage and skill but we see none of those great conflict which bring out the genius of oppose general and show war in its grand result as the decisive means of enslave or emancipate mankind the prince-cardinal one of the many who on this bloody theater display consummate military talent incessantly employ himself in incursion into the border province of france ravage picardy and fill pari with fear and tremble he however reap no new laurel when he come into contact with frederick henry who on almost every occasion particularly that of the siege of breda in 1637

admiral 's triumph and the spanish navy never recover the loss the victory be celebrate throughout europe and van tromp be the hero of the day the king of england be however highly indignant at the hardihood with which the dutch admiral break through the etiquette of territorial respect and destroy he country 's bitter foe under the very sanction of english neutrality but the subject of charle i do not partake they monarch 's feeling they have no sympathy with arbitrary and tyrannic government and they joy at the misfortune of they old enemy the spaniard give a fair warning of the spirit which afterward prove so fatal to the infatuated king who on this occasion would have protect and aid they in a unsuccessful enterprise in flander count henry casimir of nassau be mortally wound add another to the list of those of that illustrious family whose life be lose in the service of they country he brother count william frederick succeed he in he office of stadtholder of friesland but the same dignity in the province of groningen and drent devolve on the prince of orange the latter have conceive the desire of a royal alliance for he son william charle i readily assent to the proposal of the states-general that this young prince should receive the hand of he daughter mary embassy be exchange the condition of the contract agree on but it be not till two year later that van tromp with a escort of twenty ship conduct the princess then twelve year old to the country of she future husband the republic do not view with a eye quite favorable this advance aggrandizement of the house of orange frederick henry have shortly before be dignified by the king of france at the suggestion of richelieu with the title of highness instead of the inferior one of excellency and the states-general jealous of this distinction grant to they chief magistrate adopt for themselves the sound appellation of high and mighty lord the prince of orange whatever might have be he private view of ambition have however the prudence to silence all suspicion by the mild and moderate use which he make of the power which he might perhaps have wish to increase but never attempt to abuse on the 9th of November 1641 the prince-cardinal ferdinand die at brussels in he thirty-third year another instance of those who be cut off in the very vigor of manhood from worldly dignity and the exercise of the painful and inauspicious duty of governor-general of the netherland don francisco de mello a nobleman of highly reputed talent be the next who obtain this onerous situation he commence he governorship by a succession of military operation by which like most of he predecessor he be alone distinguish act of civil administration be scarcely notice by the historian of these man not one of they with the exception of the archduke albert seem to have value the internal interest of the government and he alone perhaps because they be declare and secure as he own de mello after take some town and defeat the marshal de guiche in the battle of hannecourt tarnish all he fame by the great fault which he commit in the famous battle of rocroy the duke of enghien then twenty-one year of age and subsequently so celebrated as the great condé completely defeat de mello and nearly annihilate the spanish and walloon infantry the military operation of the dutch army be this year only remarkable by the gallant conduct of prince william son of the prince of orange who not yet seventeen year of age defeat near hulst under the eye of he father a spanish detachment in a very warm skirmish considerable change be now insensibly operate in the policy of europe cardinal richelieu have finish he dazzling but tempestuous career of government in which the hand of death arrest he on the 4th of December 1642 loui xiii soon follow to the grave he who be rather he master than he minister anne of austrium be declare regent during the minority of she son loui xiv then only five year of age and cardinal mazarin succeed to the station from which death alone have power to remove he predecessor the civil war in england now break out and they terrible result seem to promise to the republic the undisturbed sovereignty of the sea the prince of orange receive with great distinction the mother-in-law of he son when she come to holland under pretext of conduct she daughter but she principal purpose be to obtain by the sale of the crown jewel and the assistance of frederick henry fund for the supply of she unfortunate husband 's cause the prince and several private individual contribute largely in money and several experienced officer pass over to serve in the royalist army of england the provincial state of holland however sympathize wholly with the parliament remonstrate with the stadtholder and the dutch colonist encourage the hostile effort of they brethren the puritan of scotland by all the absurd exhortation of fanatic zeal boswell the english resident in the name of the king and strickland the ambassador from the parliament keep up a constant succession of complaint and remonstrance on occasion of every incident which seem to balance the conduct of the republic in the great question of english politics considerable difference exist : the province of holland and some other lean toward the parliament the prince of orange favor the king and the states-general endeavor to maintain a neutrality the struggle be still furiously maintain in germany general of the first order of military talent be continually appear and successively eclipse each other by they brilliant action gustavus adolphus be kill in the midst of he glorious career at the battle of lutzen the duke of weimar succeed to he command and prove himself worthy of the place tilly and the celebrated wallenstein be no longer on the scene the emperor ferdinand ii be dead and he son ferdinand iii see he victorious enemy threaten at last the existence of the empire everything tend to make peace necessary to some of the contend power as it be at length desirable for all sweden and denmark be engage in a bloody and wasteful conflict the united province send a embassy in the month of June 1644 to each of those power and by a vigorous demonstration of they resolution to assist sweden if denmark prove refractory a peace be sign the following year which terminate the dispute of the rival nation negotiation be now open at munster between the several belligerent the republic be however the last to send its plenipotentiary there have sign anew treaty with france by which they mutually stipulate to make no peace independent of each other it behoove the republic however to contribute as much as possible toward the general object for among other strong motive to that line of conduct the finances of holland be in a state perfectly deplorable every year bring the necessity of a new loan and the public debt of the province now amount to one hundred and fifty million florin bear interest at six and a quarter per cent considerable alarm be excite at the progress of the french army in the belgian province and escape from the tyranny of spain seem only to lead to the danger of submission to a nation too powerful and too close at hand not to be dangerous either as a foe or a ally these fear be increase by the knowledge that cardinal mazarin project a marriage between loui xiv and the infanta of spain with the belgian province or spanish netherland as they be now call for she marriage portion this project be confide to the prince of orange under the seal of secrecy and he be offer the marquisate of antwerp as the price of he influence toward effect the plan the prince reveal the whole to the states-general great fermentation be excite the stadtholder himself be blame and suspect of complicity with the design of the cardinal frederick henry be deeply hurt at this want of confidence and the injurious publication which openly assail he honor in a point where he feel himself entitle to praise instead of suspicion the french labor to remove the impression which this affair excite in the republic but the states-general feel themselves justified by the intriguing policy of mazarin in enter into a secret negotiation with the king of spain who offer very favorable condition the negotiation be considerably advance by the marked disposition evince by the prince of orange to hasten the establishment of peace yet at this very period and while anxiously wish this great object he could not resist the desire for another campaign one more exploit to signalize the epoch at which he finally place he sword in the scabbard frederick henry be essentially a soldier with all the spirit of he race and this evidence of the ruling passion while he touch the verge of the grave be one of the most striking point of he character he accordingly take the field but with a constitution break by a linger disease he be little fitted to accomplish any feat worthy of he splendid reputation he fail in a attempt on venlo and another on antwerp and retire to the hague where for some month he rapidly decline on the 14th of march 1647 he expire in he sixty-third year leave behind he a character of unblemished integrity prudence toleration and valor he be not of that impetuous stamp which lead man to heroic deed and bring danger to the state whose liberty be compromise by they ambition he be a striking contrast to he brother maurice and more resemble he father in many of those calmer quality of the mind which make man more beloved without lessen they claim to admiration frederick henry have the honor of complete the glorious task which william begin and maurice follow up he see the oppression they have combate now humble and overthrow and he form the third in a sequence of family renown the most surprising and the least checkered afford by the annals of europe william ii succeed he father in he dignity and he ardent spirit long to rival he in war he turn he endeavor to thwart all the effort for peace but the interest of the nation and the die wish of frederick henry be of too powerful influence with the state to be overcome by the martial yearning of a inexperienced youth the negotiation be press forward and despite the complaint the murmur and the intrigue of france the treaty of munster be finally sign by the respective ambassador of the united province and spain on the 30th of January 1648 this celebrated treaty contain seventy-nine article three point be of main and vital importance to the republic : the first acknowledge a ample and entire recognition of the sovereignty of the states-general and a renunciation forever of all claim on the part of spain the second confirm the rights of trade and navigation in the east and west indy with the possession of the various country and station then actually occupy by the contracting power the third guarantee a like possession of all the province and town of the

treaty be exchange at munster with great solemnity on the 15th of may follow the signature the peace be publish in that town and in osnaburg on the 19th and in all the different state of the king of spain and the united province as soon as the joyous intelligence could reach such various and widely separated destination thus after eighty year of unparalleled warfare only interrupted by the truce of 1609 during which hostility have not cease in the indy the new republic rise from the horror of civil war and foreign tyranny to its uncontested rank as a free and independent state among the most powerful nation of europe no country have ever do more for glory and the result of its effort be the irrevocable guarantee of civil and religious liberty the great aim and end of civilization the king of france alone have reason to complain of this treaty : he resentment be strongly pronounced but the united province fling back the reproach of he ambassador on cardinal mazarin and the anger of the monarch be smother by the policy of the minister the internal tranquillity of the republic be secure from all future alarm by the conclusion of the general peace of westphalium definitively sign on the 24th of October 1648 this treaty be long consider not only as the fundamental law of the empire but as the basis of the political system of europe as number of conflict interest be reconcile

power condemn he to perpetual imprisonment in he native land the religious disputation in holland have give a great impulse to talent they be not mere theological argument but with the wild and furious abstraction of bigotry be often blended various illustration from history art and science and a tone of keen and delicate satire which at once refine and make they readable it be remarkable that almost the whole of the latin writings of this period abound in good taste while those write in the vulgar tongue be chiefly coarse and trivial vondel and hooft the great poet of the time write with genius and energy but be deficient in judgment found on good taste the latter of these writer be also distinguish for he prose work in honor of which loui xiii dignified he with letter patent of nobility and decorate he with the order of st michael but while holland be more particularly distinguish by the progress of the mechanical art to which prince maurice afford unbounded patronage the belgian province give birth to that galaxy of genius in the art of painting which no equal period of any other country have ever rival a volume like this would scarcely suffice to do justice to the merit of the eminent artist who now flourish in belgium at once found perfect and immortalize the flemish school of painting ruben vandyck tenier crayer jordaen sneyder and a host of other great name

that he knight he in full parliament and present he with the diamond ring he wear on he own finger and a chain enrich with brilliant david tenier the great pupil of this distinguished master meet he due share of honor he have leave several portrait of himself one of which hand he down to posterity in the costume and with the decoration of the belt and key which he wear in he capacity of chamberlain to the archduke leopold governor-general of the spanish netherland the intestine disturbance of holland during the twelve year ' truce and the enterprise against friesland and the duchy of cleve have prevent that wise economy which be expect from the republic the annual ordinary cost of the military establishment at that period amount to thirteen million florin to meet the enormous expense of the state tax be raise on every material they produce about thirty million florin a year independent of five million each for the east and west indium company the population in 1620 in holland be about six hundred thousand and the other province contain about the same number it be singular to observe the fertile erection of monopoly in a state found on principle of commercial freedom the east and west indium company the greenland company and other be successively form by the effect of they enterprise industry and wealth conquest be make and colony found with surprising rapidity the town of amsterdam now new york be found in 1624 and the east saw batavium rise up from the ruin of jacatra which be sack and raze by the dutch adventurer the dutch and english east indium company repress they mutual jealousy form a species of partnership in 1619 for the reciprocal enjoyment of the rights of commerce but four year later than this date a event take place so fatal to national confidence that its impression be scarcely yet efface -- this be the torturing and execution of several englishman in the island of amboyna on pretence of a unproved plot of which every probability lead to the belief that they be wholly innocent this circumstance be the strongest stimulant to the hatred so evident in the bloody war which not long afterward take place between the two nation and the lapse of two century have not entirely efface its effect much have be at various period write for and against the establishment of monopolize company by which individual wealth and skill be exclude from they chance of reward with reference to those of holland at this period of its history it be sufficient to remark that the great result of they formation could never have be bring about by isolate enterprise and the justice or wisdom of they continuance be question wholly dependent on the fluctuation in trade and the effect produce on that of any give country by the progress and the rivalry of other with respect to the state of manners in the republic it be clear that the jealousy and emulation of commerce be not likely to lessen the vice of avarice with which the native have be reproach the following be a strong expression of one who can not however be consider a unprejudiced observer on occasion of some dispute point between the dutch and english maritime tribunal -- the decision of we court cause much ill-will among these people whose heart ' blood be they purse -lrb- 5 -rrb- while drunkenness be a vice consider scarcely scandalous the intrigue of gallantry be conceal with the most scrupulous mystery -- give evidence of at least good taste if not of pure morality court etiquette begin to be of infinite importance the wife of count ernest casimir of nassau be so intent on the preservation of she right of precedence that on occasion of lady carleton the british ambassadress presume to dispute the _ pas _ she forget true dignity so far as to strike she we may imagine the vehement resentment of such a man as carleton for such a outrage the lower order of the people have the rude and brutal manners common to half-civilized nation which fight they way to freedom the unfortunate king of bohemia when a refugee in holland be one day hunting and in the heat of the chase he follow he dog which have pursue a hare into a newly sow corn-field : he be quickly interrupt by a couple of peasant arm with pitchfork he suppose he rank and person to be unknown to they but he be soon undeceived and salute with unceremonious reproach king of bohemia king of bohemia shout one of the boor why do you trample on my wheat which i have so lately have the trouble of sowing the king make many apology and retire throw the whole blame on he dog but in the life of marshal turenne we find a more marked trait of manners than this which might be parallel in england at this day this great general serve he apprenticeship in the art of war under he uncle the prince maurice and frederick henry he appear one day on the public walk at the hague dress in he usual plain and modest style some young french lord cover with gold embroidery and ribbon

footnote 5 : carleton -rrb- but one characteristic more noble and worthy than any of those thus briefly cite be the full enjoyment of the liberty of the press in the united province the thirst of gain the fury of faction the federal independence of the minor town the absolute power of prince maurice all the combination which might carry weight against this grand principle be totally ineffectual to prevail over it and the republic be on this point proudly pre-eminent among surround nation chapter xix from the peace of munster to the peace of nimeguen ad 1648 -- 1678 the completion of the peace of munster open a new scene in the history of the republic its political system experience considerable change its ancient enemy become its most ardent friend and its old ally loosen the bond of long-continued amity the other state of europe displeased at its imperious conduct or jealous of its success begin to wish its humiliation but it be little thought that the consummation be to be effect at the hand of england while holland prepare to profit by the peace so brilliantly gain england tear by civil war be hurry on in crime and misery to the final act which have leave a indelible stain on she annals cromwell and the parliament have completely subjugate the kingdom the unfortunate king deliver up by the scotch be bring to a mock trial and condemn to a ignominious death great as be he fault they be almost lose sight of in the atrocity of he opponent so surely do disproportioned punishment for political offence produce a reaction in the mind that would approve a commensurate penalty the united province have preserve a strict neutrality while the contest be undecided the prince of orange warmly strive to obtain a declaration in favor of he father-in-law charle i the prince of wale and the duke of york he son who have take refuge at the hague earnestly join in the entreaty but all that could be obtain from the states-general be they consent to a embassy to interpose with the ferocious bigot who doom the hapless monarch to the block pauw and joachimus the one sixty-four year of age the other eighty-eight the most able man of the republic undertake the task of mediation they be scarcely listen to by the parliament and the bloody sacrifice take place the detail of this event and its immediate consequence belong to english history and we must hurry over the brief turbid and inglorious stadtholderate of william ii to arrive at the more interesting contest between the republic which have honorably conquer its freedom and that of the rival commonwealth which have gain its power by hypocrisy violence and guilt william ii be now in he twenty-fourth year he have early evince that heroic disposition which be common to he race he pant for military glory all he pleasure be those usual to ardent and high-spirited man although he delicate constitution seem to forbid the indulgence of hunting tennis and the other violent exercise in which he delight he be highly accomplish speak five different language with elegance and fluency and have make considerable progress in mathematics and other abstract science he ambition know no bound have he reign over a monarchy as absolute king he would most probably have go down to posterity a conqueror and a hero but unfitted to direct a republic as its first citizen he have leave but the name of a rash and unconstitutional magistrate from the moment of he accession to power he be make sensible of the jealousy and suspicion with which he office and he character be observe by the provincial state of holland many instance of this disposition be accumulate to he great disgust and he be not long in evince he determination to brave all the odium and reproach of despotic design and to risk everything for the establishment of absolute power the province of holland arrogate to itself the greatest share in the reform of the army and the financial arrangement call for by the transition from war to peace be soon in fierce opposition with the states-general which support the prince in he early view cornelius bikker one of the burgomaster of amsterdam be the lead person in the state of holland and a circumstance soon occur which put he and the stadtholder in collision and quickly decide the great question at issue the admiral cornellizon de witt arrive from brazil with the remains of he fleet and without the consent of the council of regency there establish by the states-general he be instantly arrest by order of the prince of orange in he capacity of high-admiral the admiralty of amsterdam be at the same time order by the states-general to imprison six of the captain of this fleet the state of holland maintain that this be a violation of they provincial rights and a illegal assumption of power on the part of the states-general and the magistrate of amsterdam force the prison door and set the captain at liberty william back by the authority of the states-general now put himself at the head of a deputation from that body and make a rapid tour of visitation to the different chief town of the republic to sound the depths of public opinion on the matter in dispute the deputation meet with varied success but the result prove to the irritated prince that no measure of compromise be to be expect and that force alone be to arbitrate the question the army be to a man devote to he the states-general give he they entire and somewhat servile support he therefore on he own authority arrest the six deputy of holland in the same way that he uncle maurice have seize on barneveldt grotius and the other and they be immediately convey to the castle of louvestein in adopt this bold and unauthorized measure he decide on a immediate attempt to gain possession of the city of amsterdam the central point of opposition to he violent design william frederick count of nassau stadtholder of friesland at the head of a numerous detachment of troops march secretly and by night to surprise the town but the darkness and a violent thunderstorm have cause the greater number to lose they way the count find himself at dawn at the city gate with a very insufficient force and have the further mortification to see the wall well man the cannon point the draw-bridge raise and everything in a state of defense the courier from hamburg who have pass through the scatter band of soldier during the night have give the alarm the first notion be that a roving band of swedish or lorraine troops attract by the opulence of amsterdam have resolve on a attempt to seize and pillage it the magistrate could scarcely credit the evidence of day which show they the count of nassau and he force on they hostile mission a short conference with the deputy from the citizen convinced he that a speedy retreat be the only measure of safety for himself and he force as the sluice of the dike be in part open and a threat of submerge the intended assailant only require a moment more to be enforce nothing could exceed the disappointment and irritation of the prince of orange consequent on this transaction he at first threaten then negotiate and finally patch up the matter in a mariner the least mortifying to he wounded pride bikker nobly offer himself for a peace-offering and voluntarily resign he employment in the city he have save and de witt and he officer be release william be in some measure console for he disgrace by the condolence of the army the thanks of the province of zealand and a new treaty with france strengthen by promise of future support from cardinal mazarin but before he could profit by these encouraging symptom domestic and foreign a premature death cut short all he project of ambition over-violent exercise in a shoot party in guelder bring on a fever which soon terminate in a attack of smallpox on the first appearance of he illness he be remove to the hague and he die there on the 6th of November 1650 aged twenty-four year and six month the death of this prince leave the state without a stadtholder and the army without a chief the whole of europe share more or less in the joy or the regret it cause the republican party both in holland and in england rejoice in a circumstance which throw back the sovereign power into the hand of the nation the partisan of the house of orange deeply lament the event but the birth of a son of which the widow princess of orange be deliver within a week of she husband death revive the hope of those who mourn he loss and offer she the only consolation which could assuage she grief this child be however the innocent cause of a breach between he mother and grandmother the dowager-princess who have never be cordially attach to each other each claim the guardianship of the young prince and the dispute be at length decide by the state who adjudge the important office to the elector of brandenburg and the two princess jointly the state of holland soon exercise they influence on the other province many of the prerogative of the stadtholder be now assume by the people and with the exception of zealand which make a ineffectual attempt to name the infant prince to the dignity of he ancestor under the title of william iii a perfect unanimity seem to have reconcile all oppose interest the various town secure the privilege of appoint they own magistrate and the direction of the army and navy devolve to the states-general the time be now arrive when the wisdom the courage and the resource of the republic be to be put once more to the test in a contest hitherto without example and never since equal in its nature the naval war between holland and england have they real source in the inveterate jealousy and unbounded ambition of both country reciprocally convince that a joint supremacy at sea be incompatible with they interest and they honor and each resolve to risk everything for they mutual pretension -- to perish rather than yield the united province be assuredly not the aggressor in this quarrel they have make sure of they capability to meet it by the settlement of all question of internal government and the solid peace which secure they against any attack on the part of they old and inveterate enemy but they do not seek a rupture they at first endeavor to ward off the threaten danger by every effort of conciliation and they meet with temperate management even the advance make by cromwell at the instigation of st john the chief justice for a propose yet impracticable coalition between the two republic which be to make they one and indivisible a embassy to the hague with st john and strickland at its head be receive with all public honor but the partisan of the family of orange and stuart and the populace generally openly insult the ambassador about the same time dorisla a dutchman naturalized in england and send on a mission from the parliament be murder at the hague by some scotch officer friend of the banish king the massacre of amboyna thirty year before be make a cause of revive complaint and altogether a sum of injury be easily make up to turn the propose fantastic coalition into a fierce and bloody war the parliament of england soon find a pretext in a outrageous measure under pretence of provide for the interest of commerce they pass the celebrated act of navigation which prohibit all nation from import into england in they ship any commodity which be not the growth and manufacture of they own country this law though word generally be aim directly at the dutch who be the general factor and carrier of europe ship be seize reprisal make the mockery of negotiation carry on fleet equip and at length the war break out in the month of may 1652 the dutch admiral tromp command forty-two ship of war meet with the english fleet under blake in the strait of dover the latter though much inferior in number give a signal to the dutch admiral to strike the usual salutation of honor accord to the english during the monarchy totally different version have be give by the two admiral of what follow blake insist that tromp instead of comply fire a broadside at he vessel tromp state that a second and a third bullet be send promptly from the british ship while he be prepare to obey the admiral 's claim the discharge of the first broadside be also a matter of contradiction and of course of doubt but it be of small consequence for whether hostility have be hurry on or delay they be ultimately inevitable a bloody battle begin : it last five hour the inferiority in number on the side of the english be balance by the larger size of they ship one dutch vessel be sink another take and night part the combatant the states-general hear the news with consternation : they despatch the grand pensionary pauw on a special embassy to london the imperious parliament would hear of neither reason nor remonstrance right or wrong they be resolve on war blake be soon at sea again with a numerous fleet tromp follow with a hundred ship but a violent tempest separate these furious enemy and retard for a while the rencounter they mutually long for on the 16th of August a battle take place between sir george ayscue and the renowned de ruyter near plymouth each with about forty ship but with no decisive consequence on the 28th of October blake aid by bourn and pen meet a dutch squadron of nearly equal force off the coast of kent under de ruyter and de witt the fight which follow be also severe but not decisive though the dutch have the worst of the day in the mediterranean the dutch admiral van galen defeat the english captain baddely but buy the victory with he life and on the 29th of November another bloody conflict take place between blake and tromp second by de ruyter near the goodwin sand in this determine action blake be wound and defeat five english ship take burn or sink and night save the fleet from destruction after this victory tromp place a broom at he masthead as if to intimate that he would sweep the channel free of all english ship great preparation be make in england to recover this disgrace eighty sail put to sea under blake dean and monk so celebrated subsequently as the restorer of the monarchy tromp and de ruyter with seventy-six vessel be descry on the 18th of February escort three hundred merchantman up channel three day of desperate fighting end in the defeat of the dutch who lose ten ship of war and twenty-four merchant vessel several of the english ship be disabled one sink and the carnage on both side be nearly equal tromp acquire prodigious honor by this battle have succeed though defeat in save as have be see almost the whole of he immense convoy on the 12th of June and the day follow two other action be fight : in the first of which the english admiral dean be kill in the second monk pen and lawson amply revenge he death by force the dutch to regain they harbor with great loss the 21st of July be the last of these bloody and obstinate conflict for superiority tromp issue out once

of orange and every impartial friend of the national honor be indignant at the act of exclusion murmur and revolt break out in several town and all be once more tumult agitation and doubt no event of

pensionary then take in person the command of the fleet which be soon equip and he give a high proof of the adaptation of genius to a pursuit previously unknown by the rapid knowledge and the practical improvement he introduce into some of the most intricate branch of naval tactic immense effort be now make by england but with a very questionable policy to induce loui xiv to join in the war charle offer to allow of he acquire the whole of the spanish netherland provide he would leave he without interruption to destroy the dutch navy -lrb- and consequently they commerce -rrb- in the by no means certain expectation that its advantage would all fall to the share of england but the king of france resolve to support the republic the king of denmark too form a alliance with they after a series of the most strange tergiversation spain reduce to feebleness and menace with invasion by france show no alacrity to meet charle 's overture for a offensive treaty van galen bishop of munster

and see the certainty of defeat what a wretch i be among so many thousand bullet be there not one to put a end to my miserable life -lrb- footnote 6 : in all these naval battle we have follow hume and the english historian as to date which in almost every instance be strangely at variance with those give by the dutch writer -rrb- the king of france hasten forward in this crisis to the assistance of the republic and de witt by a deep stroke of policy amuse the english with negotiation while a powerful fleet be fit out it suddenly appear in the thame under the command of de ruyter and all england be throw into consternation the dutch take sheerness and burn many ship of war almost insulting the capital itself in they predatory incursion have the french power join that of the province at this time and invade england the most fatal result to that kingdom might have take place but the alarm soon subside with the disappearance of the hostile fleet and the sign the peace of breda on the 10th of July 1667 extricate charle from he present difficulty the island of polerone be restore to the dutch and the point of maritime superiority be on this occasion undoubtedly theirs while holland be prepare to indulge in the luxury of national repose the death of philip iv of spain and the startling ambition of loui xiv bring war once more to they very door and soon even force it across the threshold of the republic the king of france setting at naught he solemn renunciation at the peace of the pyrenee of all claim to any part of the spanish territory in right of he wife who be daughter

conquest europe be in universal alarm at these unexpected measure and no state feel more terror than the republic of the united province the interest of all country seem now to require a coalition against the power which have abandon the house of austrium only to settle on france the first measure to this effect be the signing of the triple league between holland sweden and england at the hague on the 13th of January 1668 but this prove to be one of the most futile confederation on record charle with almost unheard-of perfidy throughout the transaction fall in with the design of he pernicious and on this occasion purchase cabinet call the cabal and he enter into a secret treaty with france in the very tooth of he other engagement sweden be dissuade from the league by the argument of the french minister and holland in a short time find itself involve in a double war with its late ally a base and piratical attack on the dutch smyrna fleet by a large force under sir robert holme on the 13th of march 1672 be the first overt act of treachery on the part of the english government the attempt completely fail through the prudence and valor of the dutch admiral and charle reap only the double shame of perfidy and defeat he instantly issue a declaration of war against the republic on reasoning too palpably false to require refutation and too frivolous to merit record to the exclusion of more important matter from we narrow limit loui at least cover with the semblance of dignity he unjust co-operation in this violence he soon advance with he army and the contingent of munster and cologne he ally amount altogether to nearly one hundred and seventy thousand man command by conde turenne luxemburg and other of the greatest general of france never be any country less prepared than be the united province to resist this formidable aggression they army be as naught they long cessation of military operation by land have totally demoralize that once invincible branch of they force no general exist who know anything of the practice of war they very store of ammunition have be deliver over in the way of traffic to the enemy who now prepare to overwhelm they de witt be severely and not quite unjustly blame for have suffer the country to be thus take by surprise utterly defenceless and apparently without resource envy of he uncommon merit aggravate the just complaint against he error but above all thing the popular affection to the young prince threaten in some great convulsion the overthrow of the pensionary who be consider eminently hostile to the illustrious house of orange -lrb- illustration : a holland beauty -rrb- william iii prince of orange now twenty-two year of age be amply endowed with those hereditary quality of valor and wisdom which only require experience to give he rank with the greatest of he ancestor the louvenstein party as the adherent of the house of orange be call now easily prevail in they long-conceived design of place he at the head of affair with the title of captain-general and high admiral de witt anxious from personal consideration as well as patriotism to employ every means of active exertion

of the age set sail with this force in search of the combined fleet of england and france command by the duke of york and marshal d'etree he encounter they on the 6th of may 1672 at solebay a most bloody engagement be the result of this meeting sandwich on the side of the english and van ghent a dutch admiral be slay the glory of the day be divide the victory doubtful but the sea be not the element on which the fate of holland be to be decide the french army pour like a torrent into the territory of the republic river be pass town take and province overrun with a rapidity much less honorable to france than disgraceful to holland no victory be gain -- no resistance offer and it be disgust to look back on the fulsome panegyric with which courtier and poet laud loui for those facile and inglorious triumph the prince of orange have receive the command of a nominal army of seventy thousand man but with this undisciplined and discourage mass he could attempt nothing he prudently retire into the province of holland vainly hope that the numerous fortress on the frontier would have offer some resistance to the enemy guelder overyssel and utrecht be already in loui 's hand groningen and friesland be threaten holland and zealand oppose obstruction to such rapid conquest from they natural position and amsterdam set a noble example to the remain town -- form a regular and energetic plan of defense and endeavor to infuse its spirit into the rest the sluice those desperate source at once of safety and desolation be open the whole country submerge and the other province follow this example extensive district of fertility and wealth be give to the sea for the exclusion of which so many century have scarcely suffice the states-general now assemble and it be decide to supplicate for peace at the hand of the combined monarch the haughty insolence of louvoi coincide with the temper of loui himself make the latter propose the following condition as the price of peace : to take off all duty on commodity export into holland to grant the free exercise of the romish religion in the united province to share the church with the catholic and to pay they priest to yield up all the frontier town with several in the heart of the republic to pay he twenty million livre to send he every year a solemn embassy accompany by a present of a golden medal as a acknowledgment that they owe he they liberty and finally that they should give entire satisfaction to the king of england charle on he part after the most insulting treatment of the ambassador send to london require among other term that the dutch should give up the honor of the flag without reserve whole fleet be expect even on the coast of holland to lower they topsail to the smallest ship under british color that the dutch should pay one million pound sterling toward the charge of the war and ten thousand pound a year for permission to fish in the british sea that they should share the indian trade with the english and that walcheren and several other island should be put into the king 's hand as security for the performance of the article the insatiable monarch overshoot the mark existence be not worth preserve on these intolerable term holland be drive to desperation and even the people of england be inspire with indignation at this monstrous injustice in the republic a violent explosion of popular excess take place the people now see no safety but in the courage and talent of the prince of orange he be tumultuously proclaimed stadtholder de witt and he brother corneli the conscientious but too obstinate opponent of this measure of salvation fall victim to the popular frenzy the latter condemn to banishment on a atrocious charge of intended assassination against the prince of orange be visit in he prison at the hague by the grand pensionary the rabble incite to fury by the calumny spread against these two virtuous citizen break into the prison force the unfortunate brother into the street and there literally tear they to piece with circumstance of the most brutal ferocity this horrid scene take place on the 27th of August 1672 the massacre of the de witts completely destroy the party of which they be the head all man now unite under the only leader leave to the country william show himself well worthy of the trust and of he heroic blood he turn he whole force against the enemy he seek nothing for himself but the glory of save he country and take he ancestor for model in the best point of they respective character he combine prudence with energy and firmness with moderation he spirit inspire all rank of man the condition of peace demand by the partner king be reject with scorn the whole nation be move by one concentrate principle of heroism and it be even resolve to put the ancient notion of the first william into practice and abandon the country to the wave sooner than submit to the political annihilation with which it be threaten the capability of the vessel in they harbor be calculate and they be find sufficient to transport two hundred thousand family to the indian settlement we must hasten from this sublime picture of national desperation the glorious hero who stand in its foreground be inaccessible to every overture of corruption buckingham the english ambassador offer he on the part of england and france the independent sovereignty of holland if he would abandon the other province to they grasp and urge he consent ask he if he do not see that the republic be ruin there be one mean reply the prince of orange which will save I from the sight of my country 's ruin -- i will die in the last ditch action soon prove the reality of the prince 's profession he take the field have first punish with death

send to he assistance with twenty thousand man groningen repulse the bishop of munster the ally of france with a loss of twelve thousand man the king of spain -lrb- such be the strange fluctuation of political friendship and enmity -rrb- send the count of monterey governor of the belgian province with ten thousand man to support the dutch army the elector of brandenburg also lend they aid the whole face of affair be change and loui be oblige to abandon all he conquest with more rapidity than he have make they two desperate battle at sea on the 28th of may and the 4th of June in which de ruyter and prince rupert again distinguish themselves only prove the valor of the combatant leave victory still doubtful england be with one common feeling ashamed of the odious war in which the king and he unworthy minister have engage the nation charle be force to make peace on the condition propose by the dutch the honor of the flag be yield to the english a regulation of trade be agree to all possession be restore to the same condition as before the war and the states-general agreed to pay the king eight hundred thousand patacoon or nearly three hundred thousand pound with these encouraging result from the prince of orange 's influence and example holland persevere in the contest with france he in the first place make head during a winter campaign in holland against marshal luxemburg who have succeed turenne in the low country the latter be oblige to march against the imperialist in westphalium he next advance to oppose the great conde who occupy brabant with a army of forty-five thousand man after much manoeuvring in which the prince of orange display consummate talent he on only one occasion expose a part of he army to a disadvantageous contest conde seize on the error and of he own accord give the battle to which he young opponent could not succeed in force he the battle of senef be remarkable not merely for the fury with which it be fight or for its leave victory undecided but as be the last combat of one commander and the first of the other the prince of orange say the veteran conde -lrb- who have that day expose he person more than on any previous occasion -rrb- have act in everything like a old captain except venture he life too like a young soldier the campaign of 1675 offer no remarkable event the prince of orange with great prudence avoid the risk of a battle but the following year be render fatally remarkable by the death of the great de ruyter -lrb- 7 -rrb- who be kill in a action against the french fleet in the mediterranean and about the same time the not less celebrated turenne meet he death from a cannon-ball in the midst of he triumph in germany this year be doubly occupy in a negotiation for peace and a active prosecution of the war loui at the head of he army take several town in belgium : william be unsuccessful in a attempt on maestricht about the beginning of winter the plenipotentiary of the several belligerent assemble at nimeguen where the congress for peace be hold the hollander load with debt and tax and see the weakness and slowness of they ally the spaniard and german prognosticate nothing but misfortune they commerce languish while that of england now neutral amid all these quarrel flourish extremely the prince of orange however ambitious of glory urge another campaign and it commence accordingly in the middle of February loui carry valencienne by storm and lay siege to st omer and cambray william though full of activity courage and skill be nevertheless almost always unsuccessful in the field and never more so than in this campaign several town fall almost in he sight and he be completely defeat in the great battle of mount cassel by the duke of orlean and marshal luxemburg but the period for another peace be now approach loui offer fair term for the acceptance of the united province at the congress of nimeguen April 1678 as he now consider he chief enemy spain and the empire who have at first only enter into the war as auxiliary he be no doubt principally impel in he measure by the marriage of the prince of orange with the lady mary eldest daughter of the duke of york and heir presumptive to the english crown which take place on the 23d of October to the great joy of both the dutch and english nation charle be at this moment the arbiter of the peace of europe and though several fluctuation take place in he policy in the course of a few month as the urgent wish of the parliament and the large present of loui differently actuate he still the wiser and more just course prevail and he finally decide the balance by vigorously declare he resolution for peace and the treaty be consequently sign at nimeguen on the 10th of August 1678 the prince of orange from private motive of spleen or a most unjustifiable desire for fight take the extraordinary measure of attack the french troops under luxemburg near mon on the very day after the signing of this treaty he must have know it even though it be not officially notify to he and he certainly have to answer for all the blood so wantonly spill in the sharp though undecisive action which ensue spain abandon to she fate be oblige to make the best term she could and on the 17th of September she also conclude a treaty with france on condition entirely favorable to the latter power -lrb- footnote 7 : the council of spain give de ruyter the title and letter patent of duke the latter arrive in holland after he death and he child with true republican spirit refuse to adopt the title -rrb- chapter xx from the peace of nimeguen to the peace of utrecht ad 1678 -- 1713 a few year pass over after this period without the occurrence of any transaction sufficiently important to require a mention here each of the power so lately at war follow the various bent of they respective ambition charle of england be sufficiently occupy by dispute with parliament and the discovery fabrication and punishment of plot real or pretended loui xiv by a stretch of audacious pride hitherto unknown arrogate to himself the supreme power of regulate the rest of europe as if all the other prince be he vassal he establish court or chamber of reunion as they be call in metz and brisac which cite prince issue decree and authorize spoliation in the most unjust and arbitrary manner loui choose to award to himself luxemburg chiny and a considerable portion of brabant and flander he march a considerable army into belgium which the spanish governor be unable to oppose the prince of orange who labor incessantly to excite a confederacy among the other power of europe against the unwarrantable aggression of france be unable to arouse he countryman to actual war and be force instead of gain the glory he long for to consent to a truce for twenty year which the states-general now wholly pacific and not a little cowardly be too happy to obtain from france the emperor and the king of spain gladly enter into a like treaty the fact be that the peace of nimeguen have disjoint the great confederacy which william have so successfully bring about and the various power be lay utterly prostrate at the foot of the imperious loui who for a while hold the destiny of europe in he hand charle ii die most unexpectedly in the year 1685 and he obstinately bigoted and unconstitutional successor jame ii seem during a reign of not four year ' continuance to rush wilfully headlong to ruin during this period the prince of orange have maintain a most circumspect and unexceptionable line of conduct steer clear of all interference with english affair give offence to none of the political faction and observe in every instance the duty and regard which he owe to he father-in-law during monmouth 's invasion he have despatch to jame 's assistance six regiment of british troops which be in the dutch service and he offer to take the command of the king 's force against the rebel it be from the application of jame himself that william take any part in english affair for he be more widely and much more congenially employ in the establishment of a fresh league against france loui have arouse a new feeling throughout protestant europe by the revocation of the edict of nante the refugee whom he have drive from they native country inspire in those in which they settle hatred of he persecution as well as alarm of he power holland now enter into all the view of the prince of orange by he immense influence he succeed in form the great confederacy call the league of augsburg to which the emperor spain and almost every european power but england become party jame give the prince reason to believe that he too would join in this great project if william would in return concur in he view of domestic tyranny but william wisely refuse jame much disappointed and irritated by the moderation which show he own violence in such striking contrast express he displeasure against the prince and against the dutch generally by various vexatious act william resolve to maintain a high attitude and many application be make to he by the most considerable person in england for relief against jame 's violent measure and which there be but one method of make effectual that method be force but as long as the princess of orange be certain of succeed to the crown on she father 's death william hesitate to join in a attempt that might possibly have fail and lose she she inheritance but the birth of a son which in give jame a male heir destroy all hope of redress for the kingdom decide the wavering and render the determine desperate the prince choose the time for he enterprise with the sagacity arrange its plan with the prudence and put it into execution with the vigor which be habitual quality of he mind loui xiv menace by the league of augsburg have resolve to strike the first blow against the ally he invade germany so that the dutch preparation seem in the first instance intend as measure of defense against the progress of the french but loui 's envoy at the hague could not be long deceive he give notice to he master who in he turn warn jame but that infatuated monarch not only doubt the intelligence but refuse the french king 's offer of assistance and co-operation on the 21st of October the prince of orange with a army of fourteen thousand man and a fleet of five hundred vessel of all kind set sail from helvoetsluy and after some delay from bad weather he safely land he army in torbay on the 5th of November 1688 the desertion of jame 's best friend he own consternation flight seizure and second escape and the solemn act by which he be depose be the rapid occurrence of a few week : and thus the grandest revolution that england have ever see be happily consummate without enter here on legislative reasoning or party sophism it be enough to record the act itself and to say in reference to we more immediate subject that without the assistance of holland and she glorious chief england might have still remain enslaved or have have to purchase liberty by ocean of blood by the bill of settlement the crown be convey jointly to the prince and princess of orange the sole administration of government to remain in the prince and the new sovereign be proclaim on the 23d of February 1689 the convention which have arrange this important point annex to the settlement a declaration of rights by which the power of royal prerogative and the extent of popular privilege be define and guarantee william now become king of england still preserve he title of stadtholder of holland and present the singular instance of a monarchy and a republic be at the same time govern by the same individual but whether as a king or a citizen william be actuate by one grand and powerful principle to which every act of private administration be make subservient although it certainly call for no sacrifice that be not require for the political existence of the two nation of which he be the head inveterate opposition to the power of loui xiv be this all-absorbing motive a sentiment so mighty leave william but little time for inferior point of government and everything but that seem to have irritated and disgusted he he be soon again on the continent the chief theater of he effort he put himself in front of the confederacy which result from the congress of utrecht in 1690 he take the command of the ally army and till the hour of he death he never cease he indefatigable course of hostility whether in the camp or the cabinet at the head of the ally army or as the guide spirit of the council which give they force and motion several campaign be expend and bloody combat fight almost all to the disadvantage of william whose genius for war be never second by that good fortune which so often decide the fate of battle in defiance of all the calculation of talent but no reverse have power to shake the constancy and courage of william he always appear as formidable after defeat as he be before action he conqueror gain little but the honor of the day fleurus steinkerk herwinde be successively the scene of he evil fortune and the source of he fame he retreat be master-stroke of vigilant activity and profound combination many eminent siege take place during this war among other town mon and namur be take by the french and huy by the ally and the army of marshal villerous bombard brussels during three day in August 1695 with such fury that the town-house fourteen church and four thousand house be reduce to ash the year follow this event see another undecisive campaign during the continuance of this war the naval transaction present no grand result du bart a celebrated adventurer of dunkirk occupy the lead place in those affair in which he carry on a desultory but active warfare against the dutch and english fleet and generally with great success all the nation which have take part in so many war be now become exhaust by the contest but none so much so as france the great despot who have so long wield the energy of that country with such wonderful splendor and success find that he unbounded love of dominion be gradually sap all the real good of he people in chimerical scheme of universal conquest england though with much resolution vote new supplies and in every way uphold william in he plan for the continuance of war be rejoice when loui accept the mediation of charle xi king of sweden and agree to concession which make peace feasible the emperor and charle ii of spain be less satisfied with those concession but everything be finally arrange to meet the general view of the party and negotiation be open at ryswyk the death of the king of sweden and the minority of he son and successor the celebrated charle xii retard they on point of form for some time at length on the 20th of September 1697 the article of the treaty be subscribe by the dutch english spanish and french ambassador the treaty consist of seventeen article the french king declare he would not disturb or disquiet the king of great britain whose title he now for the first time acknowledge between france and holland be declare a general armistice perpetual amity a mutual restitution of town a reciprocal renunciation of all pretension upon each other and a treaty of commerce which be immediately put into execution thus after this long expensive and sanguinary war thing be establish just on the footing they have be by the peace of nimeguen and a great though unavailable lesson read to the world on the futility and wickedness of those quarrel in which the personal ambition of king lead to the misery of the people have the ally be true to each other throughout loui would certainly have be reduce much lower than he now be he pride be humble and he encroachment stop but the suffering of the various country engage in the war be too generally reciprocal to make its result of any material benefit to either the emperor hold out for a while encourage by the great victory gain by he general prince eugene of savoy over the turk at zenta in hungary but he finally accede to the term offer by france the peace therefore become general but unfortunately for europe of very short duration france as if look forward to the speedy renewal of hostility still keep she army undisbanded let the foresight of she politician have be what it might this negative proof of it be justify by event the king of spain a weak prince without any direct heir for he possession consider himself authorize to dispose of they succession by will the lead power of europe think otherwise and take this right upon themselves charle die on the 1st of November 1700 and thus put the important question to the test by a solemn testament he declare philip duke of anjou second son of the dauphin and grandson of loui xiv he successor to the whole of the spanish monarchy loui immediately renounce he adherence to the treaty of partition execute at the hague and in london in 1698 and 1700 and to which he have be a contract party and prepare to maintain the act by which the last of the descendant of charle v bequeath the possession of spain and the indy to the family which have so long be the inveterate enemy and rival of he own the emperor leopold on he part prepare to defend he claim and thus commence the new war between he and france which take its name from the succession which form the object of dispute hostility be commence in italy where prince eugene the conqueror of the turk command for leopold and every day make for himself a still more brilliant reputation loui send he grandson to spain to take possession of the inheritance for which so hard a fight be yet to be maintain with the striking expression at parting -- my child there be no longer any pyrenee a expression most happily unprophetic for the future independence of europe for the moral force of the barrier have long exist after the expiration of the family compact which be mean to deprive it of its force loui prepare to act vigorously among other measure he cause part of the dutch army that be quarter in luxemburg and brabant to be suddenly make prisoner of war because they would not own philip v as king of spain the states-general be dreadfully alarmed immediately make the require acknowledgment and in consequence have they soldier release they quickly reinforce they garrison purchase supplies solicit foreign aid and prepare for the worst that might happen they write to king william profess the most inviolable attachment to england and he meet they application by warm assurance of support and a immediate reinforcement of three regiment william follow up these measure by the formation of the celebrated treaty call the grand alliance by which england the state and the emperor covenant for the support of the pretension of the latter to the spanish monarchy william be prepare in spite of he decline health to take he usual lead in the military operation now decide on and almost all europe be again look forward to he guidance when he die on the 8th of march 1701 leave he great plan to receive they execution from still more able adept in the art of war william 's character have be trace by many hand in he capacity of king of england it be not we province to judge he in this place as stadtholder of holland he merit unqualified praise like he great ancestor william i whom he more resemble than any other of he race he save the country in a time of such imminent peril that its abandonment seem the only resource leave to the inhabitant who prefer self-exile to slavery all he act be certainly merge in the one overwhelming object of a great ambition -- that noble quality which if couple with the love of country be the very essence of true heroism william be the last of that illustrious line which for a century and a half have fill europe with admiration he never have a child and be himself a only one he title as prince of orange pass into another branch of the family he leave he cousin prince frison of nassau the stadtholder of friesland he sole and universal heir and appoint the states-general he executor william 's death fill holland with mourning and alarm the meeting of the states-general after this sad intelligence be of a most affect description but william like all master-mind have leave the mantle of he inspiration on he friend and follower heinsius the grand pensionary follow up the view of the lament stadtholder with considerable energy and be answer by the unanimous exertion of the country strong assurance of support from queen anne william 's successor still further encourage the republic which now vigorously prepare for war but it do not lose this occasion of recur to the form of government of 1650 no new stadtholder be now appoint the supreme authority be vest in the general assembly of the state and the active direction of affair confide to the grand pensionary this departure from the form of government which have be on various occasion prove to be essential to the safety although at all time hazardous to the independence of the state be not attend with any evil consequence the faction and the anarchy which have before be the consequence of the course now adopt be prevent by the potent influence of national fear lest the enemy might triumph and crush the hope the jealousy and the enmity of all party in one general ruin thus the common danger awake a common interest and the splendid success of she ally keep holland steady in the career of patriotic energy which have its rise in the dread of she redoubtable foe the joy in france at william 's death be proportionate to the grief it create in holland and the arrogant confidence of loui seem to know no bound i will punish these audacious merchant say he with a air of disdain when he read the manifesto of holland not foresee that those he affect to despise so much would ere long command in a great measure the destiny of he crown queen anne enter upon the war with masculine intrepidity and maintain it with heroic energy effort be make by the english ministry and the states-general to mediate between the king of sweden and poland but charle xii enamored of glory and bent on the one great object of he design against russium would listen to nothing that might lead he from he immediate career of victory many other of the northern prince be withhold by various motive from enter into the contest with france and its whole brunt devolve on the original member of the grand alliance the general who carry it on be marlborough and prince eugene the former at its commencement a earl and subsequently raise to the dignity of duke be declare generalissimo of the dutch and english force he be a man of most powerful genius both as warrior and politician a pupil of the great turenne he exploit leave those of he master in the shade no commander ever possess in a greater degree the faculty of form vast design and of carry they into effect with consummate skill no one display more coolness and courage in action see with a keener eye the error of the enemy or know better how to profit by success he never lay siege to a town that he do not take and never fight a battle that he do not gain prince eugene join to the highest order of personal bravery a profound judgment for the grand movement of war and a capacity for the most minute of the minor detail on which they successful issue so often depend unite in the same cause these two great general pursue they course without the least misunderstanding at the close of each of those successive campaign in which they reap such a full harvest of renown they retire together to the hague to arrange in the profoundest secrecy the plan for the next year 's operation with one other person who form the great point of union between they and complete a triumvirate without a parallel in the history of political affair this third be heinsius one of those great man produce by the republic whose name be tantamount to the most detailed eulogium for talent and patriotism every enterprise project by the confederate be deliberately examine reject or approve by these three associate whose strict union of purpose disown all petty rivalry form the center of counsel and the source of circumstance finally so fatal to france loui xiv now sixty year of age could no longer himself command he army or probably do not wish to risk the reputation he be conscious of have gain by the advice and service of turenne conde and luxemburg louvoi too be dead and colbert no longer manage he finances a council of rash and ignorant minister hang like a dead weight on the talent of the general who succeed the great man above mention favor and not merit too often decide promotion and lavish command vendome villar bouffler and berwick be set aside to make way for villerous tallard and marsin man every way inferior the war begin in 1702 in italy and marlborough open he first campaign in brabant also in that year for several succeed year the confederate pursue a career of brilliant success the detail of which do not properly belong to this work a mere chronology of celebrated battle would be of little interest and the page of english history abound in record of those deed blenheim ramilly oudenarde and malplaquet be name that speak for themselves and tell they own tale of glory the utter humiliation of france be the result of event in which the undying fame of england for inflexible perseverance and unbounded generosity be join in the strictest union with that of holland and the impetuous valor of the worthy successor to the title of prince of orange be on many occasion particularly at malplaquet support by the devotion and gallantry of the dutch contingent in the ally army the naval affair of holland offer nothing very remarkable the state have always a fleet ready to support the english in they enterprise but no eminent admiral arise to rival the renown of rooke byng benbow and other of they ally the first of those admiral take gibraltar which have ever since remain in the possession of england the great earl of peterborough carry on the war with splendid success in portugal and spain support occasionally by the english fleet under sir cloudesley shovel and that of holland under admiral allemonde and wapenaer during the progress of the war the haughty and longtime imperial loui be reduce to a state of humiliation that excite a compassion so profound as to prevent its own open expression -- the most galling of all sentiment to a proud mind in the year 1709 he solicit peace on term of most abject submission the states-general under the influence of the duke of marlborough and prince eugene reject all he supplication retort unsparingly the insolent harshness with which he have formerly receive similar proposal from they france rouse to renew exertion by the insulting treatment experience by she humiliate but still haughty despot make prodigious but vain effort to repair she ruinous loss in the following year loui renew he attempt to obtain some tolerable condition offer to renounce he grandson and to comply with all the former demand of the confederate even these overture be reject holland and england appear satisfied with nothing short of -- what be after all impracticable -- the total destruction of the great power which loui have so long prove to be incompatible with they welfare the war still go on and the taking of bouchain on the 30th of August 1711 close the almost unrivalled military career of marlborough by the success of one of he boldest and best conduct exploit party intrigue have accomplish what in court parlance be call the disgrace but which in the language of common sense mean only the dismissal of this great man the new ministry who hate the dutch now enter seriously into negotiation with france the queen accede to these view and send special envoy to communicate with the court of versaille the states-general find it impossible to continue hostility if england withdraw from the coalition conference be consequently open at utrecht in the month of January 1712 england take the important station of arbiter in the great question there debate the only essential condition which she demand individually be the renunciation of all claim to the crown of france by philip v and the demolition of the harbor of dunkirk the first of these be the more readily accede to as the great battle of almanza and villaviciosa gain by philip 's general the duke of berwick and vendome have steadily fix he on the throne of spain -- a point still more firmly secure by the death of the emperor joseph i son of leopold and the elevation of he brother charle philip 's competitor for the crown of spain to the imperial dignity by the title of charle vi the peace be not definitively sign until the 11th of April 1713 and france obtain far better condition than those which be refuse she a few year previously the belgian province be give to the new emperor and must henceforth be call the austrian instead of the spanish netherland the gold and the blood of holland have be profusely expend during this contest it might seem for no positive result but the exhaustion produce to every one of the other belligerent be a source of peace and prosperity to the republic its commerce be re-established its financial resource recover they level and altogether we must fix on the epoch now before we as that of its utmost point of influence and greatness france on the contrary be now reduce from its palmy state of almost european sovereignty to one of the deepest misery and its monarch in he old age find little left of he former power but those record of poetry painting sculpture and architecture which tell posterity of he magnificence and the splendor of which throw he fault and he misfortune into the shade the great object now to be accomplish by the united province be the regulation of a distinct and guaranteed line of frontier between the republic and france this object have become by degree ever since the peace of munster a fundamental maxim of they politics the interposition of the belgian province between the republic and france be of serious inconvenience to the former in this point of view it be make the subject of a special article in the grand alliance in the year 1707 it be particularly discuss between england and the state to the great discontent of the emperor who be far from wish its definitive settlement but it be now become a indispensable item in the total of important measure whose accomplishment be call for by the peace of utrecht conference be open on this sole question at antwerp in the year 1714 and after protracted and difficult discussion the treaty of the barrier be conclude on the 15th of November 1715 this treaty be look on with a evil eye in the austrian netherland the clamor be great and general jealousy of the commercial prosperity of holland be the real motive long negotiation take place on the subject of the treaty and in December 1718 the republic consent to modify some of the article the pragmatic sanction publish at vienna in 1713 by charle vi regulate the succession to all the imperial hereditary possession and among the rest the province of the netherland but this arrangement though guarantee by the chief power of europe be in the sequel little respected and but indifferently execute chapter xxi from the peace of utrecht to the incorporation of belgium with the french republic ad 1713 -- 1795 during a period of thirty year follow the treaty of utrecht the republic enjoy the unaccustomed blessing of profound peace while the discontent of the austrian netherland on the subject of the treaty of the barrier be in debate the quadruple alliance be form between holland england france and the emperor for reciprocal aid against all enemy foreign and domestic it be in virtue of this treaty that the pretender to the english throne receive order to remove from france and the states-general about the same time arrest the swedish ambassador baron gortz whose intrigue excite some suspicion the death of loui xiv have once more change the political system of europe and the commencement of the eighteenth century be fertile in negotiation and alliance in which we have at present but little direct interest the rights of the republic be in all instance respect and holland do not cease to be consider as a power of the first distinction and consequence the establishment of a east indium company at ostend by the emperor charle vi in 1722 be the principal cause of disquiet to the united province and the most likely to lead to a rupture but by the treaty of hanover in 1726 the rights of holland result from the treaty of munster be guarantee and in consequence the emperor abolish the company of he creation by the treaty of seville in 1729 and that of vienna in 1731 the peace which now reign in europe allow the united province to direct they whole effort toward the reform of those internal abuse result from feudality and fanaticism confiscation be reverse and property secure throughout the republic it receive into its protection the persecute sectarian of france germany and hungary and the tolerant wisdom which it exercise in these measure give the best assurance of its justice and prudence in one of a contrary nature form a solitary exception to they this be the expulsion of the jesuit whose dangerous and destructive doctrine have be long a warrant for this salutary example to the protestant state of europe in the year 1732 the united province be threaten with imminent peril which accident alone prevent from become fatal to they very existence it be perceive that the dike which have for age preserve the coast be in many place crumble to ruin in spite of the enormous expenditure of money and labor devoted to they preservation by chance it be discover that the beam pile and other timber work employ in the construction of the dike be eat through in all part by a species of sea-worm hitherto unknown the terror of the people be as may be suppose extreme every possible resource be apply which could remedy the evil a hard frost providentially set in and destroy the formidable reptile and the country be thus save from a danger tenfold greater than that involve in a dozen war the peace of europe be once more disturbed in 1733 poland germany france and spain be all embark in the new war holland and england stand aloof and another family alliance of great consequence draw still closer than ever the bond of union between they the young prince of orange who in 1728 have be elect stadtholder of groningen and guelder in addition to that of friesland which have be enjoy by he father have in the year 1734 marry the princess anne daughter of george ii of england and by thus add to the consideration of the house of nassau have open a field for the recovery of all its old distinction the death of the emperor charle vi in October 1740 leave he daughter the archduchess marium theresa heiress of he throne and possession young beautiful and endowed with quality of the highest order she be surround with enemy whose envy and ambition would have despoil she of she splendid rights frederick of prussium surname the great in honor of he ability rather than he sense of justice the elector of bavarium and saxony and the king of spain and sardinium all press forward to the spoliation of a inheritance which seem a fair play for all comer but marium theresa first join she husband duke franci of lorraine in she sovereignty but without prejudice to it under the title of co-regent take a attitude truly heroic when everything seem to threaten the dismemberment of she state she throw herself upon the generous fidelity of she hungarian subject with a dignified resolution that have few example there be imperial grandeur even in she appeal to they compassion the result be electrical and the whole tide of fortune be rapidly turn england and holland be the first to come to the aid of the young and interesting empress george ii at the head of he army gain the victory of dettingen in support of she quarrel in 1743 the states-general have contribute twenty thousand man and a large subsidy to she aid loui xv resolve to throw he whole influence into the scale against these generous effort in the princess 's favor and he invade the austrian netherland in the following year marshal saxe command under he and at first carry everything before he holland have furnish twenty thousand troops and six ship of war to george ii on the invasion of the young pretender be little in a state to oppose any formidable resistance to the enemy that threaten she own frontier the republic wholly attach for so long a period to pursuit of peace and commerce have no longer good general nor effective army nor could it even put a fleet of any importance to sea yet with all these disadvantage it would not yield to the threat nor the demand of france resolve to risk a new war rather than succumb to a enemy it have once so completely humble and give the law to conference be open at breda but interrupted almost as soon as commence hostility be renew the memorable battle of fontenoy be offer and gloriously fight by the ally accept and splendidly win by the french never do the english and dutch troops act more nobly in concert than on this remarkable occasion the valor of the french be not less conspicuous and the success of the day be in a great measure decide by the irish battalion send by the lamentable politics of those and much later day to swell the rank and gain the battle of england 's enemy marshal saxe follow up he advantage the following year take brussels and many other town almost the whole of the austrian netherland be now in the power of loui xv and the united province again expose to invasion and threaten with danger they have once more recourse to the old expedient of the elevation of the house of orange which in time of imminent peril seem to present a never-failing palladium zealand be the first to give the impulsion the other province soon follow the example and william iv be proclaimed stadtholder and captain-general amid the almost unanimous rejoicing of all these dignity be soon after declare hereditary both in the male and female line of succession of the house of orange nassau the year 1748 see the termination of the brilliant campaign of loui xv during this bloody war of eight year ' continuance the treaty of aix-la-chapelle definitively sign on the 18th of October put a end to hostility marium theresa be establish in she rights and power and europe see a fair balance of the nation which give promise of security and peace but the united province when scarcely recover from struggle which have so check they prosperity be employ in new and universal grief and anxiety by the death of they young stadtholder which happen at the hague October 13 1751 he have long be keep out of the government though by no means deficient in the talent suit to he station he son william v aged but three year and a half succeed he under the guardianship of he mother anne of england daughter of george ii a princess represent to be of a proud and ambitious temper who immediately assume a high tone of authority in the state the war of seven year which agitate the north of europe and deluge its plain with blood be almost the only one in which the republic be able to preserve a strict neutrality throughout but this happy state of tranquillity be not as on former occasion attend by that prodigious increase of commerce and that accumulation of wealth which have so often astonish the world differ with england on the policy which lead the latter to weaken and humiliate france jealousy spring up between the two country and dutch commerce become the object of the most vexatious and injurious effort on the part of england remonstrance be vain resistance impossible and the decline of the republic hurry rapidly on the hanseatic town the american colony the northern state of europe and france itself all enter into the rivalry with holland in which however england carry off the most important prize several private and petty encounter take place between the vessel of england and holland in consequence of the pretension of the former to the right of search and have the republic possess the ability of former period and the talent of a tromp or a de ruyter a new war would no doubt have be the result but it be force to submit and a degrading but irritating tranquillity be the consequence for several year the national feeling receive a salve for home-decline by some extension of colonial settlement in the east in which the island of ceylon be include in the midst of this inglorious state of thing and the domestic abundance which be the only compensation for the gradual loss of national influence the installation of william v in 1766 he marriage with the princess of prussium niece of frederick the great in 1768 and the birth of two son the eldest on the 24th of August 1772 successively take place magnificent fete celebrate these event the satisfied citizen little imagine amid they indolent rejoicing the dismal futurity of revolution and distress which be silently but rapidly prepare for they country marium theresa reduce to widowhood by the death of she husband whom she have elevated to the imperial dignity by the title of franci i continue for a while to rule singly she vast possession and have profit so little by the suffering of she own early reign that she join in the iniquitous dismemberment of poland which have leave a indelible stain on she memory and on that of frederick of prussium and catherine of russium in she own dominion she be adore and she name be to this day cherish in belgium among the dearest recollection of the people the impulsion give to the political mind of europe by the revolution in north america be soon feel in the netherland the wish for reform be not merely confirm to the people a memorable instance be offer by joseph ii son and successor of marium theresa that sovereign be not only susceptible of rational notion of change but that the infection of radical extravagance could penetrate even to the imperial crown disgust by the despotism exercise by the clergy of belgium joseph commence he reign by measure that at once rouse a desperate spirit of hostility in the priesthood and soon spread among the bigoted mass of the people who be wholly subservient to they will miscalculate he own power and undervalue that of the priest the emperor issue decree and edict with a sweeping violence that shock every prejudice and rouse every passion perilous to the country toleration to the protestant emancipation of the clergy from the papal yoke reformation in the system of theological instruction be among the wholesale measure of the emperor 's enthusiasm so imprudently attempt and so virulently oppose but ere the deep-sown seed of bigotry ripen to revolt or produce the fruit of active resistance in belgium holland have to endure the mortification of another war with england the republic resolve on a futile imitation of the northern power who have adopt the difficult and anomalous system of a armed neutrality for the prevention of english domination on the sea the right of search so proudly establish by this power be not likely to be wrench from it by manifesto or remonstrance and holland be not capable of a more effectual warfare in the year 1781 st eustache surinam essequibo and demerara be take by british valor and in the following year several of the dutch colony in the east well fortified but ill defend also fall into the hand of england almost the whole of those colony the remnant of prodigious power acquire by such incalculable instance of enterprise and courage be one by one assail and take but this do not suffice for the satisfaction of english object in the prosecution of the war it be also resolve to deprive holland of the baltic trade a squadron of seven vessel command by sir hyde parker be encounter on the dogher bank by a squadron of dutch ship of the same force under admiral zoutman a action of four hour be maintain with all the ancient courage which make so many of the memorable sea-fight between tromp de ruyter blake and monk draw battle a storm separate the combatant and save the honor of each for both have suffer alike and victory have belong to neither the peace of 1784 terminate this short but to holland fatal war the two latter year of which have be in the petty warfare of privateer most disastrous to the commerce of the republic negapatam on the coast of coromandel and the free navigation of the indian sea be cede to england who occupy the other various colony take during the war opinion be now rapidly open out to that spirit of intense inquiry which arise in france and threaten to sweep before it not only all that be corrupt but everything that tend to corruption it be in the very essence of all kind of power to have that tendency and if not check by salutary means to reach that end but the reformer of the last century new in the desperate practice of revolution see its necessity but ignorant of its nature neither do nor could place bound to the career whirlwind that they raise the well-meaning but intemperate change essay by joseph ii in belgium have a considerable share in the development of free principle although they at first seem only to excite the resistance of bigotry and strengthen the growth of superstition holland be always alive to those feeling of resistance to establish authority which characterize republican opinion and the general discontent at the result of the war with england give a good excuse to the pretended patriotism which only want change while it profess reform the stadtholder see clearly the storm which be gather and which menace he power anxious for the present and uncertain for the future he listen to the suggestion of england and resolve to secure and extend by foreign force the rights of which he risk the loss from domestic faction in the division which be now loudly proclaim among the state in favor of or oppose to the house of orange the people despise all new theory which they do not comprehend take open part with the family so closely connect with every practical feeling of good which they country have yet know the state of holland soon proceed to measure of violence resolve to limit the power of the stadtholder they deprive he of the command of the garrison of the hague and of all the other troops of the province and shortly afterward declare he remove from all he employment the violent dispute and vehement discussion consequent upon this measure throughout the republic announce a inevitable commotion the advance of a prussian army toward the frontier inflamed the passion of one party and strengthen the confidence of the other a incident which now happen bring about the crisis even sooner than be expect the princess of orange leave she palace at loo to repair to the hague and travel with great simplicity and slightly attend she be arrest and detain by a military post on the frontier of the province of holland the neighbor magistrate of the town of woesden refuse she permission to continue she journey and force she to return to loo under such surveillance as be usual with a prisoner of state the stadtholder and the english ambassador loudly complain of this outrage the complaint be answer by the immediate advance of the duke of brunswick with twenty thousand prussian soldier some demonstration of resistance be make by the astonished party whose outrageous conduct have provoke the measure but in three week ' time the whole of the republic be in perfect obedience to the authority of the stadtholder who resume all he function of chief magistrate with the additional influence which be sure to result from a vain and unjustifiable attempt to reduce he former power we regret to be beyond the reach of mr elli 's interesting but unpublished work detail the particulars of this revolution the former persual of a copy of it only leave a recollection of its admirable style and the lead fact but not of the detail with sufficient accuracy to justify more than a general reference to the work itself by this time the discontent and agitation in belgium have attain a most formidable height the attempt reformation in religion and judicial abuse persist in by the emperor be represent by a party whose existence be compromise by reform as nothing less than sacrilege and tyranny and blindly reject by a people still totally unfitted for rational enlightenment in point of faith or practice of civilization remonstrance and strong complaint be soon succeed by tumultuous assemblage and open insurrection a lawyer of brussels name vander noot put himself at the head of the malcontent the states-general of brabant declare the new measure of the emperor to be in opposition to the constitution and privilege of the country the other belgian province soon follow this example the prince albert of saxe-teschen and the archduchess marium theresa he wife be at this period joint governors-general of the austrian netherland at the burst of rebellion they attempt to temporize but this only strengthen the revolutionary party while the emperor wholly disapprove they measure and recall they to vienna count murray be now name governor-general and it be evident that the future fate of the province be to depend on the issue of civil war count trautmansdorff the imperial minister at brussels and general d'alton who command the austrian troops take a high tone and evince a peremptory resolution the soldiery and the citizen soon come into contact on many point and blood be spill at brussels mechlin and antwerp the provincial state be convoke for the purpose of vote the usual subsidy brabant after some opposition consent but the state of hainault unanimously refuse the vote the emperor see or suppose that the necessity for decisive measure be now inevitable the refractory state be dissolve and arrest and imprisonment be multiply in all quarter vander noot who have escape to england soon return to the netherland and establish a committee at breda which confer on he the impose title of agent plenipotentiary of the people of brabant he hope under this authority to interest the english prussian and dutch government in favor of he view but he proposal be coldly receive : protesiant state have little sympathy for a people whose resistance be excite not by tyrannical effort against freedom but by broad measure of civil and religious reformation the only fault of which be they attempt application to mind wholly incompetent to comprehend they value leave to themselves the belgian soon give a display of that energetic valor which be natural to they and which would be entitle to still greater admiration have it be evince in a worthier cause during the fermentation which lead to a general rise in the province on the impulse of fanatic zeal the truly enlighten portion of the people conceive the project of raise on the ruin of monkish superstition and aristocratical power a edifice of constitutional freedom vonck also a advocate of brussels take the lead in this splendid design and he and he friend prove themselves to have reach the level of that true enlightenment which distinguish the close of the eighteenth century but the vonckist as they be call form but a small minority compare with the besotted mass and overwhelm by fanaticism on the one hand and despotism on the other they be unable to act effectually for the public good vander mersch a soldier of fortune and a man of considerable talent who have raise himself from the rank to the command of a regiment and have be form in the school of the seven year ' war be appoint to the command of the patriot force joseph ii be declare to have forfeit he sovereignty in brabant and hostility soon commence by a regular advance of the insurgent army upon that province vander mersch display consummate ability in this crisis where so much depend upon the prudence of the military chief he make no rash attempt to which commander be sometimes induce by reliance upon the enthusiasm of a newly revolt people he however take the earliest safe opportunity of come to blow with the enemy and have cleverly induce the austrian to follow he into the very street of the town of turnhout he there enter on a bloody contest and finally defeat the imperialist with considerable loss he next manoeuvre with great ability and succeed in make he way into the province of flander take ghent by assault and soon reduce bruge ypre and ostend at the news of these success the governors-general quit brussels in all haste the state of flander assemble in junction with those of brabant both province be free from the presence of the austrian troops vander noot and the committee of breda make a entrance into brussels with all the pomp of royalty and in the early part of the following year -lrb- 1790 -rrb- a treaty of union be sign by the seven revolt province now form into a confederation under the name of the unite belgian state all the hope arise from these brilliant event be soon however to be blighted by the scorching heat of faction joseph ii whose temperament appear to have be too sensitive to support the shock of disappointment in plan which spring from the purest motive see in addition to this successful insurrection against he power he beloved sister the queen of france menace with the horror of a inevitable revolution he over-sanguine expectation of successfully rival the glory of frederick and catherine and the ill success of he war against the turk all tend to break down he enthusiastic spirit which only want the elastic resistance of fortitude to have make he a great character he for some time sink into a profound melancholy and expire on the 20th of January 1791 accuse he belgian subject of have cause he premature death leopold the successor of he brother display much sagacity and moderation in the measure which he adopt for the recovery of the revolted province but they internal disunion be the best ally of the new emperor the violent party which now rule at brussels have ungratefully forget the eminent service of vander mersch and accuse he of treachery merely from he attachment to the noble view and principle of the widely-increasing party of the vonckist induce by the hope of reconcile the oppose party he leave he army in namur and imprudently venture into the power of general schoenfeld who command the troops of the state vander mersch be instantly arrest and throw into prison where he linger for month until set free by the overthrow of the faction he have raise to power but he do not recover he liberty to witness the realization of he hope for that of he country the states-general in they triumph over all that be truly patriotic occupy themselves solely in contemptible labor to establish the monkish absurdity which joseph have suppress the overture of the new emperor be reject with scorn and as might be expect from this combination of bigotry and rashness the imperial troops under general bender march quietly to the conquest of the whole country town after town open they gate while vander noot and he partisan betake themselves to rapid and disgraceful flight on the 10th of December 1791 the minister of the emperor conclude a convention with those of england russium and holland -lrb- which power guarantee its execution -rrb- by which leopold grant a amnesty for all past offence and confirm to all he recovered province they ancient constitution and privilege and thus return under the domination of austrium belgium see its best chance for successfully follow the noble example of the united province paralyze by the short-sighted bigotry which deprive the national courage of all moral force leopold enjoy but a short time the fruit of he well-measured indulgence : he die almost suddenly march 1 1792 and be succeed by he son franci ii whose fate it be to see those province of belgium which have cost he ancestor so many struggle to maintain wrest forever from the imperial power belgium present at this period a aspect of paramount interest to the world less owe to its intrinsic importance than to its become at once the point of contest between the contend power and the theater of the terrible struggle between republican france and the monarch she brave and battle with the whole combination of european policy be stake on the question of the french possession of this country this war between france and austrium begin its earliest operation on the very first day after the accession of franci ii the victory of jemappe gain by dumouriez be the first great event of the campaign the austrian be on all side drive out dumouriez make he triumphal entry into brussels on the 13th of November and immediately after the occupation of this town the whole of flander brabant and hainault with the other belgian province be subject to france soon afterward several pretend deputy from the belgian people hasten to pari and implore the convention to grant they a share of that liberty and equality which be to confer such inestimable blessing on france various decree be issue in consequence and after the mockery of a public choice hurry on in several of the town by hire jacobin and well-paid patriot the incorporation of the austrian netherland with the french republic be formally pronounced the next campaign destroy this whole fabric of revolution dumouriez beat at nerwinde by the prince of saxe-coburg abandon not only he last year 's conquest but flee from he own army to pass the remainder of he life on a foreign soil and leave he reputation a doubtful legacy to history belgium once again in the possession of austrium be place under the government of the archduke charle the emperor 's brother who be destine to a very brief continuance in this precarious authority during this and the succeed year the war be continue with unbroken perseverance and a constant fluctuation in its result in the various battle which be fight and the siege which take place the english army be as usual in the foremost rank under the duke of york second son of george iii the prince of orange at the head of the dutch troops prove he inheritance of the valor which seem inseparable from the name of nassau the archduke charle lay the foundation of he subsequent high reputation the emperor franci himself fight valiantly at the head of he troops but all the coalesced courage of these prince and they army could not effectually stop the progress of the republican arm the battle of fleurus render the french completely master of belgium and the representative of the city of brussels once more repair to the national convention of france to solicit the reincorporation of the two country this be not however finally pronounced till the 1st of October 1795 by which time the violence of a arbitrary government have give the people a sample of what they be to expect the austrian netherland and the province of liege be divide into nine department form a integral part of the french republic and this new state of thing be consolidate by the preliminary of peace sign at leoben in styrium between the french general bonaparte and the archduke charle and confirm by the treaty of campo-formio on the 17th of October 1797 chapter xxii from the invasion of holland by the french to the return of the prince of orange ad 1794 -- 1818 while the fate of belgium be decide on the plain of fleurus pichegru prepare to carry the triumphant arm of france into the heart of holland he cross the meuse at the head of one hundred thousand man and soon gain possession of most of the chief place of flander a unusually severe winter be set in but a circumstance which in common case retard the operation of war be in the present instance the means of hurry on the conquest on which the french general be bent the arm of the sea which have hitherto be the best defence of holland now become solid mass of ice battlefield on which the soldier manoeuvre and the artillery thunder as if the law of the element be repeal to hasten the fall of the once proud and long flourishing republic nothing could arrest the ambitious ardor of the invader the duke of york and he brave army resist to the utmost but bear down by number he be drive from position to position battery cannon and magazine be successfully take and pichegru be soon at the term of he brilliant exploit but holland speedily cease to be a scene of warfare the discontented portion of the citizen now the majority rejoice to retaliate the revolution of 1787 by another receive the french as liberator reduce to extremity yet still capable by the aid of he ally of make a long and desperate resistance the stadtholder take the nobler resolution of save he fellow-citizen from the horror of prolonged warfare he repair to the hague present himself in the assembly of the states-general and solemnly deposit in they hand the exercise of the supreme power which he find he could no longer wield but to entail misery and ruin on he conquered country after this splendid instance of true patriotism and rare virtue he quit holland and take refuge in england the states-general dissolve a national assembly install at the hague and the stadtholderate abolish the united province now change they form of government they long-cherished institution and they very name and be christen the batavian republic assurance of the most flattering nature be profusely shower on the new state by the sister republic which have effect this new revolution but the first measure of regeneration be the necessity of pay for the recover independence which be effect for the sum of one hundred million florin the new constitution be almost entirely model on that of france and the promise independence soon become a state of deplorable suffering and virtual slavery incalculable evil be the portion of holland in the part which she be force to take in the war between france and england she marine be nearly annihilate and some of she most valuable possession in the indy ravish from she by the british arm she be at the same time oblige to cede to she ally the whole of dutch flander maestricht venloo and they dependency and to render free and common to both nation the navigation of the rhine the meuse and the scheldt the internal situation of the unfortunate republic be deplorable under the weight of a enormous and daily increase debt all the resource of trade and industry be paralyzed universal misery take place of opulence and not even the consolation of a free constitution remain to the people they vainly seek that blessing from each new government of the country whose destiny they follow but whose advantage they do not share they see themselves successively govern by the states-general a national assembly and the directory but these ephemeral authority have not sufficient weight to give the nation domestic happiness nor consideration among the other power on the 11th of October 1797 the english admiral sir adam duncan with a superior force encounter the dutch fleet under de winter off camperdown and in spite of the bravery of the latter he be take prisoner with nine ship of the line and a frigate a expedition on a extensive scale be soon after fit out in england to co-operate with a russian force for the establishment of the house of orange the helder be the destination of this armament which be command by sir ralph abercrombie the duke of york soon arrive in the texel with a considerable reinforcement a series of severe and well-contested action near bergen end in the defeat of the ally and the abandonment of the enterprise the only success of which be the capture of the remains of the dutch fleet which be safely convey to england from this period the weight of french oppression become every day more intolerable in holland minister general and every other species of functionary with swarm of minor tyrant while treat the country as a conquer province deprive it of all share in the brilliant though checkered glory gain by that to which it be subservient the dutch be rob of national independence and personal freedom while the word liberty and equality be everywhere emblazon the french ambassador assume a almost oriental despotism the language and form of a free government be use only to sanction a foreign tyranny and the batavian republic reduce to the most hopeless and degraded state be in fact but a forced appendage chained to the triumphal car of france napoleon bonaparte create by the force of he prodigious talent the circumstance of which inferior mind be but the creature now rapidly rise to the topmost height of power he not only tower above the mass of prejudice which long custom have legalize but spurn the multitude by whom these prejudice have be overthrow yet he be not of the first order of great mind for he want that grand principle of self-control which be the supreme attribute of greatness potent and almost irresistible in every conflict with other and only to be vanquish by he own act he possess many of the higher quality of genius he be rapid resolute and daring fill with contempt for the littleness of mankind yet molding every atom which compose that littleness to purpose at utter variance with its nature in defiance of the first essence of republican theory he build himself a imperial throne on the crushed privilege of a prostrate people and he lavish title and dignity on man raise from its very dregs with a profusion which make nobility a byword of scorn kingdom be create for he brother and he friend and the batavian republic be make a monarchy to give loui a dignity or at least a title like the rest the character of loui bonaparte be gentle and amiable he manners easy and affable he enter on he new rank with the best intention toward the country which he be send to reign over and though he feel acutely when the people refuse he mark of respect and applause which be frequently the case he temper be not sour and he conceive no resentment he endeavor to merit popularity and though he power be scanty he effort be not wholly unsuccessful he labor to revive the ruin trade which he know to be the staple of dutch prosperity : but the measure spring from this praiseworthy motive be totally oppose to the policy of napoleon and in proportion as loui make friend and partisan among he subject he excite bitter enmity in he imperial brother loui be so averse from the continental system or exclusion of british manufacture that during he short reign every facility be give to he subject to elude it even in defiance of the order convey to he from paris through the medium of the french ambassador at the hague he impose no restraint on public opinion nor would he establish the odious system of espionage cherish by the french police but he be fickle in he purpose and prodigal in he expense the profuseness of he expenditure be very offensive to the dutch notion of respectability in matter of private finance and injurious to the exist state of the public mean the tyranny of napoleon become soon quite insupportable to he so much so that it be believe that have the ill-fated english expedition to walcheren in 1809 succeed and the army advance into the country he would have declare war against france after a ineffectual struggle of more than three year he choose rather to abdicate he throne than retain it under the degrading condition of proconsulate subserviency this measure excited considerable regret and much esteem for the man who prefer the retirement of private life to the meanness of regal slavery but loui leave a galling memento of misplace magnificence in a increase of ninety million of florin -lrb- about nine million sterling -rrb- to the already oppressive amount of the national debt of the country the annexation of holland to the french empire be immediately pronounce by napoleon two-third of the national debt be abolish the conscription law be introduce and the berlin and milan decree against the introduction of british manufacture be rigidly enforce the nature of the evil inflict on the dutch people by this annexation and its consequence demand a somewhat minute examination previous to it all that part of the territory of the former united province have be cede to france the kingdom of holland consist of the department of the zuyder zee the mouth of the maese the upper yssel the mouth of the yssel friesland and the western and eastern em and the population of the whole do not exceed one million eight hundred thousand soul when loui abdicate he throne he leave a military and naval force of eighteen thousand man who be immediately take into the service of france and in three year and a half after that event this number be increase to fifty thousand by the operation of the french naval and military code : thus about a thirty-sixth part of the whole population be employ in arm the force include in the maritime conscription be wholly employ in the navy the national guard be on constant duty in the garrison or naval establishment the cohort be by law only liable to serve in the _ interior _ of the french empire -- that be to say from hamburg to rome but after the russian campaign this limitation be disregard and they form a part of napoleon 's army at the battle of bautzen the conscription law now begin to be execute with the greatest rigor and though the strictest justice and impartiality be observe in the ballot and other detail of this most oppressive measure yet it have be calculate that on a average nearly one-half of the male population of the age of twenty year be annually take off the conscript be tell that they service be not to extend beyond the term of five year but as few instance occur of a french soldier be discharge without he be declare unfit for service it be always consider in holland that the service of a conscript be tantamount to a obligation during life besides the regulation respect the conscription be annually change by which mean the code become each year more intricate and confused and as the explanation of any doubt rest with the functionary to whom the execution of the law be confide there be little chance of they construction mitigate its severity but the conscription however galling be general in its operation not so the formation of the emperor 's guard of honor the member of this patrician troop be choose from the most noble and opulent family particularly those who be deem inimical to the french connection the selection depend altogether on the prefect who be sure to name those most obnoxious to he political or personal dislike without regard to they rank or occupation or even the state of they health no exemption be admit -- not even to those who from mental or bodily infirmity or other cause have be declare unfit for general military duty the victim be force to the mockery of volunteer they service oblige to provide themselves with horse arm and accoutrements and when arrive at the depot appoint for they assemble consider probably but as hostage for the fidelity of they relative the various tax be lay on and levy in the most oppressive manner those on land usually amount to twenty-five and those on house to thirty per cent of the clear annual rent other direct tax be levy on person and movable property and all be regulate on a scale of almost intolerable severity the whole sum annually obtain from holland by these means amount to about thirty million of florin -lrb- or three million pound sterling -rrb- be at the rate of about one pound thirteen shilling four penny from every soul inhabit the country the operation of what be call the continental system create a excess of misery in holland only to be understand by those who witness its lamentable result in other country belgium for instance where great manufactory exist the loss of maritime communication be compensate by the exclusion of english goods in state possess of large and fertile territory the population which could no longer be employ in commerce might be occupy in agricultural pursuit but in holland whose manufacture be inconsiderable and whose territory be insufficient to support its inhabitant the destruction of trade throw innumerable individual wholly out of employment and produce a graduate scale of poverty in all rank a considerable part of the population have be employ in various branch of the traffic carry on by means of the many canal which convey merchandise from the seaport into the interior and to the different continental market when the communication with england be cut off principal and subordinate be involve in a common ruin in france the effect of the continental system be somewhat alleviate by the license trade the exportation of various production force on the rest of continental europe and the encouragement give to home manufacture but all this be reverse in holland : the few licens grant to the dutch be clog with duty so exorbitant as to make they useless the duty on one ship which enter the maese load with sugar and coffee amounting to about fifty thousand pound sterling at the same time every means be use to crush the remnant of dutch commerce and sacrifice the country to france the dutch troops be clothe and arm from french manufactory the frontier be open to the introduction of french commodity duty free and the dutch manufacturer undersell in he own market the population of amsterdam be reduce from two hundred and twenty thousand soul to one hundred and ninety thousand of which a fourth part derive they whole subsistence from charitable institution while another fourth part receive partial succor from the same source at haarlem where the population have be chiefly employ in bleaching and prepare linen make in brabant whole street be level with the ground and more than five hundred house destroy at the hague at delft and in other town many inhabitant have be induce to pull down they house from inability to keep they in repair or pay the tax the preservation of the dike require a annual expense of six hundred thousand pound sterling be everywhere neglect the sea inundate the country and threaten to resume its ancient dominion no object of ambition no source of professional wealth or distinction remain to which a hollander could aspire none could voluntarily enter the army or navy to fight for the worst enemy of holland the clergy be not provide with a decent competency the ancient law of the country so dear to its pride and its prejudice be replace by the code napoleon so that old practitioner have to recommence they study and young man be disgust with the drudgery of learn a system which be universally pronounced unfit for a commercial country independent of this mass of positive ill it must be bear in mind that in holland trade be not merely a means of gain wealth but a passion long and deeply graft on the national mind : so that the dutch feel every aggravation of calamity consider themselves degraded and sacrifice by a power which have rob they of all which attach a people to they native land and for a accumulate list of evil only offer they the empty glory of appertain to the country which give the law to all the nation of europe with the sole exception of england those who have consider the event note in this history for the last two hundred year and follow the fluctuation of public opinion depend on prosperity or misfortune will have anticipate that in the present calamitous state of the country all eye be turn toward the family whose memory be revive by every pang of slavery and associate with every throb for freedom the presence of the prince of orange william iv who have on the death of he father succeed to the title though he have lose the revenue of he ancient house and the re-establishment of the connection with england be now the general desire some of the principal partisan of the house of nassau be for some time in correspondence with he most serene highness the leader of the various party into which the country be divide become by degree more closely unite approach toward a better understanding be reciprocally make and they end in a general anxiety for the expulsion of the french with the establishment of a free constitution and a cordial desire that the prince of orange should be at its head it may be safely affirm that at the close of the year 1813 these be the unanimous wish of the dutch nation napoleon lose in the labyrinth of he exorbitant ambition afford at length a chance of redress to the nation he have enslave elevated so suddenly and so high he seem suspend between two influence and unfit for either he might in a moral view be say to have breathe badly in a station which be beyond the atmosphere of he natural world without be out of its attraction and have reach the pinnacle he soon lose he balance and fall drive from russium by the junction of human with elemental force in 1812 he make some grand effort in the following year to recover from he irremediable reverse the battle of bautzen and lutzen be the expire effort of he greatness that of leipzig put a fatal negative upon the hope that spring from the two former and the obstinate ambition which at this epoch make he refuse the most liberal offer of the ally be justly punish by humiliation and defeat almost all the power of europe now league against he and france itself be worn out by he wasteful expenditure of man and money he have no longer a chance in resistance the empire be attack at all point the french troops in holland be draw off to reinforce the army in distant direction and the whole military force in that country scarcely exceed ten thousand man the advance of the combined army toward the frontier become generally know : party of cossack have enter the north of holland in November and be scour the country beyond the yssel the moment for action on the part of the dutch confederate patriot have now arrive and it be not lose or neglect a people inure to revolution for upward of two century fill with proud recollection and urge on by well-digested hope be the most likely to understand the best period and the surest means for success a attempt that might have appear to other nation rash be prove to be wise both by the reasoning of its author and its own result the intolerable tyranny of france have make the population not only ripe but eager for revolt this disposition be act on by a few enterprising man at once partisan of the house of orange and patriot in the truest sense of the word it would be unjust to omit the mention of some of they name in even this sketch of the event which spring from they courage and sagacity count styrum messieur repelaer d'jonge van hogendorp vander duyn van maasdam and changuion be the chief of the intrepid junta which plan and execute the bold measure of enfranchisement and draw up the outline of the constitution which be afterward enlarged and ratify they first movement at the hague be totally unsupported by foreign aid they early check from the exasperated french and they overcautious countryman would have deter most man embark in so perilous a venture but they never swerve nor shrink back at the head of a force which courtesy and policy call a army of three hundred national guard badly armed fifty citizen carry fowling-piece fifty soldier of the old dutch guard four hundred auxiliary citizen arm with pike and a cavalry force of twenty young man the confederate oddly proclaim the prince of orange on the 17th of November 1813 in they open village of the hague and in the tooth of a french force of full ten thousand man occupy every fortress in the country while a few gentleman thus boldly come forward at they own risk with no fund but they private fortune and only aid by a unarmed populace to declare war against the french emperor they do not even know the residence of the exile prince in whose cause they be now so completely compromise the other town of holland be in a state of the greatest incertitude : rotterdam have not move and the intention of admiral kickert who command there be -lrb- mistakenly -rrb- suppose to be decidedly hostile to the national cause amsterdam have on the precede day be the scene of a popular commotion which however bear no decide character the rioter have be fire on by the national guard no leader come forward and the proclamation of the magistrate cautiously abstain from any allusion to the prince of orange a brave officer captain falck have make use of many strong but inefficient argument to prevail on the timid corporation to declare for the prince the presence of a french garrison of sixty man seem sufficient to preserve they patriotism from any violent excess the subsequent event at the hague furnish a inspiring lesson for all people who would learn that to be free they must be resolute and daring the only hope of the confederate be from the british government and the combined army then act in the north of europe but many day be to be linger through before troops could be embark and make they way from england in the tooth of the easterly wind then prevail while a few cossack hover on the confines of holland give the only evidence of the proximity of the ally force in this crisis it be most fortunate that the french prefect at the hague m de stassart have steal away on the earliest alarm and the french garrison of four hundred chasseur aid by one hundred well-armed custom-house officer under the command of general bouvier des eclats catch the contagious fear of the civil functionary this force have retire to the old palace -- a building in the center of the town the depot of all the arm and ammunition then at the hague and from its position capable of some defense but the general and he garrison soon feel a complete panic from the bold attitude of count styrum who make the most of he little means and keep up during the night a prodigious clatter by he twenty horseman sentinel challenge amid incessant singing and shout cry of oranje boven vivat oranje and clamorous patrol of the excited citizen at a early hour on the 18th the french general demand term and obtain permission to retire on gorcum he garrison be escort as far as the village of ryswyk by the twenty cavalier who compose the whole mount force of the patriot unceasing effort be now make to remedy the want of arm and man a quantity of pike be rudely make and distribute to the volunteer who crowd in and numerous fishing-boat be despatch in different direction to inform the british cruiser of the pass event a individual name pronck a inhabitant of schævening a village of the coast render great service in this way from he influence among the sailor and fisherman in the neighborhood the confederate spare no exertion to increase the confidence of the people under many contradictory and disheartening contingency a officer who have be despatch for advice and information to baron bentinck at zwolle who be in communication with the ally return with the discourage news that general bulow have order not to pass the yssel the ally have decide not to advance into holland beyond the line of that river a meeting of the ancient regent of the hague be convoke by the proclamation of the confederate and take place at the house of mr van hogendorp the ancient residence of the de witts the wary magistrate absolutely refuse all co-operation in the daring measure of the confederate who have now the whole responsibility on they head with little to cheer they on in they perilous career but they own resolute heart and the recollection of those day when they ancestor with odds as fearfully against they rise up and shiver to atom the yoke of they oppressor some day of intense anxiety now elapse and various incident occur to keep up the general excitement reinforcement come gradually in no hostile measure be resort to by the french troops yet the want of success as rapid as be proportion to the first movement of the revolution throw a gloom over all amsterdam and rotterdam still hold back but the nomination of messr van hogendorp and vander duyn van maasdam to be head of the government until the arrival of the prince of orange and a formal abjuration of the emperor napoleon inspire new vigor into the public mind two nominal army be form and two general appoint to the command and it be impossible to resist a smile of mingled amusement and admiration on read the exact statement of the force so pompously and so effectively announce as form the army of utrecht and gorcum the first of these command by major-general d'jonge consist of three hundred infantry thirty-two volunteer cavalry with two eight-pounder the latter under the order of major-general sweertz van landa be compose of two hundred and fifty of the hague orange guard thirty prussian deserter from the french garrison three hundred volunteer forty cavalry with two eight-pounder the army of gorcum march on the 22d on rotterdam : its arrival be joyfully hail by the people who contribute three hundred volunteer to swell its rank the army of utrecht advance on leyden and raise the spirit of the people by the display of even so small a force but still the contrary wind keep back all appearance of succor from england and the enemy be know to meditate a general attack on the patriot line from amsterdam to dordrecht the bad state of the road still retard the approach of the far-distant army of the ally alarm true and false be spread on all hand -- when the appearance of three hundred cossack detach from the russian army beyond the yssel prevail over the hesitation of amsterdam and the other town and they at length declare for the prince of orange but this somewhat tardy determination seem to be the signal for various petty event which at a epoch like that be magnify into transaction of the most fatal import a reinforcement of one thousand five hundred french troops reach gorcum from antwerp : a detachment of twenty-five dutch with a piece of cannon be surprise at one of the outpost of woerden which have be previously evacuate by the french and the recapture of the town be accompany by some excess the number and the cruelty of the enemy be greatly exaggerated consternation begin to spread all over the country the french who seem to have recover from they panic have resume on all side offensive operation the garrison of gorcum make a sortie repulse the force under general van landa enter the town of dordrecht and levy contribution but the inhabitant soon expel they and the army be enable to resume its position still the wind continue adverse to arrival from the english coast the cossack so often announce have not yet reach the hague and the small unsupported party in the neighborhood of amsterdam be in daily danger of be cut off in this crisis the confederate be place in a most critical position on the eve of failure and with the certainty in such a result of be brand as rebel and zealot whose rashness have draw down ruin on themselves they family and they country it require no common share of fortitude to bear up against the danger that threaten they aware of its extent they calmly and resolutely oppose it and each seem to vie with the other in energy and firmness the anxiety of the public have reach the utmost possible height every shift of the wind be watch with nervous agitation the road from the hague to the sea be constantly cover with a crowd of every age and sex each sail that come in sight be watch and examine with intense interest and at length on the 26th of November a small boat be see to approach the shore and the inquire glance of the observer soon discover that it contain a englishman this individual who have come over on a mercantile adventure land amid the loudest acclamation and be conduct by the populace in triumph to the governor 's dress in a english volunteer uniform he show himself in every part of the town to the great delight of the people who hail he as the precursor and type of a army of deliverer the french soon retreat before the marvellous exaggeration which the come of this single englishman give rise to the dutch display great ability in the transmission of false intelligence to the enemy on the 27th mr fagel arrive from england with a letter from the prince of orange announce he immediate coming and finally the disembarkation of two hundred english marine on the 29th be follow the next day by the landing of the prince whose impatience to throw himself into the open arm of he country make he spurn every notion of risk and every reproach for rashness he be receive with indescribable enthusiasm the generous flame rush through the whole country no bound be set to the affectionate confidence of the nation and no prince ever give a nobler example of gratitude as the people everywhere proclaim william i sovereign prince it be propose that he should everywhere assume that title it be however after some consideration decide that no step

the enthusiastic greeting of he fellow-countryman and meet they confidence by a full measure of magnanimity on the 3d of December he publish a address from which we shall quote one paragraph : you desire netherland that i should be intrust with a greater share of power than i should have possess but for my absence you confidence you affection offer I the sovereignty and i be call upon to accept it since the state of my country and the situation of europe require it i accede to you wish i overlook the difficulty which may attend such a measure i accept the offer which you have make I but i accept it only on one condition -- that it shall be accompany by a wise constitution which shall guarantee you liberty and secure they against every attack my ancestor sow the seed of you independence : the preservation of that independence shall be the constant object of the effort of myself and those around I chapter xxiii from the installation of william i as prince sovereign of the netherland to the battle of waterloo ad 1814 -- 1815 the regeneration of holland be rapid and complete within four month a army of twenty-five thousand man be raise and in the midst of financial judicial and commercial arrangement the grand object of the constitution be calmly and seriously debate a committee consist of fourteen person of the first importance in the several province furnish the result of three month ' labor in the plan of a political code which be immediately print and publish for the consideration of the people at large twelve hundred name be next choose from among the most respectable householder in the different town and province include person of every religious persuasion whether jew or christian a special commission be then form who select from this number six hundred name and every housekeeper be call on to give he vote for or against they election a large majority of the six hundred notable thus choose meet at amsterdam on the 28th of march 1814 the follow day they assemble with a immense concourse of people in the great church which be splendidly fit up for the occasion and then and there the prince in a impressive speech solemnly offer the constitution for acceptance or rejection after a few hour ' deliberation a discharge of artillery announce to the anxious population that the constitution have be accept the number present be four hundred and eighty-three and the vote as follow : aye four hundred and fifty-eight no twenty-five there be one hundred and seventeen member absent several of these be keep away by unavoidable obstacle the majority among they be consider as dissentient but it be calculate that if the whole body of six hundred have vote the adoption of the constitution would have be carry by a majority of five-sixth the dissentient chiefly object to the power of declare war and conclude treaty of peace be vest in the sovereign some individual urge that the protestant interest be endanger by the admission of person of every persuasion to all public office and the catholic complain that the state do not sufficiently contribute to the support of they religious establishment such objection as these be to be expect from individual interest or sectarian prejudice but they prove that the whole plan be fairly consider and solemnly adopt that so far from be the dictation of a government it be the freely choose charter of the nation at large offer and swear to by the prince whose authority be only exert in restrain and modify the overardent generosity and confidence of the people only one day more elapse before the new sovereign be solemnly inaugurate and take the oath prescribe by the constitution : i swear that first and above all thing i will maintain the constitution of the unite netherland and that i will promote to the utmost of my power the independence of the state and the liberty and prosperity of its inhabitant in the eloquent simplicity of this pledge the dutch nation find a ample guarantee for they freedom and happiness with they characteristic wisdom and moderation they see that the obligation it impose embrace everything they could demand and they join in the opinion express by the sovereign in he inaugural address that no greater degree of liberty could be desire by rational subject nor any larger share of power by the sovereign than that allot to they respectively by the political code while holland thus resume its place among free nation and france be restore to the bourbon by the abdication of napoleon the ally army have take possession of and occupy the remainder of the low country or those province distinguish by the name of belgium -lrb- but then still form department of the french empire -rrb- and the provisional government be vest in baron vincent the austrian general this choice seem to indicate a intention of restore austrium to she ancient domination over the country such be certainly the common opinion among those who have no means of penetrate the secret of european policy at that important epoch it be in fact quite conformable to the principle of _ statu_quo_ante_bellum _ adopt toward france baron vincent himself seem to have be impress with the false notion and there do not exist a doubt throughout belgium of the re-establishment of the old institution but the intention of the ally power be of a nature far different the necessity of a consolidated state capable of offer a barrier to french aggression on the flemish frontier be evident to the various power who have so long suffer from its want by england particularly such a field be require for the operation of she army and it be also to the interest of that nation that holland whose welfare and prosperity be so closely connect with she own should enjoy the blessing of national independence and civil liberty guarantee by internal strength as well as friendly alliance the treaty of pari -lrb- 30th may 1814 -rrb- be the first act which give a open manifestation of this principle it be stipulate by its sixth article that holland place under the sovereignty of the house of orange should receive a increase of territory in this be explain the primitive notion of the creation of the kingdom of the netherland base on the necessity of augment the power of a nation which be destine to turn the balance between france and germany the follow month witness the execution of the treaty of london which prescribe the precise nature of the project increase it be wholly decide without subject the question to the approbation of belgium that that country and holland should form one united state and the rule of government in the chief branch of its administration be completely fix the prince of orange and the plenipotentiary of the great ally power covenant by this treaty : first that the union of the two portion form the kingdom of the netherland should be as perfect as possible form one state govern in conformity with the fundamental law of holland which might be modify by common consent secondly that religious liberty and the equal right of citizen of all persuasion to fill all the employment of the state should be maintain thirdly that the belgian province should be fairly represent in the assembly of the states-general and that the session of the state in time of peace should be hold alternately in belgium and in holland fourthly and fifthly that all the commercial privilege of the country should be common to the citizen at large that the dutch colony should be consider as belong equally to belgium and finally that the public debt of the two country and the expense of its interest should be bear in common we shall now briefly recapitulate some striking point in the material which be thus mean to be amalgamated holland wrench from the spanish yoke by the genius and courage of the early prince of orange have form for two century a independent republic to which the extension of maritime commerce have give immense wealth the form of government be remarkable it be compose of seven province mutually independent of each other these province possess during the middle age constitution nearly similar to that of england : a sovereign with limited power representative of the noble and common whose concurrence with the prince be necessary for the formation of law and finally the existence of municipal privilege which each town preserved and extend by means of its proper force this state of thing have know but one alteration -- but that a mighty one -- the forfeiture of philip ii at the latter end of the sixteenth century and the total abolition of monarchical power the remain form of the government be hardly alter so that the state be wholly regulate by its ancient usage and like some gothic edifice its beauty and solidity be perfectly original and different from the general rule and modern theory of surround nation the country love its liberty such as it find it and not in the fashion of any utopian plan trace by some new-fangled system of political philosophy inherently protestant and commercial the dutch abhor every yoke but that of they own law of which they be proud even in they abuse they hold in particular detestation all french custom in remembrance of the wretchedness they have suffer from french tyranny they have unbounded confidence in the house of orange from long experience of its hereditary virtue the main strength of holland be in fact in its recollection but these perhaps generate a germ of discontent in lead it to expect a revival of all the influence it have lose and be little likely to recover in the total change of system and the variation of trade there nevertheless remain sufficient capital in the country and the people be sufficiently enlighten to give just and extensive hope for the future which now dawn on they the obstacle offer by the dutch character to the propose union be chiefly to be find in the dogmatical opinion consequent on the isolation of the country from all the principle that actuate other state and particularly that with which it be now join : while long-cherished sentiment of opposition to the catholic religion be little likely to lead to feeling of accommodation and sympathy with its new fellow-citizen the inhabitant of belgium accustom to foreign domination be little shocked by the fact of the ally power have dispose of they fate with consult they wish but they be not so indifferent to the double discovery of find themselves the subject of a dutch and a protestant king without enter at large into any invidious discussion on the cause of the natural jealousy which they feel toward holland it may suffice to state that such do exist and in no very moderate degree the country have hitherto have but little community of interest with each other and they form element so utterly discordant as to afford but slight hope that they would speedily coalesce the lower class of the belgian population be ignorant as well as superstitious -lrb- not that these two quality be to be consider as inseparable -rrb- and if they be averse to the dutch they be perhaps not more favorably dispose to the french and austrian the majority of the noble may be say to have lean more at this period to the latter than to either of the other two people but the great majority of the industrious and better inform portion of the middle order feel differently from the other two because they have find tangible and positive advantage in they subjection to france which overpower every sentiment of political degradation we thus see there be little sympathy between the member of the national family the first glance at the geographical position of holland and belgium might lead to a belief that they interest be analogous but we have trace the anomaly in government and religion in the two country which lead to totally different pursuit and feeling holland have sacrifice manufacture to commerce the introduction duty free of grain from the northern part of europe though check the progress of agriculture have not prevent it to flourish marvellously consider this obstacle to culture and faithful to they traditional notion the dutch see the element of well-being only in that liberty of importation which have make they harbor the mart and magazine of europe but the belgian to use the expression of a acute and well-informed writer restricted in the thrall of a less liberal religion be bound in the narrow circle of he actual locality concentrate in he home he do not look beyond the limit of he native land which he regard exclusively incurious and stationary in a happy existence he have no interest in what pass beyond he own door totally unaccustomed to the free principle of trade so cherish by the dutch the belgian have find under the protection of the french custom-house law a internal commerce and agricultural advantage which compose they peculiar prosperity they find a consumption for the produce of they well-cultivated land at high price in the neighboring province of france the web weave by the belgian peasantry and generally all the manufacture of the country meet no rivalry from those of england which be strictly prohibit and be commonly superior to those of france the sale be sure and the profit considerable belgium be as naturally desirous of the state of thing as holland be indifferent to it but in could only have be accomplish by the destruction of free trade and the exclusive protection of internal manufacture under such discrepancy as we have thus trace in religion character and local interest the two country be make one and on the new monarch devolve the hard and delicate task of reconcile each party in the ill-assorted match and inspiring they with sentiment of mutual moderation under the title of governor-general of the netherland -lrb- for he intended elevation to the throne and the definitive junction of holland and belgium be still publicly unknown -rrb- the prince of orange repair to he new state he arrive at brussels in the month of August 1814 and he first effort be to gain the heart and the confidence of the people though he see the noble and the higher order of the inferior class -lrb- with the exception of the merchant -rrb- intriguing all around he for the re-establishment of the austrian power petition on this subject be print and distribute and the model of those anti-national document may still be refer to in a work publish at the time -lrb- 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : history of the low country by st genoist -rrb- as soon as the moment come for promulgate the decision of the sovereign power as to the actual extent of the new kingdom -- that be to say in the month of February 1815 -- the whole plan be make public and a commission consist of twenty-seven member dutch and belgian be form to consider the modification necessary in the fundamental law of holland in pursuance of the stipulation of the treaty of london after due deliberation these modification be form and the great political pact be complete for the final acceptance of the king and people as a document so important merit particular consideration in reference to the formation of the new monarchy we shall briefly condense the reasoning of the most impartial and well-informed class in the country on the constitution now about to be frame every one agree that some radical change in the whole form of government be necessary and that its main improvement should be the strengthening of the executive power that possess by the former stadtholder of holland be often find to be too much for the chief of a republic too little for the head of a monarchy the assembly of the states-general as of old construct be defective in many point in none so glaringly as in that condition which require unanimity in question of peace or war and in the provision from which they have no power to swerve that all the tax should be uniform both these stipulation be of sheer necessity continually disregard so that the government could be carry on at all only by repeat violation of the constitution in order to excuse measure dictate by this necessity each stadtholder be perpetually oblige to form partisan and he thus become the hereditary head of a faction he legitimate power be trifling : but he influence be capable of fearful increase for the principle which allow he to infringe the constitution even on occasion of public good might be easily warped into a pretext for encroachment that have no bound but he own will besides the preponderance of the deputy from the commercial town in the states-general cause the other to become mere cipher in time of peace only capable of clog the march of affair and of be on occasion of civil dissension the mere tool of whatever party possess the greatest tact in turn they to they purpose hence a wide field be open to corruption uncertainty embarrassed every operation of the government the hague become a arena for the conflict intrigue of every court in europe holland be drag into almost every war and thus gradually weaken from its rank among independent nation it at length fall a easy prey to the french invader to prevent the recurrence of such evil as those and to establish a kingdom on the solid basis of a monarchy unequivocal in its essence yet restrain in its prerogative the constitution we be now examine be establish accord to the report of the commissioner who frame it it be found on the manners and habit of the nation on its public economy and its old institution with a disregard for the ephemeral constitution of the age it be not a mere abstraction more or less ingenious but a law adapt to the state of the country in the nineteenth century it do not reconstruct what be wear out by time but it revive all that be worth preserve in such a system of law and institution well adapt to each other the member of the commission belong to the belgian province recognize the basis of they ancient charter and the principle of they former liberty they find no difficulty in adapt this law so as to make it common to the two nation unite by tie which have be break only for they own misfortune and that of europe and which it be once more the interest of europe to render indissoluble the news of the elevation of william i to the throne be receive in the dutch province with great joy in as far as it concern he personally but a joy considerably temper by doubt and jealousy as regard they junction with a country sufficiently large to counterbalance holland oppose interest to interest and people to people national pride and oversanguine expectation prevent a calm judgment on the exist state of europe and on the impossibility of holland in its ancient limit maintain the influence which it be hope it would acquire in belgium the formation of the new monarchy excite the most lively sensation the clergy and the nobility be considerably agitate and not slightly alarm the latter fear the resentment of the king for they avowed predilection in favor of austrium and perceive the destruction of every hope of aristocratical domination the more elevated of the middle clase also see a end to they exclusive occupation of magisterial and municipal employment the manufacturer great and small see the ruin of monopoly stare they in the face the whole people take fright at the weight of the dutch debt which be considerably greater than that of belgium no one seem to look beyond the present moment the advantage of colonial possession seem remote and questionable to those who possess no maritime commerce and the pride of national independence be foreign to the feeling of those who have never yet taste its blessing it be in this state of public feeling that intelligence be receive in march 1815 of the reappearance in france of the emperor napoleon at the head of three hundred man he have take the resolution without parallel even among the grandest of he own powerful conception of invade a country contain thirty million of people gird by the protect army of coalesced europe and imbue beyond all doubt with a almost general objection to the former despot who now put he foot on its shore with imperial pretension only found on the memory of he bygone glory he march to pari be a miracle and the vigor of he subsequent measure redeem the ambitious imbecility with which he have hurry on the catastrophe of he previous fall the flight of loui xviii from pari be the sure signal to the kingdom of the netherland in which he take refuge that it be about to become the scene of another contest for the life or death of despotism have the invasion of belgium which now take place be lead on by one of the bourbon family it be probable that the priesthood the people and even the nobility would have give it not merely a negative support but the name of napoleon be a bugbear for every class and the effort of the king and government which meet with most enthusiastic support in the northern province be second with zeal and courage by the rest of the kingdom the national force be soon in the field under the command of the prince of orange the king 's eldest son and heir-apparent to the throne for which he now prepared to fight he brother prince frederick command a division under he the english army under the duke of wellington occupy brussels and the various cantonment in its neighborhood and the prussian command by prince blucher be in readiness to co-operate with they ally on the first movement of the invader napoleon hurry from pari to strike some rapid and decisive blow pass the sambre on the 15th of June at the head of the french army one hundred and fifty thousand strong drive the prussian before he beyond charlerous and back on the plain of fleurus with some loss on the 16th be fight the bloody battle of ligny in which the prussian sustain a decide defeat but they retreat in good order on the little river ly follow by marshal grouchy with thirty thousand man detach by napoleon in they pursuit on the same day the british advanced position at quatre bras and the _ corps_d'armée _ command by the prince of orange be fiercely attack by marshal ney a battalion of belgian infantry and a brigade of horse artillery have be engage in a skirmish the precede evening at frasne with the french advanced troops the affair of quatre bras be sustain with admirable firmness by the ally english and netherland force against a enemy infinitely superior in number and command by one of the best general in france the prince of orange with only nine thousand man maintain he position till three o'clock in the afternoon despite the continual attack of marshal ney who command the left of the french army consist of forty-three thousand man but the interest of this combat and the detail of the loss in kill and wound be so merge in the succeed battle which take place on the 18th that they form in most mind a combination of exploit which the interval of a day can scarcely be consider to have separate the 17th be occupy by a retrograde movement of the ally army direct by the duke of wellington for the purpose of take its stand on the position he have previously fix on for the pitched battle the decisive nature of which he determine foresight have anticipate several affair between the french and english cavalry take place during this movement and it be pretty well establish that the enemy flush with the victory over blucher of the precede day be deceive by this short retreat of wellington and form a very mistaken notion of its real object or of the desperate reception destine for the morrow 's attack the battle of waterloo have be over and over describe and profoundly feel until its record may be say to exist in the very heart and memory of the nation the fiery valor of the assault and the unshakable firmness of the resistance be perhaps without parallel in the annals of war the immense stake depend on the result the grandeur of napoleon 's isolate effort against the flower of the european force and the awful responsibility rest on the head of they great leader give to this conflict a romantic sublimity unshared by all the manoeuvring of science in a hundred commonplace combat of other war it form a epoch in the history of battle it be to the full as memorable as a individual event as it be for the consequence which follow it it be fight by no rule and gain by no tactic it be a fair stand-up fight on level ground where downright manly courage be alone to decide the issue this derogate in nothing from the splendid talent and deep knowledge of the rival commander they reputation for all the intricate quality of generalship rest on the broad base of previous victory this day be to be win by strength of nerve and steadiness of heart and a moral grandeur be throw over its result by the reflection that human skill have little to do where so much be leave to providence we abstain from enter on detail of the battle it be enough to state that throughout the day the troops of the netherland sustain the character for courage which so many century have establish various opinion have go forth as to the conduct of the belgian troops on this memorable occasion isolate instance be possibly find among a mass of several thousand of that nervous weakness which neither the noblest incitement nor the finest example can conquer old association and feeling not efface might have slacken the effort of a few direct against former comrade or personal friend whom the stern necessity of politics have place in oppose rank raw troops might here and there have shrink from attack the most desperate on record but that the great principle of public duty on grounds purely national pervade the army be to be find in the official report of its loss two thousand and fifty-eight man kill and one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six wound prove indelibly that the troops of the netherland have they full share in the honor of the day the victory be cement by the blood of the prince of orange who stand the brunt of the fight with he gallant soldier he conduct be conformable to the character of he whole race and to he own reputation during a long series of service with the british army in the spanish peninsula he stand bravely at the head of he troops during the murderous conflict or like wellington in whose school he be form and whose example be beside he ride from rank to rank and column to column inspiring he man by the proof of he untiring courage several anecdote be related of the prince 's conduct throughout the day one be remarkable as afford a example of those pithy epigram of the battlefield with which history abound accompany by a act that speak a fine knowledge of the soldier 's heart on occasion of one peculiarly desperate charge the prince hurry on by he ardor be actually in the midst of the french and be in the greatest danger when a belgian battalion rush forward and after a fierce struggle repulse the enemy and disengage the prince in the impulse of he admiration and gratitude he tear from he breast one of those decoration gain by he own conduct on some precede occasion and fling it among the battalion call out take it take it my lad you have all earn it this decoration be immediately grapple for and tie to the regimental standard amid loud shout of long live the prince and vow to defend the trophy in the very utterance of which many a brave fellow receive the stroke of death a short time afterward and just half a hour before that terrible charge of the whole line which decide the victory the prince be strike by a musket-ball in the left shoulder he be carry from the field and convey that evening to brussels in the same cart with one of he wounded aide-de-camp support by another and display throughout as much indifference to pain as he have previously show contempt of danger the battle of waterloo consolidate the kingdom of the netherland the wound of the prince of orange be perhaps one of the most fortunate that be ever receive by a individual or sympathize in by a nation to a warlike people waver in they allegiance this evidence of the prince 's valor act like a talisman against disaffection the organization of the kingdom be immediately proceed on the commission charge with the revision of the fundamental law and the modification require by the increase of territory present its report on the 31st of July the inauguration of the king take place at brussels on the 21st of September in presence of the states-general : and the ceremony receive additional interest from the appearance of the sovereign support by he two son who have so valiantly fight for the rights he now swear to maintain the heir to the crown yet bear he wounded arm in a scarf and show in he countenance the mark of recent suffer the constitution be finally accept by the nation and the principle of the government be stipulate and fix in one grand view -- that of the union and consequently the force of the new state it have be ask by a profound and sagacious inquirer or at least the question be put forth on undoubted authority in he name why do england create for herself a difficulty and what will be by and by a natural enemy in unite holland and belgium in place of manage those two immense resource to she commerce by keep they separate for holland without manufacture be the natural mart for those of england while belgium under a english prince have be the route for constantly inundate france and germany so ask napoleon and england may answer and justify she conduct so impugn on principle consistent with the general wish and the common good of europe the discussion of the question be foreign to we purpose which be to trace the circumstance not to argue on the policy that lead to the formation of the netherland as they now exist but it appear that the different integral part of the nation be amalgamate from deep-formed design for they mutual benefit belgium be not give to holland as the already-cited article of the treaty of pari might at first sight seem to imply nor be holland allot to belgium but they be graft together with all the force of legislative wisdom not that one might be dominant and the other oppressed but that both should bend to form a arch of common strength able to resist the weight of such invasion as have perpetually periled and often crush they separate independence supplementary chapter ad 1815 -- 1899 in the precede chapter we have see the history of holland carry down to the treaty which join together what be now know as the separate country of holland and belgium and it be at this point that the interest of the subject for the historian practically cease the historian differ from the annalist in this -- that he select for treatment those passage in the career of nation which possess a dramatic form and unity and therefore convey lesson for moral guidance or for constitute a basis for reasonable prognostication of the future but there be in the event of the world many tract of country -lrb- as we might term they -rrb- which have no special character or apparent significance and which therefore though they may extend over many year in time be dismiss with bare mention in the page of the historian just as in travel by rail the tourist will keep he face at the window only when the scenery warrant it at other time compose himself to other occupation the scenery of dutch history have episode as stir and instructive as those of any civilized people since history begin but it reach its dramatic and moral apogee when the independence of the unite netherland be acknowledge by spain the netherlands then reach they loftiest pinnacle of power and prosperity they colonial possession be vast and rich they reputation as guardian of liberty and the rights of man be foremost in the world but further than this they could not go and the moment when a people cease to advance may generally be regard as the moment when relatively speak at least it begin to go backward the dutch could in no sense become the master of europe not only be they domain too small but it be geographically at a disadvantage with the powerful and populous nation neighbor it and it be compel ever to fight for its existence against the attack of nature itself the stormy wave of the north sea be ever moan and threaten at the gate and ever and anon a breach would be make and the labor of generation annul holland could never enter upon a career of conquest like france or russium neither could she assume the great part which britain have play for although the character of the dutchman be in many respects as strong and sound as that of the english and in some way its superior yet the dutch have not be dower with a sea-defended isle for they habitation which might enable they to carry out enterprise abroad without the distraction and weakness involve in maintain adequate guard at home they be mighty in self-defence and in resistance against tyranny and they be unsurpassed in those virtue and quality which go to make a nation rich and orderly but aggression could not be for they they take advantage of they season of power to confirm themselves in the ownership of land in the extreme east and in the west which should be a continual source of revenue but they could do no more and they waste not a little treasure and strength in preserve what they have gain or a part of it from the grasp of other but this be the sum of they possibility they could not presume to dictate term to the world and the consequence be that they gradually cease to be a consider factor in the european problem in some respects they territorial insignificance while it prevent they from aggressive action preserve they from aggression they domain be not worth conquer and again its conquest could not be accomplish by any nation without make other uneasy and jealous they become like switzerland and unlike poland and hungary a neutral region which it be for the interest of europe at large to let alone none care to meddle with they and on the other hand they have native virtue and force enough to resist be absorb into other people the character of the dutch be as distinct to-day as ever it have be they language they literature they art and they personal trait be unimpaired they be in they own degree remarkably prosperous and comfortable and they have the good sense to be content with they condition they be liberal and progressive and yet conservative they be even with modern idea as regard education and civilization and yet the tourist within they boundary continually find himself remind of they past the costume and the custom of the mass of the people have undergo singularly little change they mind they own affair and be wisely indifferent to the affair of other both as importer and as exporter they be useful to the world and if the prophecy of those who foretell a general clash of the european power should be fulfil it be likely that the dutch will be onlooker merely or perhaps profit by the misfortune of they neighbor to increase they own well-being as we have see in the foregoing page belgium do not unite with the hollander in they revolt of the sixteenth century but appertain to burgundy and be afterward make a domain of france but after napoleon have be overthrow at waterloo the nation who have be so long harry and terrorize by he be not satisfy with banish the ex-conqueror to he island exile but wish to present any possibility of another napoleon arise to renew the war which have devastate and impoverish they consequently they agree to make a kingdom which might act as a buffer between france and the rest of europe and to this end they decree that belgium and holland should be one but in do this the statesman or politician concern fail to take into account certain factor and fact which must inevitably in the course of time undermine they arrangement nation can not be arbitrarily manufacture to suit the convenience of other there be a chemistry in nationality which have law of its own and will not be ignore between the hollander and the belgian there exist not merely a negative lack of homogeneity but a positive incompatibility the hollander have for generation be fighter and man of enterprise the belgian have be the appanage of more powerful neighbor the hollander be protestant the belgian be adherent of the papacy the former be seafarer the latter farmer the sympathy or affiliation of the dutch be with the english and the german those of the belgian be with the french moreover the dutch be incline to act oppressively toward the belgian and this disposition be make the more irksome by the fact that king william be a dull stupid narrow and very obstinate sovereign who think that to have a request make of he be reason sufficient for resist it but over and above all these cause for disintegration of the new kingdom lay fact of the broadest significance and application the arbiter of 1815 do not sufficiently apprehend the meaning of the french revolution the war of napoleon have make they forget it he power have seem so much more formidable and positive that the deeper force which have bring about the event of the last decade of the eighteenth century be ignore but they still continue profoundly active and be destine ere long to announce themselves anew they be in truth the generative force of the nineteenth century they have not yet spend themselves but as we look back upon the event of the past eighty or ninety year we perceive what vast difference there be between what we be in napoleon 's day and what we be now a long period of intrigue and misrule of war and revolution have be follow by material mental and social change affect every class of the people and especially that class which have hitherto be almost entirely unconsidered the war of this century have be of another character than those of the past they have not involve basic principle of human association but have be the result of attempt to gain comparatively trifling political advantage or else be the almost inevitable consequence of adjustment of national relation several small new kingdom have appear but they presence have not essentially alter the political aspect of europe it be the conquest of mind that have be in this century far more important than the struggle of arm steam as apply to locomotion on sea and land and to manufacture have bring about modification in social and industrial condition that can not be exaggerated steamboat and railroad have not only give a different face to commerce and industry but they have unite the world in bond of mutual knowledge and sympathy which can not fail to profoundly affect the political relation of mankind isolation be ignorance as soon as man begin to discover by actual intercourse the similarity and dissimilarity of they several condition these will begin to show improvement to be assure that people in one part of the world be better off than those in another will tend inevitably to bring about amelioration for the latter the domain of evil will be continually restricted and that of good enlarged in the dissemination of intelligence and the spread of sympathy the telegraph and other application of electricity have enormously aid the work of steam every individual of civilized mankind may now be cognizant at any moment of what be take place at any point of the earth 's surface to which the appliance of civilization have penetrate this unprecedented spread of common acquaintanceship of the world have be supplement by discovery of science in many other direction we know more of the moon to-day than europe do of this planet a few century ago the industrial art be now prosecute by machinery with a productiveness which enable one man to do the work formerly perform by hundred and which more than keep up the supply with the demand conquest of natural force be constantly make and each one of they add to the comfort and enlightenment of man man practically live a dozen life such as those of the past in they single span of seventy year and we be even find means of prolong the scriptural limit of mortal existence physically as well as mentally but be all this due to that great moral and social earthquake to which we give the name of the french revolution yes for that upheaval like the plow of some titanic husbandman bring to the surface element of good and use which have be lie fallow for unnumbered age it bring into view the people as against mere ruler and aristocrat who have hitherto live upon what the people produce without work themselves and without care for anything except to conserve thing as they be human progress will never be advance by oligarchy no matter how gentle and well-disposed we see they result to-day in spain and in turkey which be still mediæval or worse in they condition and method it be the brain of the common people that have work the mighty change they personal interest demand that they go forward and they fresh and unencumbered mind show they the way the great scientist the inventor the philanthropist the reformer be all of the common people the statesman who have really govern the world in this century have spring from the common stock the french revolution destroy the dominance of old idea and with they the form in which they be embody political personal and religious freedom be now matter of course but a hundred year ago they be almost unheard of save in the dream of optimist and fanatic the rights of labor have be vindicate and the right of every human be to the benefit of what he produce have be claim and establish along with this improvement have come of course a train of evil and abuse due to we ignorance of how best to manage and apply we new privilege and advantage but such evil be transient and the condition which create they will suffice ere long to remove they the conflict between labor and capital be not permanent it will yield to better knowledge of the true demand of political economy the indifference or corruption of law maker and dispenser will disappear when man realize that personal selfishness be self-destructive and that only care for the commonweal can bring about prosperity for the individual the democracy be still in its swaddle clothes and its outward aspect be in many way ugly and unwelcome and we sigh for the elegance and composure of old day but these discomfort be a necessary accompaniment of growth and will vanish when the growing pain be past the press be the mirror of the aspiration the virtue and the fault of the new mankind its power be stupendous and constantly increase many be begin to dread it as a possible agent of ill but in truth its real power can only be for good since the mass of mankind however wed to selfishness as individual be unite in desire honesty and good in the general trend of thing and it be to the generality and not to the particular that the press to be successful must appeal it be the great critic and the great recorder and in the face of such criticism and record abuse can not long maintain themselves man will be free first of external tyranny and then of that more subtle but not less dangerous tyranny which they impose upon themselves as might have be expect extremist have arise who seek to find a short road to perfection and they have meet with disappointment the dream of the socialist have not be realize man will not work for one another unless they be at the same time work for themselves the communist and the nihilist be yet further from the true ideal there will always remain in human society certain person who rule and other who obey there must always in all affair be a head to direct as well as hand to execute man be bear unequal in intelligence and ability and it will never be possible to reduce leader to the level of follower the form of society must take its model from the human form in which one part be subordinate to another yet all work together in harmony only time -- and probably no very long time -- be require to bring a recognition of these fact meanwhile the very violence of the revolt against even the suspicion of oppression be but symptom of the vigorous vitality which in former century seem to have no existence at all on the other hand industrial co-operation seem to promise successful development it involve immense economy and consequent profit to producer the middleman have he use and especially be he a convenience but it be easy to pay too dear for convenience and there seem no reason why the producer should not as time go on become constantly better equip for deal direct with the consumer to the manifest advantage of both all these and many other triumph of civilization which we see now in objective form be present in potency at the beginning of this century though as we have say they be not duly take into account by the framer of the agreement which seek to make holland and belgium one flesh have the sun not yet rise upon the human horizon the attempt might have have a quasi success but the light be penetrate the darkened place and man be no longer willing to accept subjection as they inevitable doom it might be conducive to the comfort of the rest of europe that batavian and belgian should dwell together under one political roof but it do not suit the party themselves and therefore they soon begin to make they incompatibility know but nothing be hear beyond the grumbling of half-awakened discontent until in 1830 the new revolution in paris send a sympathetic thrill through all the dissatisfied of europe a generation have now pass since the first great upheaval and man have have time to digest the lesson which it convey and to draw various more or less reasonable inference as to future possibility it have be determine that broadly speak what the people heartily want the people might have and the disturbance in paris indicate that the people be prepare to resent any attempt on the part of they ruler to bring back the old abuse when the pentarchy in 1815 have make its division of the spoil of napoleon the bourbon be reseat on the throne which loui xiv have make famous but loui xviii be but a degenerate representative of the glory that have be he adopt a reactionary policy against the napoleonic -lrb- or imperialist -rrb- the republican and the protestant element in france and outrage and oppression occur as a consequence secret society be form to counteract the ultra-royalist policy when loui die it be hope that he successor charle x might introduce improvement but on the contrary he only make matter worse the consequence be the gradual growth of a liberal party seek a monarchy base on the support of the great middle class of the population in 1827 charle disband the national guard and in the following year the liberal elect a majority in the chamber charle foolishly attempt to meet this step by make the prince de polignac he minister who stand for all that the people have in abhorrence the prince issue ordinance declare the late election illegal narrow down the rights of suffrage to the large landowner and forbid all liberty to the press hereupon the populace of pari erect barricade and take up arm and in the three day from the 27th to the 29th of July 1830 they defeat the force of the king and after capture the hotel de ville and the louvre send he into exile and make the venerable and faithful lafayette commander of the national guard but the revolutionist show forbearance and instead of beheading charle as they might have do they let he go and punish the minister by imprisonment only this put a end to the older line of the bourbon in france and the representative of the younger branch loui philippe -lrb- philippe egalite -rrb- be set on the throne in the hope that he would be willing to carry out the people 's will all this be interesting to the belgian and they profit by the example they regard william as another charle and deem themselves justified in revolt against he rule they declare that they be no longer subject to he control and issue be join on that point but the power be not ready to permit the dissolution of they anxiously construct edifice and they meet together with a view to arrange some secure modus vivendus the issue of they deliberation take the form of propose that the duchy of luxemburg at the southeast corner of belgium should be cede to holland on the north this suggestion be favorably receive by the hollander but be not so agreeable to the belgian and a assembly at brussels devise and adopt a liberal constitution and invite leopold of saxe-coburg to occupy they throne leopold be at this time about forty year of age he be the youngest son of franci duke of saxe-coburg he have marry in 1816 the daughter of george iv of england the princess charlotte and have a few month before the belgian ' proposal be offer and have refuse the crown of greece but the belgian throne be more to he liking and after take measure to sound the power on the subject and to assure himself of they good will he accept the proffer and be crown under the title of leopold i he reign last thirty-four year and be comparatively uneventful and prosperous but the dutch refuse to tolerate this change of sovereignty without a struggle william raise a army and suddenly throw it into belgium and the chanee be that he would have make short work of belgian resistance have the two be permit to fight out they quarrel undisturbed this however could not happen since the independence of belgium have be recognize by england austrium russium and prussium and the triumphal march of the dutch be arrest by a french army which happen to be in the place where they could be most effective in the circumstance the dutch have occupy antwerp a town on the borderland of belgium and holland it have be in the possession of the french in 1794 but have be take from they at the restoration in 1814 the french now lay siege to it be under the command of gérard while the dutch be lead by chassè the citadel be take in 1832 and the resistance of the dutch to the decree of europe be practically at a end though william the obstinate refuse for several year to accept the fact the duchy of luxemburg have side with the belgian all along as might have be anticipate from its position and natural affiliation and though no immediate action be take relative to its ownership till 1839 it remain during the interval in belgian hand matter remain in this ambiguous condition for some time but though the dutch might grumble they could not fight at length the treaty of 1839 be sign in london on the 19th of April accord to the term of which part of the duchy of luxemburg be retain by the belgian and part be rule by the king of holland as grand duke in other respects the status quo ante be preserve and the partition of holland and belgium be confirm as it have ever since remain the history of belgium thenceforward have be almost wholly devoid of incident the little nation may quite too apothegm as apply to themselves short be the annals of a happy people they insignificance and they geographical position secure they against all disturbance they live in they tiny quarter with economy and industry the most densely populous community in europe and one of the most prosperous around they border rise the sullen murmur of threatening army and hostile dynasty but belgium be free from menace and they sunshine of peace be without a cloud it be of course conceivable that in the great struggle which seem impend the belgian nation may suddenly vanish from the map and become but a memory in the mind of a future generation but they end if it come be likely to be in the nature of a euthanasia and so far as they be physically concern they will survive they political annihilation the only ripple which have vary the smooth surface of they career since the treaty have be dispute between the liberal and clerical party on question of education and disturbance and occasional riot instigate by socialist over industrial question leopold die at the age of seventy-six be succeed by he son as leopold ii and he reign continue during the remainder of the century the treaty of 1839 in addition to its provision already mention give limburg on the prussian border to the dutch and open the scheldt under heavy toll in October of the year follow the treaty william i abdicate the throne of holland in favor of he son he have not enjoy he reign and he retire in a ill humor which be not without some excuse he career have be a worthy one he have be a soldier in the field from he twenty-first year till the battle of wagram in 1809 when he be near forty after that he dwell in retirement in berlin until he be call to the throne of the netherland at that time he have exchange he german possession for the grand duchy of luxemburg and be therefore naturally reluctant to be deprive of the latter the old soldier survive he abdication only a few year die in 1843 at berlin william ii be a soldier like he father he have gain distinction under wellington in the spanish campaign and in the struggle against napoleon during the hundred day he command the dutch contingent he marry anne sister of alexander i of russium in 1816 and at the outbreak of the revolution of 1830 he be send to belgium to bring about a arrangement on the 16th of October of that year he take the step which be repudiate by he rigid old father of acknowledge belgian independence but he subsequently command the dutch army against the belgian and be force to yield to the french in August 1832 after he accession he behave with firmness and liberality and die in 1849 leave a good reputation behind he meanwhile the new revolution of 1848 be approach insensibly the state of europe have range themselves under two principle there be on one side the state govern by constitution include great britain france holland belgium switzerland sweden and norway denmark and for the time be spain and portugal on the other side be russium prussium austria the italian state and some of those of germany who hold that the right of rule and the making of law belong absolutely to certain dynasty which be indeed morally bind to consult the interest of they population yet be not responsible to they subject for the manner in which they might choose to do it in the last mention state there exist a chronic strife between the people and they ruler it be a irrepressible conflict and its crisis be reach in 1848 it be in france that thing first come to a head loui philippe and he minister guizot try to render the government gradually independent of the nation in imitation of the absolutist empire and the uneasiness cause by this policy be emphasize by the scarcity that prevail during the year 1846 and 1847 the liberal begin to demand electoral reform but the king on open the chamber intimate that he be convince that no reform be need angry debate ensue and finally the opposition arrange for a great banquet in the champ elysee on February 22 1848 in support of the reform movement this gathering however be forbid by guizot the order be regard as arbitrary and the republican seize the opportunity barricade appear in paris the king be force to abdicate and take refuge with he family in england france be thereupon declare to be a republic and the government be intrust to lamartine and other there be now great danger of excess similar to those of the first great revolution but the element of violence be keep under by the opposition of the middle and higher class the communistic club be overawe by the national guard and on April 16th the communistic party be defeat general cavaignac who have be make dictator during the struggle lay down he office after the battle which begin on the 23d of June between the rabble of idle mechanic eighty thousand in number and the national force have be decide in favor of the latter who slew no less than sixteen thousand of the enemy cavaignac be now appoint chief of the executive commission with the title of president of the council a reaction favor a monarchy be indicate but meanwhile a new constitution provide for a quadriennial presidency with a single legislature of seven hundred and fifty member loui napoleon the nephew of the great emperor be choose by a majority vote for the office in December of 1848 four year later he be declare emperor under the title of napoleon iii the revolutionary movement spread to other country of europe with vary result in hungary kossuth in the diet demand of the emperor-king a national government prince metternich prime minister attempt to resist the demand with military force but a insurrection in vienna drive he into exile and the hungarian gain a temporary advantage and be grant a constitution the slav meet at prague at the instigation of polocky and hold a congress but it be break up by the impatience of the inhabitant and a success of the imperialist be follow by the rising of the southern slav in favor of the emperor a battle take place in hungary on September 11 1848 but the imperialist under jellachich be route and drive toward the austrian frontier the war become wider in its scope the insurrectionist at first meet with success but in spite of they desperate valor the hungarian force be finally overthrow by the aid of a russian army and they leader goergy be compel to surrender to the russian on August 13 1849 it be think that the czar might annex hungary but he hand it back to franci joseph who by way of vengeance permit the most hideous cruelty in germany the issue have no definite feature the people demand freedom of the press and a german parliament and the various prince seem acquiescent but when it be propose that prussium should become germany there be opposition on all side a diet of the confederation be hold but frederick william iv king of prussium refuse to accept the title of hereditary emperor which be offer he austria and prussium come into opposition two rival congress be sit at the same time in 1850 and war between the two state be only avert by the interference of russium czar nichola then virtually dictator of europe order prussium 's troops back and the convention of olmutz in November seem to put a final end to prussium 's hope of german hegemony all the local despotism of italy collapse before the breath of revolution but the country then find itself face to face with austrium charle albert of sardinium have the courage to head the revolt but be defeat and abdicate in favor of he son victor emmanuel venice be take after a severe siege by the austrian and king bomba manage to repossess himself of naple after a terrible massacre sicily be subdue in the papal state pio nono be depose but after a time a reaction set in the provisional government under mazzinus be overthrow and the french occupied rome and recall the pope the question as to the danish or german ownership of the duchy of schleswig-holstein have already be agitate and they become acute at this time but the spirit of the new revolution have no direct bearing upon the matter by the end of the first half of the nineteenth century europe be outwardly quiet once more and what part have holland take in these proceedings a very small one the phlegmatic dutchman find themselves fairly well off and be nowise tempt to embark in trouble for sentiment 's sake the constitution give they in 1814 be revise with the consent of the king and the change which involve various political reform go into effect on April 17 1848 william ii die just eleven month afterward and be succeed by he son william iii at that time a man of two-and-thirty he favor the reform grant by he father and show himself to be in harmony with such sober idea of progress as belong to the nation over which he rule he aim in all thing be peace and the development of the resource of the country he understand he people and they place confidence in he and holland steadily grow in wealth and comfort in 1853 after the establishment by the papacy of catholic bishopric have be allow there be a period of some excitement for roman catholicism have find a stern and unconquerable foe in the dutch when it have come with the bloody tyranny of spain but those evil day be past and the dutch who have pledge themselves to welcome religious freedom in they dominion be dispose to let bygones be bygones and to permit such of they countryman as prefer the catholic ceremonial to have they way it be evident that no danger exist of holland 's become subject to the papacy and indeed the immediate political sequel of the establishment of the bishopric be the election of a moderate liberal protestant cabinet which thoroughly represent the country and which represent its tone thereafter with such modification as new circumstance might suggest the dutch be philosophic and be victim to no vague and costly ambition they feel that they have give sufficient proof of they quality in the past the glory which they have win as champion of liberty could never fade and now they merit the repose which we have learn to associate with we conception of the dutch character they nature seem to partake of the scenic trait of they country its picturesque solid serenity its unemotional level its flavor of the antique : and yet beneath that composure we feel the strength and steadfastness which can say to the ocean thus far and no further and can build they immaculate town and erect they peaceful windmill and navigate they placid canal and smoke they fragrant pipe on land which by natural right should be the bottom of the sea holland be a perennial type of human courage and industry common sense and moderation as we contemplate they to-day it require a effort of the imagination to picture they as the descendant of a race of hero who defy and overcome the strongest and most cruel power on earth in they day and then teach the rest of europe how to unite success in commerce with justice and honor but the heroism be still there and should need arise we need not doubt that it would once more be manifest because holland be so quiet some rash critic fancy that she may be term effete but this be far from the truth the absence of military burden render needless by the intelligent selfishness if not the conscience of the rest of europe imply no decadence of masculine spirit in the dutch in no department of enterprise commercial ability or intellectual energy be they inferior to any of they contemporary or to they own great progenitor holland say professor thorold roger be the origin of scientific medicine and rational therapeutics from holland come the first optical instrument the best mathematician the most intelligent philosopher as well as the boldest and most original thinker amsterdam and rotterdam hold the printing press of europe in the early day of the republic the elzevir be the first publisher of cheap edition and thereby aid in disseminate the new learning from holland come the new agriculture which have do so much for social life horticulture and floriculture the dutch teach modern europe navigation they be the first to explore the unknown sea and many a island and cape which they captain discover have be rename after some one who get he knowledge by they research and appropriate the fruit of he predecessor 's labor they have be as much plunder in the world of letter as they have be in commerce and politics holland teach the western nation finance -- perhaps no great boon but they also teach commercial honor the last and hardest lesson which nation learn they inculcate free trade a lesson nearly as hard to learn if not harder since the conspiracy against private right be watchful incessant and as some would make we believe respectable they raise a constant and for a long time ineffectual protest against the barbarous custom of privateering and the dangerous doctrine of contraband of war a doctrine which if carry out logically would allow belligerent to interdict the trade of the world the dutch be the real founder of what people call international law or the rights of nation they make mistake but they make fewer than they neighbor make the benefit which they confer be incomparably greater than the error they commit there be nothing more striking than the fact that after a brief and discreditable episode the state be a asylum for the persecute the jew who be condemn because they be thrifty plunder because they be rich and harass because they cling tenaciously to they ancient faith and custom find a asylum in holland and some of they perhaps after they originate and adopt with the pliability of they race a teutonic alias have not be sufficiently grateful to the country which sheltered they the jansenist expel from france find a refuge in utrecht and more than a refuge a recognition when recognition be a dangerous offence there be no nation in europe continue the professor which owe more to holland than great britain do the english be for a long time in the industrial history of modern civilization the stupidest and most backward nation in europe there be to be sure a great age in england during the reign of elizabeth and that of the first stuart king but it be brief indeed in every other department of art of agriculture of trade we learn we lesson from the hollander i doubt whether any other small european race after pass through the trial which it endure after the peace of aix-la-chapelle to the conclusion of the continental war ever have so entire a recovery the chain of its history to be sure be break and can never in the nature of thing be weld together but there be still leave to holland the boast and the reality of she motto ` luctor et emergo ' the event of holland 's history since the catholic concession can be briefly tell in 1863 slavery be abolish in the dutch west indy the owner be compensate and forty-two thousand slave be set free chiefly in dutch guiana in the same year the navigation of the scheldt be free by purchase from holland by the european power of the right to levy toll in 1867 loui napoleon raise the question of luxemburg by negotiate to buy the grand duchy from holland but prussium object to the scheme and the matter be finally settle by a conference in london the prussian garrison evacuate the fortification which be then dismantle and luxemburg be declare neutral territory capital punishment be abolish in 1869 and on the 15th of July of the same year the amsterdam national exposition be open by prince henry in 1870 at the outbreak of war between germany and france the neutrality of holland as to both belligerent be secure by the other power in 1871 the hollander cede dutch guinea to england and in 1876 the canal between amsterdam and the north sea which have be begin in 1865 be complete and the passage through it be accomplish by a monitor another exposition be open in 1883 and in the same year the constitution undergo a further revision on the 24th of June 1884 the prince of orange heir-apparent to the throne die and the succession thus devolve upon the princess wilhelmina then a child of four year william iii himself die in 1890 and queen emma thereupon assume the regency which she be to hold until wilhelmina come of age in 1898 a agreeable consummation which we have just witness a word may here be say concern the physical and political constitution of the present kingdom of holland the country be divide into eleven province -- north and south holland zealand north brabant utrecht limburg gelderland overyssel drenthe groningen and friesland there be three large river -- the rhine the meuse and the scheldt the inhabitant be low german -lrb- dutch -rrb- frankish saxon frisian and jew the latter numbering some sixty thousand though they influence be owe to they wealth and activity larger than these figure would normally represent the lead religion of the country be lutheran but there be also many catholic and person of other faith all of whom be permit the enjoyment of they creed holland be at one time second to no country in the extent of its colony and it still own java the moluccas part of borneo new guinea sumatra and celebe in the east and in the west dutch guiana and curacoa in roman time the low country be inhabit by various people chiefly of germanic origin and in the middle age be divide into several duchy and county -- such as brabant flander gelderland holland zealand etc the present government be a hereditary monarchy consist of a king or queen and states-general the upper chamber of fifty member the lower of one hundred it be essentially a country of large town of five thousand inhabitant and upward the frisian be in north holland separate by the river meuse from the frank the saxon extend to the utrecht veldt the semitic race be represent by the portuguese jew and there be a admixture of other nationality in no part of the country do the dutch present a marked physical type but on the other hand they be sharply difference in various locality by they law they custom and particularly by they dialect indeed the frisian have a distinct language of they own the constitution of 1815 though more than once revise remain practically much the same as at first the son of the monarch the heir-apparent be call the prince of orange the administration of the province be in the hand of the provincial state these meet but a few time in the year the commune have they communal council under the control of the burgomaster there be a high court of justice and numerous minor court the population be divide between about two million two hundred thousand protestant and half as many roman catholic together with other there be four thousand school with six hundred thousand pupil and about fourteen thousand teacher not more than ten per cent of the people be illiterate and the woman be as carefully educate the man there be four great university : leyden found in 1575 utrecht found in 1636 groningen in 1614 and amsterdam which have exist since 1877 these seat of learn give instruction to from three hundred to seven hundred student each the total expense of the university average about six hundred thousand dollar there be also in holland excellent institution of art science and industry agriculture be generally pursue but without the extreme science and economy show in belgium the cultivation and produce vary in part accord as the soil be sand or clay but the same kind of soil in different part of the country produce different result cattle be largely raise and be of first-rate quality friesland produce the best but there be also excellent stock in north holland and south holland in drenthe owing to the extensive pasturage great number of sheep be raise but perhaps the most important industry of holland be the fishery both those of the deep sea and those carry on in the great zuyder zee which occupy a vast area within the boundary of the country these fishery however be not in all year successful owe to the ungovernable vagary of ocean current and other cause holland have take a prominent part in european thought since about 1820 the dutch language instead of yield to the domination of the german have be cultivate and enrich the writer who have achieve distinction could hardly even be name in space here available and any approach to a critical estimate of they would require volume one of the earlier but best-known name be that of jacobus van lennep who be regard as the leader of the dutch romantic school he be bear in amsterdam on the 24th of march 1802 and die at oosterbeek near arnheim August 25 1868 he father david be a professor and a poet jacobus study jurisprudence at leyden and afterward practice law at amsterdam for a while he take some part in politics as a member of the second chamber but he heart be bent on the pursuit of literature and he gradually abandon all else for that he first volume of poem be publish when he be but four-and-twenty and he be the author of several drama but he strongest predilection be for romantic novel-writing and he work in this direction show sign of the influence of walter scott who dominate the romantic field in the first half of this century and be know in holland as well as throughout the rest of europe the foster son be publish in 1829 the rose of dekama in 1836 the adventure of claus sevenstar in 1865 he complete work in prose and poetry fill six-and-thirty volume a younger contemporary of van lennep be nikolas beet bear at haarlem in 1814 he also be both poet and prose writer and he camara obscura publish in 1839 be account a masterpiece of character and humor though it be compose when the author be barely twenty-four year of age van den brink be a lead critic of the romanticist hasebrock author of a volume of essay call truth and dream have be liken to the english charle lamb vosmaer be another eminent figure in dutch literature he write a life of rembrandt which be a masterpiece of biography kuenen who die but ten year ago be a biblical critic of european celebrity but the list of contemporary dutch writer be long and brilliant and the time to speak critically of they must be postpone nothing impress the visitor to holland more than the vast dike or dam which restrain the sea from overwhelming the country they have to be constantly watch and renew and to those unused to the idea of dwelling in the presence of such constant peril the phlegm of the hollander be remarkable m havard who have make a careful study of the country and its people and who write of they in a lively style have leave excellent description of these unique work we know he say what the zealand soil be -- how uncertain change and mutable nevertheless a construction be place upon it one hundred and twenty yard long sixteen yard wide at the entrance and more than seven and a half yard deep below high water add to this that the enormous basin -lrb- one thousand nine hundred square yard -rrb- be enclose within granite wall of extraordinary thickness form of solid block of stone of tremendous weight to what depth must the daring workman who undertake the cyclopean task have go in search of a stable standpoint on which to lay the foundation of such a mass in what subterranean layer could they have have such confidence in this country where the earth sink in all of a sudden where island disappear without leave a trace -- that they venture to build upon it so mighty a edifice and observe that not only one dam be thus build in the two island of zuid beveland and walcheren a dozen have be construct there be two at wormeldingen in the presence of these achievement of problem face with such courage and solve with such success one be almost bewildered elsewhere in speaking of kampveer one of the town which suffer a inundation he say poor little port once so famous lively populous and noisy and now so solitary and still trace of its former military and mercantile character be yet to be see on the left stand a majestic building with thick wall and few aperture terminate on the sea in a crenelated round tower and these elegant house with they arched and trefoiled window and they decorate gable on the right once form the ancient scotschhui every detail of the building recall the great trade in wool do by the city at that period far off at the entrance of the port stand a tower the last remnant of the rampart formerly a fortification it be now a tavern in vain do we look for the companion tower it have disappear with the earth on which its foundation stand deep and strong for age if from the summit of the survive tower you search for that mysterious town upon the opposite bank you will look for it in vain where it formerly stand and mirror its house and steeple in the limpid water kampen also have be swallow up forever leave no trace that it ever exist in this world the land that stretch out before we be all affect by that subtle cancerous disease the _ val _ whose ravages be so terrible two century ago this great bay be so fill up with sand that it be expect the two island would in a short time be reunite and thenceforth form but one then on a sudden the gulf yawn anew that huge rent the veer gat open once again more deeply than before whole town be bury and they inhabitant drown then the water retire the earth rise shake off its humid wind sheet and the old task be resume man begin once more to dispute the soil with the invade wave a portion of the land which seem to have be forever lose be regain but at the cost of what determine strife after how many battle with what dire alternation within a century three entire polder on the north coast of noordbeveland have again vanish and in the place where they be there flow a stream forty yard deep in 1873 the polder of borselen thirty-one acre in extent sink into the water each year the terrible _ val _ devour some space or other carry away the land in strip the sophium polder be now attack by the _ val _ every possible means be be employ for its defense no sacrifice be spare the game be almost up already one dike have be swallow and a portion of the conquer ground have have to be abandon the dam be be strengthen in the rear while every effort be be make to fix the soil so as to prevent the slip away of the reclaim land to effect this not only be the dam reinforce and complicate by a inextricable network of stone and interlaced tree-branch but _ zinkstukken _ be sink far off in the sea which by squeeze down the shift bottom avert those sudden displacement which bring about such disaster the zinkstukken -- enormous construction in wicker work -- be square raft make of reed and bough twist together sometimes two or three hundred foot long on a side they be make on the edge of the coast and push into the sea and no sooner be one afloat than it be surround by a crowd of barge and boat big and little laden with stone and clod of earth the boat be then attach to the zinkstuk and this combined flotilla be so disposed along shore that the current carry it to the place where the zinkstuk be to be sink when the current begin to make itself feel the raft be load by the simple process of heap the contents of the barge upon the middle of it the man form in line from the four corner to the center and the load of stone and earth be pass on to the center of the raft on which they be fling then the middle of the zinkstuk begin to sink gently and to disappear under the water as it go down the operator withdraw the stone and clod be then fling upon it from boat at this stage of the proceedings the zinkstuk be so heavy that all the vessel drag by its weight lean over and they mast bend above it but now the decisive moment approach and the foreman standing on the poop of the largest boat in the middle of the flotilla on the side furthest from the shore await the instant when the zinkstuk shall come into precisely the foreordained position at that instant he utter a shout and make a signal the rope be cut the raft plunge downward and disappear forever while the boat recover they proper position m havard merit the space we have give he for he describe a work the like of which have never be see elsewhere in the world any more than have the condition which necessitate it but the picturesqueness of the actual scene can hardly be convey in word under a azure sky we behold outstretch a sparkling sea its water shade from green to blue and from yellow to violet harmoniously blend in the distance as though mark the horizon stretch a long green strip of land with the spire of the church stand out in strong relief against the sky at we foot be the zinkstuk surround by its flotilla the great red sail furl upon the mast the green poop the rudder sheathe with burnish copper the red streak along the side of the boat the color shirt brown vest and blue girdle of the man touch by the warm ray of the sun compose a striking picture on all side the man be in motion and five hundred brawny arm be fling the contents of the boat upon the great raft a truly titanic stone projectile rain from all side without pause until the moment come when the decisive command be to be give then silence absolute and impressive fall upon the multitude suddenly the signal be give a creaking noise be hear the fifty boat right themselves at the same instant and turn toward the point where the great raft which have separate they have just disappear they bump against one another they get entangled they group themselves in numberless different way the swarm man stoop and raise up the uplift arm the fly stone the spurting water cover the boat with foam and in the midst of the confusion the polder-jungen fling the clod of earth with giant strength and swiftness upon the raft at certain point the tumult decline flag be hoist from the top of mast the large sail be shake out and aid by the breeze some vessel get loose sail out and desert the field of battle these be they whose task be do and which be empty they retire one by one upon the great expanse of water which save in one spot be a little while ago desert and be now overspread with the vessel make they various way toward that green line on the horizon this be a conflict not of day nor of year nor of generation but of all time and what the end will be none can foretell it be the concrete symbol of the everlasting fight of man with nature which mean civilization the day may come when where once holland be will be outspread the serene water of the sea hide beneath they the record of the stupendous struggle of so many century or perhaps some mysterious shift of the ocean bottom may not only lift holland out of peril but uncover mighty tract of land which in the prehistoric past belong to europe meanwhile it be easy to understand that the people who can wage this ceaseless war for they home and life be the son of those hero who curb the might of spain and teach the world the lesson of freedom and independence the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of holland by thoma colley grattan
