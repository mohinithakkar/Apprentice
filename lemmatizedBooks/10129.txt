for a cough which have attack she some time before end in consumption she display during she illness much penitence and true faith and she die with a good hope of pardon through she savior it be in the visit to the school where some lady attend every day that the dreadful misconduct of most of the woman in the female side of the prison be witness swearing gaming fight singing dancing scene so bad that it be think right never to admit young person with they in go to the school but the way in which mr fry have be receive when she go there among they alone make she sure that much could be do by love and kindness in dependence on divine help and with the power of the word of god apply by the holy spirit eleven member of the society of friend with one other lady the wife of a clergyman form themselves into a association for the improvement of the female prisoner in newgate the object be state to be to provide for the clothing instruction and employment of the woman to introduce they to a knowledge of the holy scripture and to form in they as much as possible those habit of order sobriety and industry which may render they docile and peaceable while in prison and respectable when they leave it the concurrence of the sheriff of the city magistrate and the official of the prison must be obtain and they be too glad to grant full permission to the visitor all of they at the same time express doubt as to the success of the undertaking on account of the woman not submit to the restraint it would be necessary to impose mr fry have foresee this and have draw up rule to be observe on a fixed date the sheriff meet some of the lady ' association at the prison the woman be assemble and ask by mr fry if they be willing to abide by the rule with a unanimous shout they assure she of they resolution to obey they strictly after the adoption of the rule a visitor to the prison would scarcely have recognize the place or the people a matron partly pay by the corporation and partly by the associate lady have the woman now first divide into class under she superintendence a yards-woman act as porter the prisoner who formerly spend they time wholly in idleness or in card-playing be now busily at work a visitor who go to see the change of which he have hear describe he be usher to the door of a ward where at the head of a long table sit a lady belong to the society of friend she be read aloud to about sixteen woman prisoner who be engage in needle-work they all rise on my entrance curtsy respectfully and then resume they seat and employment instead of a scowl leer or ill-suppressed laugh i observe upon they countenance a air of self-respect and gravity a sort of consciousness of they improve character and the altered position in which they be place i afterwards visit the other ward which be the counterpart of the first in 1818 there be a house of common committee before which mr fry give evidence she statement be so remarkable as to be worth recover out of a long-forgotten blue book in answer to question she tell the committee that there be rule which occasionally but very seldom be broken order have be very generally observe i think i may say we have full power amongst they for one of they say it be more terrible to be bring up before I than before the judge though i use nothing but kindness i have never punish a woman during the whole time or even propose a punishment to they with regard to we work they have make nearly twenty thousand article of wear apparel the generality of which be supply by the shop pay very little except three out of this number of article that be miss -lrb- which we really do not think owe to the woman -rrb- we never lose a single thing they knit from about 60 to 100 pair of stocking and sock every month and they spin a little the earnings of they work we think average about eighteen-penny per week for each person this be usually spend in assist they to live and help to clothe they another very important point be the excellent effect we have find to result from religious education we constantly read the scripture to they twice a day many of they be teach and some of they have be enable to read a little themselves it have have a astonishing effect i never see the scripture receive in the same way and to many of they they have be entirely new both the great system of religion and of morality contain in they xi other beneficent work the work so successfully accomplish in newgate be the precursor of similar work undertake in other prison not in london only but all over the country with prison now so much better manage and with multitude of worker single or associated strive for the welfare of prisoner the record of mr fry 's early labor may have lose much of its interest but it be well to state clearly the nature of she work and the spirit in which it be undertake nor be it only in the interior of the prison that she labor be carry on at that time the transportation of criminal to penal settlement be very largely resort to and the state of convict ship be as bad as that of the worst prison in england mr fry make arrangement for the classifying of female prisoner for obtain superintendent and matron for provide school and work on board ship and in many way attend to the welfare of the poor convict she use to go down to almost every ship that leave the thame and see everything do that be possible for they comfort in one case that of the _ wellington _ convict ship hearing that patchwork be a easy and profitable work she send quickly to different manchester house in london and get a abundance of color cotton piece when the ship touch at rio janeiro the quilt make by the woman be sell for a guinea each which give they money to obtain shelter on landing till they could get into service or find respectable means of subsistence the child be teach to knit and sew and read the schoolmistress and monitor be themselves choose from the convict with guarantee of

earl of lansdowne mr wilberforce all acknowledge the help obtain in they parliamentary effort to amend the administration of the criminal law in the fact and the experience supply by she from she long and successful effort in prison work the popularity acquire by she bring all manner of person the very highest in church and in state to seek to know she and to do she honor even the aged queen

organised methodism in london be the foundry in moorfield lady huntingdon have identify herself with the methodist and thus be enable to exert great influence upon a movement small at first but soon fraught with most potent consequence the employment by wesley of lay evangelistic agency wesley have already allow some of he lay helper to expound but not to preach yet here as in he strong desire to keep the methodist movement within the border of the established church he be to find that he personal view if enforce would hinder the work which be so manifestly of god and with he clear common sense he at once give way during 1739 lady huntingdon have frequently hear thoma maxfield pray and accord to she biographer it be at she suggestion that he begin to expound the scripture wesley have be summon from london and no clergyman be available at that moment he leave maxfield in charge to pray with the member of the society and to give they such helpful advice as he could in a letter to wesley write either at the close of 1739 or the beginning of 1740 lady huntingdon write of maxfield : he be one of the greatest instance of god 's peculiar favor that i know : he be raise from the stone to sit amongst the prince of he people the first time i make he expound expect little from he i sit over against he and think what a power of god must be with he to make _ I _ give any attention to he but before he have go over one-fifth part any one that have see I would have think i have be make of wood or stone so quite immovable i both feel and look he power in prayer be quite extraordinary the border line between such expound and preach be very narrow and it be hardly to be wonder at that maxfield soon find that he be not only preach but do so with the most true and certain warrant of fitness for the office -- soul be be bear again under he ministration on hear such unexpected tiding wesley hurry back to london and enter he house next door to the foundry with clouded face reply to he mother 's question as to the cause thoma maxfield have turn preacher i find great be he surprise to receive the rejoinder take care what you do with respect to that young man for he be as surely call of god to preach as you be such testimony from such a source could not fail to move john wesley he wisely hear for himself and express he judgment in the word of scripture -- it be the lord : let he do what seemeth he good thus methodism pass through what might have be its first great crisis thus it equip itself to keep pace with the ever-increasing claim of its work the quick spiritual insight of lady huntingdon recognize both the need and the fitness of the hitherto unrecognised worker one of the first member of the noble band of itinerate preacher thus call into the active exercise of they spiritual gift be david taylor a servant in lord huntingdon 's household who do much fruitful evangelistic work in the village surround donnington park it be this man who stand by john wesley 's side when the drunken curate of epworth refuse he admission to what have be he father 's pulpit and who announce to the congregation as they leave the church that in the afternoon wesley would preach in the graveyard and there that same afternoon wesley standing upon he father 's tombstone preach to a congregation the like of which epworth have never see before the

have nothing to do with ordinance -- be not subject to they -- and ought to be _ still _ that they ought to leave off the means of grace and not go to church not to communicate not to search the scripture not to use private prayer till they have live faith and to be _ still _ till they have it -lrb- 1 -rrb- wesley use all he influence and all he persuasive power to counteract these opinion but without avail at length he decide to sever all connection with those who insist upon act in accordance with they and remove methodism to the foundry charle wesley at first go cordially with he brother but at a later date he cease attend the foundry and manifest sign of a desire to return to fetter lane lady huntingdon for whose view he entertain feeling of the deepest respect remonstrate with he and in conjunction with john wesley 's effort keep he from a step that might have prove fatal to he further usefulness in a letter write to john wesley in October 1741 lady huntingdon write : since you leave we the _ still one _ be not without they attack i fear much more for you brother than for myself as the conquest of the one would be nothing to the other i comfort myself very much that you will approve a step with respect to they you brother and i have take no less than he declare open war with they you brother be also to give he reason for quite separate i have great faith god

rejoice that there be no wisdom for he people but that from above but reject every pretension to any but what come from himself i want no holiness he do not give I and i could not accept a heaven he do not prepare I for i can wish for no liberty but what he like for I and i be satisfy with every misery he do not redeem I from that in all thing i may feel that without he i can do nothing to preach

mother who write after she death call she the desire of my eye and the continual pleasure of my heart many be the letter of sympathy she receive from venn berridge romaine fletcher and other but it be a loss that could not be replace but it could and it do help to purify still more the loving and trusting heart which could see even as fletcher urge in so sore a trial mercy rejoice over judgment one of the saying of she daughter on that death-bed must often have come to the mother 's mind in later day i be as happy as my heart can desire to be v whitefield as lady huntingdon 's chaplain prior to 1744 the date of whitefield 's first voyage to the american colony the countess have make he acquaintance and have often hear he preach she in common with multitude of she contemporary have come under

fletcher do not reside at trevecca he frequently visit it during the first three year of its history be convince that to be fill with the holy ghost be a better qualification for the ministry of the gospel than any classical learning -lrb- although that too be useful in its place -rrb- after speak awhile in the schoolroom he use frequently to say ` as many of you as be athirst for this fulness of the spirit follow I into my room ' on this many of they have instantly follow he and there continue for two or three hour wrestle like jacob for the blessing lady huntingdon spend much of she time at trevecca and for some year bear the entire cost of the college expend upon it from # 500 to # 600 a year the lease of the property at trevecca expire within a few month of the countess 's death in 1791 and it have become imperative to find a new location the college be in 1792 remove to cheshunt in hertfordshire about twelve mile from london where it have ever since continue to flourish during the century and a quarter of its existence cheshunt college have render good service to the church of christ among the student educate at trevecca be such man as john clayton of the weigh house chapel roby of manchester and matthew wilk of the tabernacle the longer roll of those who enter after 1792 contain such name as joseph sortain of brighton and jame sherman of surrey chapel in the ministry of the home church and be peculiarly rich in man who have do and be still do noble service in the great mission field of the world the flame of missionary enthusiasm have ever burnt brightly at cheshunt among the many who have go to they well-earned rest be man like dr turner of samoa and jame gilmor of mongolium in the succession of able and devoted worker for the church at home and for the heathen abroad send forth year by year the good work begin at trevecca be still live and grow viii the calvinistic controversy the leader of the great revival of the eighteenth century be divide into two great group the one head by john wesley the other by george whitefield the calvinism of the latter at time seem dangerously rigid to the former while whitefield sometimes speak and act as though he fear that in preach free grace wesley lose sight altogether of the divine sovereignty so sharply marked be the divergence of view that for a time it interfere with they co-operation mainly by lady huntingdon 's influence as we have see in 1750 unity be restore for twenty year the two wing of the evangelical army labor harmoniously but in 1770 the doctrinal strife be renew in a way and with a vehemence that separate the two section although in most case it do not affect the mutual love and personal esteem in which the contend party hold each other at the annual conference of he minister hold in August 1770 -lrb- the year of whitefield 's death -rrb- john wesley draw up he fateful minute on calvinism intend solely for the guidance of he own preacher wesley apparently have not contemplate the use to which these statement might be put in controversy if so they would in all probability have be more carefully guard he also expect they to be consider _ as a whole _ and could hardly have foresee the use soon to be make of fragment tear from they context however this may be soon after they publication the sky be overcast and wesley find himself in the center of a embittered theological controversy in which after he have in vain strive to maintain peace by explanation and concession he vigorously maintain what he hold to be the truth he do this the more because the calvinism of the eighteenth century find itself face to face with a dangerous antinomianism this be rife among the moravian some of wesley 's own preacher adopt it john nelson fight it to the death in yorkshire and it be in the face of this state of affair that the minute be pen lady huntingdon from the first take great umbrage at the teaching of the minute she apprehend that the fundamental truth of the gospel be strike at and consider mr wesley 's consequence in the religious world as standing at the head of such numerous society think it incumbent on they to show they abhorrence of such doctrine she further declare that whoever do not wholly disavow they should quit she college wesley on the other hand think the time have come when it be he duty to act the part of a faithful pastor towards the good countess for several year i have be deeply convinced that i have not do my duty with regard to that valuable woman that i have not tell she what i be convince no one else would dare to do and what i know she would hear from no other person but _ possibly _ might hear from _ I _ but be unwilling to give she pain i put it off from time to time at length i dare not delay any longer lest death should call one of we hence so i at once deliver my own soul by tell she all that be in my heart lady huntingdon on she part act promptly and vigorously mr benson have defend the minute be dismiss from trevecca fletcher by whom benson 's appointment have be arrange visit the college in march 1771 preach under great difficulty and proffer he resignation which lady huntingdon accept at once all hope of a peaceful settlement be now at a end lady huntingdon draw up a circular invite the clergy of all denomination to assemble at the wesleyan conference at bristol in August 1771 and protest against the obnoxious minute it be needful to quote some extract from this circular in order that the position of the countess may be fully perceive the minute give by john wesley we think ourselves oblige to disavow believe such principle repugnant to scripture and the whole plan of salvation under the new covenant in union with all protestant and reform church we hold _ faith _ alone in the lord jesus christ for the sinner 's justification sanctification righteousness and complete redemption and that he the only wise god we savior be the first and last the author and finisher the beginning and the end of man 's salvation : wholly by the sacrifice of himself to complete and perfect all those who believe and that under this covenant of free grace for man he do grant repentance remission of sin and meetness for glory for the full and true salvation to eternal life and that all call good work be alike the act of he free grace we mean to enter into no controversy on the subject but separate from all party bigotry and all personal prejudice to mr wesley the conference or he friend do hereby most solemnly protest against the doctrine contain in these minute the leader and champion on the part of lady huntingdon be the honorable and rev walter shirley grandson of the first earl ferrar and she own first cousin he be a able fervent eloquent man who both in ireland and england have give full proof of he ministry and at first be leave almost alone in the conflict wesley write to lady huntingdon on June 19 1771 end with these word you have one of the first place in my esteem and affection and you once have some regard for I but it can not continue if it depend on my see with you eye or my be in no mistake what if i be in as many error as mr law himself if you be i should love you still provide you heart be still right with god my dear friend you seem not well yet to have learn the meaning of these word which i desire to have ever write upon my heart ` whoever doeth the will of my father which be in heaven the same be my brother and sister and mother ' as the time for the conference draw on it become apparent that the protestor have no standing place there only those who be actual member of the conference could attend hence instead of the large number look for shirley and seven other only appear the circular which perhaps be needlessly strong in its statement have be withdraw the day before the conference meet wesley allow shirley to appear at the third session of the conference and after careful consideration a declaration be draw up state that as the minute of 1770 have be understand to favor justification by work we abhor the doctrine of justification by work that we have no trust or confidence but in the alone merit of we lord and savior jesus christ for justification or salvation either in life death or the day of judgment and though no one be a real christian believer -lrb- and consequently can not be save -rrb- who doth not good work when there be time and opportunity yet we work have no part in merit or purchase we justification from first to last either in whole or part wesley and fifty-three of he minister sign this john nelson and thoma oliver alone refuse shirley on the other hand be constrain to sign a public avowal that he be convince that he have mistake the meaning of the doctrinal point of the minute fletcher meanwhile have write he five letter to shirley and the m be in wesley 's hand during the conference unfortunately he order it to be print and then leave for ireland fletcher after learn the issue of the conference would have like to stay they publication but in wesley 's absence this could not be do thus appear the first portion of fletcher 's famous _ check to antinomianism _ into the subsequent controversy extend over several year many writer be draw the chief be on wesley 's side fletcher and oliver and on lady huntingdon 's shirley toplady berridge sir richard and rowland hill many bitter word be write and much say and do that would have be far better left unsaid and undo but through it all even toplady wesley 's bitterest opponent could say of oliver i be glad i see he for he appear to be a person of stronger sense and better behavior than i have imagine and berridge welcome fletcher to everton after a twenty year ' absence with tear in he eye cry my dear brother how could we write against each other when we both aim at the same thing the glory of god and the good of soul ix spa field chapel in addition to the constant service hold in she different london house by she chaplain and other lady huntingdon open and support several chapel in the capital the first be lease in 1770 in ewer street the next be in princess street westminster and be open in 1774 then come mulberry garden chapel at wapping where george burder sometimes and john clayton very often preach towards the close of 1776 negotiation for the purchase of what be know as the pantheon a large building in spa field one of the place where satan have he seat be commence owe to the advice of shirley and toplady the completion of the purchase be delay but at length the countess write : my heart seem strongly set upon have this temple of folly dedicate to jehovah-jesus the great head of he church and people i feel so deeply for the perish thousand in that part of london that i be almost tempt to run every risk and though at this moment i have not a penny to command yet i be so firmly persuade of the goodness of the master whose i be and whom i desire to serve that i shall not want gold or silver for the work nor do she a company of gentleman secure it fit it up as a chapel and on July 5 1777 john ryland of northampton preach the opening sermon unforeseen and far-reaching consequence

court and obtain a inhibition prohibit any clergyman of the established church whether lady huntingdon 's chaplain or not from preach in spa field lady huntingdon rise to the occasion she be not the woman to allow a altogether unworthy opposition to defeat what she feel to be god 's work since the law uphold sellon she in she turn invoke it under the toleration act she claim and exercise she rights i be reduce she write to turn the finest congregation not only in england but in any part of the world into a dissent meeting mr will and mr taylor two clergyman who be prominent at this time among the countess 's helper both determine to secede from the established church and thus once and for ever she dispose of mr sellon 's claim and prerogative mr will become the regular minister of the church it be in this building that the first annual sermon of the london missionary society be preach by dr hawei and for over a hundred year spa field chapel be a center of light and help and healing for that part of london this legal conflict have place those numerous and able clergyman who have be in the habit of preach in lady huntingdon 's chapel in a very awkward position they have to choose between two master not unnaturally they remain in the established church hence from 1779 romaine venn jone and many other though still in full sympathy with the countess 's work cease to preach in she chapel the student educate at trevecca now render service of great value in addition to they itinerating labor they gradually fill the pulpit thus leave vacant in the chapel hitherto the great majority of they have seek ordination in the church of england such have always be lady huntingdon 's desire for they this be no longer possible the first public ordination of trevecca student take place at spa field march 9 1783 when mr will and mr taylor ordain six young man to the work of the ministry it be on this occasion that the well-known fifteen article subscription to which become essential for entrance into the college or into any of the pulpit under lady huntingdon 's control be first publicly read lady huntingdon never intend she chapel or society to be organise into a denomination -- she never think of provide for they a ecclesiastical constitution as such as she intend and sustain they they be simply evangelise agency the spiritual necessity of she day induce she to become a builder of chapel for evangelical preaching and worship these she sustain and rule as she own private property devote by she to the service of christ but disposable by she own uncontrolled

all she property to administer it all to the best of they ability in harmony with what they know to be she wish many of the building associate with she name and minister be local trust so that the power of the connexion trustee never extend over more than a portion of the church which she evangelistic zeal have found or strengthen it be almost inevitable that such a arrangement should be fatal to development and so it have prove the latest sketch of lady huntingdon 's life thus set forth the present position of the connexion : the fifteen article be the bond and doctrinal basis of administration in the connexion and in the word of the countess write when she leave the church of england ` we minister must come recommend by that neutrality between church and dissent -- secession ' beyond this the connexion have no act of uniformity the worship accord to the vary need of different locality may be liturgical or non liturgical congregation be allow much liberty in the form of

the last half century have tell rather against the development of church which stand apart from the life and association on the one hand of the established church and on the other of nonconformity but the mere enumeration of the chief chapel yet remain either in the central or in special local trust be interesting as a illustration of how the evangelise influence of lady huntingdon and she preacher

and amiable character he peaceable and virtuous life and the improbability of he be guilty of the charge bring against he he public service in defense of freedom and of the protestant religion be the real cause of the resolution to get rid of he towards the close of the trial one of he enemy the notorious jeffery make a violent declamation and turn the untimely end of lord essex in the tower into a proof of russell 's be privy to the guilty conspiracy this base insinuation evidently have effect on the jury who bring in a verdict of guilty the sentence be consider by all right-minded person as a shameful injustice burnet afterwards speak of he as that great but innocent victim sacrifice to the rage of a party and condemn only for treasonable word say to have be speak in he hearing among the incident of the trial one of the most memorable be when the prisoner ask for somebody to write to help he memory you may have a servant say the attorney-general sir robert sawyer any of you servant add the lord chief justice pemberton shall assist you in write for you anything you please my wife be here my lord to do it if my lady please to give herself the trouble be the civil reply of the lord

in he power would not have grant I six hour besides he say i must break with the duke of york if i grant it seek the king 's life have never be make a charge far less attempt to be prove though something have be say about attack the king 's guard but russell deny with he last breath any design against the person of the king all consideration be weak against the passion of revenge with which the king and the duke of york be actuate the duke of york descend so low in he personal animosity that he urge that the execution should take place before russell 's own door in bloomsbury square but the king would not consent to this a order be sign for he be behead in lincoln 's inn field a week after the trial it be say that at that time southampton house on the north side of bloomsbury square be visible from the place where the scaffold be erect lord cavendish generously offer to manage he escape and to stay in prison for he while he should go away in he clothes but russell would not entertain the proposal it be then plan that cavendish with a party of horse should attack the guard on the way to the scaffold and rescue the innocent victim but this too be overrule as russell refuse to allow any life be endanger to save he own he prepare to receive the stroke with meekness and with a dignity worthy of he name on the Tuesday before he execution when he wife have leave he he express great joy in the magnanimity of spirit he see in she and say that parting with she be the worst part of he pain on Thursday when she leave he to try to gain a respite till Monday he say he wish she would cease from seek he preservation but he do not forbid she try think that these effort though unavailing might bring some mitigation of she sorrow on the evening before he death he suffer he young child to be bring by they mother for the final parting in this try time he maintain he constancy of temper though he heart be full of tenderness when they have go he say that the bitterness of death be pass and then speak much of the noble spirit of she whom he have so loved and who have be to he so great a blessing he say what a misery it would have be to he if she have not that magnanimit of spirit join to she tenderness as never to have desire he to do a base thing for the saving of he life there be a signal providence of god in give he such a wife where there be birth fortune great understanding true religion and great kindness to he but she carriage in he extremity be beyond all he be glad she and he child be to lose nothing by he death and it be a great comfort to he that he leave he child in the hand of such a mother and that she have promise to he to take care of herself for they sake -lrb- illustration : parting of lord and lady russell _ copy by permission from the fresco in the palace of westminster _ -rrb- it should be state that when they partake of the communion together for the last time she so control she feeling for he sake as not to shed a tear although afterwards she weep so much that it be fear she would lose she sight the scene of the parting in prison be not only memorable in history but have be a favorite theme in art and one of the fresco in the new house of parliament commemorate it many poet have write about the death of lord russell among they can in a suppose letter to he friend lord cavendish in which the noble character of he wife be celebrate as well as the virtue of she husband the execution take place not on tower hill as usual with person of high rank but in lincoln 's inn field in order that the citizen of london might be humble and terrify by the sight as he be carry in a coach to the scaffold through the city the effect be very different from what be intend the death of this one man make many enemy to the king and though the triumph of liberty and religion be delay for a few year the execution of lord russell do much to secure the overthrow of arbitrary power and the defeat of popery in england at no distant time the trial take place July 13 and 14 and the execution on July 21 1683 vii lord russell die for the civil and religious liberty of he country all man even those who be far from agree with he political principle agree in regard he as a man of probity and virtue and the model of a patriot he pass through this world with as great and general a reputation as any one of the age and he memory will be hold in everlasting remembrance bring every sweetest flower and let I strew the grave where russell lie whose temper blood with calmest cheerfulness for thee resign stain the sad annals of a giddy reign aim at lawless power though meanly sink in loose inglorious luxury so sing of he the poet of the season thomson in he famous apostrophe to britannium as the land of liberty one of the first act of king william iii after the revolution be to reverse the attainder of lord russell in the preamble of this bill which be the second that pass in he reign after receive the royal assent he execution be call a murder : and in November of the same year 1689 the house of common appoint a committee to inquire who be the adviser and promoter of the murder of lord russell in the year 1694 he father be create marquis of tavistock and duke of bedford the reason for bestow these honor be state in the preamble of the patent in these term : and this not the least that he be the father of lord russell the ornament of he age whose great merit it be not enough to transmit by history to posterity but they -lrb- the king and queen -rrb- be willing to record they in they royal patent to remain in the family as a monument consecrate to he consummate virtue whose name could never be forget so long as man preserve any esteem for sanctity of manners greatness of mind and a love of they country constant even to death therefore to solace he excellent father for so great a loss to celebrate the memory of so noble a son and to excite he worthy grandson the heir of such mighty hope more cheerfully to emulate and follow the example of he illustrious father they entail this high dignity upon the earl and he posterity the first duke of bedford -lrb- fifth earl -rrb- live till September 1700 he have six son and three daughter besides the martyred son william marry to the daughter of the earl of southampton they have one son wriothesley who succeed he grandfather as duke of bedford in 1700 and die of small-pox in 1711 in the 31st year of he age of two daughter the elder married william lord cavendish afterwards duke of devonshire and the second married john manners lord ross afterwards duke of rutland a third daughter die unmarried a striking anecdote be record of king jame ii address himself in the time of he extremity in 1688 to the aged earl of bedford say my lord you be a honest man have great credit in the state and can do I signal service ah sir reply the earl i be old and feeble i can do you but little service but i have a son once that could have assist you but he be no more jame be so strike with this reply that he could not speak for some minute and it be to be hope that he feel remorse for the death of lord russell when the attainder on russell be remove by king william iii the same justice be do to he friend algernon sidney who be unite with he in the famous line of thomson 's patriotic remembrance : with he he friend the british cassius fearless lad of high determine spirit roughly brave by ancient learn to the enlighten love of ancient freedom warm algernon sidney unlike russell be in theory not averse to republicanism but the accusation be false as to he be a sceptic or a deist as he own die apology attest he say : god will not suffer this land where the gospel have of late flourish more than in any part of the world to become a slave of the world he will not suffer it to be make a land of graven image he will stir up witness of the truth and in he own time spirit he people to stand up for he cause and deliver they i live in this belief and be now about to die in it i know my redeemer liveth and as he have in a great measure uphold I in the day of my calamity i hope that he will still uphold I by he spirit in this last moment and give I grace to glorify he in my death receive I into the glory prepare for those that fear he when my body shall be dissolve amen these be the last word of algernon sidney it be noteworthy that the duke of monmouth in he declaration against jame ii among other thing accuse he of order the barbarous murder of the earl of essex in the tower and of several other to conceal it and he give as a reason for he appeal to arm in he unhappy rebellion the unjust condemnation of sidney and of russell viii it have be remark that the incident in the life of lady russell apart from the one memorable public event of she husband 's trial and death be so few and she merit confine so much to the domain of private life and feminine duty that she character unlike that of most heroine deserve to be hold up more to the _ example _ than the _ admiration _ of she countrywoman few of she sex have be place in such a conspicuous situation but fewer after behave with unexampled fortitude and dignity have shrink from public notice and in the sight of god only have lead unobtrusive quiet life in the daily performance of domestic duty as a careful and conscientious mother and guardian of she child it be this that make the record of she life so valuable for all time if she who have such a unusual and terrible affliction be enable by the grace of god in the exercise of reason and religion to show such complete submission to the divine will and such patient continuance in well-doing she example be well fit for the comfort and succor of all who in this transitory life be in trouble sorrow need sickness or any other adversity one of the earliest letter write to a friend who seek to comfort she in she deep sorrow reveal the noble spirit and wise resolution of a true christian she say : fresh occasion recall to my memory the dear object of my affection must happen every day i may say every hour of the longest life i can live but i must seek such a victory over myself that immoderate passion may not break forth and i must return into the world so far as to act that part incumbent upon I in faithfulness to he to whom i owe as much as can be due to man it may be that i may obtain grace to live a stricter life of holiness to my god who will not always let I cry to he in vain on he i will wait till he have pity upon I humbly implore that by the mighty aid of he holy spirit he will touch my heart with greater love to himself then i shall be what he would have I but i be unworthy of such a spiritual blessing who remain so unthankful a creature for those earthly one i have enjoy because i have they no longer yet god who know we frame will not expect that when we be weak we should be strong this be much comfort under my deep dejection and in a letter to doctor tillotson she say : submission and prayer be all we know that we can do towards we own relief in we distress the scene will soon alter to that peaceful and eternal home in prospect it be interesting to know that one who help to bring she to this state of mind be the rev john howe a man note for wisdom as well as piety who have be chaplain to oliver cromwell and to he son richard cromwell although too long to insert in full some sentence select from the letter be worthy of quotation the cause of you sorrow madam be exceed great the cause of you joy be inexpressibly greater you

of you afflicting loss by give you a daily intellectual participation through the exercise of faith and hope in he enjoyment he can not descend to share with you in you sorrow but you may thus every day ascend and partake with he in he joy after much devout reasoning of this kind the good and wise preacher make a practical appeal : nor should such thought excite over-hasty impatient desire of follow presently to heaven but to the endeavor of serve god more cheerfully on earth for you appoint time which i earnestly desire you ladyship to apply yourself to as you would not displease god who

a sensible and motherly letter to give adequate idea of the whole correspondence would occupy much space and we can only briefly refer to a few of the letter at different period of she long life of widowhood to burnet the bishop of salisbury she write in 1690 : when anything below be the object of we love at one time or other it will be a matter of we sorrow but a little time will put I again

thankfully feel through the course of a long life which -lrb- with a much greater help -rrb- the contemplation of a more durable state have maintain and uphold I through variety of providence and condition of life but all the delight and sorrow of this mixed state must end and i feel the decay that attend old age creep so fast on I that although i may yet get over some more year however i ought to make it my frequent meditation that the day be near when this earthly tabernacle shall be dissolve and my immortal spirit be receive into that place of purity where no unclean thing can enter there to sing eternal praise to the great creator of all thing with the psalmist i believe ` at he right hand there be pleasure for evermore : ' and what be good and of eternal duration must be joyful above what we can conceive as what be evil and of like duration must be despairingly miserable and now my dear child i pray i beseech you i conjure you my loved son consider what there be of felicity in this world that can compensate the hazard of lose a everlasting easy being and then deliberately weigh whether or no the delight and gratification of a vicious or idle course of life be such that a wise or thoughtful man would choose or submit to again fancy its enjoyment at the height imagination can propose or suggest -lrb- which yet rarely or never happen or if it do as a vapor soon vanish -rrb- but let we grant it could and last to fourscore year be this more than the quickest thought to eternity oh my child fix on that word eternity old hobbe with all he fancied strength of reason could never endure to rest or stay upon that thought but run from it to some miserable amusement i remember to have read of some man who read in the bible something that check he he throw it on the ground the book fall open and he eye fix on the word eternity which so strike upon he mind that he from a bad liver become a most holy man certainly nothing besides the belief of reward and punishment can make a man truly happy in he life at he death and after death keep innocency and take heed to the thing that be right for that shall bring a man peace at the last -- peace in the evening of each day peace in the day of death and peace after death for my own part i apprehend i should not much care -lrb- if free from pain -rrb- what my portion in this world be -- if a life to continue perhaps one year or twenty or eighty but then to be dust not to know or be know any more -- this be a thought that have something of horror in it to I and always have and would make I careless if it be to be long or short but to live to die to live again have a joy in it and how inexpressible be that joy if we secure a humble hope to live ever happily and this we may do if we take care to live agreeably to we rational faculty which also best secure health strength and peace of mind the greatest blessing on earth believe the word of god the holy scripture what most hinder faith i be persuade be ignorance of god 's true nature look up to the firmament and down to the deep how can any doubt a divine power and if there be what can be impossible to infinite power then why a infidel in the world in he gospel the terror of god 's majesty be lay aside and he speak in the still and soft voice of he son incarnate the fountain and spring whence flow gladness the idolatrous heathen perform they worship with trouble and terror but a christian and a good liver with a merry heart and lightsome spirit : for examine and consider well where be the hardship of a virtuous life -lrb- when we have moderate we irregular habit and passion and subdue they to the obedience of reason and religion -rrb- we be free to all the innocent gratification and delight of life and we may lawfully nay further i say we ought to rejoice in this beautiful world and all the convenience and provision even for pleasure we find in it and which in much goodness be afford we to sweeten and allay the labor and trouble incident to this mortal state nay inseparable i believe by disappointment cross accident bad health unkind return for good deed mistake even among friend and what be most touching death of friend but in the worst of these calamity the thought of a happy eternity do not alone support but also revive the spirit of a man and he goeth forth to he labor with inward comfort till the evening of he day -lrb- that be he life on earth -rrb- and with the psalmist cry out ' i will consider the heaven even the work of thy finger the moon and the star which thou hast ordain what be man that thou art mindful of he or the son of man that thou shouldest so regard he ' -lrb- psalm viii -rrb- ` thou madest he lower than the angel to crown he with glory ' here be matter of praise and gladness ` the fool ' as the psalmist express it ` have say in he heart there be no god ' or let we consider the man who be content to own a invisible power yet try to believe that when man have do live on this earth he live no more : but i would ask if any of these unhappy creature be fully persuade or that there do not remain in those man at time -lrb- as in sickness or sober thoughtfulness -rrb- some suspicion or doubt that it may be other than they try to think and although they may to shun such a thought or be rid of such a contemplation run away from it to some unprofitable diversion or perhaps suffer themselves to be rally out of such a think so destructive to the way they walk in yet to be sure that man do not feel the peace and tranquillity he do who believe a future state and be a good man for although this good man when he mind may be cloud with some calamity very grievous to he or the disorder of vapor to a melancholy temper i say if he be tempt to some suspicion that it be possible it may be other than he believe -lrb- pray observe -rrb- such a surmise or think nay the belief can not drive he to any horror : he fear no evil because he be a good man and with he life all sorrow end too : therefore it be not to be deny he be the wisest man who live by the scripture rule and endeavor to keep god 's law he mind be in peace and tranquillity he walk sure who keep innocence and take heed to the thing that be right he be secure god be he friend that infinite be and he have say ` come unto I ye that be heavy laden my yoke be easy ' but guilt be certainly a heavy load it sink and damp the spirit ' a wounded spirit who can bear ' and the evil subtle spirit wait -lrb- i be persuade -rrb- to drive the sinner to despair but godliness make a cheerful heart let not past error discourage who live and sin not god will judge the obstinate profane unrelenting sinner but be full of compassion to the work of he own hand if they will cease from do evil and learn to do well pray for grace to repent and endeavor with that measure which will be give if sincerely ask for for at what time soever a sinner repent -lrb- but observe this be no licence to sin because at any time we may repent -rrb- for that day we may not live to see and so like the fool in the parable we lamp be untrimmed when we be call upon remember that to forsake vice be the beginning of virtue and virtue certainly be most conducive to content of mind and a cheerful spirit he -lrb- the virtuous man -rrb- rejoiceth with a friend in the good thing he enjoy fear not the reproach of any no evil spirit can approach to hurt he here or accuse he in the great day of the lord when every soul shall be judge accord as they have do good or evil oh bless state fit for life fit for death in this good state i wish and pray for all mankind but most particularly and with all the ardor i be capable of to those i have bring into the world and those dear to they thus be my fervent and frequent prayer

day of she life a pretty little babe even then and by the time she reach two year of age with she fair complexion light curl hair and bright expression a prettier child be seldom see at that age she speak with perfect distinctness and with greater fluency and variety of language than be usual in so young a child she comprehend and enjoy any little story that be tell she i remember she animated look of attention when the rev j east tell she about a little mary who love the lord jesus we be all teach to read early and to repeat by we dear mother but as i have now left school i undertake the charming little pupil teach she reading spelling and a rhyme -lrb- generally one of jane taylor 's -rrb- for half a hour every morning and in the afternoon twenty or thirty stitch of patchwork with a very short text to repeat next morning at breakfast when three year old she could read easy book and she brother frank remember how often she be find hide under a table with some engrossing story at four year old france could read the bible and any ordinary book correctly and have learn to write in round hand french and music be gradually add but great care be always take not to tire she or

four year old she thus write : up to the time that i be six year old i have no remembrance of any religious idea whatever even when take once to see the corpse of a little boy of my own age -lrb- four year -rrb- lie in a coffin strew with flower in dear papa 's parish of astley i do not think about it as otherwise than a very sad and very curious thing that that little child should lie so still and cold but from six to eight i recall a different state of thing the beginning of it be a sermon preach one Sunday morning at hallow church by mr -lrb- now archdeacon -rrb- phillpot of this i even now retain a distinct impression it be to I a very terrible one dwelling much on hell and judgment and what a fearful thing it be to fall into the hand of the living god no one ever know it but this sermon haunt I and day and night it cross I i begin to pray a good deal though only night and morning with a sort of fidget and impatience almost angry at feel so unhappy and want and expect a new heart and have everything put straight and be make happy all at once all this time she could not bear be talk to or pray with though she keep up a custom of go by herself every Sunday afternoon to a quiet room and after read a chapter in the new testament would kneel down and pray after that she usually feel soothed and less naughty she appear even as a child to have appreciate very keenly the beauty of nature and in the spring of 1845 she be most anxious to be make a christian before the summer come so that she might enjoy god 's work as she believe a christian alone could do another soothing influence upon she spirited nature be the presence of any one whom she feel to be more than commonly holy not among those nearest and dearest to I at home she confess : how perversely i overlook they -- but any very pious clergyman or other manifest and shine christian all this while she continue i do not think any one could have give the remotest guess at what pass in my mind or have give I credit for a single serious thought i know i be ' a naughty child ' -- never entertain any doubt on the subject in fact i almost enjoy my naughtiness in a savage desperate kind of way because i utterly despaired of get any better except by be ` make a christian ' which as month pass on leave I rather worse than better be a less and less hoped-for though more and more longed-for change when she be nearly nine year old mr havergal be appoint to the rectory of st nichola worcester and thither the family remove soon after they arrival a sermon by the curate upon the text fear not little flock arouse she from the feeling of self-satisfaction into which she have drift have a favourable opportunity she unburden she heart one evening when alone with the curate but he do not help the young seeker after peace he say the excitement of move and come into new scene be the cause most likely of she feeling worse and that would soon go off then she be to try and be a good girl and pray so after that she lip be utterly seal to all but god for another few year or rather more in 1848 she mother become seriously ill and feeling that she be soon to leave she little girl she say to she one evening : fanny dear pray to god to prepare you for all that he be prepare for you the sad event which the mother thus anticipate france could not or would not understand but what god have

surely ' be my response and i leave she suddenly and run away upstairs to think it out i flung myself on my knee in my room and strove to realize the sudden hope i be very happy at last i could commit my soul to jesus i do not and need not fear he come i could trust he with my all for eternity it be so utterly new to have any bright thought about religion that i could hardly believe it could be so

she talent enough to make it worth while to devote herself to music as a serious thing as a life-work he answer sincerely and unhesitatingly i can say that you _ have _ how spontaneous be she musical and poetical genius will be see from the account of the genesis of she well-known missionary hymn and tune tell it out among the heathen she be unable to go to church at winterdyne one snowy morning

the heathen that the lord be king ' one person at least be turn to righteousness on that musical afternoon -lrb- footnote 1 : quote in _ the sister _ charle bullock bd p 100 -rrb- the ministry of song of fr havergal will chiefly be remembered however by the goodly heritage of poetry which she have leave to the church of christ and in which she be dead yet speaketh here it be that she great influence be still feel she have the happy gift of express the deep breathing of the consecrate soul in whole-hearted loyalty to the bless master she strive to regard the lord jesus as a real living and personal friend she long to be entirely yield up to he service and she put the thought of she heart which have be warm by the indwelling spirit in real and genuine expression of love to and praise of she master she begin write verse when she be only seven year of age in 1860 she poetry be so much appreciate that she receive application from the editor of various religion magazine to supply poetical contribution in 1803 she receive she first cheque of # 10 17 6d this she send to she father : # 10 for anything he like to employ it on 10 for the scripture reader ' collection and 7 6d for any similar emergency she hymn i give my life for thee first appear in _ good word _ it be write in germany in 1858 she have come in weary and sit down opposite a picture with this motto at once the line flash upon she and she write they in pencil on a scrap of paper read they over they do not satisfy she she toss they into the fire but they fall out untouched show they some month after to she father he encourage she to preserve they and write the tune baca especially for they the origin of the well-known hymn ` take my life ' she thus describe -- i go for a little visit of five day there be ten person in the house some unconverted and long pray for some convert but not rejoice christian he give I the prayer ` lord give I _ all _ in this house ' and he just _ do _ before i leave the house every one have get a blessing the last night of my visit i be too happy to sleep and pass most of the night in praise and renewal of my own consecration and these little couplet form themselves and chime in my heart one after another till they finish with ' _ ever _ only all for thee ' some six month before she die she write thus about this hymn i have a great time early this morning renew the never-regretted consecration i seem lead to run over the ` take my life ' and could bless he verse by verse for have lead I on to much more definite consecration than even when i write it -- voice gold intellect etc but the eleventh couplet -- ` take my love -- my lord i pour at thy foot its treasure store ' -- that have be unconsciously _ not fill up _ somehow i feel mystified and out of my depth here it be a simple and definite thing to be _ do _ to settle the voice or silver and gold but ` love ' i have to love other and i do and i have not a small treasure of it and even loving _ in he _ do not quite meet the inner difficulty i shall just go forward and expect he to fill it up and let my life from this day answer really to that couplet the worst part to I be that i do not in practice prove my love to he by delight in much and long communion with he hand and head seem so full of other thing ' -lrb- which yet be he given work -rrb- that ` heart ' seem not ` free to serve ' in fresh and vivid love in write she hymn fr havergal look up to god to give she the idea and word and they be often produce very rapidly mr snepp of perry bar leave she lean against a wall while he go in to visit the boy ' school and on he return ten minute afterwards she hand he the well-known hymn golden harp be sound pencil upon a old envelope a remarkable fact be record in connection with another hymn entitle reality reality lord jesus christ thou art to I she be much strike with the expression use by a work man in a prayer-meeting -- father we know the reality of jesus christ this thought take hold of she and find expression in this hymn on a stormy night at whitby after she have see the life-boat put forth to a wreck hence the expression pilot lifeboat and haven the very night she write the hymn a young christian four hundred mile away be plead at a prayer-meeting lord jesus let thy dear servant write for we what thou art thou live bright reality and let she do it _ this very night _ while they be yet speak i will hear space do not permit any detailed account of she poetry she 's be specially song of the inner life she reveal in she poetic work she own inner experience and a perusal of they will give indication of she own growth in holiness a reader be impressed not only with the ease and brightness of she style but with she firm grasp of thing unseen she poetry be not just string together word but it be the very expression of she heart she thus write on this point in _ the ministry of song _ : poetry be not a trifle lightly think and lightly make not a fair and scentless flower gaily culture for a hour then as gaily leave to fade ` tis not string rhyme together in a pleasant true accord not the music of the metre not the happy fancy sweeter than a flower-bell honey-stored ` tis the essence of existence rarely rise to the light and the song that echo longest deepest fullest truest strongest with you life-blood you must write so do the sweet singer herself write from she own experience she hymn which be very numerous no less than seventy be in common use have be the means not only of arrest the undecided and help the saint but of console the suffering and the doubt so many of she poem be the expression of a bright faith and simple trust shine out through storm and cloud that other storm-tossed and beclouded catch the ray and be cheer thereby although many of the poem be in a plaintive minor tone there be occasional burst of more cheerful strain as in the line on a merrie christmas which appear in the _ Sunday at home _ a merrie christmas to you for we serve the lord with mirth and we carol forth glad tiding of we holy savior 's birth so we keep the olden greet with its meaning deep and true and wish a merrie christmas and a happy new year to you oh yes ' a merrie christmas ' with blithest song and smile bright with the thought of he who dwell on earth a little while that we might dwell for ever where never fall a tear : so ' a merrie christmas ' to you and a happy happy year the beautiful and aptly choose title alone in many case be most suggestive and refreshing yes france r havergal 's power of give expression to holy aspiration and christian loyalty and heartfelt praise will live as long as english hymnology live vii see the king we come now to describe the closing month of this devoted life she sister recall that the new year 's greet give to she on January 1 1879 be ` he crowneth the year with he goodness ' and he crowneth I ` with loving-kindness and tender mercy ' you dear marie be one of my mercy and

she sister thus describe the glorious sunset of she life on June 3 1879 at the age of 42 : and now she look up steadfastly as if she see the lord and surely nothing less heavenly could have reflect such a glorious radiance upon she face for ten minute we watch that almost visible meeting with she king and she countenance be so glad as if she be already talk to he then she try to sing but after one sweet high note -- ` he -- ' she voice fail and as she brother commend she soul into she redeemer 's hand she pass away we precious sister be go satisfied glorified within the palace of she king and so she fall asleep and she eye see the king in he beauty -- that king of whom she sing so sweetly and write so loyally on June 9 they lay she body to rest in the quiet churchyard of astley church in worcestershire and thus within sight of the room which see she birth she body lie until the day dawn viii under the surface _ upon _ the surface you see a bright accomplished lady she have mark ability as a linguist she acquire a great deal of german as a child by carefully attend while present at the german lesson give to she sister she learn enough greek and hebrew to read she hebrew bible and to enjoy she greek testament and often bring out in she letter the fact that she have be study it as we have see she be a accomplished musician and she be untire in she literary production she book of poem comprise _ life-chord _ consist of under he shadow -- she last poem -- loyal response and she earlier poem _ life mosaic _ comprise the ministry of song and under the surface _ swiss letter and alpine poem _ write during several tour in switzerland she chief prose work _ keep for the master 's use the royal invitation my king royal commandment royal bounty starlight through shadow morning star morning bell little pillow and bruey a little worker for christ _ _ upon _ the surface too you see a woman of sound-common sense this be evidence both in she writings and she daily life for example she write thus one day : i feel as if i rather want a little intellectual brace as if something of contact with intellect be necessary to prevent my get into a weak and wishy-washy kind of thought and language i like intellect to rub against and have no present access to book which would do it so i bethought myself of see what shakespeare would do for I and i think my motive be really that i might polish my own instrument for the master 's use again as regard dress she sensible comment be if the king 's daughter be to be ` all glorious within ' she must not be outwardly a fright i must dress both as a lady and a christian the question of cost i see very strongly and do not consider myself at liberty to spend on dress that which might be spare for god 's work but it cost no more to have a thing well and prettily make yes _ on _ the surface you see a accomplished lady and on the surface you see also beam out the fact that _ under _ the surface she be a whole-hearted christian this be the most marked feature in she character no one could be in she company five minute without recognize whose she be and whom she serve a clergyman who know perhaps more of she inner life than any one else in a letter to the writer say the two most prominent characteristic of the last five and a half year of she life seem to I to be she unreserved consecration and she absolute confidence in the lord and he word the precede chapter will have show the reader how true a estimate this be the business of she life be to glorify god and enjoy he for ever of delicate health she might have spend a large portion of she time in fretful complaining but she look to she heavenly father to consecrate even she sickness to he service she standard of christian life be a very high one she thus write of a friend : i write to you as one who be really want to follow jesus altogether really want to live and speak _ exactly _ accord to he command and he beautiful example and where this be the standard what seem a little thing or nothing at all to other be sure to be sin because it be disobey he dear word and not ` follow _ fully _ ' she intimate knowledge of scripture she sound common-sense keep she from fall into many of the error into which some who have aim high in holy thing have fall in a letter to she sister on this subject she thus express herself : as to ` perfectionism ' or ` sinlessness ' i have all along and over and over again say i never do and do not hold either ` sinlessness ' belong _ only _ to christ now and to we glorified state in heaven i believe it to be not merely a impossibility on earth but a actual contradiction of we very be which can not be ` sinless ' till the resurrection change have pass upon we but be keep from fall keep from sin be quite another thing and the bible seem to teem with command and promise about it first however i would distinctly state that it be _ only _ as and while a soul be under the full power of the blood of christ that it can be cleanse from all sin that one moment 's withdrawal from that power and it be again actively because really sin one instant of standing alone be certain fall while magnify the savior 's power to save she have a just estimate of she own condition only about two year before she death she thus express herself : i can say for myself that i feel i have deserve the very suffering of hell for my transgression of the first great commandment of the law -lrb- ` thou shalt love the lord thy god ' etc -rrb- and for my sin of unbelief while she aim high she know full well that she have not attain neither be already perfect as to sanctification that it be the work of the holy spirit and progressive be the very thing i see and rejoice in he have bring I into the ` highway of holiness ' up which i trust every day to progress continually press forward lead by the spirit of god the simplicity of she trust in god and he word come out strikingly in she writings she seem to have grasp the fact that jesus christ be a living bright reality pledge to uphold and help and comfort all who go to he as little child another marked feature in she life be she deep sympathy with other in they trouble and anxiety and this spirit of unselfishness enable she in she prose writings and she hymn to inspire something of she simple trust into those who read they with receptive mind to see under the surface of france ridley havergal 's character look into she work and you find the humble servant of jesus christ reveal she walk with god and by the attraction of a life bright with the beauty of holiness reveal itself in she writings she have exercise and still exercise a great power upon christian by lift they up to a higher walk with god and many singer will doubtless join hereafter in the

order to estimate the complex influence surround hannah more in london and to appreciate the manner in which she stand the ordeal of pass through vanity fair it be necessary to bear in mind the social moral and religious aspect of the people about the middle of the eighteenth century what be now consider flagrant vice be either unnoticed or tacitly sanction of social refinement as we now understand the term there be comparatively little coarse joke swearing and profanity be almost as common in polite society as in the back street now the literature of the day except the writings of addison johnson steele and a few other minister to the low taste prevalent amongst both the upper and the lower class religion have well nigh lose all vitality with the majority of people it have become the subject either of jest sceptical hostility or the utmost indifference one of archbishop seeker 's charge contain the follow startling statement : -- in this we can not be mistake that a open and profess disregard of religion be become through a variety of unhappy cause the distinguishing character of the present age indeed it have already bring in such dissoluteness and contempt of principle

people the wave of religious awakening have touch the highest circle of london society and when hannah more receive she flattering welcome from fashion wit and genius in 1773 the spirit of indifference and neglect have give way in a slight degree to a spirit of inquiry and anxious concern there be however no perceptible change as yet in the utter worldliness of the time or in the low standard of moral it be a perilous thing for a young woman like hannah more with she enthusiasm talent and general attractiveness to be suddenly launch in the turbid though fascinating current of london society but the admirable training in strict moral principle with which she have be privileged furnished weapon of defense against the more specious temptation which present themselves whilst she quick discernment easily penetrate the thin shell of external polish cover worthlessness of character it be also fortunate for she that at the outset of she london experience she become acquaint

she london friend but chiefly with mr garrick either at the adelphus or at she country residence at hampton she life write by mr robert and other be rich with letter which of themselves form a striking autobiography reveal the writer 's prominent phase of character she steadfast adhesion to high principle she progress in the path of literary fame she wearying of fashionable society and the gradual consecration of all she power to the service of god besides these personal matter we get glimpse of the notable people with whom she be bring into contact and of the moral and religious condition of the higher class these letter conform to hannah more 's own idea of what epistolary effusion between friend should be what i want in a letter she once write be the picture of my friend 's mind and the common course of he life i want to know what he be say and do i want he to turn out the inside of he heart to I without disguise without appear better than he be we can therefore obtain a more lifelike portraiture by make extract from she correspondence than by attempt the task in any other way describe she feeling in associate with person of rank and wit she say : -- i have yesterday the pleasure of dining in hill street berkeley square at a certain mr montague 's a name not totally obscure the party consist of herself mr carter dr johnson solander and matty mr boscawen miss reynold and sir joshua -lrb- the idol of every company -rrb- some other person of high rank and less wit and you humble servant -- a party that would not have disgrace the table of laelius or of atticus i feel myself a worm for the consequence which be give I by mix I with such a society but as i tell mr boscawen and with great truth i have a opportunity of make a experiment of my heart by which i learn that i be not envious for i certainly do not repine at be the meanest person in companydr johnson ask I how i like the new tragedy of braganza i be afraid to speak before they all as i know a diversity of opinion prevail among the company : however as i think it less evil to dissent from the opinion of a fellow-creature than to tell a falsity i venture to give my sentiment and be satisfy with johnson 's answer ` you be right madam ' she conscience be uneasy from visit the opera and also from attend Sunday party which be greatly in vogue she thus write on this subject : -- london 1775 ` bear I some god oh quickly bear I hence to wholesome solitude the nurse of -- ' ` sense ' i be go to add in the word of pope till i recollected that _ penny _ have a more appropriate meaning and be as good a rhyme this apostrophe break from I on come from the opera the first i ever _ do _ the last i trust i ever _ shall _ go to for what purpose have the lord of the universe make he creature man with a comprehensive mind why make he a little lower than the angel why give he the faculty of think the power of wit and memory and to crown all a immortal and never-dying spirit why all this wondrous waste this prodigality of bounty if the mere animal sens of sight and hearing -lrb- by which he be not distinguish from the brute that perish -rrb- would have answer the end as well and yet i find the same people be see at the opera every night -- a amusement write in a language the greater part of they do not understand and perform by such a set of being conscience have do its office before nay be busy at the time and if it do not dash the cup of pleasure to the ground infuse at least a tincture of wormwood into it i _ do _ think of the alarming call ` what doest thou here elijah ' and i think of it to-night at the opera the attraction of wealth and fame have not blind she to the need of seek satisfaction from a higher source for my own part the more i see of the ` honor famed and great ' the more i see of the littleness the unsatisfactoriness of all create good and that no earthly pleasure can fill up the want of the immortal principle within she be much trouble by the extravagance of fashion in dress and adornment and although conform to some extent to prevail mode in order to avoid singularity which she abhor she always dress neatly and decorously and never through the whole of she life wear a article of jewellery simply for ornament the follow extract from a letter write by one of hannah 's sister show the cordial relationship with dr johnson and he interest in the five sister Tuesday evening we drink tea at sir joshua 's with dr johnson hannah be certainly a great favorite she be place next he and they have the entire conversation to themselves they be both in remarkably high spirit it be certainly she lucky night i never hear she say so many good thing the old genius be extremely jocular and the young one very pleasant you would have imagine you have be at some comedy have you hear we peal of laughter they indeed try which could ` pepper the highest ' and it be not clear to I that the lexicographer be really the highest reasoner iii characteristic friendship and early literary work hannah more 's flattering reception in london society and the lively impression which she so quickly create will give rise to some astonishment in the mind of many reader she have not yet win reputation as a authoress she do not possess the influence of wealth or of noble family she be not remarkable for physical beauty and she have none of the brazen ingenuity of patronage-hunter by which admission be secure into the house of distinguished people she come to london a stranger a plain schoolmistress from bristol and yet in a marvellously short time she be one of the best know character in the rank of the wise and great the cause of she rapid rise to distinction be not far to seek she wonderful talent for conversation at once prove a attraction to both man and woman but she be not merely a fluent talker never at a loss for a word a phrase or a metaphor have this be she crowning recommendation dr johnson 's long-standing friendship would never have be gain she talk be always sensible -- the outcome of a well-furnished retentive mind she judgment be sound she discrimination delicate and she grasp of fundamental truth consistently firm she do not accommodate she opinion to meet the exigency of different coterie nor be she addict to compromise she be equally at ease in discuss the merit of _ rassela _ with dr johnson the curiosity of art with lord orford roman history with gibbon and the state of the church with bishop porteus not that she pretend equality of learn with such man but she have just sufficient knowledge of various subject to provoke a conversation and enough cleverness to sustain it by draw out the scholar who might be seat at she side but this be not all she conversation sparkle with wit and repartee the mind laugh say she friend zachary macaulay not the muscle the countenance sparkle but it be with a ethereal flame : everything be oxygen gas and intellectual champagne : and the eye which she sister call ` diamond ' and which the painter complain they could not put upon canvas often give signal by its coruscation as the same sort of eye do in she friend mr wilberforce that something be forthcoming which in a less amiable and religiously disciplined mind might have be very pretty satire but which glance off innoxiously in the shape of epigrammatic playfulness -lrb- illustration : -rrb- she genial disposition and good temper disarm difference of opinion of anything harsh or unpleasant and form another credential for the prominence she attain in society the absence of all artificiality in sentiment and manners when contrast with the strain after effect acquire by fashionably-bred lady also add to she attraction in the eye of thoughtful man but whilst to these cause may be attribute she rapid rise into favor it be undoubtedly owe to she unswerving and unassuming piety that she retain for so long the respect confidence and affection of varied order of mind in london society at first she appear to have do little to enforce religious teaching amongst she acquaintance she moral and religious principle be know by the firm stand she take against common incentive to dissipation and irreligion -- such as card-playing and Sunday entertainment -- against the introduction of questionable topic unseemly language and vacuous frivolity into conversation she religious influence thus far be almost a silent or negative one but it have its effect on other and lay the foundation of that direct search and far-reaching influence which under the divine blessing she wield in later year she interest in young people be notably illustrate by she effort to foster the intellectual taste of lord macaulay when a lad she supply he with standard book which form the nucleus of a excellent library and advise he in he study to the child of six she thus write : -- though you be a little boy now you will one day if it please god be a man but long before you be a man i hope you will be a scholar -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see _ life and letter of lord macaulay _ by george otto trevelyan mp vol 1 pp 35 36 -rrb- when hannah more begin to produce book she reputation rise to literary fame in 1775 she write a romantic poem entitle _ sir eldr of the bouer _ with which be publish another poem write earlier _ the bleeding rock _ in the first the element of religion be not forget and both work meet with a flattering reception though as we have see a woman of high christian tone with what we should consider strange inconsistency she both write play which be act and attend the theater herself in 1777 she tragedy _ percy _ be bring out at covent garden theater one of the result of this venture be a shower of invitation to the author of the play from a new circle of title and distinguish people the play be afterwards translate into german and perform at vienna with notable success on the death of garrick in 1779 hannah more break off attendance at the theater garrick 's widow seek relief and solace in hannah 's company and for many year a close friendship be keep up between the two lady although there could be but little intercourse on religious matter mr garrick be a roman catholic before the actor 's death miss more have complete another play _ the fatal falsehood _ which be afterwards perform and which elicit almost as much applause as _ percy _ miss more 's experience of fashionable life have now last about six year as she fame increase she taste for society decline the constant round of dinner-party conversation-party and assembly of intellect and wealth though at first full of attraction to one of she disposition have begin to lose its charm she depth of character and she recognition of the claim of religion demand a more satisfactory mode of spend she time and utilise she talent for the next five year we find she often the guest of mr garrick but gradually detach herself from fashionable circle study theology history and science write poem and engage in other literary work she chief literary work during this period consist of _ sacred drama -- mose in the bulrush david and goliath belshazzar _ and _ daniel _ she be prompt to this undertaking by a desire to provide not play for the stage but a substitute for some of the pernicious literature of the day which fall into the hand of young people and also to afford instruction in the common fact of scripture the gross ignorance of the bible amongst fashionable people astonish she one day when sir joshua reynold tell she that on show he picture of samuel to some great patron they ask he who samuel be the work answer the purpose for which it be intend and pass through nineteen edition receive high commendation from bishop lowth and other she poem _ sensibility _ be also include in this successful volume a poem _ the ba bleu or conversation _ write in a lively and facetious strain owe its origin to the mistake of a foreigner who give the literal designation of the _ bas-bleu _ to a party of friend who have be humorously call the blue stocking at the king 's request a manuscript copy of the poem be send to he and dr johnson go so far in he praise of the effusion as to say that there be no name in poetry that might not be glad to own it a little later miss more write _ florio _ a poem describe the occupation of a young man of fashion and he final escape from a life of pleasure to one of usefulness by the death of dr johnson in 1784 miss more lose the best friend she ever have in london she have be with the doctor at he last communion at st clement 's church and see too plainly he altered condition bind to each other by strong intellectual and stronger religious sympathy the separation cause a void in miss more 's life which be never afterwards fill theirs be a friendship bear at first sight for more than ten year it grow and flourish with mutual benefit and happiness to the stern moralist and he promising _ protégé _ whilst the rugged common-sense and sound literary judgment of the doctor impart increase accuracy and insight to he friend 's view of the world and of literature it be the sparkle freshness and wit of miss more 's conversation and she light-heartedness of character that often dispel the cloud of depression from the mental horizon of she sage and trusty adviser and smooth the rough edge of he outspoken opinion in religion it be probably the doctor 's uncompromising fidelity to first principle and to a fearless practice of truth that help to fortify he dear child as he call miss more in maintain she integrity amidst the bewildering voice and garish scene of vanity fair iv cowslip green about the time of dr johnson 's death in 1784 hannah more become the possessor of a rural spot call cowslip green some ten mile from bristol here she build herself a cottage intend to make it she place of retirement for a large portion of each year in the cultivation of she garden she find leisure for reflection as well as a opportunity to pursue a favorite occupation the inroad which death have make in she circle of intimate friend a grow dissatisfaction with the enjoyment of london life and especially a keener sense of she responsibility as a profess christian than she have hitherto experienced lead to a close self-examination and to a scrutiny of the real motive of she life the result of this testing process show itself in various way during occasional visit to london and attendance at party she lose no opportunity of enforce the truth of religion she silent witness be now exchange for active exertion the manners and practice of people who be amongst she most effusive admirer sometimes meet with she indignant rebuke lady of title society beauty and leader of fashion who be unapproachable by other religious influence she urge in private to consider they spiritual interest the method she adopt be not usually to start religious topic but to extract from common subject some useful and awful truth and to counteract the mischief of a popular sentiment by one draw from religion perhaps a message which john wesley once send to she through a sister may have weigh considerably in deter she from a entire severance from the fashionable world tell she to live in the world _ there _ be the sphere of she usefulness they will not let _ we _ come nigh they not content with personal and private reproof advice and entreaty she now devoted she pen to the denunciation of folly and vice in high place in she work _ thought on the importance of the manners of the great to general society _ whilst protest against prevalent irreligious practice and habit of dissipation which even good people sanction she seek to arouse a sensitive regard for mutual responsibility as set forth in the new testament in 1788 the slave trade form a burning question in parliament miss more intensely arouse by the description present of the horrible traffic find vent for she feeling in a poem on the subject about the same time a close friendship begin with wilberforce which last to the end of life a yet more important friendship commence at this period -- one

nutriment on which they spiritual life and growth depend they do not pray over it they do not consider all its doctrine as of practical application they do not cultivate that spiritual discernment

the mother of susanna be a woman of eminent piety and beloved of all who know she how many child have dr annseley be a question ask of the eminent puritan preacher manton who have just be officiate at the baptism of one of the number i believe it be two dozen or a quarter of a hundred he reply such be the family into which the mother of the wesley be bear on the 20th of January 1669 of this crowded household the majority be daughter and susanna be the youngest of these in she own journal which form the only account of she childhood we read of several instance of she preservation from accident and once from a violent death the method of she education be not clearly state but the tree be know by its fruit there be evidence that it be sound and liberal and up to the best standard of the day in any rank of society french and music be evidently among she attainment while in she letter and treatise there be abundant token that logic and philosophy be also hold in effective possession and use she tell we that which might have be expect when she say that she be early initiate and instruct in the first principle of the christian religion and in after day we find she give to she son a rule which have prove to be a blessing to she own girlhood -- never to spend more time in any matter of mere recreation in one day than i spend in private religious duty the thoroughness of she own private religious duty be show by the fact that in the year 1700 she make a resolution to spend one hour morning and evening in private devotion this practice she keep up through life as far as circumstance would admit ii theological study soon we find susanna wesley study the work of jeremy taylor of the early puritan divine and the immortal bunyan till at length she vigor of intellect and enterprise in reading lead she into danger by read arian and socinian author of the period she faith be shake this however be not to be for long and the manner of she recall be mark by interesting circumstance it be at this juncture that samuel wesley she future husband first appear in the story as the friend of she soul this young student seven year she senior have himself make proof of socinianism in the course of some literary work he have be specially well pay for the translation of socinian writings from the latin but he strong mind revolt from they principle the task be resign and he faith become more firmly root in christ as the eternal son of god in this frame of mind mr wesley meet susanna annesley and by god 's help succeed in accomplish she complete extrication from the mesh of doctrinal error and distress it can be gather from she writings about this time that the salutary change proceed not out of complaisance to the lover but by reception of a fulness of light

well-informed for she father 's house be the resort of many able man on both side of the question the result be that with all due respect toward she beloved parent she renounce he ecclesiastical view and attach herself to the established church i be educate among the dissenter she write and because there be something remarkable in my leave they at so early a age not be full thirteen i have draw up a account of the whole transaction under which i have include the main of the controversy between they and the established church as far as it have come to my knowledge clearly susanna wesley be not to be consider as have merely accept the ecclesiastical situation turn churchwoman by marriage iii marriage dr annesley 's daughter be remarkable for they personal beauty and from all account it would seem that the subject of this narrative share this dower she be of average stature and slight frame some time late in 1689 or early in 1690 susanna annesley be marry to samuel wesley mr wesley be at that time a curate at a salary of # 30 a year and with he newly-wedded wife take lodgings in london till the autumn of 1690 when he receive the living of south ormsby in lincolnshire through the presentation of the marquis of normanby while exercise in he pastoral duty a diligence and faithfulness such as to put he for the most part above censure the young husband toil hard in literary work for the support of he household and by various publication of a theological character in verse and prose -- at one time a metrical _ life of christ _ at another a treatise on _ the hebrew point _ and chiefly by article in dunton 's _ athenian oracle _ -- he earn the means of keep he family at least above distress about the close of 1696 samuel wesley be present to the parish of epworth -- a place destine to be irrevocably associate with he name this promotion be say to have be award he by special desire of the queen to whom he have dedicate he _ metrical and illustrated life of christ _ iv epworth mr and mr wesley with they family of four child -- one son and three daughter the youngest of these be a infant in arm -- duly take possession of they new sphere the promotion prove to be a hard parish and a humble abode the landowner be comparatively poor and of small culture in mind or moral the people be proportionately subject to hardship in they mode of life and be rude and even savage in character as event be soon to prove there be seven room in the straw-roofed parsonage require new furniture which have to be procure with borrow money -- a beginning of thing that form a grievous burden for many a day the trade of the place consist chiefly in the dress of flax which be extensively grow in the field of the river-island of axholme in-which the village of epworth stand with its population of two thousand the parsonage share in this trade but misfortune soon come thickly a fire break out -lrb- not the one that have become so celebrated -rrb- in 1702 and destroy a third part of the house mr wesley and the child be in the study when the alarm be raise and the mother take two of they in she arm rush through the smoke and flame another be with difficulty save and happily none be lose a year later the rector 's whole crop of flax be consume the famous fire take place in 1709 accord to mr wesley 's account -- when we open the street door the strong north-east wind drive the flame in with such violence that none could stand against they but some of we child get out through the window the rest through a little door into the garden i be not in a condition to climb up to the window neither could i get to the garden door i endeavor three time to force my passage through the street door but be as often drive back by the fury of the flame in this distress i besought we bless savior for help and then wade through the fire as i be which do I no further harm than a little scorching my hand and my face the sequel be of undying interest to the church and the world one sweet child six year of age have be leave sleep upstairs : the father make frantic attempt to reach he by the burning staircase but in vain and finally fall on he knee in the passage solemnly commit the child 's soul to god the boy awake after some bewilderment with the glare that look to he as daylight climb upon a chest at the window and be see man rightly guide do not lose the last chance by wait for a ladder but mount one upon the other 's shoulder some two or three in this way save the child who become the famous john wesley when john have be save the father turn to the man who have save the boy with the word : come neighbor let we kneel down let we give thanks to god he have give I all my eight child let the house go i be rich enough this terrible occurrence be attend by consequence which make the noble christian mother anxious for she child in another way be now disperse among various household of the village for sleep accommodation the little one be for a time in danger of those evil communication that corrupt good manners from this the kindness of the few who sheltered they could scarcely defend they for the malice of the many be great against they parish minister the grounds of ill-will and persecution be political rather than personal it be strongly suspect that these fire be in every instance the deed of incendiary the rector 's cattle have be mutilate the child have curse fling at they in the street and on occasion of mr wesley 's absence at lincoln to record he vote many cowardly device be resort to by way of alarming the family at all hour of the night one new-born child have be owe to mr wesley 's exhaustion and danger commit to the care of a nurse this poor woman lose sleep by the cruel noise purposely raise outside at last far in the night fall into a heavy slumber and overlay the child cold and dead they bring it to the poor mother it be political spite also that be at the bottom of the conduct of a creditor who cause the rector to be arrest for debt at the church door after a baptismal service and hurry off to lincoln castle leave he lamb among so many wolf in prison mr wesley engage in a earnest work of evangelise he brother jail-bird as he call they he conduct at this period more than realize the world-renowned picture which goldsmith have draw of he incarcerated vicar of wakefield susanna wesley now strive to support herself and she child by means of the diary but fear lest she husband should be pine in want she send to he she wedding-ring beseech he by this to get a little money for he comfort he return it with word of tender gratitude say that god would soon provide indeed be by this time regard as a martyr to he political principle he be approach by some brethren of the clergy seek to deliver he and a arrangement be make after three month by which he be liberate v the school in the home it would appear that ultimately the family of susanna wesley be almost as numerous as that of she father have be a singular want of accuracy characterise all the record but it be safe to say that she child be some eighteen or nineteen in number death come often during those year of persecution john wesley speak of the serenity with which he mother work among she thirteen child but ten be the number of those who be spare to enjoy the blessing of that enlighten affectionate and admirable training on she part which have be so fully record and of which the fruit be witness especially in the eminence of she son charle and john she pay the utmost attention to physical training punctuality in the hour of sleep be carefully carry out from infancy through the year that follow the rule regard food be all admirable and the younger child be early promote to a place at the parent ' own table mr wesley have commit all these matter to write and she own word be valuable for they wisdom in order to form the mind of child the first thing to be do be to conquer the will to inform the understanding be a work of time and must with child proceed by slow degree as they be able to bear it but the subject the will be a thing which must be do at once and the sooner the better then a child be capable of be govern by the reason and piety of its parent till its own understanding come to maturity again she write : cowardice and fear of punishment often lead child into lie and accordingly to save she own from temptation the rule be -- whoever be charge with a fault of which they be guilty if they would ingenuously confess it and promise to amend should not be beat the most careful discrimination be make between inadvertent and deliberate falsehood if they amend they be never upbraid afterward kindly commendation be regularly award to obedience evidently do at a sacrifice when the thing cross the child 's own inclination and when any of they perform a act of obedience or do any thing with a intention to please though the performance be not well yet the obedience and intention be kindly accept and the child with sweetness direct how to do better for the future recreation be liberally allow and outdoor physical amusement encourage high glee and frolic so notably appear in the narrative that in after day some writer think to turn this matter against john wesley remark that he have himself be indulge by he mother at home in amusement which he be now prohibit to the student under he at college he make the difference of age and the demand of duty he defense rather than any difference of principle here surely the motherly instinct of this remarkable woman may be of use to-day in clear the line of duty in the question of amusement you argument against horse-race do certainly conclude against masquerade ball play opera and all such light and vain diversion i will not say it be impossible for a person to have any sense of religion who frequent these but i never throughout the course of my long life know as much as one serious christian that do nor can i see how a lover of god can have any relish for they take this rule -- whatever weaken you reason impair the tenderness of you conscience obscure you sense of god or take off the relish of spiritual thing -- in short whatever increase the strength and authority of you body over you mind -- that thing be sin to you however innocent it may be in itself she fix the age of five for the teaching to a child the letter of the alphabet and tell we that in all case except two the first day see the conquest of the alphabet the birthday festivity over next morning the child go to the schoolroom of the house where no one must come into the room from nine till twelve or from two till five while the teacher devoted herself entirely to that one pupil another feature of the method be the abolition of the study of syllable and the immediate and usually successful advance into word and sentence such as the opening verse of the bible in the begin god create the heaven and the earth it be almost incredible say mr wesley what a child may be teach in a quarter of a year to this period belong the well-known incident -- when one day mr wesley say to he wife while engage in repeat a lesson to a dull child i wonder at you patience : you have tell that child twenty time that same thing and the mother reply -- have i satisfied myself by mention the matter only nineteen time i should have lose all my labor you see it be the twentieth time that crown the whole vi the church in the home the child at epworth be well ground in the observance of divine worship we may look in vain in the record of many family for anything so deep and so beautiful as that one thing which be tell of they -- that before they could kneel or speak the little one be teach to ask a blessing on they food by appropriate sign repeat as soon as they be able to articulate the lord 's prayer morning and evening they be encourage to add sentence of prayer of they own conceive petition for they parent and request for thing of they own earnest desire from this period in each case the parental eye be already carefully look forward to the time when the mind should begin to think for itself and to help they in this important matter mr wesley remember she own mental struggle prepare for she child a book of divinity write for they special edification in due time as the child grow a little older day of the week be allot to each of they for special opportunity of conversation with they mother as distinct from be catechise by she this be for the purpose of deal with doubt and difficulty of the well-recorded list of day and name the Thursday with jacky and Saturday with charle will mostly arrest the reader now these day come to be fondly treasured in the memory of all the child twenty year after john wesley have leave home it be touch to hear he say -- in many thing you have intercede for I and prevail who know but in this too -- a complete renunciation of the world -- you may be successful if you can spare I only that little part of Thursday evening which you formerly bestow upon I in another manner i doubt not it would be as useful now for correct my heart as it be then for form my judgment yet one more feature of mr wesley 's plan of education be that of the child 's appoint conversation with one another the eldest with the youngest the second eldest with the next in age and so on to this good purpose be devote the better space available in the room of the new rectory build after the fire vii struggle with poverty all this work of education intellectual and spiritual be conduct under severe pressure of poverty when mr wesley receive the living of epworth it cost he fifty pound to have the great seal affix to he title and to remove he family to the place this unfortunately be but a specimen of the hard condition under which he hold he cure lord oxford write to the celebrated dean swift solicit he name as a subscriber to mr wesley 's book on job -- the person concerned be a worthy honest man and by this work of he he be in hope to get free of a load of debt which have hang upon he some year this debt be not owe to any folly or extravagance of he but to the calamity of he house have be twice burnt which he be oblige to rebuild this be in short the case of a honest poor worthy clergyman and i hope you will take he under you protection a wealthy brother of mr wesley profess himself quite scandalise at the constant struggle of the family and do a little for the wipe away of the reproach but no more tell I mrs wesley whether you ever really want bread say the good archbishop sharp one day by way of preface to a very generous donation on the spot my lord be the reply i will freely own to you grace that strictly speak i never do want bread but then i have so much care to get it before it be eat and to pay for it after as have often make it very unpleasant to I and i think to have bread on such term be the next degree of wretchedness to have none at all all this thank god say mr wesley do not in the least sink my wife 's spirit she bear it with a courage which become she and which i expect from she mr wesley 's meditation on the matter carry with they a unchanging serenity of mind that man whose heart be penetrate with divine love and enjoy the manifestation of god 's blissful presence be happy let he outward condition be what it will this world this present state of thing be but for a time what be now future will be present as what be already past once be and then as pascal observe a little earth throw on we cold head will for ever determine we hope and condition nor will it signify much who personate the prince or the beggar since with respect to the exterior all must stand on the same level after death in a very dark hour she write : but even in this low ebb of fortune i be not without some kind intervalus adore and praise the unsearchable wisdom and boundless goodness of almighty god for this dispensation of he providence towards I for i clearly discern there be more of mercy in this disappointment of my hope than there would have be in permit I to enjoy all that i desire because it have give I a sight and sense of some sin which i have not before i would not have imagine i be in the least inclined to idolatry and covetousness and want of practical subjection to the will of god again the furnace of affliction which now seem so hot and terrible to nature have nothing more than a lambent flame which be not design to consume we but only to purge away we dross to purify and prepare the mind for its abode among those bless one that pass through the same trial before we into the celestial paradise how shall we then adore and praise what we can not here apprehend aright how will love and joy work in the soul but i can not express it i can not conceive it viii a new departure where the great religious movement of the last century in england be to be trace to any human influence the mother of john and charle wesley must have a large share of the sacred honor this will be find to fall to she by right not only on account of that profound religious education she impart to she child but also by reason of the peculiar direction which she give it even in respect of they first institution of assembly for the preaching of the gospel outside the wall of church or any state place of worship susanna wesley may be discover to have lead the way in the year 1711 during one of the protracted sojourning of mr wesley in london attend convocation and also do business with he publisher he place at the parish church be supply by a curate whose ministration be not particularly efficient although as may be judge from thing already tell the people of epworth be not likely to be very exacting however a notable reaction of feeling in favor of they minister have set in since the day of the fire and the parishioner be many of they quietly attentive to divine ordinance mr wesley without any pronounced hostility on she part toward the curate feel a deep echo of the popular complaint in she own soul divine service at church have be cut down to one diet in the morning and hence to save she child and servant from temptation of mere idleness the gifted mother feel herself call to set up a kind of service at the parsonage of this step she duly apprise she husband say : i can not but look upon every soul you leave under my care as a talent commit to I under a trust by the great lord of all the family of heaven and earth and if i be unfaithful to he or to you in neglect to improve those talent how shall i answer unto he when he shall command I to render a account of my stewardship as yet all she have do be read to and instruct she own family but the news of this spread in epworth and a hunger for the word arise the parent brother and sister of the servant drop in till the audience be about thirty or forty the service consist of praise prayer and reading of a short sermon at this time mr wesley 's mind be greatly stimulate by the account she have be peruse of the devoted labor of two danish missionary in indium she feel impel to do somewhat for christ conversation with the neighbor who have come to the parsonage-meeting shape itself into meeting of inquirer she now fall back upon the library in quest of more awakening sermon which be find among she husband 's stock of puritan author the attendance at the service now increase so as completely to fill the room at length some three or four person head by the curate write to the rector in london concern the doings of he wife and the danger of a conventicle mr wesley be sufficiently interested and apprehensive to write to she and ask what have be do and whether it do not look particular to this he wife rather glad to be challenge lose no time in reply and she write explanation to the head of the house and parish have result in we possess a ample account of the movement as to its look particular she say i grant it do and so do almost everything that be serious or that may any way advance the glory of god or the salvation of soul if it be perform out of a pulpit or in the way of common conversation after give various reason for she action she proceed : now i beseech you weigh all these thing in a impartial balance if you do after all think fit to dissolve this assembly do not tell I that you desire I to do it for that will not satisfy my conscience but send I you positive command in such full and express term as may absolve I from all guilt and punishment for the neglect this opportunity of do good when you and i shall appear before the great and awful tribunal of we lord jesus christ -lrb- illustration : s wesley -rrb- no wonder that all opposition on the part of the rector from this moment disappear and on return to he charge he find many sign of a happy change and that all thing be as if freshen under the dew of the blessing of god ix relation to she son susanna wesley be the life-long counsellor of she child amid those interesting conversation which be hold with each member of the family on appoint day and hour and which be frequently note in mr wesley 's private meditation we be arrest by the head of one of they -- son john -- and we learn that he become a communicant at the lord 's table at eight year of age this important step be take by reason of he great seriousness and of the sign of grace that be see in he he mother give we another striking glimpse of he in April 1712 when the scourge of small-pox attack five of the child -- jack bear he disease bravely like a man and indeed a christian without any complaint on recover he be through the influence of the duke of buckingham to whom he father be know send to charterhouse school but at this period there be little or nothing record of correspondence with he mother it be tolerably clear that the reason of this be that the boy be studious to a degree and need he father 's injunction to see to it that he take regular exercise in the garden the letter of mr wesley to she son be best represent by those address to samuel now twenty year of age after have distinguish himself at westminster school and win the special regard and friendship of those two eminent man bishop sprat and atterbury samuel repair to oxford follow the fashion of the time the youth have hitherto address he mother as dear madam he mother dislike the phrase but have wait till the change should be make spontaneously to dear mother which instantly evoke the response dear sammy -- i be much better pleased with the beginning of you letter than with that you use to send I for i do not love distance or ceremony there be more of love and tenderness in the name of _ mother _ than in all the complimentary title in the world you complain that you be unstable and inconstant in the way of virtue alas what christian be not so too i be sure that i above all other be most unfit to advise in such a case : yet since i love you as my own soul i will endeavor to do as well as i can admirable advice be then give as to choice of company with strictness yet with charity for we must take the world as we find it and the wholesome caution to beware lest the compare yourself with other may be a occasion of you fall into too much vanity and rather entertain such thought as these ` though i know my own birth and advantage yet how little do i know of the circumstance of other ' ` be they so solemnly devote to god at they birth as i be ' you have have the example of a father who serve god from he youth and though i can not commend my own to you for it be too bad to be imitate yet surely my earnest prayer for many year and some little good advice have not be want if still upon comparison you seem better than other be then ask yourself who it be that make you differ : and let god have all the praise i be straiten for paper and time therefore must conclude god almighty bless you and preserve you from all evil adieu susanna wesley it be a striking fact that mr wesley 's letter to she son john be for the most part concern he secular affair the inference be not remote that as regard he spiritual welfare john wesley appear to he mother at all time to be in a satisfactory condition at one time he press she for a opinion on thomas à kempis and receive a elaborate answer at once philosophical and theological in the course of which the remark be make -- i take à kempi to have be a honest weak man with more zeal than knowledge by he condemn all mirth or pleasure as sinful or useless in opposition to so many plain and direct text of scripture ` tis stupid to say nothing be a affliction to a good man nor do i understand how any man can thank god for present misery yet do i know very well what it be to rejoice in the midst of deep affliction not in the affliction itself for then it would cease to be one but in this we may rejoice that we be in the hand of a god who have promise that all thing shall work together for good for the spiritual and eternal good of those that love he evidently it be from a unshaken soul the conclude word of the letter proceed -- you brother have bring we a heavy reckoning for you and charle god be merciful to we all much earnest and deeply discriminative advice be give to john on occasion of he enter the holy ministry the letter then write to he abound with trace of the fact that he have be in the habit of confide much of he mind to he mother through those year in 1727 she write to he a profound and beautiful epistle in term which indicate that he have make she he _ confidante _ at the time in he love for a young lady whom he have lately meet in worcestershire what then be love oh how shall we describe its strange mysterious essence it be -- i do not know what a powerful something source of we joy and grief feel and experience by every one and yet unknown to all nor shall we ever comprehend what it be till we be unite to we first principle and there read its wondrous nature in the clear mirror of uncreated love : another letter belong to the same year be solemnly prospective the topic be evidently the care of the world ` believe I youth -lrb- for i be read in care and bend beneath the weight of more than fifty year -rrb- ' believe I old age be the worst time we can choose to mend either we life or we fortune ah my dear son do you with I stand on the verge of life and see before you

she die look reply and lamb-like as she lord she die xiii conclusion the title founder of methodism humanly speak must be share between mother and son to many mind this will seem to have be a question settle by the action of mr wesley at epworth but she part in the matter show a deepen beauty from the first in fulfilment of the word of she journal concern john with special reference to he remarkable rescue from the fire i do intend to be more particularly careful of the soul of this child that thou hast so mercifully provide for when at college he and he brother with they young companion owe to they living by rule first win the name of methodist amid sneer and persecution he mother cheer he on at that juncture subsequently when he be in a state of hesitancy as to enter the holy ministry and he father have encourage the idea of delay he mother say the sooner you be a deacon the better -- and break the spell of what might have be a fatal backwardness on that evening at aldersgate street 24th may 1738 so memorable in the spiritual history of methodism when john wesley stand up in he newly-found fulness of the assurance of grace and encounter much sharp rebuke on the spot he have be well fortified beforehand with he mother 's sympathy say she be glad he have get into such a just way of think she also see eye to eye with he in he position in the controversy between calvinism and arminianism the beginning of lay-preaching date as we have see from she support of thoma maxfield and the lead feature of the mode of preach which john wesley recommend to he follower may be find long before in he mother 's counsel to himself -- to avoid nice distinction in public assembly -- to exalt christ and the work of the spirit here you may give free scope to you soul and discourse without reserve as he spirit give you utterance well do she son call she in she measure and degree a preacher of righteousness so shine the bright light of susanna wesley all along the upbuilding of that great christian society which bear the name of she son she example must surely also be of special value at the present day when alike in the church and in the world the place of woman rise in importance and the demand be for further opportunity of usefulness for the life of this gifted and saintly woman be characterise by a modesty that be above criticism and at the same time show no lack of the greatness of power and achievement in the work of the lord jame cunningham ma mr heman mr heman be fully entitle to a place in the rank of excellent woman not only on account of she personal character but also on account of the work she do -- a work remove from the stunning tide but not the less effectual there be no doubt that mr heman exert a distinct influence and make a distinct impression on the national character she leave the world unmistakably better for she have live in it many do not realize what great abiding result flow from she work and one chief way in which she be productive of so much good to she race be this : she raise the standard of popular poetry raise it at a time when it sadly need raise to a higher level and tone though she write so much and in a age when byron be the favorite poet of englishman not a line leave she pen that indicate anything but a spotless and habitually lofty mind it be no mean achievement to establish the popularity of a poetry which be by its purity a rebuke to much that have hitherto pass current and receive applause how well she succeed in accomplish the end which as we learn in that beautiful piece of hers a poet 's die hymn she have set before herself and other who give expression to they thought in verse and if thy spirit on thy child have shed the gift the vision of the unsealed eye to pierce the mist o'er life 's deep meaning spread to reach the hidden fountain-urn that lie far in man 's heart -- if i have keep it free and pure a consecration unto thee i bless thee o my god \* \* \* \* \* not for the brightness of a mortal wreath not for a place ` midst kingly minstrel dead but that perchance a faint gale of thy breath a still small whisper in my song have lead one struggle spirit upward to thy throne or but one hope one prayer -- for this alone i bless thee o my god many a straggler in life 's perplexity find sympathy and help in the sweet verse of this poetess they feel that there be one struggle by they side one who could rest on god 's promise and could almost insensibly weave link for intercourse with god i early day felicium dorothea browne be bear in duke street liverpool on the 25th of September 1793 she be the second daughter and the fourth child of a family of three son and three daughter she father who be a native of ireland be a merchant of good position

repeat page of poetry from she favorite author after have read they over but once on one occasion to satisfy the incredulity of one of she brother she learn by heart the whole of heber 's poem of europe contain four hundred and twenty-four line in a hour and twenty minute she repeat it without a single mistake or a moment 's hesitation long piece of both prose and poetry she would often recite after have twice glance over they this power of memory stand she in good stead in she later life when physical weakness prevent she from write down what she have compose she thought have to be retain in she mind and then dictate when felicium browne be about eleven year old she spend the winter in london with she father and mother but this visit have not the charm for she that it have for most young people she see nothing in the metropolis to compensate for the loss of the country the sight and scene of the busy throng be not so congenial as the sight and scene of the quiet little welsh home she long to rejoin she younger brother and sister in they favorite rural haunt and amusement -- the nutting wood the beloved apple-tree the old arbor with its swing the post-office tree in whose trunk a daily interchange of letter be establish the pool where fairy-ship be launch -lrb- generally paint and decorate by herself -rrb- and dearer still the fresh free ramble on the seashore or the mountain ` expedition ' to the signal station or the roman encampment town party and town conventionality have little in they to gain favor in the eye of this bonnie free country lass not that she do not sometimes derive pleasure from the sight she be take to especially be she impress by she visit to some of the great work of art on enter a gallery of sculpture she involuntarily exclaim oh hush :

she poem be publish the earliest of these early composition be write when she be only eight year of age the volume of poem appear in 1808 perhaps it would have be a more judicious course on the part of she friend if they have prevent they from appear the young girl of fourteen year be by she youth ill-fitted to face the criticism of the literary world at this time there come across she path the person whose name she be afterwards to bear -- captain heman of the king 's own regiment he be on a visit in the neighborhood of gwyrch and soon become a intimate friend in the family which contain felicium amongst its member before he be call upon to embark with he regiment for spain a impression have be create which three year ' absence do not efface on either side the friend of both party

call there be now on she as she marriage be not altogether a happy one she have to arrange the education of she child how well she train they not only in temporal wisdom but in the highest of all wisdom many evidence show we may anticipate and insert a anecdote of one of she boy at the age of eleven she have be read to he lord byron 's magnificent address to the sea : -- roll on thou deep and dark-blue ocean roll he listen with breathless attention and at the close break out with these word -- it be very grand indeed -- but how much finer it would have be mamma if he have say at the close that god have measure out all those water with the hollow of he hand on another occasion she be explain to she eight-year-old boy the meaning of the title of a story he be read the atheist he argument be real and ready : not believe in a god mamma who do he expect make the world and he own body iv work and friend the plentiful contribution from she pen be become increasingly popular and it may be add increasingly useful there be no doubt that she be a distinct moral power for good as almost every one think that he or she can compose poetry and that better than other it often happen that in a prize poem competition there be no lack of person ready to enter the list so it be when a patriotic scotchman offer a prize of # 50 for the best poem on the meeting of wallace and bruce the number of competitor be astounding and the mass of matter send in overwhelming one production be as long as paradise lose quality prevail over quantity and the award be make to mr heman this be not the only occasion on which she be adjudge the prize in a competition in 1821 she obtain that award by the royal society of literature for the best poem on dartmoor one of she poem which be destine to be almost more useful than any of the other be the sceptic a reviewer 's testimony to the elevate influence of the work after complain of the grave defect in some of the most popular writer of the day in that they be not sufficiently attentive to the moral dignity of the performance conclude with this encomium on mr heman ' work : -- with the promise of talent not inferior to any and far superior to most of they the author before we be not only free from every stain but breathe all moral beauty and loveliness and it will be a memorable coincidence if the era of a woman 's sway in literature shall become co-eval with the return of its moral purity and elevation a more gratifying testimony to the worth of the sceptic be give in a visit of a stranger to mr heman it occur many year after the sceptic be publish indeed a very short time before she death the visitor be tell that she be unable to see he as she be only just recover from a illness he entreat for a few minute ' interview with such importunity that it be grant to he on he admission he explain with the utmost feeling that the object of he visit be to acknowledge the deepest debt of obligation that to she he owe in the first instance that faith and those hope which be now more precious to he than life itself for that it be by read she poem of ` the sceptic ' he have be first awaken from the miserable delusion of infidelity and induce to ` search the scripture ' this be not the only time she receive a comforting assurance of this kind with regard to the poem the warm friendship of the bishop of st asaph dr luxmoore be a great boon to mr heman he be always ready with he advice and he support and she find they of singular benefit in she comparatively lonely position the bishop 's palace be like a second home there she and she child be always welcome of like value be the friendship of another who be also destine to have a place on the episcopal bench reginald heber be a frequent visitor at the residence of he father-in-law the dean of st asaph he soon become deeply interested in the welfare of mr heman she find in he one whose counsel especially in literary matter be of the utmost value he suggestion and encouragement supply just what she want any one who read he hint with regard to she contemplated poem superstition and revelation will know how full and painstaking be the trouble he take to assist he friend the design of the poem to which reference have just be make be a grand one it be best describe in she own word : might not a poem of some extent and importance if the execution be at all equal to the design be produce from contrast the spirit and tenet of paganism with those of christianity it would contain of course much classical allusion and all the graceful and sportive fiction of ancient greece and italy as well as the superstition of more barbarous clime might be introduce to prove how little consolation they could convey in the hour of affliction or hope in that of death many scene from history might be portray in illustration of this idea and the certainty of a future state and of the immortality of the soul which we derive from revelation be surely subject for poetry of the highest class the poem be commence but never complete it be press out by other undertaking v the home in wale mr heman find peculiar pleasure in reading and speak german i be so delighted she write when i meet with any one who know and love my favorite _ scelenvolle _ -lrb- full of soul -rrb- german that i believe i could talk of it for ever she sister remark that she knowledge of the language seem almost as if it have be bear with she the poetess could write humorous prose as well as serious verse some of she letter write in 1822 give a very amusing description of the inconvenience she have to put up with whilst certain alteration be be make at bronwylfa she describe how at last she be drive to seek refuge in the laundry from which classical locality she be wont to say it could be no wonder if sadly _ mangled _ line be to issue i entreat you to pity I i be actually in the melancholy situation of lord byron 's ` scorpion girt by fire ' -- she circle narrow as she go -- for i have be pursue by the household troops through every room successively and begin to think of establish my _ métier _ in the cellar though i dare say if i be to fix myself as comfortably in a hogshead as diogene himself it would immediately be discover that some of the hoop or stave want repair there be a war of old grate with new grate and plaster and paint with dust and cobweb carry on in this once tranquil abode with a vigor and animosity productive of little less din than that occasion by ` lance to lance and horse to horse ' i assure you when i make my escape about ` fall of eve ' to some of the green quiet hayfield by which we be surround and look back at the house which from a little distance seem almost like shakespeare 's moonlight to ` sleep upon the bank ' i can hardly conceive how so gentle-looking a dwelling can continue to send forth such a incessant clatter of obstreperous sound through its honeysuckle-fringed window it really remind I of a pretty shrew whose amiable smile would hardly allow a casual observer to suspect the possibility of so fair a surface be occasionally ruffle by storm the lyric the voice of spring be write in 1823 it be follow by breathing of spring the season of spring have a marked influence upon she it be with all its joy and beauty generally a time of thoughtfulness rather than mirth it have be well observe that autumn in one way be a more joyous time than spring it remind we that we shall go to they while in spring everything seem to say they will not return to we but what awakest thou in the _ heart _ o spring the human heart with all its dream and sigh thou that givest back so many a bury thing restorer of forget harmony fresh song and scent break forth where'er thou art -- what wakest thou in the heart too much oh then too much we know not well wherefore it should be thus yet rouse by thee what fond strange yearning from the soul 's deep cell gush for the face we no more may see how be we lament in the wind 's low tone by voice that be go in 1825 there appear one of she principal work -- the one she consider as almost if not altogether the best -- _ the forest sanctuary _ it related to the suffering of a spanish protestant in the time of philip ii and be suppose to be narrate by the sufferer himself who escape with he child to a north american forest the picture of the burial at sea be the passage of whose merit she have the highest opinion vi mother and daughter another change of home take place in 1825 the new home be not more than a quarter of a mile from the old one rhyllon could be see from the window of bronwylfa it be a very different house the former be describe as a tall stare brick house almost destitute of tree the latter as a perfect bower of rose peep out like a bird 's - nest from amidst the foliage in which it be embosome the contrast be playfully depict in a dramatic scene between bronwylfa and rhyllon the former after stand for some time in silent contemplation of rhyllon break out into the follow vehement strain of vituperation : -- you ugliest of fabric you horrible eyesore i wish you would vanish or put on a vizor in the face of the sun without cover or rag on you stand and outstare I like any red dragon and so on through many amusing and spirited line show the lighter side of the authoress 's character she sister describe this part of she life as perhaps the happiest of all and this be produce to a great extent by she see the happiness of other especially that of she boy she be always ready to join they in they ramble and they sport the morning be spend in the instruction of she child then in answer countless letter and satisfy the demand of impatient editor and this do she would revel in the enjoyment of fresh air soft wind and bright blue sky she write make I or dispose I to be a sad idler for this reason she delight in the rigor of winter as be most conducive to literary productiveness a heavy sorrow be overshadow this happy home between mr heman and she mother there be the strongest bond of affection in she poem there may be trace the intensity of this love it be find in the simple line on my mother 's birthday when the child be only eight year old and after incidentally appear in many a poem it be show in all its intensity in the hymn by the sick-bed of a mother father that in the olive shade when the dark hour come on didst with a breath of heavenly aid strengthen thy son oh by the anguish of that night send we down blest relief or to the chasten let thy might hallow this grief and if the flame of passionate affection shine out in the time of fear and impend sorrow no less be it see after the dread hour have come what beauty there be in the line entitle the charmed picture : -- sweet face that o'er my childhood shine whence be thy power of change thus ever shadow back my own the rapid and the strange whence be they charm -- those earnest eye i know the mystery well in mine own tremble bosom lie the spirit of the spell -lrb- illustration : edna heman -rrb- this mother patiently bear sickness for eight month and then pass away something of what this blow mean to the loving daughter may be gather from she letter but she know where true comfort be to be find and in allude to the word of another set forth the divine consolation she say this be surely the language of real consolation how different from that which attempt to soothe we by general remark on the common lot the course of nature or even by dwelling on the release of the depart from pain and trial it be not surprising that she health for a long time delicate now show sign of a alarming nature she often have a complete prostration of strength succeed by a wonderful reaction vii removal from wale the place of mr heman in the literary world be establish as might be expect friendship be form with those who have taste in common amongst the number be miss baillie miss mitford mr howitt miss jewsbury and dean milman from she friend she seek sympathy rather than praise always appreciative of word of encouragement she give back good exchange in the artless way into which she enter into the pursuit of she correspondent she health continue to give great anxiety to she friend and matter be not improve by the unconquerable dislike of the patient to the adoption of the necessary precaution and remedy

strain of music whilst lie in the twilight under the infliction of a blister in 1828 she publish the _ record of woman _ the work into which she say she have put she heart and individual feeling more than in anything else she have write one verse amongst many other indicate the pressure put upon she feeble frame by the intensity of she activity of mind yet i have know it long too restless and too strong within this clay have be the o'ermaster flame swift think that come and go like torrent o'er I send have shake as a reed my thrilling frame a severe trial be at hand the home must again be change and the beloved wale leave the marriage of she sister and the appointment of she brother to a official post be the immediate cause in which direction should she turn she step with most advantage the choice be determine by the consideration that at wavertree near liverpool she have several attach friend that there she would meet with advantage for the education of she boy and also with more literary communion for herself the wrench from the land of she childhood she home and she dead be a hard one she write tell she friend how she literally cover she face all the way from bronwylfa until she boy tell she they have pass the clwyd range of hill then she feel that something of the bitterness be over the sound of thy stream in my spirit i bear farewell and a blessing be

land of my home and my dead she love for the people of wale be not a unreciprocated love many of they rush forward to touch the post of the gate through which the poetess have pass and when three year later she pay a visit to st asaph come and weep over she and entreat she to make she home among they again viii waveeteee wavertree have its advantage but it certainly have its disadvantage too she be bring into a scene where all she precious time might have be absorb in the triviality of society she be overwhelm with offer of service and mark of courtesy all the gaiety of a large town be open to

the predominant sensation would partake of awe and rapture and that the person visit must thenceforward and for ever be inevitably separate from this world and its concern -- that the soul which have

riches and i be die of hunger close by a table spread and a continual feast o beauty ancient and new why have i know thee so late alas i seek thee where thou wast not and do not seek thee where thou

tendency to wander into region of spiritual imagination the liking for strong dramatic expression which though not in themselves blamable yet give to the outside world and even to those about she who be open to adverse prepossession false impression as to the depth and reality of she religion they close at hand could not make the allowance which we can easily make for the extravagance of a soul which have just emerge from the prison gloom of depression and distrust into this realisation of the divine love and favor when she enthusiastic spirit lead she to subject herself to the severest penance she joy in they infliction and could not make they severe enough and here at once come out prominently a primary error of judgment in this good woman at the very outset of she christian life she give we detail of a specially disgusting penance which she inflict on herself in this as in the rest of she self-imposed torture and degradation the impulse manifestly come not from above but from the mistaken imagining of a over-wrought mind encase in a frail and delicate frame and these morbid fancy be base on she intense passion for self-abasement we must remember that at this critical time when she most needed counsel she have really no one to guide she -- no one that be who possess spiritual wisdom and common sense though madame guyon be much absorb in a mystical ecstasy which she describe as prayer without word or even thought she be no mere visionary she love to god she intense devotion to she savior lead she to earnest endeavor to do good to those around she the poor and the

exceptional qualification for this missionary work just over twenty year of age she youthful beauty and grace the tender yearning love which light up she expressive feature the ready utterance and sweet voice and the charm of manner which never leave she be no unfitting media to convey the tiding of mercy to many a benighted seeker after rest and peace iv affliction and gloom at this time she find great benefit from the counsel of she friend geneviève granger the prioress of the benedictine convent who encourage she in she determination to avoid all conformity to the world and to live wholly to god she once more make progress in the divine life and the trial which now come thickly upon she be the means of blessing she soul with increase of purity and peace hers be no light trial besides the constant annoyance from she implacable mother-in-law and the ill-tempered behavior of she husband heavy affliction befall she the terrible small-pox attack she and spoil she beautiful face though it leave she alive she cruel mother-in-law instead of tenderly nurse she basely neglect she debar she from medical attendance and imperil she life the loss of she beauty alienate she husband 's

spiritual marriage cross contempt confusion disgrace and ignominy and i pray he to give I grace to entertain disposition of littleness and nothingness with regard to everything else though we can not consider such covenant in general as wise in themselves nor this one in particular as appropriate in its language yet for a time it seem to give greater strength to she holy resolution and increase stability to she pious frame of mind but about eighteen month afterwards she fall into a state of depression or absence of joy which last nearly six year -lrb- footnote :1 _ la vie de madame guyon _ première partie ch xix 10 -rrb- probably this state of privation as she term it be in great measure the result of physical cause she have for many year try she bodily strength to the utmost by she severe self-denying treatment of herself and now the death of she intimate friend the above-mentioned geneviève granger no doubt exercise a lowering effect on she spirit it be a testing time for she faith and it be a signal proof of the depth and reality of she piety that through all this try season she hold fast she trust in god and keep on she way though uncheered for a time by the joyous emotion with which she have so long be favor it be well that she mind which have be overtax and strain by the intensity of she religious fervor and by its unbroken continuity of introspection should be bring into a more healthful state by this bitter tonic of joylessness in 1676 she husband 's health never very good completely break down and after a long illness he die leave she at the age of twenty-eight a widow with three child as the solemn hour of parting draw near she sweep away all the wretched interference which have help to cloud the happiness of they married life and kneel by he bed she beg he to forgive anything she have do amiss the better nature of the man now at length prevail and he say -- what he have never say before -- it be i who ask pardon of you i do not deserve you : which be perfectly true he leave a large amount of property but he affair be in a perplexing state of entanglement and he young widow unused to business have to do she best to make all straight she prove equal to the occasion and soon with she quick perception and uncommon power of direction and persuasion she reduce the complicated tangle to order and then retire to a house of she own where she be free from the annoying device of she irreconcilable mother-in-law and could devote herself to the education of she child the perfecting of she own education and the visitation of the sick and poor it be in 1680 after nearly seven year of comparative darkness and depression that she spiritual gloom be break in upon by a letter from father la combe in which he take the sensible view that by this sore deprivation god be teach she not to lean on she state of feeling but to look to he alone for comfort and strength on the 22nd of July -- a day several time mark in she history as one of signal blessing -- she prayer be hear and god again lift up the light of he countenance upon she on that happy day she write my soul be fully deliver from all its distress it begin a new life a life of steady peace and joy guard from dependence on the joy itself by the painful experience from which she have just emerge from this time forth she devote she life to the spread of the knowledge of the love of god after much deliberation and consultation with other she leave paris in July 1681 to commence work in the south-east of france the precede winter have be pass in make necessary preparation in relieve the necessity of the famished poor of pari and in other work of charity v she public work on that July morning when madame guyon embark on the seine secretly for fear of the interference of she half-brother she be really embark on the chief business of she life the work of spread the doctrine of inward holiness she have feel draw to the district of geneva by a desire to give temporal and spiritual help to the poor people at the foot of the jura range and now have consult at paris the bishop of geneva she be make she way in company with she little daughter a nun and two servant to the little town of gex pass through annecy and geneva she reach she destination on July 23 and take up she residence at the house of the sister of charity this be for a time the center of she labor of love besides she work of charity she feel impel to tell other of the spiritual blessing which she herself enjoy situate as she be a protestant without herself suspect it and that in the very heart of the roman catholic church a devout reader of the bible and one who value the ministration of priest as adviser and confessor rather than as transact the penitent 's own work for he she superior intelligence and she happy art of carry conviction to the listener raise the jealousy of the clergy just as she pure life be a silent rebuke to all lax liver whether monk nun or priest d'aranthon the bishop have welcome she to he diocese and at first receive she doctrine with appreciative favor but he be a man easily persuade sway by the last person who talk to he and as she opinion become more pronounced he begin to perceive that they be dangerous to the stability of the corrupt priest-ridden church of which he be a overseer he have appoint father la combe as madame guyon 's director she spiritual guide and instructor but in practice the position be reverse and it be she who lead la combe into higher region of thought and experience of which he soon become the eloquent exponent la combe 's preach attract great attention at thonon on the other side of the lake of geneva and the bishop be anxious lest these new doctrine should spread and he himself should get into trouble at rome on they account he now want to circumscribe madame guyon 's sphere of influence by get she to become prioress of a convent at gex he evidently think that by have she here under some restraint and by keep she close to the duty of the cloister he would be able to put a stop to the propagation of she heretical opinion but though she give a little too much heed to vision and dreamy imagining she have lose no whit of the practical common-sense and clearness of sight which have distinguish she in many mundane emergency she absolutely refuse to make over she property for the good of the sisterhood and would not undertake a office which would shut she up from she mission of proclaim far and wide as the divine hand open the way the message of the savior 's love and the holy spirit 's sanctify power this refusal bring much persecution and annoyance both to herself and to father la combe who have manfully refuse to obey the bishop when he order he to use he influence in make madame guyon comply with he express wish a party be now form at gex specially for the persecution of madame guyon and after much annoyance and suffer she feel she be providentially call to leave a town where she have many disciple whose life she have be the means of brighten and elevate in the spring of 1682 she cross the lake of geneva to thonon where she pursue the same missionary career and be the means of raise up a little church of believer in the midst of dense bigotry and superstition she never preach in public but in private she converse and pray with individual seeker after salvation and at time have conference with several together in a small room by these means and by she excellent letter she effect a amazing amount of good in all that region for a time a short and happy time all go rightly but she know only too well that persecution must ensue it could not but come to this good woman who devoutly fulfil what she esteem to be the lawful command of she church but who take as she highest authority and director the open bible explain not by priest or friar but by the holy ghost work upon she own acute intellect and devout heart it be worthy of notice that under she guidance several small society or community be form by poor girl who have become decide christian these young people help each other in secular matter and hold little meeting for reading and prayer and loving fellowship they association be soon break up by the priestly party as indeed be to be expect the girl be deprive of ordinary church privilege and some of they be drive out of thonon altogether another indication of the rise tide of persecution be that the dominant party order all book relate to the inner life to be bring to they and publicly burnt in the market-place the few which be give up at length through the influence of she enemy madame guyon receive from the bishop notice that she must go out of he diocese and father la combe be similarly warn to depart all espostulation be in vain and leave savoy in which she labor have be so much bless she set out on a wearisome journey into piedmont cross the perilous mont ceni on a mule and come to turin in spite of many annoyance she have spend two happy year at thonon in work for she divine master and she would have be more than human if she have not feel though in a spirit of sweet resignation the wrench which these frequent change of habitation inflict no wonder that she call to mind the pathetic word in matthew viii 20 : the fox have hole and the bird of the air have nest but the son of man have not where to lay he head this she write -lrb- 1 -rrb- i have since experience to its full extent have have no sure abode where i could remain more than a few month and every day in uncertainty where i should be on the morrow and besides find no refuge either among my friend who be ashamed of I and openly renounce I just when there be a outcry against I or among my relation most of whom have declare themselves my adversary and be my greatest persecutor while the other look on I with contempt and indignation -lrb- footnote 1 : _ la vie _ seconde partie ch xiv 1 -rrb- at turin she find temporary refuge and rest in the house of the marchioness of prunaus but appear to have spend only a few month of 1684 in that city she long to return to evangelistic work in france accordingly in the autumn she go to grenoble and have great success in she labor but through the hatred of she enemy be oblige to quit the place secretly leave she little daughter in charge of she faithful maid la gautière she have already commence authorship at thonon by write during a interval of much-needed rest she book entitle _ spiritual torrent _ at grenoble she begin she commentary on _ the holy bible _ and here she publish she famous work _ a short and very easy method of prayer _ which speedily run through several edition so by word of mouth and by pen she teach and the new spirit of religious inquiry as she call it spread and prevail it be indeed the _ old _ spirit of inquiry as old as the day of the apostle and its basis be the principle which she clearly enunciate that man be a sinner and that he must be save by repentance and faith in christ and that faith in god through christ subsequently be and must be the foundation of the inward life such a bold proclamation of gospel truth could not but rouse the anger of the clerical party at grenoble the persuasive missioner be soon the center of a storm of wrath and indignation which the friendly bishop camus afterwards a cardinal be unable to allay early in 1686 she leave grenoble for marseille where she hope to find refuge for a while but she fame have precede she i do not arrive in marseille she record till ten in the morning and it be only a few hour after

labor unaware of the king 's despotic intolerance she arrive in the french capital on July 22 1686 after a absence of five year and soon become the center of a enlighten circle of friend of high rank who be glad to listen to she teaching and to learn the way of the lord more perfectly for a while all be quiet but she enemy -- among whom she half-brother père la mothe be ever the most virulent -- be meantime very busy and at length a charge be lay against she before the king she be seize by warrant of a _ lettre de cachet _ and consign to solitary imprisonment in the convent of sainte marie in the suburb of st antoine loui xiv be now pose as a defender of the faith and be glad to show he catholic zeal in the punishment of a lady who be say to hold opinion similar to those of molino whom he have recently induce the pope to condemn nearly four month previously she eloquent disciple father la combe have be commit to the bastille for life vi in prison on January 29 1688 -- the first month of a year specially dear to english lover of civil and religious liberty -- madame guyon be take to she cell in sainte marie it be a room in a upper story of the convent with a bar door and a opening for light and air on one side here she be shut up from she friend she gaoler a crabbed hard-hearted nun who treat she with the greatest rigor regard she not only as a heretic but as a hypocrite and out of she sens as well feeble in body and in bad health she mind be much trouble about she beloved daughter whom interested person be try to force into a marriage of which madame guyon strongly disapprove but though under harsh treatment she become very ill and be nigh unto death she peace and joy prove they heavenly origin by unbroken continuance in this try season as she recover she find occupation in write she autobiography and in compose hymn and sacred poem amongst the latter be the charming _ cantique _ give at the end of she life and beginning -- grand dieu pour ton plaisir je suis dans une cage which have be happily english as follow : -- a little bird i be shut from the field of air and in my cage i sit and sing to he who place I there well please a prisoner to be because my god it please thee nought have i else to do i sing the whole day long and he whom well i love to please doth listen to my song he catch and bind my wander wing but still he bend to hear I sing thou hast a ear to hear a heart to love and bless and though my note be e'er so rude thou would ` st not hear the less because thou knowest as they fall that love sweet love inspire they all my cage confines I round abroad i can not fly but though my wing be closely bind my heart 's at liberty my prison wall can not control the flight the freedom of the soul oh it be good to soar these bolt and bar above to he whose purpose i adore whose providence i love and in thy mighty will to find the joy the freedom of the mind she liberation from this imprisonment come from a remarkable quarter madame de miramion a pious lady often visit the convent with charitable intent have hear much about madame guyon she ask to see she and have see she and converse with she she soon become she warm friend and plead she cause with madame de maintenon who be now at the height of she power and possess supreme influence with the king whose wife she have become by a private marriage in 1685 madame de miramion have in this way procure madame guyon 's release from she convent prison take she to she own house it be a happy change for this much-tried woman she be once again among friend and have the society of she daughter she go to st cyr -- a royal institution for the education of the daughter of the poorer aristocracy in which madame de maintenon take interest -- to thank the great lady for she kindness the latter be charm with the bright saintly ex-prisoner whose devout spirit shine out in she countenance and breathe in she fascinating speech she have many conversation with she and beg she to give instruction to the girl of st cyr it be at this time that madame guyon first meet the great fénelon who be a director of st cyr as well as one of the most note character of the age she win he lasting regard he be cheer by the warmth of she piety and she unwavering faith while he more logical and better disciplined mind would no doubt moderate and tone down she excess of introspection and rapt emotion she spend three happy year in pari consult by many person on religious matter admire and honor by several distinguished people and sheltered from storm in the house of she daughter now marry to the count de vaux but the sunshine be not to last long godet madame de maintenon 's confessor and one of the director of st cyr be possess with a jealous hatred of he co-director fénelon and also dislike madame guyon breathing into the mind of the great lady -- who though of huguenot descent be nothing if not orthodox -- doubt as to madame guyon 's correctness of belief he cause madame de maintenon to withdraw she countenance from she _ protégée _ and to discontinue she own visit to st cyr now be the time for madame guyon 's enemy to attack she when they see the court favorite 's countenance withdraw a attempt be make to poison she and so far succeed that she health be impaired for many year then bossuet appear on the scene in September 1693 he come to see she in pari feeling doubtless that he be the man to settle all these pietistic commotion at madame guyon 's request he consent to examine she numerous writings and when in the course of some month he have perform this task and have also peruse she m autobiography he have another long conversation with she which bring out fully the peculiarity of she doctrine in this interesting discussion he seem to have adopt a bully tone somewhat incompatible with he remarkably mild christian name jacque _ bénigne _ and to have forget the courtesy due to a lady who whatever she error might be in he eye be one of the brightest light and purest saint in the roman catholic church of that day finally the matter become a affair of state and the king appoint a commission to sit at issy upon she orthodoxy -- bossuet de noailles and tronson the two latter be charm with she mild and teachable spirit but the fierce bossuet be not yet satisfied and as she put herself under he special direction for a time he consign she to a convent at meaux and at length require she to sign certain doctrinal article and a decree condemn she book to this last however a qualify clause be append to the effect that she have never intend to say anything contrary to the spirit of the church not know that any other meaning could be give to she word in fact while concede to she church the right to condemn whatever it do not approve in she tenet she hold much the same position as galileo when he theory as to the movement of we planet be condemn as heretical and he cap he enforced retractation with the quiet protest _ e pur si muove _ in she letter to she three ecclesiastical judge date in August 1694 she courageously tell they i pray you my lord to remember that i be a ignorant woman that i have write my experience in all good faith and that if i have explain myself badly it be the result of my ignorance as regard the experience _ they be real _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ la vie _ troisième partie ch xvi 6 -rrb- bossuet at length appear to be satisfied and give she a certificate of she filial submissiveness to the roman catholic faith and she think herself free to return to pari it be not perhaps the wisest step to take the bishop be displeased at it as be also the bigoted madame de maintenon madame guyon go to live in privacy in a small house in the faubourg st antoine where she hope to be leave in peace but she enemy get scent of she hiding-place arrest she and shut she up in the castle of vincenne whence after a few week at vaugirard she be transfer to the bastille of she life in this famous prison we have little or no detail like all its unfortunate inmate she be forbid to reveal its secret but we gather from she own word that amid sickness and the many hardship of she prison life one of she severest trial be find in the rumor which reach she of the horrible outcry outside the wall against herself and she sympathiser but in this dark season she hold fast she confidence in god and she spirit find utterance and relief in some of those song full of love and trust which be include in the four volume of she poetical work vii last year she be confine in the bastille for four year and when at last in 1702 she be release she health be completely ruin by the privation she have suffer the bitter cold of winter and in the warmer weather the poisonous exhalation from the stagnant water of the moat when once more she issue into the sweet air of liberty my afflict spirit she say begin to breathe and recover itself but my body be from that time sick and bear down with all sort of infirmity even now however she be not free to go where she like after a brief visit to she daughter in paris she be require to take up she residence at blois a hundred mile south-west and there in complete retirement she spend she remaining day still write cheery word of counsel to she disciple in france and other land and enjoy spell of happy converse with the steadfast friend who seek she out in she exile she live on in peace and quiet though often in pain and weakness for fifteen year after she release from the bastille she final release from all earthly trial and sorrow take place on June 9 1717 when she have enter about three month into she seventieth year that she beautiful spirit of resignation be maintain to the last and that she faith be pure and steadfast we have proof in these expression in she will write a short time before she death : thou knowest that there be nothing in heaven or in earth that i desire but thee alone in thy hand o god i leave my soul not rely for my salvation on any good that be in I but solely on thy mercy and the merit and suffering of my lord jesus christ we find here no trace of that reliance on the virgin mary or that frequent clamouring for she interest and intercession which then form and still form so integral a portion of the daily routine of romish worship it be a remarkable feature of madame guyon 's religious life that in a idolatrous age she faith constantly soar straight up to god ignore the mediation of the virgin and the saint and regard the priest themselves not as intermediary between christ and she soul but simply as she appoint counsellor and guide on the road to heaven we need not wonder that such bitterness be show towards she and that no effort be spare to suppress teaching so dangerous to the very foundation of the ancient edifice of error viii she teaching on a previous page i have give extract from she autobiography which show pretty plainly the mistake into which madame guyon fall at the outset of she christian career they have they root in the idea that she communion with god be so close and intimate that all she thought be not merely devout and god-ward but even divine come direct from god so she fall into the quietist error of intense introspection look for guidance not solely to the write word but chiefly to she own inward impression or inspiration as she consider they to be but be it at all wonderful that this good woman bring up in the bondage of corrupt doctrine and deeply-incrusted prejudice should entertain some theological error the only wonder be that she attain so much of the truth and in that age of mingled intolerance and licentiousness live a life of purity and charity of holy aspiration and devout performance and though she excessive introspection be not at all to be imitate and many of she view be such as we with we greater light can not of course endorse yet she mistake in metaphysics and in theology do not affect the beauty of she life which be chiefly spend in act of charity and earnest endeavor to spread the knowledge of she lord and savior if she benevolent effort at evangelisation do not always show the successful result she desire if disappointment crowd some of she later year yet to she case we can rightly apply the word of the poet : yet to the faithful there be no such thing as disappointment failure only bring a gentle pang as peacefully they say ` he purpose stand though mine have pass away ' she work amount in all to forty volume be publish in paris in several edition she _ poem and spiritual song _ occupy four volume some of these simple utterance of a devout heart be beautifully translate by cowper and with one of the most characteristic of these rendering this sketch may fitly be conclude : -- the entire surrender peace have unveil she smile face and woo thy soul to she embrace enjoy with ease if thou refrain from earthly love else seek in vain she dwell with all who truth prefer but seek not they who seek not she yield to the lord with simple heart all that thou hast and all thou art renounce all strength but strength divine and peace shall be for ever thine behold the path which i have tread my path till i go homo to god william nichols ann judson chapter i early year -lrb- illustration -rrb- ann a daughter of john and rebecca hasseltine be bear in bradford massachusett on December 22 1789 the quiet daily life of the simple new england people from whom she spring and amongst whom she be bring up be as beneficial a training for she future career as could have be find for she the feverish activity and never-ceasing struggle to be first which have now take possession of the american people be then almost unknown and the descendant of the puritan father spend they day in peaceful toil most of the new englander be engage in farming or small manufacture and there be a deeply religious spirit throughout the whole of the northern state of the early life of ann hasseltine we know comparatively little she family be evidently in moderately easy circumstance and the hasseltine household be a happy and closely-united one the parent with wise foresight be careful to give they child as good a education as could be obtain in the neighborhood and keep they at school till well advance in they teens ann be distinguish among she sister for she gay joyous and somewhat emotional temperament there be no half-heartedness about she and whatever she take up she would throw she whole soul into as be to be expect in a community where religious matter occupy so prominent a place the urgent need of a personal faith in christ be place before she at a early age she could not suppress a vague longing after something she know not what and every now and then she conscience would be arouse and she would quicken she effort to be good when she be sixteen affair reach a crisis a series of religious conference have be hold in bradford during the early month of 1806 and she regularly attend they each meeting deepen the impression on she mind as to the need of a higher life she old amusement seem now utterly distasteful to she and the fear of be for ever lose weigh heavily on she soul she be invite to a party by a old friend but she heart be too sad to care for such thing so on the morning of the party she steal off to the house of one of she aunt who she think might be able to help she in she trouble she aunt speak seriously to she of the necessity of obtain salvation while she could and the poor girl become more downcast than ever i return home with a burst heart she afterwards say fear that i should lose my impression with the other scholar and convinced that if i do so my soul be lose she shut herself in she bedroom refuse to touch any but the plainest food and for some day plead with god for pardon gradually the light come in she soul i begin to discover a beauty in the way of salvation by christ she say he appear to be just such a savior as i need i see how god could be just in save sinner through he i commit my soul into he hand and besought he to do with I what seem good in he sight when i be thus enable to commit myself into the hand of christ my mind be relieve from that distressing weight which have bear it down for so long a time i do not think that i have obtain a new heart which i have be seek but feel happy in contemplate the character of christ and particularly that disposition which have lead he to suffer so much for the sake of do the will and promote the glory of he heavenly father with so deep a experience it be only natural that the whole course of she outward life should be completely change she soon make a open profession of religion by become a member of the congregational church at bradford and she friend could see the reality of she conversion by she consistent daily walk she now throw herself with greater zeal into she ordinary study and this soon result in she be request to take temporary charge of a small school at salem when the work there be do a teachership be find for she in another place near at hand and it be while thus engage that she become acquaint with she future husband adoniram judson mr judson who be some sixteen month she senior be the eldest son of a congregational minister at malden near boston and have from he youth be note for possess intellectual power far above the average when a boy he diligently read every book that he could get hold of and at brown university he graduate head of he class for a time during he college course he become affect with the sceptical view which be then fashionable but the death of a friend bring he back to the old faith and as a outcome of he conversion he become a student at the theological college at andover while at college judson and three fellow-student have they interest deeply arouse in the conversion of heathen nation they petition the general assembly of they church on the matter and solicit its advice as to whether they ought to renounce the object of mission as visionary or impracticable and if not what step they should take to translate they longing into action the importance of this appeal be at once recognize by the church and as a immediate consequence the board of commissioner for foreign mission be form a society which have grow until it be now one of the greatest missionary organization in the world judson go on a visit to england in order to expedite matter and to consult with the official of the london missionary society after some delay cause by the capture of the vessel in which he be sail by a french privateer he reach london and see the director they agree to support he and he companion should the american board be unable to do so and with this assurance judson return to america he now make miss hasseltine a formal offer of marriage and she know that if she accept she must of course accompany he abroad for a time she not unnaturally hesitate she be ask to do what no american woman have before attempt and the life of a foreign missionary seem full of unknown horror it mean to leave home and probably never to see friend or native land again to be wear out in the unhealthy climate of some tropical land to suffer every kind of want and distress degradation insult persecution and perhaps a violent death friend with few exception advise she to decline and public opinion be strongly oppose to such a wild romantic undertaking as a woman go out to the heathen o jesus she pray in she perplexity direct I and i be safe use I in thy service and i ask no more i would not choose my position of work or place of service only let I know thy will and i will readily comply after some week of hesitation she definitely make up she mind i have at length come to the conclusion she

they discover this they be summon from serampore to calcutta and there formally command in the name of the company to leave indium at once and return to america to do this would have ruin all they

boat come down the river or a stranger enter the village would fill they with alarm for they expect at any moment to be seize by government agent send after they at the end of the fourth day relief come in a most unexpected way a letter be hand to mr judson contain a official permit for they to go on to the isle of france in the vessel from which they have a few day before be remove how this permit be obtain or who have send it to they they could never discover and there be no time then to speculate on the matter the ship be now at least seventy mile away in the saugur road and have probably already set out to sea in the hope that it might possibly have be delay in start and that they might catch it they at once start down the river in boat after be row all night and all next day they find on reach the road that they be in time as owe to the absence of some of the crew the vessel have be delay it may be imagine how thankfully they find themselves once more on board before leave calcutta a important change have take place in mr and mr judson 's view about the question of infant baptism while on the voyage from america mr judson know that he would come in contact with the baptist missionary at serampore have study the subject in order to be able to defend he position to they the result have be that doubt have gradually arise in he mind as to the correctness of he own point of view and he speak on the subject to he wife she deprecate any hasty action but they both resolve to give careful attention to the matter every consideration of human interest would have lead they to cling to they old belief for as mr judson point out if she husband should renounce he former sentiment he must offend he friend at home hazard he reputation and what be still more try be separate from he missionary companion i hope that i shall i be dispose to embrace the truth she write whatever it may be it be painfully mortifying to my natural feeling to think seriously of renounce a system which i have be teach from infancy to believe and respect we must make some very painful sacrifice we must be separate from we dear missionary associate and labor alone in some isolate spot we must expect to be treat with contempt and cast off by many of we american friend -- forfeit the character we have in we native land and probably have to labor for we support where we be station after prayerful consideration they both apply to carey for baptism much to the surprise of the great english missionary who have know nothing of they struggle this step necessarily involve they separation from the congregational board of commissioner who have send they out and there be then no american baptist missionary society to which they could look for help but mr judson write to the american baptist church state what he have do and appeal to they to support he in he labor the baptist soon afterwards respond to he appeal by form a missionary union and they appoint mr and mr judson two of they agent thus be mr judson a important though indirect instrument in cause another great american denomination to throw itself into the work of evangelise the world the first news that mr judson hear on reach the isle of france be that mr newell she companion from america have die a few week previously before even be allow to commence the work to which she have dedicate she life the governor of the island have be warn about the come of the american and advise to keep a eye on they but he give they a warm welcome and express a hope that they would settle in the place and work among the native and the soldier but the isle of france hardly seem to offer a sufficiently extensive field for they energy and there be other place more in need of they service mr and mr judson specially wish to go to burmah where with a population of many million there be hardly a single christian teacher but the character of the people and of the government be such that any stranger go among they must take they life in they hand notwithstanding this they determine after due inquiry to go to penang and thence to attempt to find access to the country it be necessary first to go to madra in order to find a vessel which would take they eastward but on arrive at madras they find that it would be impossible to procure a passage to penang so they take passage in a ship that be go to rangoon and after some adventure reach the field of they future work in July 1813 we can not expect to do much in such a rough uncultivated field write mr judson yet if we may be instrumental in clear away some of the rubbish and prepare the way for other it will be sufficient reward chapter iii preparation time mr and mr judson might well have be excuse have they hesitate to settle in rangoon for the prospects before they in that place be anything but hopeful the emperor of burmah be a absolute monarch and rumor give he the credit of be unjust tyrannical grasp capricious and cruel the people be describe as indolent inhospitable deceitful and crafty and in spite of the natural wealth of the land the majority of the inhabitant be miserably poor this be largely due to the fact that all property be hold on the most uncertain tenure everything be liable to be seize at any time by the emperor or by some of he official more than one unsuccessful attempt have be make to form a missionary settlement in rangoon previous to the arrival of the judson preacher have be send out from serampore and by the london missionary society but none of they have be able to occupy the field for any length of time when the judson arrive there be only one other christian teacher in burmah mr felix carey who be then at ava the residence of the emperor mr carey a native of the country be stay at rangoon in a house build by the serampore baptist missionary and she welcome the new-comer to she home where they stay for some month the first work to which the judson set themselves be the study of the burmese tongue this be a task of extreme difficulty for the only part of the language put into write which would help they be a small portion of a grammar and six chapter of st matthew 's gospel which have be translate by mr felix carey even with all the aid at present in use burman be anything but easy to acquire it have be call the round o language on account of each word be make up of a number of small circle and to a untrained eye the word seem almost exactly alike the letter and word be all totally destitute of the least resemblance to any language we have ever meet with mr judson write to a friend in salem and these word be not fairly divide and distinguish as in western writing by break and point and capital but run together in one continuous line a sentence or paragraph seem to the eye but one long word instead of clear character on paper we find only obscure scratch on palm leave string together and call a book we have no dictionary and no interpreter to explain a single word and must get something of the language before we can avail ourselves of the assistance of a native teacher it unavoidably take several year to acquire such a language in order to converse and write intelligibly on the truth of the gospel mr and mr judson obtain a native teacher and settle down to a daily struggle with they task the man be at first unwilling to have mr judson as a pupil think it below he dignity to instruct a woman : but when he see that she be determine to persevere he abandon he opposition as the teacher know no english and the pupil know no burman progress be of necessity very slow we only mode of ascertain the name of object which meet we eye write mr judson be by point to they in the presence of we teacher who would immediately speak the name in burman we then express they as nearly as possible by the roman character till we have sufficiently acquire the power of the burman in order to get more in contact with the people they leave mr carey 's hospitable roof and take up they residence in the center of the town this obliged mr judson to commence housekeeping on she own account and consequently she have less time to devote to study yet to she surprise she make faster progress now than she have ever do before she thus describe she daily life in a letter home : we be busily employ all day long could you look into a large open room which we call a verandah you would see mr judson bent over he table cover with burman book with he teacher at he side a venerable-looking man in he sixtieth year with a cloth wrap round he middle and a handkerchief on he head they talk and chatter all day long with hardly any cessation my morning be busily employ in give direction to the servant provide food for the family etc at ten my teacher come when be you present you might see I in a inner room at one side of my study table and my teacher the other reading burman write talk etc i have many more interruption than mr judson as i have the entire management of the family this i take on myself for the sake of mr judson 's attend more closely to the study of the language yet i have find by a year 's experience that it be the most direct way i could have take to acquire the language as i be frequently oblige to speak burman all day i can talk and understand other better than mr judson though he know more about the nature and construction of the language it be impossible to do any direct evangelistic work until the language have be more fully master and mr judson be continually spur on in she study by the desire to speak to the native about the lord jesus christ o thou light of the world she pray as she realize more fully the ignorance of the people dissipate the thick darkness which cover burmah and let thy light arise and shine chapter iv a heavy affliction -lrb- illustration : ann hasseltine judson -rrb- when mr judson have be in rangoon six month she be take somewhat seriously ill and it be deem advisable that she should go to madras both for the sea voyage and in order to obtain skilled medical advice which could not be have in rangoon she meet with nothing but kindness all the way the viceroy grant she special permission to take a native woman as she attendant a thing which be deem a very great favor indeed as no native woman be usually allow to leave the country the captain of the vessel in which she sail refuse to accept any money for the passage and when she send the physician who attend to she seventy rupee in payment for he advice he return they with a expression of pleasure in have be of any service to she she go back to rangoon renew in health and a few month later she become the mother of a little boy for a short time the baby be the treasure of the mission-house in they loneliness and separation from all friend the heart of the father and mother go out to they little one and he become even more to they than a only child usually be to its parent the burman regard he as quite a curiosity for he be the only purely white infant in the place the baby would lie quietly for hour on a mat in the study while he parent be pore over they book and when work be do they would throw the palm leave on one side take up the boy and carry he in state around the house and garden he presence seem to light up the home with a new and sacred joy but he be not to be there long when he have completely twine himself around he parent ' heart he be take away for after a few day ' illness he die when only eight month old this sore affliction be the means of draw out much sympathy from many of the native the chief wife of the viceroy have be greatly attract by the little lad when he be alive and on hearing of he death she pay a visit of condolence to he parent accompany by she official attendant numbering some two hundred people why do you not send I word that i might come to the funeral she ask smite she breast and show every sign of sorrow the heart-broken mother reply that she grief be so great that she do not think of it and the burman lady then do she best to comfort she and strive with warm womanly sympathy to make she forget she loss chapter v sowing time for three year mr and mr judson devoted themselves solely to the study of burman and do not even attempt any directly evangelistic work beyond the opportunity afford by casual conversation with a few individual they well know that any impatient attempt to push forward the work would probably result in close the country against christianity for many year to come it be not without heavy heart that they see the year pass away and nothing apparently be do they have half expect before leave america that it would require little more than a plain proclamation of the gospel to win convert but a short experience of the reality of missionary life show they that the work be not so easy as have be imagine the people be careless and indifferent and no permanent impression seem to be produce upon they mind they would listen politely while the missionary plead with they for christ and then would lightly dismiss the matter with the remark that all religion be good one reason why preach have not be attempt be because mr and mr judson feel it would be well at first to devote they energy more especially to the printing and circulation of christian literature in burmah almost every man could read and it would be possible to reach far more through the print page than by public speak a portion of a gospel have be translate by mr felix carey but this be lose in a wreck so mr judson start a fresh translation of the new testament and prepared one or two tract in 1815 he write to dr carey ask if he could print some burmese tract at the serampore press the doctor reply that it would be far better for judson to start a press of he own in rangoon and in order that he might do so he send he a complete outfit include a press a supply of type and other necessary stock when the printing press reach rangoon there come with it two new helper mr and mr hough send out by the american baptist missionary society mr hough have be a printer before leave america and so he be able to render practical assistance almost from the day of he arrival by take charge of the printing department two small tract be issue as quickly as possible one a summary of christian doctrine and the other a catechism and mr judson hurry on with he translation of the new testament the printing of these be the first thing of the kind that have ever be do in burmah and the missionary rejoice that the art of printing should be introduce into the country directly through christianity they first serious inquirer be bring to they through these tract one day in march 1817 a man evidently of good position come to the mission-house and astonished mr judson with the question how long a time will it take I to learn the religion of jesus the surprised missionary reply that it all depend on whether god give he light and wisdom and ask how he come to know anything of jesus have he be there before no have he see any writings concern jesus i have see two little book who be jesus judson ask to test he knowledge he be the son of god who pity creature come into the world and suffer death in they stead who be god he be a be without begin or end who be not subject to old age or death but always be mr judson be delighted beyond measure to hear these word proceed from the lip of a burman he hand he a tract and catechism but these the man have read and specially want another book judson have tell he that he be prepare another book but have not get it ready yet have you not a little of that book do which you would be graciously pleased to give I the man ask and judson think it better not to let the opportunity pass by give he two half sheet which have be already print and which contain the first five chapter of matthew the man do not come again to they for some time but they learn that he be appoint governor of some village a distance away the follow January he have to visit rangoon and once more call at the mission-house mr judson be away just then have go for a short time to indium but mr judson have a long talk with he and ask he if he have yet become a disciple of jesus i have not yet he reply but i be think and read in order to become one i can not yet destroy my old mind for if i see a handsome cloth or handkerchief i still desire they tell the great teacher when he return that i wish to see he though i be not a disciple of christ he request more book and then leave up to this time the ruler have be most friendly but in 1818 a little event occur which indicate to the missionary what might at any time happen the former viceroy have leave and a new one be appoint in he stead it be the time when mr judson be away in indium and one morning mr hough receive a command write in most threatening language order he to at once appear at the court-house to give a account of himself he go and be order to come next day for examination and the official assure he that if he do not tell all the truth about he situation in the country they would write it with he heart 's blood for two day he be subject to a severe cross-examination and the official seem to delight in annoying and threatening he in every possible way he could not appeal to the viceroy for he be not sufficiently acquaint with the language so the native teacher draw up a petition and mr judson herself present it to the viceroy he receive it kindly and at once give order that mr hough be not to be trouble further they afterwards find out that the thing have be arrange by the minor official in order to extort money from the missionary before mr judson return a severe epidemic of cholera break out in rangoon and mr hough be very anxious to take he wife and mr judson out of the place and go back to india it be a try and troubled time and all missionary-work be necessarily at a standstill mr judson be very reluctant to leave burmah and for long refuse to depart she have not hear from she husband for many month and do not know on what day he might return but mr hough be so persistent that she at last consent and allow she luggage to be take on board a vessel she herself follow but at the last moment when the ship be on the point of sailing she feel that she could not leave and order she thing to be take back to the city again mr and mr hough go on and she be leave alone but within a few day she husband return and she greatest trouble be over chapter vi inquirer and convert soon after the retirement of mr hough two other missionary and they wife come out to rangoon and the judson feel it be time to commence a more aggressive work a little house of public worship or zayat be erect in one of the main road and open to all who like to come in the work have to be do very quietly in order not to arouse the opposition of the government for there be much uncertainty at the time about the course the official would take should any convert be make when the zayat be finish mr judson call together some of the people live around and hold he first public service in the burmese tongue from this time meeting be hold several time a week and during the day mr judson would sit in the house talking and argue with all who choose to come in to he every Wednesday evening at seven o'clock mr judson meet a class of woman numbering generally from twelve to twenty to these she would read the scripture and talk in a simple way about god my last meeting be very animating she say when describe one of these class and the appearance of the female -lrb- thirteen in number all young married woman -rrb- very encourage some of they be inquisitive and after spend two hour seem loth to go one say she appear to herself like a blind person just begin to see and another say she believe in christ pray to he daily and ask what else be necessary to make she a real disciple of christ i tell she she must not only say that she believe in christ but must believe with all she heart she again ask what be some of the evidence of believe with the heart i tell she the manner of life would be change but one of the best evidence she could obtain would be when other come to quarrel with she and use abusive language if so far from retaliate she feel a disposition to bear with to pity and to pray for they the burman woman be particularly give to quarrel and to refrain from it would be most decide evidence of a change of heart during the daytime while mr judson be talk with any man who call mr judson would sit in another part of the place and see all the woman visitor by this plan she be enable to preach the gospel to many what time she could spare from this work she now devoted to a study of siamese a number of people in rangoon know only that language so she learn it sufficiently well to be able to converse with they and to translate a gospel and several tract into they tongue in 1819 the heart of the missionary be cheer by a native moung hau come out and openly profess christianity -- the first fruit gather after seven year of labor many have partly accept they teaching and have be evidently impress by they message but up to that time no real definite convert have be make moung hau soon show that a real work of grace be progress in he heart he tell the missionary that he have find no other savior but jesus christ from all the darkness and uncleanness and sin of he whole life that he could look nowhere else for salvation and that therefore he propose to adhere to christ for ever it seem almost too much to believe that god have begin to manifest he grace to the burman the member of the little mission band say one to another but the sincerity of moung hau be such that they could not doubt it and after a time of probation he be publicly baptize there be sign that this convert be only the first of a abundant harvest in the autumn of the same year two more man request baptism but this time the rite have to be perform privately for the viceroy have begin openly to avow himself hostile to christianity dark rumor of persecution be hear and one inquirer be summon before the authority and warn to beware of what he do so serious do matter become that public preaching have for a time to be abandon and many inquirer cease they visit to the mission-house and be hear of no more the missionary think that if they could only appeal to the emperor and obtain he permission to carry on they work all might be well again so after much deliberation messr judson and colman go on a journey to the royal city of ava and obtain a audience of the emperor they humbly request that he subject might be permit to become christian without incur the wrath of the authority but when the monarch hear they petition he treat it with open disdain and they have to return to rangoon saddened and disappointed beyond measure the news that nothing must be expect from the government but persecution seem to give strength to the three convert and to several really earnest inquirer when the missionary speak of go to another part of burmah where they could have more liberty they disciple implore they to remain it be useless to remain under present circumstance mr judson say we can not open the zayat we can not have public worship no burman will dare to examine this religion none can be expect to embrace it teacher one of the convert reply my mind be distressed i can neither eat nor sleep since i find you be go away i have be around among those who live near we and i find some who be even now examine the new religion do stay with we a few month do stay till there be eight or ten disciple then appoint one to be teacher of the rest many other say the same and at last it be decide that mr and mr judson be to remain in rangoon while mr and mr colman the other missionary there at the time should move to chittagong a place near at hand under british protection and try to form a station there within a few week after this several who have long be inquirer come and request baptism although they be well aware that by do so they be make themselves liable to death by most horrible torture one man a prominent native in good circumstance and well know as a great orator and metaphysician who have for a long time be argue with mr judson about christianity now openly declare himself a follower of jesus other do the same and god seem to reward he servant by show they such result from they labor as they have hardly hope ever to obtain the threat of persecution for a time cease and the prospects of the mission improve in every way by early in 1821 the number of baptize disciple have increase to nearly twenty and among they be several professional man of great influence in the city and some woman many other although not profess disciple show by they act that they sympathise with the christian and would do what they could for they in December 1821 dr price a medical missionary arrive with he wife from america and soon afterwards mr and mr hough return though the missionary be leave in comparative peace they well know that severe measure might at any time be take against they every now and then there come rumbling of the threaten storm and one of the chief convert be oblige to flee from the city on account of proceedings be start against he for he change of faith a few month before the arrival of dr price mr judson have so break down in health that she husband decide to send she to america for the long sea voyage she first go to england where she receive a warm welcome from many christian and then she proceed to the united state where she spend the winter medical man in america be unanimous in advise she not to return to the east as they say she state of health be such that she would probably die before long if she go there but nothing could keep she back from what she feel to be the post of duty i can not prevail on myself to be any longer from rangoon than be absolutely necessary for the preservation of my life she say so in June 1823 she start on the return journey accompany by another missionary and he wife chapter vii prisoner of war when mr judson reach calcutta on she return voyage to rangoon she be inform that war might break out at any time between england and burmah and be strongly advise not to attempt to go on but she be determine to rejoin she husband at once and find that a vessel would start for rangoon in a few day she take a passage in it she be not to stay long in rangoon however for the emperor have order dr price and mr judson to take up they residence in ava dr price be already there and mr judson have only stay at rangoon to meet he wife on the understanding that he should set out for the capital as soon as possible the missionary attempt to carry on they work at ava in the same way as they have previously do at rangoon but the public mind be in too excite a state just then to permit of much progress be make the emperor have for some time treat the english government with open disdain and have collect a army together for the avowed purpose of invade bengal he even cause a pair of golden fetter to be make to bind the governor-general of indium when he should be lead as captive to ava but before the emperor could carry out he plan the english take the initiative and invade he country he be confident of victory but information be soon bring to he that the english have capture rangoon and this be follow by news of various other english victory the foreign resident at ava naturally feel that they position there be somewhat precarious at first the emperor assure they that as they have nothing to do with the war they should not be molest but when tiding of english triumph follow one another in rapid succession the attitude of the native grow more and more menace some englishman formerly in the employ of the court be seize and they belongings examine in the account book of one of they be item record certain sum have be pay to mr judson this money have be give to he in exchange for circular banker ' order send from america but the emperor do not understand this he conclude that judson have be pay to be a english spy and at once give order for the arrest of both the missionary the scene can best be describe in mr judson 's own word on the 8th of June just as we be prepare for dinner in rush a officer hold a black book with a dozen burman accompany by one whom from he spotted face we know to be a executioner and a ` son of the prison ' ` where be the teacher ' be the first inquiry mr judson present himself ` you be call by the king ' say the officer -- a form of speech always use when about to arrest a criminal the spotted man instantly seize mr judson throw he on the floor and produce the small cord the instrument of torture i catch hold of he arm ` stay ' say i ' i will give you money ' ` take she too ' say the officer ` she also be a foreigner ' mr judson with a implore look beg they would let I remain till further order the hardened executioner draw tight the cord bind mr judson fast and drag he off i know not whither in vain i entreated the spotted face to take the silver and loosen the rope but he spurn my offer and immediately depart mr judson be hurry away to the death prison and he wife find herself a captive in she own house she be expose to many insult from the guard of soldier set over she and for three day she be unable to go out then by a judicious bribe she obtain a certain measure of liberty she at once go to the governor of the city and seek to obtain the release of she husband this could not be gain but she purchase permission to see he he crawl to the door of the prison as fast as he trebly-bound limb would allow and speak for a minute to she but before they could exchange many word mr judson be peremptorily order away by the jailer the government official come again to the mission-house and seize all the silver they could find in it but mr judson have receive warning of they visit and before they arrive have hide as much money as she could have she not do this she and she husband must inevitably have starve during the follow month as it be she have something now with which to mollify the official and she succeed in get she husband and dr price take out of the common prison for a time and place in a open shed day by day she work incessantly petition every one of influence from the queen downward for she husband 's release many sympathise with she but one and all declare themselves unable to do anything the governor of the city who have chief control of the prison happily become they friend and do all he dare for they three time he be inform by a near relative of the emperor that if he would cause all the white prisoner to be privately put to death it would be please to the monarch but every time he manage to avoid do it for seven month mr judson strove daily on she husband 's behalf and spend what time she could with he in the gaol sometimes she say i could not go into the prison till after dark when i have two mile to walk in return to the house oh how many time have i return from that dreary prison at nine o'clock at night solitary and worn out with fatigue and anxiety and endeavor to invent some new scheme for the release of the prisoner after she husband have be in prison for some month she give birth to a little daughter and for a few week be unable to get about to look after the captive as before during this time news come to ava of further great defeat of the burmese troops and the treatment of the captive be at once make harsher they be again shut in the inner prison among all the common malefactor of the place and be each bind with five pair of fetter the hottest season of the year have now arrive and the situation of the prisoner be far more terrible than any word can describe the room in which they be confine be occupy by about a hundred native criminal there be no ventilation beyond that afford by the crack in the wall and the continual stench and heat be almost unbearable as soon as she could get about mr judson build herself a small bamboo hut by the gate of the prison and live there to be as near as possible to she husband after he have be a month in this black hole mr judson be take ill with fever and after much entreaty she be permit to move he to a little bamboo cell by himself and to go in daily to feed he and to give he medicine chapter viii through much tribulation the darkest hour have not yet come two or three day after she have secure the removal of she husband from the common prison he and all the white man be suddenly seize and hurry out of the city mr judson be engage elsewhere at the time and for some hour she be unable to learn where the prisoner have be take but a servant who have see they leave give she a clue and she at once follow it up she deposit she book and medicine with the friendly governor and set out with she babe on she arm and two orphan child she have adopt by she side seek she husband after a wearisome journey she find he in a wretched prison at oung-pen-la almost dead from weakness and the torture he have undergo on he forced march and be greet with the pathetic word so illustrative of adoniram judson 's utter unselfishness why have you come i hope you would not follow for you can not live here the prison be place in a lonely spot far away from any village there be no accommodation for mr judson and no food could be obtain near at hand she be refuse permission to build herself a little hut but the jailer find she a small dirty store-room in he own house and here she and the three child live for the next six month day by day she search for food not only for she husband but for the other white prisoner and though wear out with pain and sorrow cheer they look after they every want and continually apply to the official for some improvement in they lot the untold privation she be suffer soon tell on a frame that have never be very strong she two adopted child be take with small-pox and when they have partly recover the baby be also attack mr judson have now to look after they in addition to she other work and would often spend the day attend to the prisoner and the night in nurse the child the watching and fatigue at last break she down and for two month she be unable to leave she bed she have for most of the time no attendant except a common bengalee cook but this man prove a invaluable aid he work almost without cease nursing mr judson search for provision and feed the prisoner the little baby be in a most deplorable state it have no nurse mr judson could not feed it on account of she fever and the only way it exist be by she husband obtain permission from the jailer to go out for a short time each day carry the child around the village and beg a little nourishment for it from those mother who have young child i now begin to think the very affliction of job have come upon I write mr judson when in health i could bear the various trial and vicissitude through which i be call upon to pass but to be confine with sickness and unable to assist those who be so dear to I when in distress be almost too much for I to bear and have it not be for the consolation of religion and a assure conviction that every additional trial be order by infinite love and mercy i must have sink under my accumulate suffering meanwhile the english army be daily come closer and closer to the capital and mr judson be take out of prison and send down to the burmese camp to act as translator in the negotiation which be go on between the two force the victorious british general sir archibald campbell order the burmese to pay a heavy war indemnity and to cede a large part of they territory to the english and he also stipulate that all foreign prisoner who wish should be hand over to he consequently the judson find themselves once more free after a year and seven month ' imprisonment and be make the honor guest of the english general but the relief come too late for mr judson 's constitution be completely undermine by the privation she have endure she and she husband settle in amherst a new town in british burman territory and hopefully look forward to carry on a useful work there they have not be many month in the place before mr judson have a bad attack of fever at a time when she husband be away help the english general she seem temporarily to get better but she have no strength leave to resist the disease and gradually sink the teacher be long in come and the new missionary be long in come she murmur in a moment of relief from she delirium i must die alone and leave my little one but as it be the will of god i acquiesce in he will i be not afraid of death but i be afraid i shall not be able to bear these pain tell the teacher the disease be most violent and i could not write tell he how i suffer and die tell he all that you see and take care of the house and thing until he return for most of the time she lay unconscious and on October 24 1827 after about sixteen day of illness and at the age of thirty-seven she pass away before she husband could return soon afterwards she baby follow she and so go home one of the noblest woman who have labor in the mission field she brave spirit she undaunted trust in god and in the power of prayer uphold she when the courage of the bravest man would have fail not a little of the remarkable success of the work of god in burmah be due to the indomitable perseverance and the wise devotion to god and to she husband of ann judson and wherever the gospel be preach that also which this woman have do shall be speak of for a memorial of she be she life throw away be the labor and suffering she have bodily undergo waste not so the story of she life have be and still be a precious heritage for the whole church militant a lesson

of she young son and daughter while she in return give great assistance in the conduct and work of the mission iv mission work in cairo and on the nile be it possible to convert moslem to christianity be they ready to receive it no one perhaps be more competent to answer these question than mary whately and this be what she say : to say as have be sometimes rashly declare that the moslem be ready to receive christianity and that the faith of the false prophet be crumble away be what i would not venture for a moment to assert but i can state as a fact that in the neighborhood of cairo the peasant population both man and woman be willing and many of they eager to _ listen _ to the word of god when it be bring before they judiciously and discreetly as well as with kindness and zeal -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ more about rugged life in egypt _ p 210 -rrb- subsequent experience confirm this view and more than twenty year later she remark it be necessary to be discreet in deal with mohammedan for if the spirit of bitterness be once arouse the door be shut for the time at least against good influence -lrb- 1 -rrb- to awaken to a experience of vital religion the ignorant superstitious and spiritually lifeless copt be a difficult task to bring to personal faith in christ the bigoted moslem be more difficult still a moslem 's religion she say be twine up with he political social domestic life so minutely that the whole rope as it be have to untwisted before he can be free from error and the very admixture of truth in they book make it harder in some respects to refute than if like the heathen doctrine it be all wrong throughout perhaps the intense self-righteousness of moslem be after all the hardest point about they they notion that in the end all who be islam be safe strengthen they in this belief -lrb- 2 -rrb- nevertheless the point of contact between the mohammedan faith and the christian a wise teacher can use as peg to hang christian teaching upon and this mary whately 's previous experience among the ignorant and bigoted roman catholic of ireland enable she to do with much tact when peasant say to she you book be christian -- we do not like christian book she would explain that it be god 's book and that the koran do not forbid it to be read and that she want to tell they about seidna eessa -lrb- the lord jesus -rrb- whom mohamm acknowledge to be a prophet in this way many a initial difficulty would be overcome and the reading with simple explanation of story from the gospel would elicit the response the word be good and the request for the gift of a new testament -lrb- footnote 1 : _ life of mary l whately _ p 109 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ a glimpse behind the curtain _ p 117 -rrb- -lrb- illustration : mary l whately

arduous and consume much time through it a entrance be make for the gospel into many home into the house of the rich she penetrate but seldom partly because she work lay in other direction and partly because these be occupy by numerous slave-wife who be chiefly circassian or georgian speak turkish and do not understand arabic in earlier year miss whately do all the visit herself and she book bear abundant testimony to the skill with which she could turn the conversation to spiritual matter in later year she be much assist in it by mr shakoor and by a bible-woman whom she employ mansoor and yousif shakoor engage in similar work among man they often find man at the coffee-house willing to listen to the reading of the scripture when this be put a stop to through the opposition of the moslem priest a book depot be open which do good service for some year evening meeting be also establish but these be attend almost exclusively by copt though occasionally a moslem would brave the real danger of be present at a christian service beside the early morning ride to which reference have be make which afford opportunity for religious conversation miss whately would occasionally stay for a week or two at some farmhouse or by the seaside and find opportunity of teach the people around something of the gospel the follow be a incident connect with this work in the country : at a open spot just outside the village a barber be shave a peasant 's head and as usual a group be assemble near he chat and smoke mr shakoor take advantage of this and resolve to join the party of man and get into conversation while i go a little further in search of some woman i soon find four or five with some little girl all sit upon a dust-heap they look very dirty as well they might but i remember ` who can raise up the beggar from the dung-hill and make he to sit among prince ' i salute the poor woman in a friendly way and though look astonished they reply civilly after a little chat and a few question on both side i ask if they have ever hear about we first parent adam and eve and how sin come into the world they just know the name but no more and be please to listen while i related the story before i have finish a old woman who have come up interrupted I a young man who be stand near and listen desire she not to interrupt the lady for he could see she be learn and ` thou art ignorant ' he add with more truth than politeness ` but you be not well place here ' he say point to the heap on which they be seat ` come to the roof of my house my mother will show you the way and these woman can come too if they like ' i accede to this courteous invitation and follow the mother and son up the mud-brick step lead to the rude terrace and though anything but clean it be a great improvement on what we have leave and with genuine kindliness the old woman bring out a old but well-preserved carpet and spread it for I the other have follow and sit round to hear what the stranger could have to read to they they really seem interested though sometimes interrupt I with remark not at all to the purpose i manage to bring they back to the story i read of course choose the simplest possible and try to explain a little as we go -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ among the hut _ pp 181-184 -rrb- miss whately would occasionally make a excursion into the desert make the acquaintance of the wild bedouin tribe and read to they the scripture lady once say a bedouin lift the curtain of a tent in which she and she sister be seat i see you horse at the water and my comrade and i be come to hear some of you book they listen attentively while she read to they the ninth chapter of john 's gospel a important part of she work be the missionary tour which she make each year in the winter or early spring the first of these journey be in 1861 the last within a few week of she death the spiritual condition of those she visit be thus describe by miss whately : the mass of the peasant be little if at all different from what they be in the day of pharaoh instead of pray to god of stone and revere brute it be true they now call on the almighty but know scarcely anything about he neither he word nor he law much of the religion of the _ fellah _ consist in prostration and he _ spontaneous _ prayer be usually invocation to dead man as we see with nile boatman and other labourer when in a fatiguing work they call on the ` lord hosseen or zeid ' & c to ` stretch out a hand and help ' buffalo and sheep be frequently sacrify at the shrine of sheik of reputed sanctity or at the mosque dedicate to lady zeynab a pilgrimage to mecca and the performance of certain ceremony there be suppose to cleanse the pilgrim from sin the copt -lrb- who form the minority of the population -rrb- have always preserve they veneration for scripture but neglect it and be extremely ignorant till in some degree arouse by the effort of missionary to seek more after education and to read more of the word of god she proceed thus to describe the work among these people : on we yearly nile excursion we have great cause for encouragement both among the copt and the far more numerous moslem the coast of the river be dot with number of village -- some almost large enough to be consider town boast a few house with window a mosque and a small primitive school other be mere hamlet consist of mud hut crowd closely together and build in and out of the palm-tree we bring to several of these place both medicine for the sick and book for those who desire they and be heartily welcome

in daily attendance about half be moslem the rest copt and syrian with one or two little negro slave or bronzed nubian many be very poor but some belong to the middle class and there be even a few from wealthy family who would ride to school on donkey from distant quarter of the town the two brother shakoor devoted much of they time to the superintendence of the school and teach all the higher branch be assist in write spelling & c by several native teacher the girl ' school advance less rapidly because of the early marriage which usually withdraw the pupil about the age of twelve and because girl be more want at home than boy in 1870 there be about a hundred name on the roll with a average attendance of seventy or eighty it be long miss whately 's desire to acquire a piece of land on which to build suitable school premise she desire be gratify when in 1869 the khedive ismail pasha at the kind suggestion of the prince of wale make she a grant of the freehold of nearly a acre of land just outside the old wall of cairo the only condition be that the building erect on it should have a handsome front as it would face a main road considerable delay be experience in get the necessary papers for make the possession secure and it be not till 1871 that the building be erect mansoor shakoor who have considerable knowledge of architecture design it and superintend all the detail of its erection by its side and separate from it only by a garden miss whately put up a house for herself that she might be always close to she work about one fourth of the cost be contribute by those who in cairo and in england take a interest in the work of the school but miss whately herself contribute the remainder of the outlay amounting to about four thousand pound -lrb- 1 -rrb-

course it be quite out of she power personally to provide # 200 of this be derive from a annual grant from the egyptian government and about # 150 from pay pupil while occasionally grant be receive from several english society the new school soon become one of the sight of cairo and the english and american tourist who visit they contribute considerably to the fund while the rest of the money require be collect in england mainly through the effort of member of miss whately 's family and the honorary secretary of she english committee but the difficulty of secure sufficient fund to carry on she work efficiently be always one of mary whately 's chief burden and she be often oblige to make up deficiency herself during she occasional visit to england which latterly occur only once in two or three year she be largely occupy in address public and drawing-room meeting on behalf of she work but to return the new school building be open in January 1872 all the friend and acquaintance who take

the simple teaching of reading and write to the boy would not attract scholar but to secure the advantage of instruction in english and french geography history and account many parent would send they

regiment of which she father be the lieutenant-colonel have arrive there only a few day before when agne be about five year of age she father 's regiment which have previously be quarter at cork be order to mauritius the wonderfully varied and beautiful scenery of this little island -- a tiny gem set in the heart of the indian ocean -- with its curiously shaped mountain and tropical tree and plant make a wonderful impression on the mind of the child and although she be only eleven year old when she leave she always cherish the memory of it but it be not only that she mind be rouse to a keen appreciation of the beauty around she during she residence in mauritius the higher part of she nature chiefly through the faithful teaching of one of the french pastor on the island be also touch and in the young heart there arise the longing to be safely fold in the arm of the good shepherd a sentence in one of he sermon haunt she night and day : -- and now brethren if you can not answer I how will you at the last day answer the great searcher of heart a arrow shot at a venture it pierce she heart and although she do not yet yield herself fully to god she never entirely lose the desire to be he even when apparently outwardly indifferent we may well thank god for he servant 's earnest ministry for have he be less faithful the whole course of that life which be to prove so valuable in the service of the lord might have be change from madagascar five hundred and fifty mile from mauritius yet its next-door neighbor westwards in the silver sea there come when agne be yet but seven year old the tiding of a fearful persecution of the christian the letter receive at that time tell of indescribably dreadful suffering for christ 's sake and the sight of the malagasy refugee who flee to mauritius fire she young soul with the desire to become a missionary this desire however in she exceed reserve she keep to herself god have other purpose for she and it be amongst she own country people and not in the foreign field that he call she to labor after the return of she parent from mauritius the greater part of four year be spend in a beautiful spot at the foot of the hill of the donegal highland on the bank of lough swilly one of the loveliest of the irish lake this period be speak of by she sister as one in which she appear utterly indifferent to spiritual thing yet some entry in she journal indicate a intense longing after a higher life they certainly show that she know the sinfulness of she own heart and the weakness of she resolution and that in common with so many reserved nature while hide the true state of she feeling from other she be much give to introspection and incline to magnify she fault such reserve nature do not wear they heart on they sleeve and it should be a comfort to parent and teacher who be anxiously watch child to know that thing be not always what they seem and that many a child who seem altogether careless be in reality not far from the kingdom in January 1848 when a little over fifteen she be send to school at stratford-on-avon and remain there until she father 's death in 1850 the good discipline of this school and the wise guidance of she teacher have a most wholesome effect on the development of she character and the steady indomitable perseverance in the face of difficulty which so mark she after-life distinguish she then by she painstaking and close attention she make up for she want of quickness in learn hence she never forget what she have once learn the actual time of she conversion seem to have be during the period that she reside with she mother and sister in dublin to the earnest man of god whose ministry they attend the preparation of the younger member of he flock for admission to the lord 's supper be no perfunctory task he introduce she with other of he candidate to one of he helper as anxious inquirer so shy and reserved be agne that she say but little yet this lady remark of she : -- in the class she intense appetite for the living bread be so apparent that i often feel myself speak to she only she calm gentle eye fix on I as god help I to speak it be impossible for those who have definitely accept christ 's salvation and who truly realize he love to perish sinner to be idler in he vineyard we be therefore not surprise to find she soon at work she own particular plot be in the ragged school she needy little scholar be a great interest to she she always show the greatest sympathy and devotion to they and while care for they soul do not forget they bodily need even when on a holiday she seek and find work amongst the poor indeed distress of any kind always appeal to she heart there be some christian who be very active in the outside world but who forget that the first duty of a child of god be to show piety at home it be not so with agne jone for it be in the home that the beauty of she life be most visible and it be in the family circle that the affection and unselfishness of she character shine most conspicuously other indeed could plainly see the development of the christ-life in she but she herself dwelling as she do in the presence of she lord be prone to judge herself harshly thus with every moment occupy she charge herself with be lazy and negligent the first step towards the great work of she life be take while on a visit to the continent in 1853 during the may meeting in pari there be one hold on behalf of the oeuvre des diaconesses one of the branch of the institution at kaiserswerth on the rhine found by pastor fliedner this she attend and be then first make acquaint with that work which become of great interest to she a interest which be much strengthen by a visit to kaiserswerth itself about two month later as we drive away she write my great wish be that this might not be my last visit to kaiserwerth that visit be i believe a talent commit to we care may it not be bury so full be she of the conviction that by see more of the work at kaiserswerth she would be the better fit for she beloved work in ireland that she propose that she should go there for a week to she great joy she mother concur in the proposal and earnestly do agne pray that this visit might be bless and sanctify by god to he glory she be charm with all that she hear and see at kaiserswerth with the love which be so manifest in all with the intensity of purpose the perfect obedience the beautiful order the incessant work without fuss or bustle and above all with the spirit of prayer which pervade the whole institution she journal show how strong be she desire to return there for training for she believe that as we use mean to fit we for any earthly profession so be we bind to use every means which will enable we to adorn we christian profession she friend however know nothing of she wish they be tell only in the ear of she god chapter ii at work in the vineyard for some time after she return from the continent agne jone resume she former work in dublin labor more energetically than ever in 1856 however she and she mother return to fahan the old home on the shore of lough swilly always a favorite spot with she not only because of the beauty of its scenery but also because she beloved father be there lay to rest to the christian who be ever on the watch opportunity for service be never lack and agne soon find she hand full do a child fall into the fire -- a very common accident in that district -- she must be fetch for so gentle yet so firm be she touch in dress wound that the fame of she skill have spread for mile and she be send for from far and near to protestant and roman catholic alike be some one die still it be she who must come to smooth the pillow and speak the word of life the spiritual side of she work she never lose sight of but make the rest subservient to this as a means to a end always read the bible if allow and follow the reading by a simple but practical and faithful explanation she be indeed instant in season and out of season in all weather she might be see speed along the lonely mountain road set off soon after breakfast to be at work the whole day with the exception of the early dinner-time and often not return until after dark she be tempt as every other worker be to relax she energy and to stay at home if the weather be bad or if she be not feel well but instead of yield she would if a bad headache come on start off the earlier that she might not lose the chance of a visit through the pain increase yet she duty at home be never neglect rather than omit they she would rise at five that she might anticipate the want of other and save she mother trouble agne herself in she intense humility consider that she be a unsuccessful worker and be incline to condemn herself for lack of zeal and earnestness but she work be a great joy to she and especially do she love she happy talk with some of the aged christian amongst the sixty family she regularly visit he be a rash soldier who venture into the battle without a weapon try and prove and he can only be a unsuccessful christian worker who do not make the word of god the rule and guide of he life to agne jone the bible be a constant study she be a most earnest student of god 's word and delighted to meditate upon it in she journal she write : -- what should i be without my bible and again realize the truth of the promise he that watereth shall be water also himself she say : -- god 's word often come home more strongly to my own heart as i read to the poor and try to make a few simple remark little wonder be it that know and love he word as she do christ be to she a very personal savior and friend she one longing be for more and more likeness to he chapter iii foreign training however strong and good we wish may be it be never safe to force on they accomplishment they be never the loser who wait god 's time and the wisest course of all be the one which agne jone pursue of tell she wish to god and then in perfect submission to he will leave the issue with he it be not until seven year after she visit to kaiserswerth that the way be make open for she to return there this step have be suggest by she mother five year previously but the filial spirit be so strong in she that although she eagerly desire a more thorough training for god 's service she feel that she mother stand first and refuse to leave she alone now the case be different and she gladly seize the opportunity still she be nervously fearful lest after all she should not be follow the guide pillar it be in the autumn of 1860 that she arrive at kaiserswerth where she immediately enter heartily into the work she intention be to stay for only a month or at the most six week but after she have be there but a short time the pastor so strongly represent the great advantage it would be to she to spend the whole winter in the institution that she feel constrain to write for she mother 's permission to do so as ever she be full of prayer for god 's guidance and that whatever be do might be only for he glory she mother leave the choice entirely with she she decide to remain believe that the training would be of inestimable use to she in she future work the deaconess ' institution at kaiserswerth have a very small begin pastor fliedner have hear of mr fry 's work amongst female prisoner be fill with longing to follow she example and receive two discharge prisoner whose friend have refuse they with the object of give they the chance of retrieve they character he set they to work under the personal supervision of himself and he wife the work soon increase and assistance be need to the penitentiary be add a orphanage a training-school a hospital and a lunatic asylum more and more worker be draw in and at the time of agne jone 's first visit there be fifteen branch of the institution in different part of the world this number by the time of she second visit have increase to fifty the deaconess as novice pass through every department of the work and receive a thorough training in both nursing and household work the pastor wisely consider that if when in visit the poor they could render they practical help they word would prove far more effective much be make of bible study both public and private and this as well as the _ stille stunde _ -lrb- quiet hour -rrb- a half-hour daily set apart for prayer and meditation could not but tend to give a spiritual tone to the whole work agne revel in all this and find great happiness in the daily routine in spite of much which be perhaps somewhat needless drudgery such as sweeping and dust she room wash up after meal and even black-leading stove she have however well learn the lesson that no action can be mean to the christian if it come in the way of duty sometimes indeed it seem a waste of strength to spend so much of the day in manual work especially work which so injure she hand that for some time she be oblige to keep they poulticed and be thus unable to assist in the hospital still she be as she say herself as happy as the day be long and it do not seem half long enough in spite of a longing sometimes for home sight and voice soon after she arrival at kaiserswerth fourteen sick boy be give into she care for twelve hour a day this be no easy task particularly when she be leave in sole charge of they some be too far recover to lie in bed and need to be keep at lesson or work as the week roll by she work be change and in addition to other employment she instruct a number of class in english both in the training-school and among the deaconess as for herself she be daily become more proficient in german and in a very short time be able easily to follow the sermon this be a great enjoyment to she as she much value the truly evangelical teaching at kaiserswerth at the end of three month of steady work she spend a few day with a uncle and aunt who be stay at bonn but the gay boarding-house life contrast so unfavourably with the happy christian fellowship at kaiserswerth that she be thankful to return to she duty playfully write : -- the nun will not soon again leave she cell for it be with very nun-like feeling she meet the world again yet she be no misanthrope she do not bring to god a heart which have try earth 's pleasure and have find they want nor a life jade with pursue they from the first she have cast aside the love of worldly thing and have choose to be wholly the lord 's during the latter part of she stay at kaiserswerth she duty lay entirely in the hospital in January she write : -- my duty be in the child 's hospital all age from two to twelve it be a new life for I in a nursery of sick child and a busy one too for every moment they want something do for they a month or so later she be appoint superintendent of the boy ' hospital a post of peculiar responsibility and difficulty it be one too from which she shrink hold the mistaken idea that she possess no power of government certainly it be a position to tax the patience for the child be not too ill to be noisy and disobedient or even sometimes to unite in open rebellion while the task be not render easier by the necessity of speak in a foreign tongue altogether she have a very busy life she rise at 5o be every day and keep hard at work with the exception of the interval for meal and the _ stille stunde _ -lrb- quiet hour -rrb- until night the cleaning and keep my dominion in order be such a business she write sweeping and wash the floor of the three room every morning two stove which must be black-leaded weekly each take a hour weekly cleaning of window tin dinner-chest washing-up of bandage & c besides the washing-up after each of we five meal keep one busy she must have be strong in those day for she write : -- i come over from the other house every morning at six the ground white and window freeze over often at three in the afternoon the water outside be still frozen yet night or morning i never put on bonnet or handkerchief unless when i go out for a walk from the first the hospital patient with they varied need be a great interest to she now it be a die man beside whom she have to watch longing to minister word of comfort yet unable to do so fear that she then want of fluency in the language might trouble he in he weakness yet as she hear the poor man 's cry lieber heiland hilf mir -lrb- dear savior help I -rrb- she prayer too rise for he to the compassionate savior now it be a little boy with a bad back terrible sore and a rack cough who would let no one else touch he every night she say i use to pray with otto after they be all in bed and he use to put he poor little arm round my neck as i knelt beside he but last night -lrb- the night before he die -rrb- he say of himself ' i will only now pray that jesus may take I to heaven and that i may soon die ' and as i have put my face near he to hear he say ` lay you cheek on mine it do I so much good ' we have see quite enough of agne jone by this time to know that she never shrink from a duty however repulsive she love for she master and she desire to serve other for he sake preserve she from any fastidiousness in spite of she sensitive and sympathetic nature she could bear to witness the most painful operation without flinch for she keep before she mind the ultimate good which would accrue from the present suffer one day news reach kaiserswerth of the deplorable condition of one of the english hospital in syrium sick and well it be state be crowd together in a place where rubbish of every kind be throw a insanitary condition anywhere but especially so in a eastern climate helper they say be much need agne long to step into the breach and in a letter to she mother she say : -- the english send plenty of money but hand be want it be no new think with I that mine be strong and willing i would gladly offer they could my own mother bear to think of she child for the next few month as in syrium instead of germany it be but temporary and yet a urgent case my favorite motto come last Sunday ` the lord have need ' if he have need of my mother 's permission to she child he will enable she to give it this be but the expression of a wish and if my own mother be to be make too anxious by the grant it let it be as if unasked by she own agne she standard of filial obedience be indeed a high one though no higher than the standard of god 's word before this in ask permission to remain longer at kaiserswerth she have write to she mother : -- you wish shall be my guide now and for the future as long as i be bless with such a loving counsellor i trust my present training in obedience will not be lose in reference to home although she think the whole training at kaiserswerth invaluable she write long after : -- i believe all i owe to kaiserswerth be comprise in the lesson of unquestioning obedience those who would rule must first learn to obey and certain it be that she would never have be fit to be afterwards the head of a large institution hundred to care for and govern have she not so truly imbibe the spirit of obedience while she have a profound admiration for kaiserswerth she could still see that the life of a deaconess shield though it be from the world be not exempt from danger some fancy that the life of a deaconess or of any one similarly set apart must be much more free from temptation than that of any ordinary person i think she write every one be as much call on as a deaconess be to work for he who first love we but if this do not constrain we as christian neither will it as deaconess and certainly the ` anstalt ' -lrb- institution -rrb- be a world in which the martha-spirit may be find as well as in the outer world there be many most deeply teach christian here many whose face shine but i should say compare my home life -lrb- but few have such a home -rrb- with that of the deaconess here i should say that in many position here there be more not only daily but hourly temptation the fact that nursing be she vocation have for a long time be dawn on she mind but the way to go to syrium do not seem open and the lord have other work for she almost by the same post there arrive two letter one from mrs ranyard so well know as the originator of the london bible mission suggest that she should go and help she in the great work of superintend and train the bible woman the other from a philanthropic gentleman unfold a plan for a propose nurse ' home in connection with a infirmary and ask if she after a few month ' special training would become its superintendent thus while one door be shut two other unexpectedly open to she but which should she enter this be the question which she prayerfully debate she wish to lay out she life to the best interest for god and both scheme have special attractiveness to she the one because of its intensely spiritual work the other because of she love for nursing and the boundless possibility for good there might be in training nurse she fear however that as superintendent of the nurse ' home she might be fetter in more definite christian work she feel she must be leave in no uncertainty on this point in she letter reply to the gentleman who have write to she she say : -- you send I the ground plan of the building but i would ask be its foundation and corner stone to be christ and he crucify the only savior be the christian training of the nurse to be the primary and hospital skill the secondary object i ask not that all should be of one christian denomination but what i do ask be that jesus the god-man and he finished work of salvation for all who believe on he should be the basis and the bible the book of the institution if this be you end and aim then will i gladly pass through any course of training to be fit to help in you work soon after write this letter she bid farewell to kaiserswerth she plan be to go first to london to consult with miss nightingale and other friend as to she future the seven month in germany have be most happy one and she be ever thankful for the time she have spend there she fully see the great need of christian training institution in those day the evangelical protestant church unlike the romanist who for many century have largely avail themselves of it be not alive to the importance of the ministry of woman there be no institution in england where christian woman could be train to work for christ that work of all other the most important and some to secure the training they long for and could not get elsewhere have even enter roman catholic sisterhood time be change now thank god and although there be still the need of more there be many institution where christian woman can be thoroughly and efficiently train for service of different kind at home and abroad chapter iv in london slum as we have already see agne jone distrust she power to rule this fact add to she mother 's dislike to she enter a hospital determine she for the present at least to join mr ranyard in the work of the bible mission for she know that while she would be relieve she friend of some of the burden of she work

illustration : -rrb- she happy work in london be bring to a premature conclusion by a telegram announce that she sister be ill of fever in rome follow by another beg she to go to she at once a journey thither be not such a easy one then as it be now but after arrange all she work so as to give mr ranyard as little trouble as possible agne bravely undertake it a heavy storm be encounter at marseille where she embark for italy and this delay she arrival in rome so that on reach there she find she sister out of danger a cousin however who have form one of the party have fall ill of the same fever and need careful nursing so that she find she hand full and as the recovery of both invalid be slow she determine to give up she london work and devote herself to they some month be spend in italy but she strength which have be greatly try by the work in london again become enervate and she nursing duty be at a end she propose that she should go to switzerland and visit the deaconess ' institution there this plan she carry out and visit several of the swiss institution which she consider compare unfavourably with kaiserswerth both in organization and spiritual tone she visit besides some of those in germany and at mannedorf have the joy of spend several day with that wonderful woman of faith dorothea trudel all she experience have now go to prove that she special gift be hospital work and on rejoin she mother she definitely lay before she she wish to devote herself to the work of nursing and with she consent enter into a correspondence with miss nightingale with the idea of enter st thoma 's hospital as a nightingale probationer it be very clear that all through she life she be satisfy to be do the next thing whatever that next thing should be which be point out to she by the guide of god 's holy spirit she never run counter to she mother 's wish know that no blessing could be expect when the command honor thy father and thy mother be not observe but when home no longer need she she be glad to enter the larger field to which god have open the way chapter v hospital ward it have be say that every woman be by nature more or less a nurse but like most saying it be by no mean always true many who possess the gentleness and sympathy which be so necessary in nurse the sick yet lack the ready nerve deftness and promptitude who have not behold the sad spectacle of woman anxious to help yet helpless because of they ignorance and want of training that will be a happy day when a course of training in nursing though it be but a short one be consider a necessary part of every woman 's education miss nightingale truly say there be no such thing as amateur nursing three-fourth of the whole mischief in woman 's life arise from they except themselves from the rule of training consider needful for man agne jone be a bear nurse but although she have have many opportunity both at fahan and at kaiserswerth of develop she talent she would not attempt to teach other what she have not thoroughly grasp herself the post in liverpool of superintendent of the training school of nurse for the poor be still open to she and in spite of she fear that she lack the capacity to govern have many attraction for she and so she say i determine at least to try to come to st thoma 's hospital and to see whether in so great a work as that of training true-hearted god-fearing nurse there be not some niche for I if every one shrink back because incompetent who will ever do anything ` lord here be i send I ' let no one think that the resolve cost she nothing as a matter of fact it mean give up a great deal but to follow in the step of he who freely give up all for we she cheerfully surrender she lovely irish home for the dreary wall of a london hospital where she companion be as a rule neither christian in the true sense of the word nor she equal in society yet who that know the lord jesus as a living bright reality can talk of sacrifice to know the need of the lord 's poor be sufficient for she and she count nothing too much to give up joyfully for he and he nor be this choice which she feel to be a life-choice a thought but of yesterday not long after she go to kaiserswerth she have as she herself write much watching of a poor die man sit alone by he in that little room day after day it go to my heart to hear some of he request refuse and to see the food give he so unfitted to he state and i sit there and think ` if these be the trial of the sick in a institution conduct on christian principle oh how must it be in those institution in we own land where no true charity be in the heart of most of the head or hand that work they ' and i then and there dedicate myself to do what i could for ireland in its workhouse infirmary and hospital she feel too that although she could do good service for she lord in ordinary christian work she could do still better if possess as she do a god-given talent for nursing she could like she master both speak a word in season and minister to the need of the body so st thoma 's be enter enter with the hope and prayer that both amongst nurse and patient god would use she and use she he do as he do all who cry lord what wilt thou have I do and then watch for the opportunity to do it it be not long before she seek and gain permission to establish a bible class for the other nightingale nurse which prove a great blessing to several of they in she ward too she be often able to speak a word for christ to the patient she be very happy in she busy life write i be so growingly happy in it and so fond of nay work of its importance she become more and more convinced and in a letter write from barnet where she be spend a few happy day with she friend mr and mr pennefather she say : -- _ my work _ i more and more feel it for the worst thing only make I realize how christian and really good nurse be need but it be to ireland that she thought ever turn and it be of work in ireland that she be think even while training in london for by this very training she hope to be the better fit for work in she own beloved country ireland be ever my bourn she write and again : -- my heart be ever in ireland where i hope ultimately to work after a year at st thoma 's and a short visit home she return to london to take the superintendence of a small hospital in connection with the deaconess ' institution in burton crescent here she have all the nursing to do as there be but few patient and she have great joy in minister to they i trust she write in a letter to she aunt i be gain a quiet influence with my patient they be my great pleasure and again : i be very happy here among my patient and often feel god have send I here i have two revival patient one have find peace before she come the other be seek it and to both i can talk then i have a poor woman with cancer who like I to speak of jesus whom i believe she truly love so you see i be not without work a short time at this hospital and a few month as superintendent at the great northern hospital end she work in london the work at the latter try she much both in body and mind for not only do the whole responsibility of it rest upon she shoulder but owe to the inexperience of she assistant most of the nursing devolve on she as well one patient who be critically ill she be oblige for six week to nurse entirely both by night and day nervous debility be the natural consequence of such overwork and a deafness from which she have suffer at kaiserswerth so much increase that the doctor order she to rest that be not immediately possible as there be no one to take she place and when at last a successor have be find and she be able to return home she be so weary both in body and mind that she fail to find she usual delight in the loveliness of fahan a few week ' stay however in the brace air near the giant 's causeway restore she to she wonted health the winter be pass at she home rest quietly in preparation for the work in liverpool of which the offer have be already mention in the spring of 1865 she leave for ever the old familiar spot with its beautiful hill and glen and its cottage to many of whose inmate she have be the means of bring comfort and peace liverpool with its needy poor and its many difficult problem claim she for the last three year of she life chapter vi amongst the pauper in the year 1698 william iii state in a speech that : -- workhouse under a prudent and good management will answer all the end of charity to the poor in regard to they soul and body they may be make properly speak nursery for religion virtue and industry but could the good king who anticipate so many advantage from workhouse have only see we poor law institution a hundred and fifty or sixty year later he would have be pained to learn how far they have fall short of he sanguine expectation the sick and helpless be entrust to the care of woman who be pauper themselves and of a low class and be for the most part in the workhouse through loss of character be find to be almost incapable of training rough they be and in many case brutal as well while they roughness and brutality be intensify by the free use of intoxicant they language be terrible and not only do they quarrel constantly amongst themselves but fight be of frequent occurrence to endure such treatment and to witness such scene be the daily lot of a sick pauper who know also that when dead he would have little better than the burial of a dog since it be the common custom in many workhouse to bury corpse naked with no cover but a few shaving throw over the body little wonder be it that the poor when overtake by age or disease shrink from the thought of enter a place which to they seem worse than a prison choosing rather to die without attention than to be treat in such a barbarous manner it seem strange that it be so long after a great reformation have be work in the management of we prison that any one be find to lift up a voice in behalf of the much enduring inmate of we workhouse there seem to be no one who could spare a thought for the thousand of sick and poor in these institution but it be the old story of out of sight out of mind for if only the evil have be apparent we english nation with its love of justice would have see it right long before workhouse be to be find all over the land yet the public seem not at all curious much less interested in the question whether they be properly manage or not the guardian be often ignorant man and be very slow to admit visitor perhaps from a foreshadow suspicion of the exposure which be in store for they and the consequent necessity and expense of change so that we need not wonder that the opposition which be call forth when first the evil of the workhouse system be expose be tremendous and that the task of awaken real interest seem well nigh hopeless in the liverpool workhouse the state of thing be no worse than in many other and in many respects it be not so bad there be a good committee and therefore there be nothing like the wholesale starvation and cruelty which exist in too many other workhouse there be also some measure of thoughtful care for the sick one for agne jone in a letter write after she first visit say : -- there seem care for the patient too a few plant and flower _ illustrate news _ picture on the wall and a ` silent comforter ' in each ward not the utterly desolate look one often meet in such place still there be no trained nurse and it be impossible for any committee however zealous to counteract all the evil of pauper nursing the need for reform be great and happily for liverpool and for the country at large there be not only eye to see the need but a mind which have grasp the only solution of the difficulty and a large and sympathetic heart which prompt the hand to open wide the purse to accomplish it for mr william rathbone ever foremost in all scheme for ameliorate the condition of the poor and needy have long be alive to the necessity of substitute for pauper nurse train pay one he it be who not only suggest the change but offer himself to bear the whole expense of the scheme for three year feel assure that by that time the guardian would be so convinced of its practical good that they would adopt it permanently have obtain the committee 's consent to the trial of he plan mr rathbone offer the post of lady superintendent to agne jone then at the great northern hospital in london after consultation with miss nightingale and mr wardroper the lady superintendent of st thoma 's hospital and receive they approval and also the promise of twelve nightingale nurse from st thoma 's for she staff she accept it still there be a delay of some month which be partly due to the nurse ' need of further training and partly to the imperative necessity that she should have entire rest in order to recruit the strength which have be so sorely overtax at the great northern hospital she do not therefore enter on she duty until march 31 1865 even then she begin she new and untried work in much tremble and with great distrust of herself though she trust in she savior never fail it often seem strange she write that i who have so little self-reliance and would like every step direct be oblige to take such a independent position and yet i have be so lead that i could not help it and i only trust i may be more and more lead to look to the guidance of the ever-present and all-wise heavenly friend after she arrival she be still oblige to wait some week for the advent of she staff consist of twelve nightingale nurse and four probationer but although she be not yet in possession of the rein of government and so be debar from do anything in the way of nursing she be yet allow free access to the ward be only prohibit to speak on religion to the roman catholic patient so the intervene time be not lose for she find many opportunity of bring cheer and comfort to sad and weary heart and of point lost one to the sinner 's savior agne jone be not one of those who be always seek for some great thing to do and ignore the many small opportunity of service which lie ready to hand she be quite content since the larger field be not yet open to she to occupy a smaller one in a letter to she aunt she write very characteristically : -- i be try and succeed more and more in fix my eye on all the little thing we shall be able to do i believe in this be we safety do the daily _ little _ as opportunity be give and leave the issue with god it be the _ individual _ influence we shall have the individual relief and the individual help for mind and body that will be ours if it be he will he can make other see the many little as one great whole or they may see nothing do while we have the comfort of the little we know have be do the nurse and probationer arrive in the middle of may and then work begin in good earnest the post of lady superintendent be by no mean a sinecure at 530 every morning she might have be see unlock the door for the kitchen-women she be often round the ward at 60 and all through the busy day until 110 at night she be keep fully employ give out store superintend she nurse preside at meal and visit patient besides all the hundred-and-one duty and call which fall to one in the like position she unselfishness be as conspicuous as ever and she never think of spare herself in any way she joy be to make the life of other bright and happy the patient be quick to discover the benefit of the new _ régime _ instead of the old system of roughness and neglect they find now a very different order of thing as nurse perfectly train with soft voice and gentle footfall pass from bed to bed ministering to the sick and die interesting and helpful book for those who be well enough to read find they way into the ward flower -- for agne jone who love intensely all god 's work in nature have great faith in the ministry of flower -- be there to give brightness in the midst of depressing surroundings visit from friend be render more easy christmas be make happy with special festivity indeed she seem always to be plan something to cheer the sick under she care she very soon begin Sunday evening bible reading in the ward where there be only protestant patient many crowd in even romanist whom she be not allow to invite and listen with rapt attention the late-comer slip off they shoe lest they should disturb she after nearly two year ' work she commence daily evening bible reading have a attendance of from twenty to thirty while on the Sunday evening there be often more than a hundred it be no wonder that such devotion meet with a ready response from the sad and friendless and that she loving sympathy evoke love from the seemingly unloving let we follow she as she pass through the ward a thorough lady quiet and self-possessed she command respect from even the roughest and all look up with eager expectancy hope for just one word from she here be a old man whose brighten face show how welcome be she visit as she stop we hear he murmur i never have a friend in all my life till i come here you be my only friend another who be draw very near to the gate of death take she hand in he say : -- i want to take leave of you -- i never tell you before but do you remember speaking of the ` gift of god be eternal life through jesus christ we lord ' i get that gift then and when she have go a poor man may be hear say to the nurse : -- the lady can never know what she have do for I i think i be in heaven when she come she nurse be thoroughly one with she how could they be otherwise when she be so thoughtful and considerate for they before introduce they to they ward she commend they to god in prayer ask he blessing on they and they work she have a bible read for they but not content with speak to they collectively she would frequently talk to they individually of the savior she so love although she never pass over they fault they be sure of she ready sympathy in they trouble and as they pour they into she ear she would say have you tell jesus so the success of the work be a astonishment to all the patient could at first scarcely understand why the nurse do not swear at they like they former one the police wonder as they see woman able to deal with those whom they have find utterly untameable while the committee be so pleased with the success of the experiment that a year before the specify time they decide permanently to adopt the system of trained nurse but such work be not without its trial during the first year there be great difficulty with the ex-pauper woman who be be train many who seem to be do well return to they drunken habit dirt disorder insubordination and grumble have to be contend with the vilest sin be practice even by child and so shameful be the conduct of many of the inmate that agne jone say i can only compare it to sodom and wonder how god stay he hand from smite the isolation from home and friend be a trial in itself while she anxiety about she work be so great that she scarcely allow herself a holiday a further trouble be that from morning till night she be never alone it be small cause for wonder that with such a terrible strain overtax nerve and strength should result in depression a fact only reveal by she journal for to other she be ever bright and it be often say of she she be like a sunbeam a life live at high pressure can not long continue without fail partly or altogether and the end come at last in the beginning of 1868 there be much fever and sickness of various kind there be three hundred patient above the normal number while the nursing staff be reduce by illness a nurse who have be ill with bronchitis develop symptom of typhus and agne jone fear that she life might be sacrify be she remove to the fever ward give up she bedroom to she sleep herself on the floor of she sitting-room she be soon attack by the same disease for a week she progress very favourably then dangerous symptom show themselves and finally inflammation of both lung many be the touch inquiry from the patient of how be the lady nurse and friend watch anxiously the terrible progress of the disease much prayer be make but the lord have need of he servant who have be so faithful to the trust commit to she here for a more perfect service and at the age of thirty-five she pass away peacefully into the brightness of he presence in the early morning of February 19 1868 the beginning to she of a glorious day which should know no twilight gloom on the follow Friday when the coffin be carry into the hall and place in its case ready for removal across the irish channel the landing and stair be fill with patient who have creep there from the ward to see the last of one who have bring so much happiness into they wretched life and when she be carry to she last resting-place in the picturesque churchyard of fahan within sound of the ripple water of lough swilly she be follow as be fitting by nearly the whole population many of whom could thank god for blessing which she have be the means of bring to they until the resurrection morning she might be hide from the eye of those who love she but none who know she could ever forget she hear the testimony of one of the workhouse official to the writer more than twenty-five year after when the question do you remember miss jone be ask remember she i should think i do i could never forget she she use to have a bible class on Sunday afternoon and on a week-day evening in that little vestry belong to the church she begin it for the nurse but there be only about fifteen of they then and so she use to let we officer go as well if we like i use to love it for it be beautiful to see she sit there so homely and nice and then she use to pray with we and expound the scripture oh it be a real help i can tell you but it be a wonder to I how she live those last few week of she life you see the cholera break out and

the pursuit of the world as she have formerly do she husband do not fully sympathise with the change in she view but he see enough of the sinful emptiness of mere gaiety to make he refrain from insist upon she take part in its pursuit more than this he give every facility to she for carry out she wish even when he could not understand the spirit which be they motive when in geneva after she bible

to this period of she spiritual life in these term some one have make the remark that deep conviction of sin be almost invariably the beginning of the work of god in the soul : i do not quite agree with that statement and do not think it be by any mean always the case in my own case i believe that for two year i be a save sinner a believer in jesus christ and yet that during all that time i do not see the exceed sinfuluess of sin i believe in a general way that i be a sinner who deserve the punishment of a righteous god i believe that whosoever come to jesus christ should he save but i have no deep sense of sin of my sin since then i believe that i have pass through almost every phase of christian experience that i have ever read or hear of and now i have such a sight of my own utter vileness and unworthiness that i feel that the great and holy god might well set he heel on I so to speak and crush I into nothing this sense of absolute unworthiness be always a feature of she life a useless log be the term she apply to herself one means of profit which lady huntly much enjoy be she intercourse with a friend of bygone day miss helen home they be now both walk in the same way the

wicked well may i say with job ' i abhor myself and repent in dust and ash ' a day lose though well begin more peace more clear belief but alas not less indifference not less hardness of heart great idleness after breakfast little or nothing do o lord deliver I from pride and vanity and make I a humble and devoted follower of the meek and lowly jesus he indeed be we peace another unprofitable day but when alas be any day otherwise with I sin of the week : unbelief proceeding from pride of reason selfishness carelessness hardness of heart vanity evil speak these extract be sufficient to show that there be a very severe introspection -- a very real shrink from sin and sense of unworthiness some of the fault she lament seem to other remarkably absent in the duchess evil speaking for example be about the last thing she could be accuse of there be no one more careful of the character of those with whom she have to do this short diary also show she busily occupy in attend to member of she

she make a practice of take copious note of the sermon the note be copy out carefully during the week this note-taking -- sometimes a slight embarrassment to the preacher -- be a great help to the hearer as at least two sermon a week be thus note there must have be a great mass of manuscript before the thirty year be expire amongst those whose sermon she much enjoy be mr howel of long acre mr harington evan and mr blunt of chelsea good work be promote by the duke and duchess at the cost of much self-denial the duke 's predecessor have leave the estate heavily burden the consequence be that they be put under trust only a limited income be allow to the duke this make contribution to charitable object less ample than they would otherwise have be but generous help be bestow that cost the giver something to give the duchess set she heart on building and endow a chapel in connection with the church of england to render this possible the duke propose to sell some of he horse for the same purpose the duchess leave a golden vase value at # 1200 to be sell to quote she own word to explain what result from this charitable idea : the duchess of beaufort hearing of my vase thought of she diamond ear-ring which she get I to dispose of for a chapel in wale and she diamond make I think of my jewel and as the duke have always be most anxious for the chapel he agree with I that stone be much prettier in a chapel wall than round one 's neck and so he allow I to sell # 600 's worth or rather what bring that for they cost more than double the chapel be go on nicely and i have still enough jewel leave to help to endow it if no other way should open i do think i may with confidence hope for a blessing on this it be no sacrifice to I whatever except as it be one to the duke who be

new opportunity of meeting with the lord 's people and speaking of the glad tiding of great joy have cause the delay in write i now know what fine climate be and the country and view be beautiful but above all there be a field of usefulness that we could not have at nice and a open door for the gospel altogether no tongue can tell the goodness of the lord to we he be let I get glimpse both of he love and he glory in the face of jesus christ such as i have never have before and all this with such peace in outward circumstance be it not marvellous you need not be alarm about my ` exposition '

they seem to have much warmer feeling the course of event in the life of the duchess in scotland seem to have be very even and not very full of startling incident during the last year of she life she personal piety be mature and she work of usefulness be multiply she much delighted in the ministry of dr rainy who leave huntly in 1853 after a sojourn there of four year i wish much you have hear we three last sermon from mr rainy i never hear any more useful striking and impressive i be particularly strike by the way he bring out the necessity of take up the cross in these day in a real give up of self self-love self-righteousness self-pleasing ix quicken spiritual life the year 1859 be remember as a season of remarkable quickening of spiritual life in america and ireland and later in scotland such a movement could not fail to attract the attention of the duchess of gordon who live so entirely in the presence of the spirit be able to realize the workings around she huntly lodge be always ready to receive any who be busy with the spread of the good tiding mr macdowall grant mr brownlow north and mr reginald radcliffe be amongst the evangelist who be welcome visitor as they go about they work of love in January 1859 and in the follow month there be impressive gathering of minister who meet to bring themselves to the attainment of a nearer walk with god and to strive for the awakening of they people in January 1860 there be a conference on a still larger scale twenty-four minister stay at the lodge whilst other find hospitality elsewhere there be a unmistakable quicken on all side it be suggest to the duchess by mr duncan matheson who have be she missionary in the district for some year that a great assembly might be gather together for two or three day in one of she park the matter be carefully weigh by one who shrink from anything like undue novelty or unsound sensationalism but when once she be convince that it be god 's way she hesitate no longer what the world would think be a light consideration with she invitation be send by the duchess to minister and layman of all denomination in england and scotland the spot choose be the castle park the date the Wednesday and Thursday of the third week in July there be provision make for accommodate the expect guest in the lodge itself and all the adjoining house the duchess fill she school with store for the minister and they family and all whom they might choose to invite no expense of thought or labor be spare but there be one thing that might have render all the careful arrangement of no avail the rain have be fall for week and there seem no prospect of its cessation happily the fear be disappoint from the time the people begin to assemble until after the forenoon train on the last day have carry away the last of those who have linger to the close of the assembly there be not a drop of rain the great day of the gathering be especially bright it seem as if god the great creator be specially smile on this effort for he glory and the everlasting welfare of he creature the place choose for the gathering be most suitable there be two or three place like amphitheatre on which the hearer could sit everything have be arrange so carefully by those whose heart be thoroughly in the work that the duchess be able to note after the great gathering be over -- truly there be not one thing out of place or unseemly eternity will unfold the result the assembly be characterise by much freedom and power in the speaker by refreshing and lively joy and thanksgiving in the lord 's people by the awakening of many of the dead and by holy liberty grant to those that be bind the number at this meeting in 1860 be about 7000 meeting of a similar character be hold in the three follow year in one or more of these the number reach 10000 about the last of the great assembly the duchess write -- _ August _ 1863 i can not but wonder to see these meeting increase in number and interest every year not as a rendezvous for a pleasant day in the country but really very solemn meeting where the presence of the lord be feel and the power of he spirit manifest i trust that i have be somewhat awaken by the preaching of we own minister which have be very striking indeed x the end be peace at the beginning of 1861 the duchess be bring almost to death 's door to use the word of she biographer she be visit with a severe and all but fatal illness which be inscribe by the lord 's own hand with all the character of the believer 's death-bed except that he bring she up again from the gate of the grave and prolong she precious life for three year more so alarming be the illness that she make all arrangement for she departure hence various remembrance be set aside for she relative and friend and direction be give that certain letter should be write for the promotion of the welfare of some whose interest she have at heart on the evening of she attack she ask she friend to repeat the hymn one there be above all other oh how he love she then observe that she have be depress for some time with a sense of she many sin but that the lord be now give she tranquil and joyful rest she often speak of the manner in which she soul be comfort and that never-forgotten night it be thus describe by dr moody stuart who be for many year she close friend : there be nothing of the nature of a dream or trance but as she lay sleepless there appear as if really before she eye a white scroll unrolled glisten with unearthly brightness and with flood of vivid light ever flow over it write at the head of the scroll in large bright letter of gold she read this inscription : -- ` the lord we righteousness ' all she darkness be dispel in a moment with the glorious word the spirit imprint on she heart and conscience the fresh seal of the pardon of all she sin she believe and know that the lord jesus christ be of god make unto she ` righteousness ' and that he blood have make she whiter than snow she soul enter in a moment into perfect rest the peace of god that passeth all understand now keep she heart and mind through christ jesus and she rejoice in the full assurance that for she to die that night be to depart and be for ever with the lord day after day pass on and she still live all she thought and word be about she lord and the spiritual welfare of those around she she servant be a special care to she as she be not allow to see they individually she send they a message that they must not be content with trust in a general way to the mercy of god but that each of they must be find in the lord we righteousness if they would be save throughout the illness she mind be keep in perfect peace be emphatically stay upon she lord one can well understand how prayer would be offer up for she by many that the value life might be spare if it be god 's will during the time of she slow and partial recovery she occupy herself with learn hymn she lay up a store which become in later month a great source of comfort to she the hymn which she first commit to memory be one of she chief favorite : -- a mind at perfect peace with god the second verse she specially value : -- by nature and by practice far how very far from god yet now by grace bring nigh to he through faith in jesus ' blood as we have say recovery be only slow and partial she try to learn the lesson design in this lengthen out of she earthly sojourn i think my life be spare she say to give the opportunity of devote for a longer period my influence and substance to the cause of christ but i see now a deeper meaning in it there be more personal holiness to be attain more nearness to christ and more joy hereafter through a deeper work here in my heart she old habit of early rising have of course to be abandon but the hour of the early morning be well spend especially in meditation and intercessory prayer as a example of the thing that occupy she mind we may quote word speak to she maid as she enter the room : i awake very early this morning and have be very happy and busily engage my thought have be much occupy with three thing all so different yet each need god 's help to-day the first be the queen 's visit to aberdeen to inaugurate the prince consort 's memorial the second be mr m 's prayer meeting in london in a hall that have be a dancing-saloon in he parish and -lrb- refer to a young

gentleman pray for I as if i be something and i be nothing i must speak about that before the next meeting she invite all to meet again on the 10th of the follow month she little think that they would indeed meet on that day but only to lay she remains to rest the 10th of February be to be she funeral day the fatal illness be of very short duration and give she little opportunity of thought she be sorrow over she inability to think when the word be give to she : i be poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon I yes that be it be she reply in thy strong arm i lay I down she be quote from the follow hymn which she frequently repeat to she friend and which she say more than any other express the present state of she feeling : -- i only enter on the rest obtain by labor do i only claim the victory by he so dearly win and lord i seek a _ holy _ rest a victory over sin i seek that thou alone should ` st reign o'er all without within in quietness then and confidence savior my strength shall be and ' _ take _ I for i can not _ come _ ' be still my cry to thee in thy strong hand i lay I down so shall the work be do for who can work so wondrously as a almighty one work on then lord
