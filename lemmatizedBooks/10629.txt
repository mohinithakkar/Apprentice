permission reproduce without substantial change i the nation and the party i do not believe in the perfection of the british constitution as a instrument of war it be evident that there be something in you machinery that be wrong these be the word of the late marquis of salisbury speaking as prime minister in he place in the house of lord on the 30th of January 1900 they amount to a declaration by the british government that it could not govern for the first business of a government be to be able to defend the state of which it have charge that be to carry on war strange to say the people of england be undisturbed by so strike a admission of national failure on the 16th of march 1909 come a new declaration from another prime minister mr asquith on the introduction of the navy estimate explain to the house of common that the government have be surprise at the rate at which the new german navy be be construct and at the rapid growth of germany 's power to build battleship but it be the first duty of a government to provide for national security and to provide means to foresee a government that be surprise in a matter relate to war be already half defeat the creation of the german navy be the creation of means that could be use to challenge great britain 's sea power and all that depend upon it there have be no such challenge these hundred year no challenge so formidable as that represent by the new german fleet these three hundred year it bring with it a crisis in the national life of england as great as have ever be know yet this crisis find the british nation divide unready and uncertain what leadership it be to expect the dominant fact the fact that control all other be that from now onwards great britain have to face the stern reality of war immediately by way of preparation and possibly at any moment by way of actual collision england be drift into a quarrel with germany which if it can not be settle involve a struggle for the mastery with the strongest nation that the world have yet see -- a nation that under the pressure of necessity have learn to organise itself for war as for peace that set its best mind to direct its preparation for war that have a army of four million citizen and that be of one mind in the determination to make a navy that shall fear no antagonist a conflict of this kind be the test of nation not only of they strength but also of they righteousness or right to be it have two aspect it be first of all a quarrel and then a fight and if we be to enter into it without fear of destruction we must fulfil two condition : in the quarrel we must be in the right in the fight we must win the two condition be inseparable if there be a doubt about the justice of we cause we shall be divide among ourselves and it will be impossible for we to put forth the strength of a united nation have we really a quarrel with germany be she do we any wrong some of we people seem to think so though i find it hard to say in what the wrong consist be we do she any wrong some german seem to think so and it behove we if we can to find out what the german grievance be suppose that there be a cause for quarrel hide at present but sooner or later to be reveal what likelihood be there that we shall be able to make good we case in arm and to satisfy the world and posterity that we deserve to win germany can build fleet as fast as we can and although we have a start the race will not be easy for we she have the finest school of war that ever exist against which we have to set a admiralty so much mistrust that at this moment a committee of the cabinet be inquire into its efficiency be it not time for we to find the answer to the question raise by lord salisbury nine year ago to ascertain what it be that interfere with the perfection of the british constitution as a instrument of war and to set right what be wrong with we machinery the truth be that we have cease to be a nation we have forget nationhood and have become a conglomerate of class party faction and sect that be the disease the remedy consist in reconstitute ourselves as a nation what be a nation the inhabitant of a country constitute as one body to secure they corporate be and well-being the nation be all of we and its government be trusteeship for we all in order to give we peace and security and in order that in peace and security we may make each other 's life worth live by do each the best work he can the nature of a nation may be see by distinguish it from the other nation outside and from the party within the mark of a nation be sovereignty which mean as regard other nation the right and the power to make peace with they or to carry on war against they and which mean as regard those within the right and the power to command they a nation be a people constitute as a state maintain and support a government which be at once the embodiment of right and the wielder of force if the right represent by the government be challenge either without or within the government assert it by force and in either case dispose to any extent that may be require of the property the person and the life of its subject a party accord to the classical theory of the british constitution be a body of man within the state who be agree in regard some measure or some principle as so vital to the state that in order to secure the adoption of the measure or the acceptance of the principle they be willing to sink all difference of opinion on other matter and to work together for the one purpose which they be agree in regard as fundamental the theory of party government be base on the assumption that there must always be some measure or some principle in regard to which the citizen of the same country will differ so strongly as to subordinate they private conviction on other matter to they profound conviction in regard to the one great question it be a theory of permanent civil war carry on through the form of parliamentary debate and popular election and indeed the two traditional party be the political descendant of the two side which in the seventeenth century be actually engage in civil war for the ordinary purpose of the domestic life of the country the system have its advantage but they be couple with grave drawback the party system destroy the sincerity of we political life and introduce a dangerous dilettantism into the administration of public business a deliberative assembly like the house of common can reach a decision only by there be put from the chair a question to which the answer must be either yes or no it be evidently necessary to the sincerity of such decision that the answer give by each member shall in every case be the expression of he conviction regard the right answer to the question put if every member in every division be to vote accord to he own judgment and conscience upon the question put there would be a perpetual circulation of member between the aye to the right and the no to the leave the party system prevent this it oblige each member on every important occasion to vote with he leader and to follow the instruction of the whip in this way the division of opinion produce by some particular question or measure be as far as possible make permanent and dominant and the freedom of thought and of deliberation be confine within narrow limit thus there creep into the system a element of insincerity which have be enormously increase since the extension of the franchise and the consequent organization of party in the country thirty or forty year ago the caucus be establish in all the constituency in each of which be form a party club association or committee for the purpose of secure at parliamentary election the success of the party candidate the association club or committee consist as regard its active or work portion of a very small percentage of the voter even of its own party but it be affiliate to the central organization and in practice it control the choice of candidate what be the result that the affair of the nation be entirely give over to be dispute between the two organise party whose leader be compel in shape they policy and in think about public affair to consider first and foremost the probable effect of what they will do and of what they will say upon the active member of the caucus of they own party in the constituency the frame of mind of the member of the caucus be that of man who regard the opposite caucus as the adversary but the adversary of a nation can only be another nation in this way the leader of both party the man who fill the place which in a well-organised nation would be assign to statesman be place in it position in which statesmanship be almost impossible a statesman would be devote solely to the nation he would think first second and third of the nation security would be he prime object and upon that basis he would aim at the elevation of the character and of the life of the whole population but we leader can not possibly think first second and third of the nation they have to think at least as much of the next election and of the opinion of they supporter in this way they attention be divert from that observation of other nation which be essential for the maintenance of security moreover they be oblige to dwell on subject directly intelligible to and appreciable by the voter in the constituency and be thereby hinder from give either the time or the attention which they would like to any of those problem of statesmanship which require close and arduous study for they solution the wonder be in these condition that they do they work so well and maintain undiminished the reputation of english public man for integrity and ability yet what at the present moment be the principle about which party be divide be there any measure or any principle at issue which be really vital to great britain be there anything in dispute between the party which would not be abandon and forget at the first shot fire in a war between england and a great continental nation i be convince that that first shot must cause the scale to fall from man 's eye that it must make every one realize that we division be comparative trifle and that for year we have be waste time over they but if we wait for the shock of war to arouse we to a sense of reality and to estimate we party difference at they true value it will be too late we shall wring we hand in vain over we past blindness and the insight we shall then have obtain will avail we nothing the party system have another consequence which will not stand scrutiny in the light of reality it be dilettantism in the conduct of the nation 's principal business some of the chief branch of the executive work of government be the province of special art and science each of which to master require the work of a lifetime of such a kind be the art of carry on war whether by sea or land the art of conduct foreign relation which involve a knowledge of all the other great state and they policy and the direction of the educational system which can not possibly be properly conduct except by a experienced educator but the system give the direction of each of these branch to one of the political leader form the cabinet or govern committee and the practice be to consider as disqualify from membership of that committee any man who have give he life either to war to foreign policy or to education yet by its efficiency in these matter the nation must stand or fall by all mean let we be chary of lightly make change in the constitution or in the arrangement of government but if the security and continue existence of the nation be in question must we not scrutinise we method of government with a view to make sure that they accord with the necessary condition of success in a national struggle for existence i be well aware that the train of think to which i have try to give expression be unpopular and that most people think that any modification of the traditional party system be impracticable but the question be not whether the system be popular it be whether it will enable the country to stand in the hour of trial if the system be inefficient and fail to enable the nation to carry on with success the function necessary for its preservation and if at the same time it be impracticable to change it then nothing can avert ruin from this country yet i believe that a very large number of my countryman be in fact think each for himself the thought which i be try to express they be perhaps not the active member of the caucus of either party but they be man who if they see the need will not shrink from exertion or from sacrifice which they believe to be useful or necessary to the country it be to they that the follow page be a appeal i appeal with some confidence because what i shall try to show to be necessary be not so much a change of institution as a change of spirit not a new constitution but a return to a true way of look at public and private life my contention be that the future of england depend entirely upon the restoration of duty of which the nation be the symbol to its proper place in we life ii defeat great britain be drift unintentionally and half unconsciously into a war with the german empire a state which have a population of sixty million and be better organise for war than any state have ever be in modern time for such a conflict which may come about to-morrow and unless a great change take place must come about in the near future great britain be not prepare the food of we people and the raw material of they industry come to this country by sea and the article here produce go by sea to they purchaser abroad every transaction carry with it a certain profit which make it possible if the exporter and the manufacturer who supply he can make no profit they can not continue they operation and the man who work for they must lose they employment suppose great britain to be to-morrow at war with one or more of the great power of europe all the sailing vessel and slow steamer will stop run lest they should be take by hostile cruiser the fast steamer will have to pay war rate of insurance and to charge extra freight steamer ready to leave foreign port for this country will wait for instruction and for news on the outbreak of war therefore this over-sea traffic must be greatly diminish in volume and carry on with enormously increase difficulty the supply of food would be considerably reduce and the certainty of the arrival of any particular cargo would have disappear the price of food must therefore rapidly and greatly rise and that alone would immediately impose very great hardship on the whole of the work class of which a considerable part would be drive across the line which separate modern comfort from the starvation margin the diminution in the supply of the raw material of manufacture would be much greater and more immediate something like half the manufacturer of great britain must close they work for want of material but will the other half be able to carry on foreign order they can not possibly execute because there can be no certainty of the delivery of the goods and even if they could the price at which they could deliver they with a profit would be much higher than it be in peace for with a diminish supply the price of raw material must go up the cost of marine insurance must be add together with the extra wages necessary to enable the workman to live with food at a enhance price thus the effect of the greater difficulty of sea communication must be to destroy the margin of profit which enable the british capitalist to carry on he work while the effect of all these cause take together on the credit system upon which we whole domestic economy repose will perhaps be understand by business man even if this state of thing should last only a few month it certainly involve the transfer to neutral of all trade that be by possibility transferable foreign country will give they order for cotton woollen and iron goods to the united state france switzerland and austro-hungary and at the conclusion of peace the british firm that before supply they if they have not in the meantime become bankrupt will find that they customer have form new connection the shrinkage of credit would bring a multitude of commercial failure the diminution of trade and the cessation of manufacture a great many more the unemployed would be count by the million and would have to be keep at the public expense or starve if in the midst of these misfortune cause by the mere fact of war should come the news of defeat at sea still more serious consequence must follow after defeat at sea all regular and secure communication between great britain she colony and indium come to a end with the terrible blow to britain 's reputation which defeat at sea must bring what will be the position of the 100000 british in indium who for a century have govern a population of nearly 300000000 what can the colony do to help great britain under such condition for the command of the sea nothing and even if each of they have a first-rate army what would be the use of those army to this country in she hour of need they can not be bring to europe unless the british navy command the sea these be some of the material consequence of defeat but what of its spiritual consequence we have bring up we child in the pride of a great nation and teach they of a empire on which the sun never set what shall we say to they in the hour of defeat and after the treaty of peace impose by the victor they will say : find we work and we will earn we bread and in due time win back the greatness that have be lose but how be they to earn they bread in this country half the employer will have be ruin by the war the other half will have lose heavily and much of the wealth even of the very rich will have go to keep alive the innumerable multitude of starve unemployed these will be advise after the war to emigrate to what country englishman after defeat will everywhere be at a discount word will not describe and the imagination can not realize the suffering of a defeat nation living on a island which for fifty year have not produce food enough for its population the material and spiritual result of defeat can easily be recognize by any one who take the trouble to think about the question though only experience either at first hand or supply by history can enable a man fully to grasp its terrible nature but a word must be say on the social and political consequence inseparable from the wreck of a state whose government have be unable to fulfil its prime function that of provide security for the national life all experience show that in such case man do not take they trouble calmly they be fill with passion they feeling find vent in the action to which they previous current of thought tend the work class long accustom by its leader to regard the capitalist as a class with interest and aim oppose to its own will hardly be able in the stress of unemployment and of famine to change its way of think the mass of the workman follow leader whose judgment may not perhaps be of the soundest but who will undoubtedly sincerely believe that the doctrine with which they have grow up be true may assail the exist social order and lay the blame of they misfortune upon the class which have hitherto have the government of the country in its hand and have supply the leader of both political party the indignation which would inspire this movement would not be altogether without justification for it can not be deny that both political party have for many year regard preparation for war and all that belong to it as a minor matter subordinate to the really far less important question rely upon which each side have seek to win sufficient vote to secure a party majority why do i discuss the hypothesis of british defeat rather than that of british victory because it be the invariable practice of the master of war to consider first the disagreeable possibility and to make provision for they but also because accord to every one of the test which can be apply the probability of defeat for great britain in the present state of europe be exceedingly great rarely have a state unready for conflict be able to stand against a nation organise for war the last of a long series of example be the war between russium and japan in which the vast resource of a great empire be exhaust in the struggle with a state so small as to seem a pigmy in comparison with she giant adversary on the 10th of February 1904 the day when the news reach england that the russo-japanese war have begin i give as follow my reason for think that japan would win : -- the hypothesis of a considerable japanese success at any rate at first be consider rather than its opposite because japan have at present all the mark of a nation likely to do great thing in war it be not merely that she have transform she government and she education have introduce military institution on the german model especially compulsory training and that vivify institution a general staff the present quarrel arise from the deliberate policy of russium pursue aim that be incompatible with every japanese tradition and every japanese hope the whole japanese nation have for year be burn with the sense of wrong inflict by russium and into this war as into the preparation for it the whole people throw itself mind soul and body this be the condition which produce great strategical plan and extreme energy in they execution the japanese force be well organised armed and equipped they be intelligently lead and follow with intelligence of russium there be hardly evidence to show that the cause for which she be fight have touch the imagination or the feeling of more than a small fraction of the population it be the war of a bureaucracy and russium may easily fail to develop either great leading though she officer be instruct or intelligent following of the leader by the rank and file but the russian troops be brave and have always need a good deal of beat substitute great britain for russium and germany for japan in this forecast which have be prove true and every word hold good except two we now know that russium 's policy be not deliberate that she government bungle into the war without know what it be do in just the same way british government have drift blindly into the present difficult relation with germany those in england who would push the country into a war with germany be indeed not a bureaucracy they be merely a fraction of one of the party and do not represent the mass of we people who have no desire for such a war and be so little aware of its possibility that they have never even take the trouble to find out why it may come a larger section of the other party be steep in the belief that force violence and war be wicked in themselves and ought therefore not to be think about it be a prejudice which unless remove may ruin this country and there be no way of dissipate it except that of patient argument base upon observation of the world we live in that way i shall attempt to follow in the next chapter iii force and right ye have hear that it have be say a eye for a eye and a tooth for a tooth : but i say unto you that ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to he the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let he have thy cloke also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with he twain give to he that asketh thee and from he that would borrow of thee turn not thou away ye have hear that it have be say thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy : but i say unto you love you enemy -lrb- matt v 38-44 -rrb- if there be any among we who adopt these word as the govern rule of they life they will certainly cause no difficulty to the state in its military policy whatever that may be and will find they natural place even in time of war to the public good if the whole population be of they way of think and act there would be no need to discuss war a invader would not be resist he troops would be hospitably entertain and treat with affection no opposition would be make to the change of government which he would introduce and the tax which he impose would be cheerfully pay but there would be no state except that create by the invader and the problem of conduct for those live the life describe would arise when the state so set up issue its ordinance require every able-bodied man to become a competent soldier there be those who believe or fancy they believe that the word i have quote involve the principle that the use of force or of violence between man and man or between nation and nation be wicked to the man who think it right to submit to any violence or to be kill rather than to use violence in resistance i have no reply to make the world can not conquer he and fear have no hold upon he but even he can carry out he doctrine only to the extent of allow himself to be ill-treated as i will now convince he many year ago the people of south lancashire be horrify by the fact report in a trial for murder in a village on the outskirts of bolton live a young woman much like and respect as a teacher in one of the board school on she way home from school she be accustom to follow a footpath through a lonely wood and here one evening she body be find she have be strangle by a ruffian who have think in this lonely place to have he wicked will of she she have resist successfully and he have kill she in the struggle fortunately the murderer be catch and the fact ascertain from circumstantial evidence be confirm by he confession now the question i have to ask of the man who take he stand on the passage i have quote from the gospel be : what would have be you duty if you have be walk through that wood and come upon the girl struggle with the man who kill she this be a crucial instance which i submit utterly destroy the doctrine that the use of violence be in itself wrong the right or wrong be not in the employment of force but simply in the purpose for which it be use what the case establish i think be that to use violence in resistance to violent wrong be not only right but necessary the employment of force for the maintenance of right be the foundation of all civilised human life for it be the fundamental function of the state and apart from the state there be no civilisation no life worth live the first business of the state be to protect the community against violent interference from outside this it do by require from its subject whatever personal service and whatever sacrifice of property and of time may be necessary and resistance to these demand as well as to any injunction whatever lay by the state upon its subject be unconditionally suppress by force the mark of the state be sovereignty or the identification of force and right and the measure of the perfection of the state be furnish by the completeness of this identification in the present condition of english political thought it may be worth while to dwell for a few moment upon the beneficent nature of this dual action of the state within its jurisdiction the state maintain order and law and in this way make life worth live for its subject order and law be the necessary condition of man 's normal activity of they industry of they ownership of whatever the state allow they to possess -- for outside of the state there be no ownership -- of they leisure and of they freedom to enjoy it the state be even the basis of man 's character for it set up and establish a minimum standard of conduct certain act be define as unlawful and punish as crime other act though not criminal be yet so far subject to the disapproval of the court that the man who do they may have to compensate those who suffer injury or damage in consequence of they these standard have a dual origin in legislation and precedent legislation be a formal expression of the agreement of the community upon the definition of crime and common law have be produce by the decision of the court in action between man and man every case try in a civil court be a conflict between two party a struggle for justice the judgment be justice apply to the particular case the growth of english law have be through a endless series of conflict and the law of to-day may be describe as a line pass through a series of point represent a infinite number of judgment each the decision of a conflict in court for seven hundred year with hardly a interruption every judgment of a court have be sustain by the force of the state the law thus produce express in legislation and interpret by the court be the foundation of all english conduct and character upon the basis thus lay there take place a perpetual evolution of higher standard in the intercourse of a settle and undisturbed community and of the many society which it contain arise a number of standard of behavior which each man catch as it be by infection from the person with whom he habitually associate and to which he be oblige to conform because if he conduct fall below they he companion will have nothing to do with he every class of society have its notion of what constitute proper conduct and constrain its member to carry on they life so far as they be open to inspection accord to these notion the standard tend constantly to improve man form a ideal of behavior by observe the conduct of the best of they class and in proportion as this ideal gain acceptance find themselves drive to adopt it for fear of the social ostracism which be the modern equivalent of excommunication little by little what be at first a rarely attain ideal become a part of good manners it establish itself as custom and finally become part of the law thus the state in co-operation with the whole community become the educator of its people standard of conduct be form slowly in the best mind and exist at first merely in what plato would have call the intellectual sphere or in what would have be call at a later date in palestine the kingdom of heaven but the strongest impulse of mankind be to realize its ideal its fervent prayer which once utter can never cease be on earth as it be in heaven and the ideal develop in man 's spiritual life gradually take shape in law and become prohibition and injunction back by the force of the state the state however be not a abstraction for english people it mean the united kingdom and if a englishman want to realize what he owe to he country let he look back through its history and see how all that he value in the character of the man he most admire and all that be best in himself have gradually be create and realize through the ceaseless effort of he forefather carry on continuously from the time when the first englishman cross the north sea until the present day other nation have they type of conduct perhaps as good as we own but englishmen value and rightly value the ideal particularly associate with the life of they own country perhaps two of the commonest expression convey peculiarly english view of character we talk of fair play as the essence of just deal between man and man it be a conception we have develop from the national game we describe ideal conduct as that of a gentleman it be a condensation of the best part of english history and a search for a definition of the function of great britain in the moral economy of the world will hardly find a better answer than that it be to stamp upon every subject of the king the character imply in these two expression suppose the british state to be overthrow or to drop from its place among the great power of the world these ideal of character would be discredit and they place would be take by other the justification of the constraint exercise by the state upon its own citizen be the necessity for security the obligation of self-defence which arise from the fact that outside the state there be other state each endowed like itself with sovereignty each of they maintain by force its conception of right the power of the state over its own subject be thus in the last resort a consequence of the existence of other state upon the competition between they rest the order of the world it be a competition extend to every sphere of life and in its acute form take the shape of war a struggle for existence for the mastery or for right iv arbitration and disarmament to some people the place of war in the economy of nation appear to be unsatisfactory they think war wicked and a world where it exist out of joint accordingly they devote themselves to suggestion for the abolition of war and for the discovery of some substitute for it two theory be common the first that arbitration can in every case be a substitute for war the second that the hope of peace would be increase by some general agreement for disarmament the idea of those who regard arbitration as a universal substitute for war appear to be that the relation between state can be put upon a basis resemble that of the relation between citizen in a settle and civilised country like we own in great britain we be accustom to a variety of means for settle disagreement between person there be the law court there be the case in which recourse be have with the sanction of the law court to the inquiry and decision of a arbitrator and in all we sport we be accustom to the presence of a umpire whose duty it be impartially to see that the rule of the game be observe and immediately to decide all point that might otherwise be doubtful the work of a umpire who see that the rule of the game be observe be base upon the consent of the player of both side without that consent there could be no game and the consent will be find to be base upon the fact that all the player be bring up with similar tradition and with like view of the nature of the game where this unity do not exist difficulty constantly arise as be notoriously the case in international sport the attempt have be make with constantly increase success to mitigate the evil of war by the creation of institution in some way analogous to that of the umpire in a game the declaration of london recently publish be a agreement between the principal power to accept a series of rule concern maritime war to be administer by a international prize court the function of a arbitrator usually to decide question of fact and to assess compensation for inconvenience most commonly the inconvenience occasion to a private person by some necessary act of the state also rest upon the consent of the party though in this case the consent be usually impose upon they by the state through some legislative enactment or through the decision of a court the action of a court of law on the other hand do not rest upon the consent of the party in a civil action the defendant may be and very often be unwilling to take any part in the proceedings but he have no choice and whether he like it or not be bind by the decision of the court for the court be the state act in its judicial capacity with a view to insure that justice shall be do the plaintiff allege that the defendant have do he some wrong either by breach of contract or otherwise and the verdict or judgment determine whether or not this be the case and if it be what compensation be due the judgment once give the whole power of the state will be use to secure its execution the business of a criminal court be the punishment of offender whom it be the function of the state to discover to bring to trial and when convict to punish the prisoner 's consent be not ask and the judgment of the court be support by the whole power of the state in the international sphere there be no parallel to the action either of a civil or of a criminal court civil and criminal jurisdiction be attribute of sovereignty and over two independent state there be no sovereign power if therefore it be desire to institute between two state a situation analogous to that by which the subject of a single government be amenable to judicial tribunal the proper way be to bring the two state under one sovereignty this can be effect and be constantly effect by one of two method either the two state federate and form a united state or one of they conquer and annex the other the former process have be see in modern time in the formation of the united state of america : the latter form the substance of the history of civilisation during the first three century before christ when the roman state successively conquer annexed and absorb all the other then exist state surround the basin of the mediterranean the history of no state justify the belief that order and justice can successfully be maintain merely by the action of umpire and of arbitrator every state worth the name have have to rely upon civil and criminal court and upon law enforce by its authority that be upon a series of principle of right express in legislation and upon a organization of force for the purpose of carry those principle into practical effect it appear then that so far from the experience of state justify the view that it be wrong to employ force the truth be that right or law unless support by force be ineffective that the objection in principle to any use of force involve anarchy or the cessation of the state and that the wish to substitute judicial tribunal for war as a means of settle dispute between state and state be a wish to amalgamate under a single government all those state which be to benefit by the substitution the reasonable attitude with regard to arbitration be to accept it whenever the other side will accept it but if the adversary refuse arbitration and insist upon use force what course be open to any state but that of resist force by force arbitration have from the earliest time be prefer in most of those case to which it be applicable that be in case in which there be a basis of common view or common tradition sufficient to make agreement practicable but wherever there have be a marked divergence of ideal or a different standard of right there have be a tendency for each side to feel that to submit its conscience or its conviction of right its sense of what be most sacred in life to a outside judgment would involve a kind of moral suicide in such case every nation repudiate arbitration and prefer to be a martyr in case of need to its sense of justice it be at least a open question whether the disappearance of this feeling would be a mark of progress or of degeneration at any rate it be practically certain that the period when it will have disappear can not at present be foresee the abolition of war therefore involve the abolition of independent state and they amalgamation into one there be many who have hope for this ideal express by tennyson when he dream of the parliament of man the federation of the world that it be the ultimate destiny of mankind to be unite under a single government seem probable enough but it be rash to assume that that result will be reach either by a process of peaceful negotiation or by the spread of the imperfect method of modern democratic government the german empire with its population of sixty million educate by the state discipline by the state rely on the state and command by the state be as potent in comparison with the less disciplined and less organised community which surround it as be in the third century before christ the roman state in comparison with the disunited multitude of greek city the commercial oligarchy of carthage and the half-civilised tribe of gaul and spain unless the other state of europe can rouse themselves to a discipline as sound and to a organization as subtle as those of prussium and to the perception of a common purpose in the maintenance of they independence the union of europe under a single government be more likely to be bring about by the conquer hand of germany than by the extension of democratic institution and of sentimental good understanding proposal for disarmament stand on a entirely different footing from proposal to agree to arbitration the state that disarm renounce to the extent of its disarmament the power to protect itself upon what other power be it suggest that it should rely in the last analysis the suggestion amount to a proposal for the abolition of the state or its abandonment of its claim to represent the right those who propose agreement for disarmament imagine that the suggestion if adopt would lead to the establishment of peace have they consider the natural history of peace as one of the phenomenon of the globe which we inhabit the only peace of any value be that between civilised nation it rest either upon the absence of dispute between they or upon a equilibrium of force during the last few century there have usually be at the end of a great european war a great european congress which have regulate for the time be the matter which be in dispute and the treaty thus negotiate have remain for a long time the basis of the relation between the power it be always a compromise but a compromise more or less acceptable to all party in which they acquiesce until some change either by growth or decay make the condition irksome then come a moment when one or more of the state be dissatisfied and wish for a change when that have happen the dissatisfied state attempt to bring about the change which it desire but if the force with which its wish be likely to be oppose be very great it may long acquiesce in a state of thing most distasteful to it let there be a change in the balance of force and the discontented state will seize the opportunity will assert itself and if resist will use its force to overcome opposition a proposal for disarmament must necessarily be base upon the assumption that there be to be no change in the system that the _ status quo _ be everywhere to be preserve this amount to a guarantee of the decaying and inefficient state against those which be grow and be more efficient such a arrangement would not tend to promote the welfare of mankind and will not be accept by those nation that have confidence in they own future that such a proposal should have be announce by a british government be evidence not of the strength of great britain not of a healthy condition of national life but of inability to appreciate the change which have be produce during the last century in the condition of europe and the consequent alteration in great britain 's relative position among the great power it be long ago remark by the german historian bernhardus that great britain be the first country in europe to revive in the modern world the conception of the state the feudal conception identify the state with the monarch the english revolution of 1688 be a identification of the state with the nation but the nationalisation of the state of which the example be set in 1688 by great britain be carry out much more thoroughly by france in the period that follow the revolution of 1789 and in the great conflict which ensue between france and the european state the principal continental opponent of france be compel to follow she example and in a far greater degree than have ever happen in england to nationalise the state it be to that struggle that we must turn if we be to understand the present condition of europe and the relation of great britain to the european power v the nationalisation of war the transformation of society of which the french revolution be the most striking symptom produce a corresponding change in the character of war by the revolution the french people constitute itself the state and the process be accompany by so much passion and so much violence that it shortly involve the reconstituted nation in a quarrel with its neighbor the germanic empire and prussium which rapidly develop into a war between france and almost all the rest of europe the revolution weaken and demoralise the french army and disorganise the navy which it deprive of almost all its experienced officer when the war begin the regular army be supplement by a great levy of volunteer the mixed force thus form in spite of early success be unable to stand against the well-disciplined army of austrium and prussium and as the war continue while the french troops gain solidity and experience they number have to be increase by a levy _ en masse _ or a compulsory draft of all the man of a certain age into the army in this way the army and the nation be identify as they have never be in modern europe before and in the fifth year of the war a leader be find in the person of general bonaparte who have imbue himself with the principle of the art of war as they have be expound by the best strategist of the old french army and who have thus think out with unprecedented lucidity the method of conduct campaign he mastery of the art of generalship be reveal by he success in 1796 and as the conflict with europe continue he become the leader and eventually the master of france under he impulse and guidance the french army superior to they in number organization and tactical skill crush one after another the more old-fashioned and smaller army of the great continental power with the result that the defeat army under the influence of national resentment after disaster attempt to reorganise themselves upon the french model the new austrian army undertake its revenge too soon and be defeat in 1809 but the prussian endeavor continue and bear fruit after the french disaster in russium of 1812 in the national rise in which prussium support by russium and austrium and assist by the british operation in the peninsula overthrow the french empire in 1814 after the definitive peace defer by the hundred day but finally force upon france on the field of waterloo the prussian government continue to foster the school of war which it have found in the period of humiliation prussian officer train in that school try to learn the lesson of the long period of war which they have pass through what they discover be that war between nation as distinct from war between dynasty or royal house be a struggle for existence in which each adversary risk everything and in which success be to be expect only from the complete prostration of the enemy in the long run they say to themselves the only defense consist in striking you adversary to the ground that be the case a nation must go into war if war should become inevitable with the maximum force which it can possibly produce represent by its whole manhood of military age thoroughly trained organise and equip the prussian government adhere to these idea to which full effect be give in 1866 when the prussian army reorganise in 1860 crush in ten day the army of austrium and in 1870 when in a month from the first shot fire it defeat one half of the french army at gravelotte and capture the other half at sedan these event prove to all continental nation the necessity of adopt the system of the nation in arm and give to they whole male population up to the limit of possibility the training and the organization necessary for success in war the principle that war be a struggle for existence and that the only effective defense consist in the destruction of the adversary 's force receive during the age of napoleon a even more absolute demonstration at sea than be possible on land great britain whether she would or no be draw into the european conflict the neglect of the army and of the art of war into which during the eighteenth century she government have for the most part fall make it impracticable for she to take the decisive part which she have play in the day of william iii and of marlborough in the struggle against the french army she contribution to the land war be for the most part misdirect and futile she expedition to dunkirk to holland and to hanover embarrassed rather than materially assist the cause of she ally but she navy favourably handicap by the breakdown due to the revolution of the french navy eventually produce in the person of nelson a leader who like napoleon have make it the business of he life to understand the art of war he victory like napoleon 's be decisive and when he fall at trafalgar the navy of continental europe which one after another have be press into the service of france have all be destroy then be reveal the prodigious consequence of complete victory at sea which be more immediate more decisive more far-reaching more irrevocable than on land the sea become during the continuance of the war the territory of great britain the open highway along which she ship could pass while it be close to the ship of she adversary across that secure sea a small army be send to spain to assist the national and heroic though miserably organise resistance make by the spanish people against the french attempt at conquest the british government have at last find the right direction for such military force as it possess sir john moore 's army bring napoleon with a great force into the field but it be able to retire to its own territory the sea the army under wellington handle with splendid judgment have to wait long for its opportunity which come when napoleon with the grand army have plunge into the vast expanse of russium wellington march from victory to victory be then able to produce upon the general course of the war a effect out of all proportion to the strength of the force which he command or of that which directly oppose he while france be engage in she great continental struggle england be reap all over the world the fruit of she naval victory of the colony of she enemy she take as many as she want though at the peace she return most of they to they former owner of the world 's trade she obtain something like a monopoly the nineteenth century see the british colony grow up into so many nation and the british administration of indium become a great empire these development be now see to have be possible only through the security due to the fact that great britain during the first half of the nineteenth century have the only navy worth consider in the world and that during the second half its strength greatly preponderate over that of any of the new navy which have be build or be build no wonder that when in 1888 the american observer captain mahan publish he volume the influence of sea power upon history other nation besides the british read from that book the lesson that victory at sea carry with it a prosperity a influence and a greatness obtainable by no other mean it be natural for englishman to draw the moral which be slumber in the national consciousness that england 's independence she empire and she greatness depend upon she sea power but it be equally natural that other nation should draw a different moral and should ask themselves why this tremendous prize the primacy of nation and the first place in the world should for ever belong to the inhabitant of a small island a mere appendage to the continent of europe this question we must try to answer but before enter upon that inquiry i will ask the reader to note the great lesson of the age of napoleon and of nelson it produce a change in the character of war which enlarged itself from a mere dispute between government and become a struggle between nation the instrument use be no longer a small standing army but the able-bodied male population in arm great britain indeed still retain she standing army but for the time she throw she resource without stint into she navy and its success be decisive vi the balance of power we have see what a splendid prize be the result of british victory at sea supplement by british assistance to other power on land a century ago we have now to ask ourselves first of all how it come about that great britain be able to win it and afterwards whether it be award once for all or be merely a challenge cup to be hold only so long as there should be no competitor the answer to the first question be a matter of history england be peculiarly favor by fortune or by fate in the great struggle through which during a period of three hundred year she assert and increase she superiority at sea until a century ago it become supremacy she rarely have to fight alone she first adversary be spain in the conflict with spain she have the assistance of the dutch province when the dutch be strong enough to become she maritime rival she have for a time the co-operation of france then come a long period during which france be she antagonist at the beginning of this epoch william iii accept the british crown in order to be able to use the strength of england to defend he native country holland he work be take up by marlborough whose first great victory be win in co-operation with the imperial commander prince eugene from that time on each of the principal war be a european war in which france be fight both by sea and land she army be engage against continental foe while great britain could devote she energy almost exclusively to she navy in the seven year ' war it be the prussian army which win the victory on land while small british force be enable by the help of the navy to win a empire from france in canada and to lay the foundation of the british empire in indium in the war of american independence great britain for once stand alone but this be the one conflict which contribute little or nothing towards establish the ascendency of the british navy great britain fail of she object because that ascendency be incomplete then come the war of the french revolution and empire in which the british navy be the partner of the austrian prussian russian and spanish army these be the fact which we have to explain we have to find out how it be that so many continental nation whether they like it or not find themselves in fight they own battle help to bring about the british predominance at sea it must be remember that land warfare involve much heavier sacrifice of life than warfare at sea and that though great britain no doubt spend great sum of money not merely in maintain she navy but also in subsidise she ally she could well afford to do so because the prosperity of she over-sea trade due to she naval success make she the richest country in europe the other nation that be she ally might not unnaturally feel that they have toil and that great britain have gather the increase what be the explanation of a co-operation of which in the long run it might seem that one partner have have the principal benefit if two nation carry on a serious war on the same side it may be assume that each of they be fight for some cause which it hold to be vital and that some sort of common interest bind the ally together the most vital interest of any nation be its own independence and while that be in question it conceive of its struggle as one of self-defence the explanation of great britain 's have have ally in the past may therefore be that the independence of great britain be threaten by the same danger which threaten the independence of other power this theory be make more probable by the fact that england 's great struggle -- that of queen elizabeth against spain that of william iii and marlborough against loui xiv and of pitt against napoleon -- be each one of they against a adversary whose power be so great as to overshadow the continent and to threaten it with a ascendency which have it not be check might have develop into a universal monarchy it seem therefore that in the main england in defend she own interest be consciously or unconsciously the champion of the independence of nation against the predominance of any one of they number the effect of great britain 's self-defence be to facilitate the self-defence of other nation and thus to preserve to europe its character of a community of independent state as oppose to that which it might have acquire if there have be no england of a single empire govern from a single capital this be however only half of the answer we want it explain to some extent why england could find other nation co-operate with she and reveal the general nature of the cause which they maintain in common but let we remember the distinction between a quarrel in which the main thing be to be in the right and a fight in which the main thing be to win the explanation just sketch be a justification of england 's policy a attempt to show that in the main she have right on she side that be only part of the reason why she have ally the other part be that she be strong and could help they she have three mode of action she use she navy to destroy the hostile navy or navy and to obtain control of the seaway then she use that control partly to destroy the seaborne trade of she enemy and partly to send army across the sea to attack she enemy ' army it be because she could employ these three mode of warfare and because two of they be not available for other power that she influence on the course of event be so great the question of moral justification be more or less speculative i have treat it here on a hypothesis which be not new though since i propounded it many year ago it have meet with little adverse criticism but the question of force be one of hard fact it be fundamental if england have not be able to win she battle at sea and to help she ally by she war against trade and by she ubiquitous if small army there would have be no need for hypothesis by which to justify or explain she policy she would have long ago lose all importance and all interest except to antiquarian we object be to find out how she may now justify she existence and enough have be say to make it clear that if she be to do that she must not only have a cause good enough to gain the sympathy of other power but force enough to give they confidence in what she can do to help herself and they we be now ready to examine the second question whether or no great britain 's position win a century ago be liable to challenge vii the rise of germany the great event of the nineteenth century in the history of europe be the union of germany into a federal state the secret of prussium 's success in accomplish that union and in lead the federation so create have be the organization of the national energy by a far-seeing government a process begin as a means of self-defence against the french domination of the period between 1806 and 1812 the prussian statesman of those day be not content merely to reorganise the army on the basis of universal service they organise the whole nation they sweep away a ancient system of land tenure in order to make the peasant free and prosperous they establish a system of public education far in advance of anything possess by any other nation they especially devoted themselves to foster industry manufacture and commerce the result of this systematic direction of the national energy by a government of expert continuously support by the patient and methodical diligence of the people have be a constant and remarkable advance of the national prosperity a wonderful development of the national resource and a enormous addition to the national strength for the last forty year it have be the settle policy of the german government that she organised military force should be strong enough in case of need to confront two enemy at once one on either frontier feeling themselves thus stronger than any other european state the german have watch with admiration the growth of the british colony and of british trade it be natural that they should think that germany too might expect to have colony and a great maritime trade but wherever in the world german traveller have go wherever german trader have settle wherever the german government have think of work for a site for a colony everywhere they have meet british influence british trade the british flag in this way have be bring home to they as to no other people the tremendous influence of sea-power they historian have recall to they the successive attempt which have be make in past time by german state to create a navy and to obtain colony attempt which to we own people be quite unknown because they never except in the case of the hanseatic league attain to such importance as to figure in the general history of europe in the period between 1815 and 1870 when the desire for national unity be express by a host of german writer there be not want plea for the creation of a german navy several attempt be make in those day to construct either a prussian or a german fleet but the time be not ripe and these attempt come to nothing the constitution of the empire promulgate in 1871 embody the principle that there should be a german navy of which the emperor should be commander-in-chief and to the creation of that navy the most assiduous labor have be devote the plan pursue be in the first instance to train a body of officer who should thoroughly understand the sea and maritime warfare and for this purpose the few ship which be first build be send on long voyage by way of train the crew and of give the officer that self-reliance and initiative which be think to be the characteristic mark of the officer of the british navy in due time be found the naval college of kiel design on a large scale to be a great school of naval thought and of naval war the history of maritime war be diligently study _ especially _ of course the history of the british navy the professor and lecturer make it they business to explore the workings of nelson 's mind just as german military professor have make themselves pupil of napoleon and not until a clear and consistent theory of naval war have be elaborate and make the common property of all the officer of the navy be the attempt make to expand the fleet to a scale think to be proportionate to the position of germany among the nation when it be at length determine that that constructive effort should be make the plan be think out and embody in a law regulate the construction for a number of year of a fleet of predetermined size and composition to be use for a purpose define in the law itself the object be to have a fleet of sufficient strength and of suitable formation to be able to hold its own in case of need even against the greatest maritime power in other word germany think that if she prosperity continue and she superiority in organization over other continental nation continue to increase she might find england 's policy back by england 's naval power a obstacle in the way of she natural ambition after all no one can be surprise if the german think germany as well entitle as _ any other _ state to cherish the ambition of be the first nation in the world it have for a century be the rational practice of the german government that its chief strategist should at all time keep ready design for operation in case of war against any reasonably possible adversary such a set of design would naturally include a plan of operation for the case of a conflict with great britain and no doubt every time that plan of operation be re-examine and revise light would be throw upon the difficulty of a struggle with a great maritime power and upon the means by which those difficulty might be overcome the british navy be so strong that unless it be mismanage the german navy ought to have no chance of overcome it yet germany can not but be anxious in case of war to protect herself against the consequence of maritime blockade and of the effort of a superior british navy to close the sea to german merchantman accordingly the law which regulate the naval shipbuilding of the german empire lay down in its preamble that -- germany must possess a battle-fleet so strong that a war with she would even for the greatest naval power be accompany with such danger as would render that power 's position doubtful in other word a war with great britain must find the german navy too strong for the british navy to be able to confine it to its harbor and to maintain in spite of it complete command of the sea which border the german coast as german strategist continuously accept the doctrine that the first object of a fleet in war be the destruction of the enemy 's fleet with a view to the consequent command of the sea the german navy act be equivalent to the declaration of a intention in case of conflict to challenge the british navy for the mastery this be the answer to the question ask at the beginning of the last chapter whether the command of the sea be a permanent prize or a challenge cup germany at any rate regard it as a challenge cup and have resolve to be qualify if occasion should arise to make trial of she capacity to win it viii nationhood neglect what have be the effect upon great britain of the rise of germany be there any cause of quarrel between the two people and the two state that germany have give herself a strong military organization be no crime on the contrary she be oblige to do it she could not have exist without it the foundation of she army be lay when she be suffer all the agony of conquest and oppression only by a tremendous effort at the cost of sacrifice to which england 's experience offer no analogy be she able to free herself from the over-lordship of napoleon king william i expand and reorganise he army because he have pass through the bitter humiliation of see he country impotent and humble by a combination of austrium and russium whether bismarck 's diplomacy be less honorable than that of the adversary with whom he have to deal be a question to which different answer may be give but in a large view of history it be irrelevant for beyond all doubt the settlement effect through the war of 1866 and 1870 be sound settlement and leave the german nation and europe in a healthier condition than that which precede they the unity of germany be win by the blood of she people who be and be rightly resolve to remain strong enough and ready to defend it come what may it be not for englishman who have talk for twenty year of a two-power standard for they navy to reproach germany for maintain she army at a similar standard have she not do so the peace of europe would not have be preserve nor be it possible on any ground of right or justice to cavil at germany 's purpose to be able in case of need to defend herself at sea the german admiral rosendahl discuss the british and german navy and the proposal for disarmament write in the _ deutsche revue _ for June 1909 : -- if england claim and think permanently necessary for she a absolute supremacy at sea that be she affair and no sensible man will reproach she for it but it be quite a different thing for a great power like the german empire by a international treaty suppose to be bind for all time expressly to recognize and accept this in principle assuredly we do not wish to enter into a building competition with england on a footing of equality but a political agreement on the basis of the unconditional superiority of the british fleet would be equivalent to a abandonment of we national dignity and though we do not speak broadly wish to dispute england 's predominance at sea yet we do mean in case of war to be or to become the master on we own coast there be not a word in this passage which can give just cause of offence to england or to englishman that there have be and still be a good deal of mutual ill-feeling both in germany and in england can not be deny rivalry between nation be always accompany by feeling which be all the stronger when it be instinctive and therefore though not unintelligible apt to be irrational but what in this case be really at the bottom of it there have no doubt be a number of matter that have be discuss between the two government and though they have for the most part be settle the manner in which they have be raise and press by german government have cause they to be regard by british minister and to a less extent by the british people as source of annoyance as so many diplomatic pin-prick the manners of german diplomacy be not suave suavity be no more part of the bismarckian tradition than exactitude but after all the manners of the diplomatist of any country be a matter rather for the nation whose honor they concern than for the nation to which they have give offence they only partially account for the deep feeling which have grow up between great britain and germany the truth be that england be disturb by the rise of germany which she people in spite of abundant warning do not foresee and have not appreciate until the moment when they find themselves outstrip in the race by a people whom they have be accustom to regard with something of the superiority with which the prosperous and polished dweller in a capital look upon he country cousin from the farm fifty year ago germany in english estimation do not count the name be no more than a geographical expression great britain be the one great power she alone have colony and indium she as good as monopolise the world 's shipping and the world 's trade as compare with other country she be immeasurably rich and prosperous she population during the long peace interrupt only by the crimean war and the indian mutiny have multiply beyond man 's wildest dream she manufacturer be amass fortune she industry have no rival the victorian age be think of as the beginning of a wonderful new era in which among the nation england be first and the rest nowhere the temporary effort of the french to create a modern navy disturb the sense of security which exist and give rise to the volunteer movement which be feel to be a marvellous display of patriotism there be attempt to show that british self-complacency be not altogether justified the warning of those who look below the surface be read and admire few writer be more popular than carlyle ruskin and matthew arnold but all three hold aloof from the current of public life which flow in the traditional party channel there be no effort to revive the conception of the nation as the organised state to which every citizen be bind the source and center of all man 's duty accordingly every man devote himself to he own affair of which the first be to make money and the second to enjoy life those who be rich enough find they amusement in parliament which be regard as the most interesting club in london and in its debate of which the charm for those who take part in they lie in the fact that for success not knowledge of a subject but fluency readiness and wit be require the great event take place in the world the war in bohemia in france and in turkey add a certain interest to english life because they furnish to the newspaper matter more exciting than any novelist could produce and in this way gratify the taste for sensation which have be acquire both by rich and poor that these event mean anything in particular to the british nation be not likely to be realize while that nation be in fact non-existent and have resolve itself into forty million individual each of they live for he own end slightly enlarged to include he family he literary or scientific society perhaps he cricket club and on Sunday morning he church or chapel there be also a widespread interest in politics by which be mean the particular fad cherish by one 's own caucus to the exclusion of the nation 's affair it be more or less understand that the army the navy and foreign policy be not to be make political question while forty million english people have thus be spend they life self-centred content to make they live to enjoy life and to behave kindly to they fellow there have grow up in germany a nation a people of sixty million who believe that they belong together that they country have the first call on they whose child go to school because the government that represent the nation bid they who go for two year to the army or the navy to learn war because they know that if the nation have to fight it can do so only by they fight for it they government think it be its business to be always improve the organization of its sixty million for security for knowledge for instruction for agriculture for industry for navigation thus after forty year of common effort for a common good germany find itself the first nation in europe more than hold its own in every department of life and eagerly survey the world in search of opportunity the englishman while he have be live he own life and as i think improve in many respects have at the same time be admire the british empire and discover with pride that a number of new nation have grow up in distant place form of people whose father or grandfather emigrate from great britain he remember from he school lesson or read in the newspaper of the greatness of england in past century and naturally feel that with such a past and with so great a empire exist to-day he country should be a very great power but as he discover what the actual performance of germany be and become acquaint with the result of she effort in science education trade and industry and the way in which the influence of the german government predominate in the affair of europe he be puzzle and indignant and feel that in some way great britain have be surpass and outdo the state of the world which he think exist in which england be the first nation and the rest nowhere have completely change while he have be attend to he private business he politics and he cricket and he find the true state of the world to be that while in industry england have hard work to hold she own against she chief rival she have already be pass in education and in science that she army good as it be be so small as scarcely to count and that even she navy can not keep its place without a great and unexpected effort yet fifty year ago england have on she side all the advantage but one she be forget nationhood while germany be revive it the british people instead of organise themselves as one body the nation have organise themselves into two body the two political party england 's one chance lie in recover the unity that have be lose which she must do by restore the nation to its due place in man 's heart and live to find out how that be to be do we must once more look at europe and at england 's relation to europe ix new condition it have be see how as a result of the struggle with napoleon england from 1805 onward be the only sea power remain in europe and indeed with the exception of the united state the only sea power in the world one of the result be that she have for many year the monopoly of the whole ocean not merely for the purpose of war but also for the purpose of trade the british mercantile marine continue through the greater part of the nineteenth century to increase its preponderance over all other and this remarkable and probably quite exceptional growth be greatly favor by the civil war in america during which the mercantile marine of the united state receive from the action of the confederate cruiser a damage from which it have never recover in the year immediately follow 1805 great britain in self-defence or as a means of continue the war against france in regard to which she resource for operation on land be limit have recourse to the operation of blockade by which the sea be close as far as possible to enemy merchantman while great britain prohibit neutral ship from carry enemy goods napoleon reply by the attempt to exclude british goods from the continent altogether and indeed the pressure produce by great britain 's blockade compel napoleon further to extend he domination on the continent thus the other continental state find themselves between the devil and the deep sea they have to submit to the domination of napoleon on land and to the complete ascendency of great britain on the water which surround they coast the british claim to supremacy at sea be unanimously resent by all the continental state which all suffer from they but in all case the national resentment against french invasion or french occupation of territory be greater than the resentment against the invisible pressure exercise by the british navy in the war of liberation though great britain be the welcome ally of all the state that be fight against france the pressure of british sea power be none the less disagreeable and in the year of peace which follow the british monopoly of sea power of sea-carriage of manufacture industry and of international trade be equally dislike by almost all the nation of europe protective duty be regard as the means of foster national industry and of shelter they against the overpowering competition of british manufacture the british claim to the dominion of the sea be regard as unfounded in right and be in principle as strongly denounce as have be the territorial domination of france the mistress of the sea be regard as a tyrant whom it would be desirable if it be possible to depose and there be many who think that as the result of a conflict in which the final success have be gain by the co-operation of a number of state act together the gain of great britain which as time go on be see to be grow into a world-wide empire have be out of proportion to the service she have render to the common cause meantime during the century which have elapse since the last great war there have be a complete change in the condition of intercourse between nation at sea and of maritime warfare it have come about gradually almost imperceptibly so that it could hardly be appreciate before the close of the nineteenth century but it be vital to great britain that she people should understand the nature of the transformation the first thing to be observe be that the british monopoly of shipping and of oversea trade have disappear great britain still have by far the largest mercantile marine and by far the greatest share in the world 's sea traffic but she no longer stand alone germany the united state france norway italy and japan all have great fleet of merchant ship and do a enormous some of they a rapidly increase seaborne trade a large number of the principal state import the raw material of manufacture and carry on import and export on a large scale the railway system connect all the great manufacturing centre even those which lie far inland with the great port to and from which the line of steamer ply the industrial life of every nation be more than ever dependent upon its communication with and by the sea and every nation have become more sensitive than ever to any disturbance of its maritime trade the preponderance of the british navy be therefore a subject of anxiety in every state which regard as possible a conflict of its own interest with those of great britain this be one of the reason why continental state have during the last quarter of a century be dispose to increase they fleet and they naval expenditure in the declaration of pari renew and extend by the declaration of london the maritime state have agree that in any future war enemy goods in a neutral ship be to be safe from capture unless the ship be run a blockade which must be effective whether great britain be well or ill advise in accept this rule be a question which it be now useless to discuss for the decision can not be recall and the rule must be regard as establish beyond controversy its effect be greatly to diminish the pressure which a victorious navy can bring to bear upon a hostile state it deprive great britain of one of the most potent weapon which she employ in the last great war to-day it would be impracticable even for a victorious navy to cut off a continental state from seaborne traffic the port of that state might be blockade and its merchant ship would be liable to capture but the victorious navy could not interfere with the traffic carry by neutral ship to neutral port accordingly great britain could not now even in the event of naval victory be hers exercise upon a enemy the pressure which she formerly exercise through the medium of the neutral state any continental state even if its coast be effectively blockade could still with increase difficulty obtain supplies both of raw material and of food by the land route through the territory of its neutral neighbor but great britain herself as a insular state would not in case of naval defeat have this advantage a decisive defeat of the british navy might be follow by a attempt on the part of the enemy to blockade the coast of great britain though that would no doubt be difficult for a very large force would be require to maintain a effective blockade of the whole coast-line it be conceivable that a enemy might attempt in spite of the declaration of london to treat as contraband food destine for the civil population and this course ought to be anticipate but in the military weakness of great britain a enemy whose navy have gain the upper hand would almost certainly prefer to undertake the speedier process of bring the war to a end by land a army in great britain a landing on a coast so extensive as that of this island can with difficulty be prevent by force on land because troops can not be move as quickly as ship the war in the far east have show how strong such a army might be and how great a military effort would be need to crush it the proper way to render a island secure be by a navy strong enough to obtain in war the control of the surround sea and a navy unable to perform that function can not be regard as a guarantee of security the immediate effect of naval victory can hardly ever again be so far-reaching as they be a century ago in the epoch of mast and sail at that time there be no foreign navy except in european water and in the atlantic water of the united state when therefore the british navy have crush its european adversary its ship could act without serious opposition upon any sea and any coast in the world to-day the radius of action of a victorious fleet be restrict by the necessity of a supply of coal and therefore by the secure possession of coaling-station at suitable interval along any route by which the fleet propose to move or by the goodwill of neutral in permit it to coal at they depot to-day moreover there be navy establish even in distant sea in the pacific for example be the fleet of japan and of the united state and these in they home water will probably be too strong to be oppose by european navy act at a vast distance from they basis it seem likely therefore that neither great britain nor any other state will in future enjoy that monopoly of sea power which be grant to great britain by the circumstance of she victory in the last great war what i have call the great prize have in fact cease to exist and even if a adversary be to challenge the british navy the reward of he success would not be a naval supremacy of anything like the kind or extent which peculiar condition make it possible for great britain to enjoy during the nineteenth century it would be a supremacy limited and reduce by the existence of the new navy that have spring up from these consideration a very important conclusion must be draw in the first place enough victory at sea be in case of war as indispensable to great britain as ever for it remain the fundamental condition of she security yet its result can hardly in future be as great as they be in the past and in particular it may perhaps not again enable she to exert upon continental state the same effective pressure which it formerly render possible in order therefore to bring pressure upon a continental adversary great britain be more than ever in need of the co-operation of a continental ally a navy alone can not produce the effect which it once do upon the course of a land war and its success will not suffice to give confidence to the ally nothing but a army able to take its part in a continental struggle will in modern condition suffice to make great britain the effective ally of a continental state and in the absence of such a army great britain will continue to be as she be to-day without continental ally a second conclusion be that we people while strain every nerve in peace to ensure to they navy the best chance of victory in war must carefully avoid the conception of a dominion of the sea although in fact such a dominion actually exist during a great part of the nineteenth century the new condition which have grow up during the past thirty year have make this ideal as much a thing of the past as the medival conception of a roman empire in europe to whose titular head all king be subordinate x dynamics -- the question of might if there be a chance of a conflict in which great britain be to be engage she people must take think in time how they may have on they side both right and might it be hard to see how otherwise they can expect the contest to be decide in they favor as i have say before in the quarrel you must be in the right and in the fight you must win the quarrel be the domain of policy the fight that of strategy or dynamics policy and strategy be in reality inextricably interwoven one with another for right and might resemble more than be commonly suppose two aspect of the same thing but it be convenient in the attempt to understand any complicated subject to examine its aspect separately i propose therefore in consider the present situation of great britain and she relation to the rest of the world to treat first of the question of force to assume that a quarrel may arise and to ascertain what be the condition in which great britain can expect to win and then to enter into the question of right in order to find out what light can be throw upon the necessary aim and method of british policy by the conclusion which will have be reach as to the use of force the nationalisation of state which be the fundamental fact of modern history affect both policy and strategy if the state be a nation the population associate as one body then the force which it can use in case of conflict represent the sum of the energy of the whole population and this force can not and will not be use except as the expression of the will of the whole population the policy of such a state mean its collective will the consciousness of its whole population of a purpose mission or duty which it must fulfil with which it be identify and which therefore it can not abandon only in case this national purpose meet with resistance will a people organise as a state enter into a quarrel and if such a quarrel have to be fight out the nation 's resource will be expend upon it without limitation the chief fact in regard to the present condition of europe appear to be the very great excess in the military strength of germany over that of any other power it be due in part to the large population of the german empire and in part to the splendid national organization which have be give to it it can not be assert either that germany be not entitle to become united or that she be not entitle to organise herself as efficiently as possible both for peace and for war but the result be that germany have a preponderance as great if not greater than that of spain in the time of philip ii or of france either under loui xiv or under napoleon every nation no doubt have a right to make itself as strong as it can and to exercise as much influence as it can on the affair of the world to do these thing be the mission and business of a nation but the question arise what be the limit to the power of a single nation the answer appear to be that the only limit be those set by the power of other nation this be the theory of the balance of power of which the object be to preserve to europe its character of a community of independent state rather than that of a single empire in which one state predominate without attribute to germany any wrong purpose or any design of injustice it must be evident that she very great strength must give she in case of dispute always possible between independent state a corresponding advantage against any other power whose view or whose intention should not coincide with hers it be the obvious possibility of such dispute that make it incumbent upon great britain to prepare herself in case of disagreement to enter into a discussion with germany upon equal term only upon such preparation can great britain base the hope either of avert a quarrel with germany or in case a quarrel should arise and can not be make up by mutual agreement of settle it by the arbitrament of war upon term accordant with the british conception of right great britain therefore must give herself a national organization for war and must make preparation for war the nation 's first business until a reasonable security have be attain the question be what weapon be now available for great britain in case of a disagreement with germany lead to conflict in the old war as we have see she have three mode of action she use she navy to obtain control of the sea-way and then she use that control partly to destroy the sea-borne trade of she enemy and partly to send army across the sea to attack she enemy ' army by the combination of these three mode of operation she be strong enough to give valuable help to other power and therefore she have ally whose assistance be as useful to she as hers to they to-day as we have see the same condition no longer exist the british navy may indeed hope to obtain control of the sea-way but the law of maritime war as it have be settle by the declaration of pari and of london make it impracticable for great britain to use a naval victory even if she win it in such a way as to be able commercially to throttle a hostile power while the british military force available for employment on the continent be so small as hardly to count in the balance the result be that great britain 's power of action against a possible enemy be greatly reduce partly in consequence of change in the law of war but perhaps still more in consequence of the fact that while other power be organise for war as nation england in regard to war be still in the condition of the eighteenth century rely upon a small standing army a purely professional navy and a large half-trained force call territorial neither ready for war nor available outside the unite kingdom there be a school of politician who imagine that great britain 's weakness can be supplement from other part of the british empire that be a idea which ought not to be receive without the most careful examination and in my judgment must except within narrow limit be reject in a war between great britain and a continental state or combination the assistance which great britain could possibly receive from the king 's dominion beyond the sea be necessarily limit such a war must in the first place be a naval contest towards which the most that the colony can contribute consist in such addition to great britain 's naval strength as they may have give during the preceding period of peace what take together they may do in this way would no doubt make a appreciable difference in the balance of force between the two contend navy but in the actual struggle the colony would be little more than spectator except in so far as they port would offer a certain number of secure basis for the cruiser upon which great britain must rely for the protection of she sea-borne trade even if all the colony possess first-rate army the help which those army could give would not be equal to that obtainable from a single european ally for a war against a european adversary great britain must rely upon she own resource and upon such assistance as she might obtain if it be feel by other power on the continent not only that the cause in which she be fight be vital to they and therefore call for they co-operation but also that in the struggle great britain 's assistance would be likely to turn the scale in they favor can we expect that history will repeat itself and that once more in case of conflict great britain will have the assistance of continental ally that depend chiefly on they faith in she power to help they one condition of such a alliance undoubtedly exist -- the desire of other nation for it the predominance of germany on the continent rest like a nightmare upon more than one of the other state it be increase by the alliance of austrium another great military empire -- a empire moreover not without a fine naval tradition and as be prove by the recent announcement of the intention of the austrian government to build four dreadnought resolve to revive that tradition against the combination of germany and austrium russium which have hardly begin to recover from the prostration of she defeat by japan be helpless while france with a population much smaller than that of germany can hardly look forward to a renewal single-handed of the struggle which end for she so disastrously forty year ago the position of italy be more doubtful for the sympathy of she people be not attract by austrium they look with anxiety upon the austrian policy of expansion towards the aegean and along the shore of the adriatic the estrangement from france which follow upon the french occupation of tuni appear to have pass away and it seem possible that if there be a chance of success italy might be glad to emancipate herself from german and austrian influence but even if germany 's policy be such that russium france and italy be each and all of they desirous to oppose it and to assert a will and a policy of they own distinct from that of the german government it be very doubtful whether they strength be sufficient to justify they in a armed conflict especially as they hypothetical adversary have a central position with all its advantage from a military point of view the strength of the central position consist in the power which it give to its holder to keep one opponent in check with a part of he force while he throw the bulk of they into a decisive blow against another this be the situation of to-day on the continent of europe it can not be change unless there be throw into the scale of the possible opponent of german policy a weight or a force that would restore the equality of the two party the british navy however perfect it may be assume to be do not in itself constitute such a force nor could the british army on its present footing restore the balance a small standing army able to give its ally assistance officially estimate at a strength of 160000 man will not suffice to turn the scale in a conflict in which the troops available for each of the great power be count no longer by the hundred thousand but by the million but if great britain be so organise that she could utilise for the purpose of war the whole of she national resource if she have in addition to the navy indispensable for she security a army equal in efficiency to the best that can be find in europe and in number to that maintain by italy which though the fifth power on the continent be most nearly she equal in territory and population the equilibrium could be restore and either the peace of europe would be maintain or in case of fresh conflict there would be a reasonable prospect of the recurrence of what have happen in the past the maintenance against a threaten domination of the independence of the european state the position here set forth be grave enough to demand the close attention of the british nation for it mean that england might at any time be call upon to enter into a contest likely enough to take the form of a struggle for existence against the greatest military empire in the world support by another military empire which be itself in the front rank of great power while the other european state would be look on comparatively helpless but this be by no mean a full statement of the case the other power might not find it possible to maintain a attitude of neutrality it be much more probable that they would have to choose between one side and the other and that if they do not consider great britain strong enough to help they they may find it they interest and indeed may be compel to take the side of great britain 's adversary in that case great britain would have to carry on a struggle for existence against the combined force of the continent that even in this extreme form the contest would be hopeless i for one be unwilling to admit if great britain be organise for war and able to throw she whole energy into it she might be so strong that she overthrow even by unite europe would by no means be a foregone conclusion but the determine preparation which would make she ready for the extreme contingency be the best and perhaps the only means of prevent its occurrence xi policy -- the question of right i have now give reason for my belief that in case of conflict great britain owe to she lack of organization for war would be in a position of some peril she have not create for herself the means of make good by force a cause with which she may be identify but which may be dispute and she weakness render it improbable that she would have ally there remain the second question whether in the absence of might she would at least have right on she side that depend upon the nature of the quarrel a good cause ought to unite she own people and only in behalf of a good cause could she expect other nation to be on she side from this point of view must be consider the relation between great britain and germany and in the first place the aim of german policy a nation of which the army consist of four million able-bodied citizen do not go to war lightly the german ideal since the foundation of the empire have be rather that hold up for great britain by lord rosebery in the word : peace secure not by humiliation but by preponderance the first object after the defeat of france in 1870 be security and this be seek not merely by strengthen the army and improve its training but also by obtain the alliance of neighbouring power in the first period the attempt be make to keep on good term not only with austrium but with russium when in 1876 disturbance begin in the balkan peninsula germany while give austrium she support exert herself to prevent a breach between austrium and russium and after the russo-turkish war act as mediator between russium on one side and austrium and great britain on the other so that without a fresh war the european treaty of berlin be substitute for the russo-turkish treaty of san stefano after 1878 russium become estrange from germany whereupon germany in 1879 make a defensive alliance with austrium to which at a later date italy become a party this triple alliance serve for a quarter of a century to maintain the peace against the danger of a franco-russian combination until the defeat of russium in manchurium and consequent collapse of russium 's military power remove that danger shortly before this event the british agreement with the french government have be negotiate by lord lansdowne the french be very anxious to bring morocco into the sphere of french influence and to this the british government see no objection but in the preamble to the agreement as well as in its text by way of declaration that great britain have no objection to this portion of the policy of france word be use which might seem to imply that great britain have some special rights in regard to morocco the second article of the declaration of April 8 1904 contain the follow clause : the government of the french republic declare that they have no intention of alter the political status of morocco he britannic majesty 's government for they part recognize that it appertain to france more particularly as a power whose dominion be conterminous for a great distance with morocco to preserve order in that country and to provide assistance for the purpose of all administrative economic financial and military reform which it may require this clause seem to be open to the interpretation that great britain assume a right to determine what nation of europe be best entitle to exercise a protectorate over morocco that would involve some british superiority over other power or at any rate that great britain have a special right over morocco a sort of suzerainty of which she could dispose at will germany dislike both this claim and the idea that france be to obtain special influence in morocco she be herself anxious for oversea possession and sphere of influence and appear to have think that if morocco be to become a european protectorate she ought to have a voice in any settlement the term in which the english consent to the french design be express be construe by the german 's as involve on the part of great britain just that kind of supremacy in regard to oversea affair which they have for so many year be learn to dislike at any rate when the moment convenient to she come germany put she veto upon the arrangement which have be make and require that they should be submit to a european conference france be not prepare to renew the struggle for existence over morocco while germany appear not unwilling to assert she will even by force accordingly germany have she way the annexation of bosnium and herzegovina by austria-hungary again afford a opportunity for the exercise of germany 's preponderance in 1878 the treaty of berlin have authorise austria-hungary to occupy and administer the two province without limitation of time and bosnium and herzegovina have since then practically be austrian province for the male population have be subject to compulsory service in the austrian army and the soldier have take the oath of allegiance to the emperor it be not clear that any of the great power have other than a formal objection to the annexation the objection namely that it be not consistent with the letter of the treaty of berlin the british government point out that by international agreement to which austria-hungary be a party a european treaty be not to be modify without the consent of all the signatory power and that this consent have not be ask by austria-hungary the british view be endorse both by france and russium and these three power be in favor of a european conference for the purpose of revise the clause of the treaty of berlin and apparently also of give some concession to servium and montenegro the two small state which for reason altogether disconnect with the formal aspect of the case resent the annexation neither of the western power have any such interest in the matter as to make it in the least probable that they would in any case be prepare to support they view by force while austrium by mobilise she army show that she be ready to do so and there be no doubt that she be assure in case of need of germany 's support the russian minister of foreign affair publicly explain to he countryman that russia be not in a condition to carry on a war accordingly in the moment of crisis the russian government withdraw its opposition to austro-hungarian policy and thus once more be reveal the effect upon a political decision of the military strength readiness and determination of the two central power a good deal of feeling be arouse at any rate in great britain by the disclosure in the case of bosnium and herzegovina as well as in the earlier case of morocco of germany 's policy and in the later negotiation of she determination to support austria-hungary by force yet he would be a rash man who on now look back would assert that in either case a british government would have be justify in armed opposition to germany 's policy the bearing of germany and austria-hungary in these negotiation end as they do at the time when the debate on the navy estimate disclose to the british public the serious nature of the competition in naval shipbuilding between germany and great britain be to a large class in this country a startling revelation of the too easily forget fact that a nation do not get its way by ask for it but by be able and ready to assert its will by force of arm in case of need there be no reason to believe that the german government have any intention to enter into a war except for the maintenance of rights or interest hold to be vital for germany but it be always possible that germany may hold vital some right or interest which another nation may be not quite ready to admit in that case it behove the other nation very carefully to scrutinise the german claim and its own way of regard they and to be quite sure before enter into a dispute that its own view be right and germany 's view wrong as well as that it have the means in case of conflict of carry on with success a war against the german empire if then england be to enter into a quarrel with germany or any other state let she people take care that it arise from no obscure issue about which they may disagree among themselves but from some palpable wrong do by the other power some wrong which call upon they to resist it with all they might the case allege against germany be that she be too strong so strong in herself that no power in europe can stand up against she and so sure of the assistance of she ally austrium to say nothing of the other ally italy that there be at this moment no combination that will venture to oppose the triple alliance in other word germany be think to have acquire a ascendency in europe which she may at any moment attempt to convert into supremacy great britain be think of at any rate by she own people as the traditional opponent of any such supremacy on the continent so that if she be strong enough it might be she function to be the chief antagonist of a german ascendency or supremacy though the doubt whether she be strong enough prevent she from fulfil this role but there be another side to the case the opinion have long be express by german writer and be very widespread in germany that it be great britain that claim a ascendency or supremacy and that germany in oppose that supremacy be make herself the champion of the european cause of the independence of state this german idea be plainly express twenty-five year ago by the german historian wilhelm mller who write in a review of the year 1884 : england be the opponent of all the maritime power of europe she have for decade assume at sea the same dictatorial attitude as france have maintain upon land under loui xiv and napoleon i the year 1870-1871 break the french spell the year 1884 have show england that the time of she maritime imperialism also be over and that if she do not renounce it of she own free will a 1870 will come for the english spell too it be true england need not fear any single maritime power but only a coalition of they all and hitherto she have do all she can to call up such a coalition the language which englishman naturally use in discuss they country 's naval strength might seem to lend itself to the german interpretation for example on the 10th march 1908 the prime minister mr asquith express a opinion in which he think both party concur say : we must maintain the unassailable supremacy of this country at sea here at any rate be the word supremacy at which the german take umbrage and which we own people regard as objectionable if apply to the position of any power on the continent i will not repeat here the analysis which i publish many year ago of the dealings between the german and british government during the period when german colonial enterprise be begin nor the demonstration that in those negotiation the british government act with perfect fairness but be grossly misrepresent to the german public the important thing for the people of great britain to understand to-day be not the inner diplomatic history of that and subsequent period but the impression which be current in germany with regard to the whole of these transaction the german think that great britain lay claim to a special position in regard to the ocean in the nature of a suzerainty over the water of the globe and over those of its coast which be not the possession of some strong civilised power what they have perceive in the last quarter of a century have be that somehow or other they care not how whenever there have be a german attempt in the way of what be call colonial expansion it have lead to friction with great britain accordingly they have the impression that great britain be oppose to any such german expansion and in this way as they be anxious for dominion beyond the sea and for the spread of they trade into every quarter of the globe they have come to regard great britain as the adversary this german feeling find vent during the south african war and the expression at that time freely use in the german newspaper as well as by german writer whose work be less ephemeral could not but deeply offend the national consciousness to any nothing of the pride of the people of this country in this way the sympathy which use to exist between the two people have be lose and they have come to regard each other with suspicion which have not be without its effect on the relation between the two government and upon the course of european diplomacy this be the origin of the rivalry and it be to the resentment which have be diligently cultivate in germany against the suppose british claim to supremacy at sea that be attributable the great popularity among the people of germany of the movement in favor of the expansion of the german navy since 1884 the people of germany have be teach to regard with suspicion every item of british policy and naturally enough this auspicious attitude have find its counterpart among the people of this country the result have be that the agreement by which england have dispose of a number of disagreement with france and with russium have be regard in germany as inspire by the wish to prepare a coalition against that country and in view of the past history of great britain this interpretation can hardly be pronounced unnatural any cause for which great britain would fight ought to be intelligible to other nation first of all to those of europe but also to the nation outside of europe at any rate to the united state and japan for if we be fight for something in regard to which there be no sympathy with we or which lead other nation to sympathise with we adversary we should be hamper by grave misgiving and might find ourselves alone in a hostile world accordingly it can not be sound policy for great britain to assert for herself a supremacy or ascendency of the kind which be resent not only by germany but by every other continental state and indeed by every maritime state in the world it ought to be make clear to all the world that in fact whatever may have be the language use in english discussion great britain make no claim to suzerainty over the sea or over territory border on the sea not form part of the british empire that while she be determine to maintain a navy that can in case of war secure the command of the sea against she enemy she regard the sea in peace and in war except for she enemy as the common property of all nation the open road form the great highway of mankind we have but to reflect on the past to perceive that the idea of a dominion of the sea must necessarily unite other nation against we what in the sixteenth century be the nature of the dispute between england and spain the british popular consciousness to-day remember two cause of which one be religious antagonism and the other the claim set up by spain and reject by england to a monopoly of america carry with it a exclusive right to navigation in the western atlantic and to a monopoly of the trade of the spanish dominion beyond the sea that be a chapter of history which at the present time deserve a place in the meditation of englishman i may now try to condense into a single view the general survey of the condition of europe which i have attempt from the two point of view of strategy and of policy of force and of right germany have such a preponderance of military force that no continental state can stand up against she there be therefore on the continent no nation independent of german influence or pressure great britain so long as she maintain the superiority of she navy over that of germany or over those of germany and she ally be not amenable to constraint by germany but she military weakness prevent she exert any appreciable counter pressure upon germany the moment the german navy have become strong enough to confront that of great britain without risk of destruction british influence in europe will be at a end and the continent will have to follow the direction give by german policy that be a consummation to be desire neither in the interest of the development of the european nation nor in that of great britain it mean the prevalence of one national ideal instead of the growth side by side of a number of type it mean also the exclusion of british ideal from european life great britain have in the past be a powerful contributor to the free development of the european nation and therefore to the preservation in europe of variety of national growth i believe that she be now call upon to renew that service the method open to she lie in such action as may relieve the other european state from the overwhelming pressure which in case of the disappearance of england from the european community would be put upon they by germany it seem probable that in default of right action she will be compel to maintain she national ideal against europe unite under german guidance the action require consist on the one hand in the perfecting of the british navy and on the other of the military organization of the british people on the principle already explain of the nationalisation of war xii the nation the conclusion to which a review of england 's position and of the state of europe point be that while there be no visible cause of quarrel between great britain and germany yet there be between they a rivalry such as be inevitable between a state that have long hold something like the first place in the world and a state that feel entitle in virtue of the number of its people they character and train they work and they corporate organization to aspire to the first place the german nation by the mere fact of its growth challenge england for the primacy it could not be otherwise but the challenge be no wrong do to england and the idea that it ought to be resent be unworthy of british tradition it must be cheerfully accept if the german be better man than we be they deserve to take we place if we mean to hold we own we must set about it in the right way -- by prove ourselves better than the german there ought to be no question of quarrel or of war man can be rival without be enemy it be the first lesson that a english boy learn at school quarrel arise as a rule from misunderstanding or from fault of temper and england ought to avoid the frame of mind which would render she liable to take offence at trifle while she policy ought to be simple enough to escape be misunderstand in a competition between two nation the qualification for success be to be the better nation germany 's advantage be that she people have be learn for a whole century to subordinate they individual wish and welfare to that of the nation while the people of great britain have be steep in individualism until the consciousness of national existence of a common purpose and a common duty have all but fade away what have to be do be to restore the nation to its right place in man 's mind and so to organise it that like a trained athlete it will be capable of hard and prolonged effort by the nation i mean the unite kingdom the commonwealth of great britain and ireland and i distinguish it from the empire which be a federation of several nation the nation thus define have work to do duty to perform as one nation among many and the way out of the present difficulty will be find by attend to these duty in the first place come britain 's work in europe which to describe have be the purpose of the precede chapter it can not be right for britain after the share she have take in secure for europe the freedom that distinguish a series of independent state exist side by side from a single centralised empire to turn she back upon the continent and to suppose that she exist only for the sake of she own colony and indium on the contrary it be only by play she part in europe that she can hope to carry through the organization of she own empire which she have in view she function as a european state be to make she voice hear in the council of the european nation so that no one state can dictate the decision to be reach in order to do that she must be strong enough to be able to say aye and no without fear and to give effective help in case of need to those other state which may in a decision vote on the same side with she in she attitude towards the power of europe and in she dealings with they great britain be the representative of the daughter nation and dependency that form she empire and she self-defence in europe be the defense of the whole empire at any rate against possible assault from any european power at the same time she be necessarily the center and the head of she own empire she must take the lead in its organization and in the direction of its policy if she be to fulfil these duty on the one hand to europe and on the other to the daughter nation and indium she must herself be organise on the principle of duty a england divide against herself absorb in the dispute of faction and unconscious of a purpose can neither lead nor defend she empire can play she proper part neither in europe nor in the world the great work to be do at home correspond to the ultimate purpose of national life be that she should bring up she people to a higher standard of human excellence to a finer type than other there be english type well recognize fifty year ago the standard of british workmanship be the acknowledged mark of excellence in the industrial world while it have be point out in a earlier chapter that the english standard of character display in conduct describe in one aspect by the word gentleman and in another by the expression fair-play form the best part of the nation 's inheritance it be the business of any british education worth thinking of to stamp these hall-mark of character upon all she people nothing reveal in a more amazing light the extent to which in this country the true meaning of we be a nation have be forget than the use that have be make in recent year of the term national education the leader of both party have discuss the subject as though any system of school maintain at the public expense form a system of national education but the diffusion of instruction be not education and the fact that it be carry on at the public expense do not make it national education be train the child for he life to come and he life 's value consist in the work which he will do national education mean bring up every boy and girl to do he or she part of the nation 's work a child who be go to do nothing will be of no use to he country and a bring up that leave he prepare to do nothing be not a education but a perversion a british national education ought to make every man a good workman every man a gentleman every man a servant of he country my contention then be that this british nation have to perform certain specific task and that in order to be able to do she work she must insist that she people -- every man woman and child -- exist not for themselves but for she this be the principle of duty it give a standard of personal value for evidently a man 's use to he country consist in what he do for it not in what he get or have for himself which from the national point of view be of no account except so far as it either enable he to carry on the work for which he be best suit or can be apply for the nation 's benefit how then in practice can the principle of duty be bring into we national and we individual life i think that the right way be that we should join in do those thing which be evidently need and should postpone other thing about the necessity of which there may be disagreement i shall devote the rest of this volume to consider how the nation be to prepare itself for the first duty lay upon it that of assure its security and so make good its position as a member of the european community but before pursue that inquiry i must reiterate once more the principle which it be my main purpose to set before my countryman the conception of the nation be the clue to the solution of all the problem with which the people of great britain be confront they be those of foreign and imperial policy of defense national and imperial of education and of social life foreign and imperial policy include all affair external to great britain the relation of great britain to europe to indium to the colony and to the power of asia and america in all these external affair the question to be ask be what be britain 's duty it be by the test of duty that great britain 's attitude towards germany should be try in what event would it be necessary and right to call on every british citizen to turn out and fight ready to shed he blood and ready to shoot down enemy evidently only in case of some great and manifest wrong undertake by germany as i be aware of no such wrong actually attempt i think a conflict unnecessary it be true i begin by point out the danger of drift into a war with the german empire but i wish to do what i can to prevent it and to show that by right action the risk will be diminish the greatest risk be due to fear -- fear in this country of what germany may do fear in germany of what great britain may do fear be a bad adviser there be englishman who seem to think that as germany be strengthen she navy it would be wise to attack she while the british navy be superior in numerical force this suggestion must be frankly discuss and deal with a war be a trial of strength to begin it do not add to you force suppose for the sake of the argument that a war between england and germany be inevitable -- which be equivalent to the supposition that one of the two government be bind to wrong the other -- one of the two government must take the initiative you take the initiative when you be the power that want something in which case you naturally exert yourself to obtain it while the adversary who merely say no to you request act only in resistance england want nothing from germany so that she be not call upon for a initiative but the initiative or offensive require the stronger force its object be to render the other side powerless for resistance to its will the defensive admit of a smaller force a conflict between england and germany must be primarily a naval war and germany 's naval force be considerably weaker than those of england england have no political reason for the initiative germany be debar from it by the inferiority of she navy if therefore germany want anything from england she must wait to take the initiative until she have force strong enough for the offensive but she force though not strong enough for the offensive may be strong enough for the defensive if therefore england should take the initiative she would in so do give away the one advantage she have it may be germany 's interest to have a prompt decision it can hardly be she interest to attack before she be ready but if she really want to pick a quarrel and get some advantage it would exactly serve she purpose to be attack at once as that would give she the benefit of the defensive the english jingo then be false guide bad strategist and worse statesman not only in the affair of europe but in those of indium egypt and the colony and in all dealings with asia africa and america the line of british policy will be the line of the british nation 's duty if britain be to follow this line two condition must be fulfil she must have a leader to show the way and she people must walk in it with confidence the mark of a leader be the single eye but the traditional system give the lead of the nation to the leader of one party choose for he success in lead that party he can never have a single eye he serve two master he party require he to keep it in office regard the opposition as the enemy but he country require he to guide a united nation in the fulfilment of its mission in europe and a unite empire in the fulfilment of its mission in the world a statesman who be to lead the nation and the empire must keep he eye on europe and on the world a party leader who be to defeat the other party must keep he eye on the other party no man can at the same time be look out of the window and watch a opponent inside the house and the traditional system put the prime minister in a painful dilemma either he never look out of the window at all or he try to look two way at once party man seem to believe that if a prime minister be to look across the sea instead of across the floor of the house of common he government would be upset that may be the case so long as man ignore the nation and so long as they acquiesce in the treasonable doctrine that it be the business of the opposition to oppose but a statesman who would take courage to lead the nation might perhaps find the opposition powerless against he the counterpart of leadership be follow a government that show the line of britain 's duty must be able to utilise the whole energy of she people for its performance a duty lay upon the nation imply a duty lay upon every man to do he share of the nation 's work to assist the government by obedient service the best of which he be capable it mean a people train every man to he task a nation should be like a team in which every man have he place he work to do he mission or duty there be no room in it either for the idler who consume but render no service or for the unskilled man who bungle a task to which he have not be train a nation may be compare to a living creature consider the way in which nature organise all thing that live and grow in the structure of a living thing every part have its function its work to do there be no superfluous organ and if any fail to do its work the creature sicken and perhaps die take the idea of the nation as i have try to convey it and apply it as a measure or test to we customary way of think both of public affair and of we own life do it not reveal that we attach too much importance to have and to possession -- we own and other people 's -- and too little importance to do to service when we ask what a man be worth we think of what he own but the word ought to make we think of what he be fit for and of what service he render to the nation the only value of what a man have spring from what he do with it the idea of the nation lead to the right way of look at these matter because it constrain every man to put himself and all that he have at the service of the community thus it be the opposite of socialism which merely turn upside down the current worship of ownership and which think have so supremely important that it would put not have in its place the only cry i will adopt be england for ever which mean that we be here every one of we with all that we have and all that we can do as member of a nation that must either serve the world or perish but the idea of the nation carry we a long way further than i have yet show it bid we all try at the peril of england 's fall to get the best government we can to lead we we need a man to preside over the nation 's counsel to settle the line of britain 's duty in europe and in she own empire and of she duty to she own people to the million who be grow up ill feed ill house and ill trained and yet who be part of the sovereign people we need to give he as councillor man that be master of the task in which for the nation to fail mean its ruin the task of which i have enumerate those that be vital do we give he a master of the history of the other nation to guide the nation 's dealings with they do we give he a master of war to educate admiral and general do we give he a master of the science to direct the pursuit of knowledge and a master of character-building to supervise the bring up of boy and girl to be type of a noble life it would serve the nation 's turn to have such man they be among we and to find they we should only have to look for they it would be no harder than to pick apple off a tree but we never dream of look for they we have a wonderful plan of choose we leader the plan which we call a election five hundred man assemble in a hall and listen to a speech from a partisan while five hundred other in a hall in the next street be cheer a second partisan who declaim against the first there be no test of either speaker except that he must be rich enough to pay the expense of a election the voter do not even listen to both partisan in order to judge between they thus we choose we member of parliament we government be a committee of some twenty of they its first business be to keep its authority against the other party of which in turn the chief function be to make out that everything the government do be wrong this be the only recognize plan for lead the nation you may be shock as you read this by the plainness of my word but you know they to be true though you suppose that to insist on the fact be impracticable because you fancy that there be no way out of the marvellously absurd arrangement that exist but there be a way out though it be no royal road it be this get the meaning of the nation into you own head and then make a present to england of you party creed ask yourself what be the one thing most need now and the one thing most need for the future you will answer because you know it to be true that the one thing most need now be to get the navy right the one thing most need for the future be to put the idea of the nation and the will to help england into every man 's soul that can not be do by write or by talk but only by set every man while he be young to do something for he country there be one way of bring that about it be by make every citizen a soldier in a national army the man who have learn to serve he country have learn to love it he be the true citizen and of such a nation be compose great britain need a statesman to lead she and a policy at home and abroad but such a policy must not be seek and can not be find upon party line the statesman who be to expound it to he countryman and represent it to the world must be the leader not of one party but of both in short a statesman must be a nation leader and the first condition of he existence be that there should be a nation for he to lead xiii the effect of the nationalisation of war upon leadership the argument of the precede chapter point to the conclusion that if great britain be to maintain she position as a great power probably even if she be to maintain she independence and certainly if she be to retain the administration of indium and the leadership of the nation that have grow out of she colony she statesman and she people must combine to do three thing : -- 1 to adopt a policy have due relation to the condition and need of the european continent 2 to make the british navy the best possible instrument of naval warfare 3 to make the british army strong enough to be able to turn the scale in a continental war what be for the navy and for the army the essential of victory if there have never be any war no one would know what be essential to victory people would have they notion no doubt but these notion would be guess and could not be verify until the advent of a war which might bring with it a good deal of disappointment to the people who have guess wrong but there have already be war enough to afford ample material for deduction as to the cause and condition of success i propose to take the two best example that can be find one for war at sea and the other for war on land in order to show exactly the way in which victory be attain by victory of course i mean crush the enemy in a battle in which neither side be cripple and after which the fleet part to renew the struggle after a short interval one side or the other may consider that it have have the honor of the day it may have lose fewer ship than the enemy or have take more it may have be able and willing to continue the fight though the enemy draw off and its commander may be promote or decorate for have maintain the credit of he country or of the service to which he belong but such a battle be not victory either in a political or a strategical sense it do not lead to the accomplishment of the purpose of the war which be to dictate condition of peace that result can be obtain only by crush the enemy 's force and so make he powerless to renew the contest a general view of the war of the eighteenth century between great britain and france show that broadly speak there be no decision until the end of the period the nearest approach to it be when hawke destroy the french fleet in quiberon bay but this be hardly a stand-up fight the french fleet be run away and hawke 's achievement be that in spite of the difficulty of weather on a extremely dangerous coast he be able to consummate its destruction the real decision be the work of nelson and its principal cause be nelson himself the british navy have discover in its conflict with the dutch during the seventeenth century that the object of naval warfare be the command of the sea which must be win by break the enemy 's force in battle this be also perfectly understand by the dutch admiral and in those war be begin the development of the art of fight battle with sailing vessel a formation the line of battle in which one ship sail in the track of the ship before she be find to be appropriate to the weapon use the broadside of artillery and a type of ship suitable to this formation the line-of-battle ship establish itself these be the element with which the british and french navy enter into they long eighteenth century struggle the french however have not grasp the principle that the object of naval warfare be to obtain the command of the sea they do not consciously and primarily aim as do they british rival at the destruction of the enemy 's fleet they be more concern with the preservation of they own fleet than with the destruction of the enemy 's and be ready rather to accept battle than to bring it about the british admiral be eager for battle but have a difficulty in find out how a decisive blow could be strike the orthodox and accept doctrine of the british navy be that the british fleet should be bring alongside the enemy 's fleet the two line of battleship be parallel to one another so that each ship in the british fleet should engage a corresponding ship in the french fleet it be a maneuver difficult of execution because in order to approach the french the british must in the first place turn each of they ship at right angle to the line or obliquely to it and then when they be near enough to fire must turn again to the left -lrb- or right -rrb- in order to restore the line formation and during this period of approach and turn they must be expose to the broadside of the french without be able to make full use of they own broadside moreover it be next to impossible in this way to bring up the whole line together besides be difficult the maneuver have no promise of success for if two fleet of equal number be in this way match ship against ship neither side have any advantage except what may be derive from the superior skill of its gunner so long as these condition prevail no great decisive victory of the kind for which we be seek be gain it be during this period that nelson receive such training as the navy could give he and add to it the necessary finish touch by never-ceasing effort to find out for himself the way in which he could strike a decisive blow he daring be always deliberate never rash and this be the right frame of mind for a commander you may be assure he write to lord hood march 11 1794 i shall undertake nothing but what i have moral certainty of succeed in he fierce determination to get at the ultimate secret of he trade lead he to use every means that would help he to think out he problem and among these means be read in 1780 appear clerk 's essay on naval tactic clerk point out the weakness of the method of fight in two parallel line and suggest and discuss a number of plan by which one fleet with the bulk of its force could attack and destroy a portion of the other this be the problem to which nelson give he mind -- how to attack a part with the whole on the 19th of August 1796 he write to the duke of clarence : -- we be now 22 sail of the line the combined fleet will be above 35 sail of the line i will venture my life sir john jervis defeat they i do not mean by a regular battle but by the skill of we admiral and the activity and spirit of we officer and seaman this country be the most favourable possible for skill with a inferior fleet for the wind be so variable that some one time in the 24 hour you must be able to attack a part of a large fleet and the other will be becalm or have a contrary wind he opportunity come in 1798 when in the battle of the nile he crush the french mediterranean fleet in a letter to lord howe write January 8 1799 he describe he plan in a sentence : -- by attack the enemy 's van and center the wind blow directly along they line i be enable to throw what force i please on a few ship we know that nelson 's method of fight have for month before the battle be he constant preoccupation and that he have lose no opportunity of explain he idea to he captain here be the word of captain berry 's narrative : -- it have be he practice during the whole of the cruise whenever the weather and circumstance would permit to have he captain on board the vanguard where he would fully develop to they he own idea of the different and best mode of attack and such plan as he propose to execute upon fall in with the enemy whatever they position or situation might be by day or by night there be no possible position in which they might be find that he do not take into he calculation and for the most advantageous attack on which he have not digest and arrange the best possible disposition of the force which he command the great final victory of trafalgar be prepare in the same way and the various memorandum write in the period before the battle have reveal to recent investigation the unwearying care which nelson devote to find out how best to concentrate he force upon that portion of the enemy 's fleet which it would be most difficult for the enemy to support with the remainder nelson 's great merit he personal contribution to he country 's influence lay first and foremost in he have by intellectual effort solve the tactical problem set to commander by the condition of the naval weapon of he day the fleet of line-of-battle ship and secondly in he be possess and inspire by the true strategical doctrine that the prime object of naval warfare be the destruction of the enemy 's fleet and therefore that the decisive point in the theater of war be the point where the enemy 's fleet can be find it be the conviction with which he hold this principle that enable he in circumstance of the greatest difficulty to divine where to go to find the enemy 's fleet which in 1798 lead he persistently up and down the mediterranean till he have discover the french squadron anchor at aboukir which in 1805 take he from the mediterranean to the west indy and from the west indy back to the channel so much for nelson 's share of the work but nelson could neither have educate himself nor make full use of he education if the navy of he day have not be inspire with the will to fight and to conquer with the discipline that spring from that will and have not obtain through long experience of war the high degree of skill in seamanship and in gunnery which make it the instrument its great commander require these condition of the navy in turn be product of the national spirit and of the will of the government and people of great britain to devote to the navy as much money as many man and as vigorous support as might be necessary to realize the national purpose the effort of this nature make by the country be neither perfect nor complete the government make mistake the admiralty leave much to be desire both in organization and in personnel but the will be there the best proof of the national determination be to be find in the best hate of all the institution of that time the press-gang a brutal and narrow-minded form of assert the principle that a citizen 's duty be to fight for he country that the principle should take such a shape be decisive evidence no doubt that society be badly organise and that education intellectual and moral be on a low level but also and this be the vital matter that the nation well understand the nature of the struggle in which it be engage and be firmly resolve not only to fight but to conquer the cause of the success of the french army in the period between 1792 and 1809 be precisely analogous to those which have be analyze in the case of the british navy the basis be the national will express in the volunteer and the levy _ en masse _ upon this be superimpose the skill acquire by the army in several year of incessant war and the formal cause of the victory be napoleon 's insight into the art of command the research of recent year have reveal the origin of napoleon 's mastery of the method of direct a army he become a officer in 1785 at the age of sixteen in 1793 as a young captain of artillery he direct with remarkable insight and determination the operation by which the ally fleet be drive from toulon in 1794 he inspire and conduct though still a subordinate a series of successful operation in the maritime alp in 1796 as commander-in-chief of the army of italy he astonish europe by the most brilliant campaign on record for these achievement he have prepare himself by assiduous study as a young officer of artillery he receive the best professional training then to be have in europe while at the same time by wide and careful reading he give himself a general education at some period before 1796 probably before 1794 he have read and thoroughly digest the remarkable treatise on the principle of mountain war which have be leave in manuscript by general bourcet a officer who during the campaign of half a century have assist as quartermaster-general a number of the best general of france napoleon 's phenomenal power of concentration have enable he to assimilate bourcet 's doctrine which in he clear and vigorous mind take new and more perfect shape so that from the begin he operation be conduct on a system which may be describe as that of bourcet raise to a higher power the nelson touch be acquire by the admiral through year of effort to think out to its last conclusion a problem the nature of which have never be adequately grasp by he professional predecessor and comrade though it seem probable that he owe to clerk the hint which lead he to the solution which he find napoleon be more fortunate in inherit a strategical doctrine which he have but to appreciate to expand and to apply the success of both man be due to the habit of mind which cling tenaciously to the subject under investigation until it be completely clear up each of they become as a result of he think the embodiment of a theory or system of the employment of force the one on sea and the other on land and such a embodiment be absolutely necessary for a nation in pursuit of victory it seem natural to say that if england want victory on sea or land she must provide herself with a nelson or a napoleon the statement be quite true but it require to be rightly interpret if it mean that a nation must always choose a great man to command its navy or its army it be a impossible maxim because a great man can not be recognize until he power have be reveal in some kind of work moreover to say that nelson and napoleon win victory because they be great man be to invert the order of nature and of truth they be recognize as great man because of the mastery of they business which they manifest in action that mastery be due primarily to knowledge wordsworth hit the mark when in answer to the question who be the happy warrior he reply that it be he -- who with a natural instinct to discern what knowledge can perform be diligent to learn the quality that make they both so valuable be that they know the best that be know and think in regard to the art of war this be the quality which a nation must secure in those whom it entrust with the design and the conduct of the operation of its fleet and its army there be a method for secure this not by any mean a new one and not originally as be commonly suppose a german invention it consist in provide the army and the navy with a general staff or department for the study design and direction of operation in such a department bourcet napoleon 's master spend the best year of he life in such a department moltke be train over such a department he preside its characteristic be that it have one function that of the study design and direction of the movement in fighting of a fleet or a army and that it have nothing whatever to do with the maintenance of a army or with its recruiting discipline or peace administration its function in peace be intellectual and educational and in war it become the channel of executive power bourcet describe the head of such a department as the soul of a army the british navy be without such a department the army have borrow the name but have not maintain the speciality of function which be essential in army other than the british the chief of the general staff be occupy solely with tactic and strategy with the work of intellectual research by which nelson and napoleon prepare they great achievement he business be to be design campaign to make up he mind at what point or point in case of war he will assemble he fleet or he army for the first move and what the nature of that move shall be the second move it be impossible for he to pre-arrange because it depend upon the result of the first he will determine the second move when the time come in order that he work should be as well do as possible care be take that the chief of the staff shall have nothing else to do not he but another officer superintend the raise organising and discipline of the force thus he become the embodiment of a theory or system of operation and with that theory or system he inspire as far as possible all the admiral or general and other officer who will have to carry out he design in the british system the chief of the general staff be the principal military member of the board which administer the army accordingly only a fraction of he time can be give to think out the problem of strategy and tactic at the admiralty the principal naval member of the board be make responsible not only for the distribution and movement of ship -- a definition which include the whole domain of strategy and tactic -- but also for the fighting and sea-going efficiency of the fleet its organization and mobilisation a definition so wide that it include the greater part of the administration of the navy especially as the same officer be hold responsible for advice on all large question of naval policy and maritime warfare as well as for the control of the naval ordnance department thus in each case the very constitution of the office entrust with the design of operation prevent the officer at its head from concentrate himself upon that vital duty the result be that the intellectual life both of the army and of the navy lag far behind that of they german rival and therefore that there be every chance of both of they be beat not for lack of courage or hard work but by be oppose to a adversary whose thinking have be better do by reason of the greater concentration of energy devote to it the first reform need at any rate in the navy be a definition of the function of the first sea lord which will confine he sphere to the distribution and movement of ship and the strategical and tactical training of officer so as to compel he to become the embodiment or personification of the best possible theory or system of naval warfare that definition adopt and enforce there be no need to lay down regulation give the strategist control over he colleague who administer _ matriel _ and _ personnel _ they will of themselves always be anxious to hear he view as to the method of fight and will be only too glad to build ship with a view to they be use in accordance with he design of victory but until there be at the admiralty department devote to design victory and to nothing else what possible guarantee can there be that ship will be build or the navy administer and organise in accordance with any design likely to lead to victory xiv the need of the navy the doubt which since the prime minister 's statement on the introduction of the navy estimate have disturb the public mind be concern almost exclusively with the number of modern battleship in the royal navy the one object which the nation ought to have in view be victory in the next war and the question never to be forget be what be essential to victory while it be probably true that if the disparity of number be too great a smaller fleet can hardly engage a larger one with any prospect of success it be possible to exaggerate the importance both of number and of the size of ship the most decisive victory at sea which be on record be those of tsusima of trafalgar and of the nile at tsusima the number and size of the japanese fleet be not such as before the battle to give foreign observer grounds for expect a decisive victory by the japanese it be on the superior intellectual and moral quality of the japanese that those who expect they to win base they hope and this view be justify by the event at the battle of trafalgar the british fleet number twenty-seven the franco-spanish fleet number thirty-three at the battle of the nile the number be equal -- thirteen on each side these figure seem to I sufficiently to prove that superior number be not in battle the indispensable condition of victory they certainly prove that the numerically inferior fleet may very well win writer on the art of war distinguish between tactic the art of win a battle and strategy the art of design and conduct the whole of the operation which constitute a campaign of bring about battle in condition favourable to one 's own side and of make the best use of such victory as may be win for contribute to the general purpose of the war which be dictate peace on one 's own term the decision of the question how many fleet to send out what be to be the strength and composition of each of they and what the objective assign to they several commander be a strategical decision it be a function of the strategist at the board of admiralty but the question how to handle any one of these fleet in the presence of the enemy so as either to avoid or to bring about a action and so as to win the battle if a battle be desirable be a question for the admiral command the particular fleet evidently the master art because it dominate the whole war be that of strategy and for that reason it must have a seat at the admiralty board as be well know a large number of naval officer have for several year past be trouble with doubt as to the strategical competence display by the board or board of admiralty since 1904 the board of admiralty have also be criticise for other reason into some of which it be not necessary to enter but it be desirable to state precisely the consideration which tend to show that important decision make by the admiralty have not be base upon sound strategical principle and be indeed incompatible with they when four or five year ago it be decide to transfer the center of gravity of the navy as represent by fleet in commission from the mediterranean to the atlantic coast of europe that be a sound decision but when the principal fleet in commission in home water be reduce in order to facilitate the creation of a so-called home fleet make up of a number of ship station at different port and man for the most part by nucleus crew the admiralty announce this measure in a very remarkable circular the change clearly involve a reduction of the number of man at sea and also a reduction in the number of ship which would be immediately available under war condition it be further evident that the chief result of this measure would be a reduction of expenditure yet the circular boldly state that the object of the measure be to increase the power and readiness of the navy for instant war in any case the decision announce reveal a ignorance of one of the fundamental condition of naval warfare which differentiate it completely from operation on land a ship in commission carry on board everything that be necessary for a fight she can be make ready for battle in a few minute on the order to clear for action no other mobilisation be necessary for a fleet in commission and if a war should break out suddenly as war normally always do break out whichever side be able at once with its fleet already in commission to strike the first blow have the incalculable advantage of the initiative a fleet divide between several port and not fully man be not a fleet in commission it be not ready and its assembly as a fleet depend on a contingency which there be no means of guarantee that the enemy shall not be able to prevent its assembly by move a fleet immediately to a point at sea from which it would be able to oppose by force the union of the constituent part of the divide and unready fleet later official description of the home fleet explain that it be part of the admiralty design that this fleet should offer the first resistance to a enemy the most careful examination of these description leave no room for doubt that the idea of the admiralty be that one of its fleet should in case of war form a sort of advance-guard to the rest of the navy but it be a fundamental truth that in naval war a advance-guard be absurd and impossible in the operation of army a advance-guard be both necessary and useful its function be to delay the enemy 's army until such time as the commander-in-chief shall have assemble he own force which may be to some extent scatter on the march this delay be always possible on land because the troops can make use of the ground that be of the position which it afford favourable for defense and because by means of those position a small force can for a long time hold in check the advance of a very much larger one but at sea there be no position except those form by narrow strait estuary and shoal where land and sea be more or less mixed up the open sea be a uniform surface offering no advantage whatever to either side there be nothing in naval warfare resemble the defense of a position on land and the whole difference between offence and defense at sea consist in the will of one side to bring on a action and that of the other side to avoid or postpone it at sea a small force which endeavor by fight to delay the movement of a large force expose itself to destruction without any corresponding gain of time accordingly at sea there be no analogy to the action of a advance-guard and the mere fact that such a idea should find its way into the official account of the admiralty 's view regard the opening move of a possible war must discredit the strategy of the admiralty in the judgment of all who have pay any attention to the nature of naval war the second requisite for victory that be for win a battle against a hostile fleet be tactical superiority or as nelson put it : the skill of we admiral and the activity and spirit of we officer and seaman the only way to obtain this be through the perpetual practice of the admiral command fleet a admiral in order to make himself a first-rate tactician must not merely have deeply study and ponder the subject but must spend as much time as possible in exercise as a whole the fleet which he command in order not only by experimental maneuver thoroughly to satisfy himself as to the formation and mode of attack which will be best suit to any conceivable circumstance in which he may find himself but also to inculcate he idea into he subordinate to inspire they with he own knowledge and to give they that training in work together which in all those kind of activity which require large number of man to work together whether on the cricket field at football in a army or in a navy constitute the advantage of a practice over a scratch team if the practice be to make the fleet ready for war it must be carry out with the fleet in its war composition all the different element battleship cruiser torpedo craft and the rest must be fully represent otherwise the admiral would be practise in peace with a different instrument from that with which he would need to operate in war the importance of this perpetual training ought to be self-evident it may be well to remind the reader that it have also be historically prove the great advantage which the british possess over the french navy in the war of the revolution and the empire be that the british fleet be always at sea whereas the french fleet for year blockade in they port be deficient in that practice which in the naval as in all other profession make perfect one of the complaint against the present board of admiralty be that it have not encourage the training and exercise of fleet as complete unit another point in regard to which the recent practice of the admiralty be regard with very grave doubt not only by many naval officer but also by many of those who without be naval officer take a serious interest in the navy be that of naval construction for several year the admiralty neglect to build torpedo craft of the quality and in the quantity necessary for the most probable contingency of war while at the same time large sum of money be spend in building armored cruiser vessel of a fight power so great that a admiral would hesitate to detach they from he fleet lest he should be needlessly weaken on the day of battle yet not strong enough safely to replace the battleship in the fight line the result have be that the admiral in command of fleet have for some time be anxiously ask to be better supply with scout or vessel of great speed but not of such fight power that they could not be spare at a distance from the fleet even on the eve of a action these two defect in the shipbuilding policy of the admiralty make it probable that for some year past the navy have not be construct in accord with any fully thought-out design of operation in other word that the great object victory have be forget by the supreme authority the doubt whether victory have be bear in mind be confirm by what be know of the design of the original _ dreadnought _ a battleship ought to be construct for battle that be for the purpose of destroy the enemy 's fleet for which purpose it will never be use alone but in conjunction with a number of ship like itself form the weapon of a admiral in command a battleship require three quality in the follow order of importance : -- first offensive power a fleet exist in order to destroy the enemy but it have no prospect of perform that function if its power of destruction be less than its enemy 's the chief weapon to-day as in the past be artillery accordingly the first requisite of a fleet as regard its material quality those produce by the constructor be the capacity to pour on to the enemy 's fleet a heavier rain of projectile than he can return the second quality be the power of movement the advantage of superior speed in a fleet -- for the superior speed of a individual ship be of little importance -- be that so long as it be preserve it enable the admiral within limit to accept or decline battle accord to he own judgment this be a great strategical advantage it may in some condition enable a inferior fleet to postpone a action which might be disastrous until it have effect a junction with another fleet belong to its own side the third quality be that the ship of a fleet should be strong enough to offer to the enemy 's projectile a sufficient resistance to make it improbable that they can be sink before have inflict they fair share of damage on the adversary there be always a difficulty in combine these quality in a give ship because as a ship weigh the quantity of water which she displace a ship of any give size have its weight give and the designer can not exceed that limit of weight he must divide it between gun with they ammunition engine with they coal and armor every ton give to armor diminish the tonnage possible for gun and engine and give a minimum for armor every extra ton give to engine and coal reduce the possible weight of gun and ammunition in the _ dreadnought _ a very great effort be make to obtain a considerable extra speed over that of all other battleship this extra speed be defend on the ground that it would enable a fleet of _ dreadnought _ to fight a battle at long range and with a view to such battle the _ dreadnought _ be provide only with gun of the heaviest calibre and deprive of those gun of medium calibre with which earlier battleship be well provide the theory thus embody in the new class of ship be both of they doubtful and even dangerous in the first place it be in the highest degree injurious to the spirit and courage of the crew to have a ship which they know will be at a disadvantage if bring into close proximity with the enemy they great object ought to be to get as near to the enemy as possible the hypothesis that more damage will be do by a armament exclusively of the largest gun be in the opinion of many of the best judge likely to be refute there be some reason to believe that a give tonnage if devote to gun of medium calibre would yield a very much greater total damage to a enemy 's ship than if devote to a smaller number of gun of heavy calibre and firing much less rapidly there be moreover a widespread belief among naval officer of the highest repute among whom may be name the author of the influence of sea power upon history than whom no one have think more profoundly on the subject of naval war that it be bad economy to concentrate in a few very large ship the power which might be more conveniently and effectively employ if distribute in a great number of ship of more moderate size surely so long as naval opinion be divide about the tactical and strategical wisdom of a new type of battleship it be rash to continue build battleship exclusively of that type and it would be more reasonable to make a attempt to have naval opinion sift and clarify and thus to have a secure basis for a shipbuilding program than to hurry on a enormous expenditure upon what may after all prove to have be a series of doubtful experiment all the question above discuss seem to I to be more important than that of mere number of ship number be however of great importance in they proper place and for the proper reason the policy adopt and carry out by the british navy at any rate during the latter half of the war against the french empire be base on a known superiority of force the british fleet set out by blockade all the french fleet that be by take station near to the great french harbor and there observe those harbor so that no french fleet should escape without be attack if this be to be the policy of the british navy in future it will require a preponderance of force of every kind over that of the enemy and that preponderant force will have to be fully employ from the very first day of the war in other word it must be keep in commission during peace but in addition it be always desirable to have a reserve of strength to meet the possibility that the opening of a war or one of its early subsequent stage may bring into action some additional unexpected adversary there be thus two reason that make for a fleet of great numerical strength the first that only great superiority render possible the strategy know as blockade or as i have venture to call it of shadow the whole of the enemy 's force the second that only great numerical strength render it possible to provide a reserve against unexpected contingency xv england 's military problem after the close of the south african war two royal commission be appoint one of they know as the war commission be in a general way to inquire into and report upon the lesson of the war this mission it could fulfil only very imperfectly because its member feel preclude from discuss the policy in which the war have its origin and incapable of review the military conduct of the operation this be very like review the play of hamlet without reference to the character and action either of hamlet or of the king for the mainspring which determine the course character and issue of any war be the policy out of which it arise and the conduct of the military operation the main fact which impress itself on the member of the war commission be that the force employ on the british side have be very much larger than have be expect at the beginning of the war and the moral which they draw be contain in the one sentence of they report which have remain in the public mind to the effect that the government ought to make provision for the expansion of the army beyond the limit of the regular force of the crown about the same time another commission under the chairmanship of the duke of norfolk be appoint to inquire and report whether any and if any what change be require in order to secure that the militia and volunteer force should be maintain in a condition of military efficiency and at a adequate strength the norfolk commission recommend certain change which it think would lead to a great improvement in the efficiency of both force while permit they to maintain the requisite numerical strength with regard to the volunteer force the report say : -- the govern condition be that the volunteer whether a officer non-commissioned officer or private earn he own living and that if demand be make upon he which be inconsistent with he do so he must cease to be a volunteer no regulation can be carry out which be incompatible with the civil employment of the volunteer who be for the most part in permanent situation moreover whatever may be the goodwill and patriotism of employer they can not allow the volunteer they may employ more than a certain period of absence they power to permit they workman to attend camp or other exercise be control by the competition which exist in they trade those who permit volunteer in they service to take holiday longer than be customary in they trade and district be make in the public interest a sacrifice which some of they think excessive the report further lay stress on the cardinal principle that no volunteer whatever he rank should be put to expense on account of he service subject to this govern condition and to this cardinal principle the commission make recommendation from which it expect a marked improvement and the gradual attainment of a standard much in advance of anything which until then have be reach most of these recommendation have be adopt with modification in the arrangement which have since be make for the volunteer under the new name the territorial force the norfolk commission feel no great confidence in the instruction give it by the government on the subject of the standard of efficiency and of numerical strength accordingly the commission add to its report the statement : -- we can not assert that even if the measure recommend be fully carry out these force would be equal to the task of defeat a modern continental army in the unite kingdom the commission 's chief doubt be whether under the condition inseparable at any rate from the volunteer system any scheme of training would give to force officer largely by man who be not professional soldier the cohesion of army that exact a progressive two-year ' course from they soldier and rely except for expand the subaltern rank on mobilisation upon professional leader the commission then consider measure which may provide a home defense army equal to the task of defeat a invader they be unable to recommend the adoption of the swiss system partly because the initial training be not in they judgment sufficient for the purpose and partly because they hold that the modern method of extend the training to all class while shorten its duration involve the employment of instructor of the highest possible qualification the commission conclude by report that a home defense army capable in the absence of the whole or the greater portion of the regular force of protect this country against invasion can be raise and maintain only on the principle that it be the duty of every citizen of military age and sound physique to be train for the national defense and to take part in it should emergency arise the norfolk commission give expression to two different view without attempt to reconcile they on the one hand it lay down the main line along which the improvement of the militia and volunteer be to be seek and on the other hand it point out the advantage of the principle that it be the citizen 's duty to be train as a soldier and to fight in case of need to go beyond this and to attempt either to reconcile the two current of thought or to decide between they be impossible for a commission appoint to deal with only a fraction of the problem of national defense the two set of view however continue to exist side by side and the nation yet have to do what the norfolk commission by its nature be debar from do the government represent in this matter by mr haldane be still in the position of rely upon a improve militia and volunteer force the national service league on the other hand advocate the principle of the citizen 's duty though it couple with it a specific program borrow from the swiss system the adoption of which be deprecate in the commission 's report the public be somewhat puzzle by the appearance of opposition between what be think of as two school and indeed mr haldane in he speech introduce the army estimate on march 4 1909 describe the territorial force as a safeguard against universal service the time have perhaps come when the attempt should be make to find a point of view from which the two school of thought can be see in due perspective and from which therefore a definite solution of the military problem may be reach by what principle must we choice between the two system be determine by the purpose in hand the sole ultimate use of a army be to win the nation 's battle and if one system promise to fulfil that purpose while the other system do not we can not hesitate great britain require a army as one of the instrument of success in a modern british war and we have therefore to ascertain in general the nature of a modern war and in particular the character of such war as great britain may have to wage the distinguish feature of the conflict between two modern great state be that it be a struggle for existence or at any rate a wrestle to a fall the mark of the modern state be that it be identify with the population which it comprise and to such a state the name nation properly belong the french revolution nationalise the state and in consequence nationalise war and every modern continental state have so organize itself with a view to war that its army be equivalent to the nation in arm the peculiar character of a british war be due to the insular character of the british state a conflict with a great continental power must begin with a naval struggle which will be carry on with the utmost energy until one side or the other have establish its predominance on the sea if in this struggle the british navy be successful the effect which can be produce on a continental state by the victorious navy will not be sufficient to cause the enemy to accept peace upon british condition for that purpose it will be necessary to invade the enemy 's territory and to put upon he the constraint of military defeat and great britain therefore require a army strong enough either to effect this operation or to encourage continental ally to join with it in make the attempt in any british war therefore which be to be wage with prospect of success great britain 's battle must be fight and win on the enemy 's territory and against a army raise and maintain on the modern national principle this be the decisive consideration affect british military policy in case of the defeat of the british navy a continental enemy would undoubtedly attempt the invasion and at least the temporary conquest of great britain the army require to defeat he in the unite kingdom would need to have the same strength and the same quality as would be require to defeat he in he own territory though if the invasion have be precede by naval defeat it be very doubtful whether any military success in the unite kingdom would enable great britain to continue she resistance with much hope of ultimate success for these reason i can not believe that great britain 's need be meet by the possession of any force the employment of which be by the condition of its service limit to fight in the unite kingdom a british army to be of any use must be ready to go and win its country 's battle in the theater of war in which its country require victory that theater of war will never be the unite kingdom unless and until the navy have fail to perform its task in which case it will probably be too late to win battle in time to avert the national overthrow which must be the enemy 's aim there be however certain subsidiary service for which any british military system must make provision these be : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- sufficient garrison must be maintain during peace in indium in egypt for some time to come in south africa and in certain naval station beyond the sea viz gibraltar malta ceylon hong kong singapore mauritius west africa bermuda and jamaica it be generally agree that the principle of compulsory service can not be apply for the maintenance of these garrison which must be compose of professional pay soldier -lrb- 2 -rrb- experience show that a widespread empire like the british require from time to time expedition for the maintenance of order on its border against half civilised or savage tribe this function be describe in a essay on imperial defense publish by sir charle dilke and the present writer in 1892 as imperial police it would not be fair for the purpose of one of these small expedition arbitrarily to call upon a fraction of a force maintain on the principle of compulsion accordingly any system must provide a special pay reserve for the purpose of furnish the man require for such a expedition a army able to strike a serious blow against a continental enemy in he own territory would evidently be equally able to defeat a invade army if the necessity should arise accordingly the military question for great britain resolve itself into the provision of a army able to carry on serious operation against a european enemy together with the maintenance of such professional force as be indispensable for the garrison of indium egypt and the over-sea station enumerate above and for small war xvi two system contrast i proceed to describe a typical army of the national kind and to show how the system of such a army could be apply in the case of great britain the system of universal service have be establish longer in germany than in any other state and can best be explain by a account of its work in that country in germany every man become liable to military service on he seventeenth birthday and remain liable until he be turn forty-five the german army therefore theoretically include all german citizen between the age of seventeen and forty-five but the liability be not enforce before the age of twenty nor after the age of thirty-nine except in case of some supreme emergency young man under twenty and man between thirty-nine and forty-five belong to the landsturm they be subject to no training and would not be call upon to fight except in the last extremity every year all the young man who have reach they twentieth birthday be muster and classify those who be not find strong enough for military service be divide into three grade of which one be dismiss as unfit a second be excuse from training and enrol in the landsturm while a third whose physical defect be minor and perhaps temporary be tell off to a supplementary reserve of which some member receive a short training of those select as fit for service a few thousand be tell off to the navy the remainder pass into the army and join the color the soldier thus obtain serve in the rank of the army for two year if assign to the infantry field artillery or engineer and for three year if assign to the cavalry or horse artillery at the expiration of the two or three year they pass into the reserve of the standing army in which they remain until the age of twenty-seven that be for five year in the case of the infantry and engineer and for four year in the case of the cavalry and horse artillery at twenty-seven all alike cease to belong to the standing army and pass into the landwehr to which they continue to belong to the age of thirty-nine the necessity to serve for at least two year with the color be modify in the case of young man who have reach a certain standard of education and who engage to clothe feed equip and in the mount arm to mount themselves these man be call one year volunteer and be allow to pass into the reserve of the standing army at the expiration of one year with the color in the year 1906511000 young man be muster and of these 275000 be pass into the standing army 55000 of they be one year volunteer the man in any year so pass into the army form a annual class and the standing army at any time be make up in the infantry of two annual class and in the cavalry and horse artillery of three annual class in case of war the army of first line would be make up by add to the two or three annual class already with the color the four or five annual class form the reserve that be altogether seven annual class each of these class would number when it first pass into the army about 275000 but as each class must lose every year a certain number of man by death by disease which cause physical incapacity from service and by emigration the total army of first line must fall short of the total of seven time 275000 it may probably be take at a million and a half in the second line come the twelve annual class of landwehr which will together furnish about the same number as the standing army behind the landwehr come the supplementary reserve and behind that again the landsturm comprise the man who have be train and be between the age of thirty-nine and forty-five the young man under twenty and all those who from physical weakness have be entirely exempt from training during they two or three year with the color the man receive a allowance or pay of twopence halfpenny a day they service be not a contract but a public duty and while perform it they be clothe lodge and feed by the state when pass into the reserve they resume they normal civil occupation except that for a year or two they be call up for a few week ' training and maneuver during the autumn in this way all german citizen so far as they be physically fit with a few exception such as the only son and support of a widow receive a thorough training as soldier and germany rely in case of war entirely and only upon she citizen thus turn into soldier the training be carry out by officer and non-commissioned officer who together be the military schoolmaster of the nation and like other proficient schoolmaster be pay for they service by which they live broadly speak there be in germany no professional soldier except the officer and non-commissioned officer from whom a high standard of capacity as instructor and trainer during peace and as leader in war be demand and obtain the high degree of military proficiency which the german army have acquire be due to the excellence of the training give by the officer and to the thoroughness with which during a course of two or three year that training can be impart the great number which can be put into the field be due to the practice of pass the whole male population so far as it be physically qualify through this training so that the army in war represent the whole of the best manhood of the country between the age of twenty and forty the total of three million which have be give above be that which be mention by prince bismarck in a speech to the reichstag in 1887 the increase of population since that date have considerably augmented the figure for the present time and the corresponding total to-day slightly exceed four million \* \* \* \* \* the result of the british system be show in the follow table which give from the army estimate the number of the various constituent of the british army on the 1st of January 1909 there be at that date in the unite kingdom : -- regular force 123250 army reserve 134110 special reserve 67780 militia 9158 territorial force 209977 officer ' training corps 416 ________ total in the unite kingdom 544691 in egypt and the colony : -- regular force 45002 the british troops in indium be pay for by the indian government and do not appear in the british army estimate of the force maintain in the unite kingdom it will be observe that it fall roughly into three category in the first place come the first-rate troops which may be presume to have have a thorough training for war this class embrace only the regular and the army reserve which together slightly exceed a quarter of a million in the second class come the 68000 of the special reserve which in so far as they have enjoy the six month ' training lay down in the recent reorganisation could on a sanguine estimate be classify as second-class troops though in view of the fact that they officer be not professional and be for the most part very slightly train that classification would be exceedingly sanguine next come the territorial force with a maximum annual training of a fortnight in camp precede by ten to twenty lesson and officer by man whose professional training though it far exceed that of the rank and file fall yet very much short of that give to the professional officer of a first-rate continental army the territorial force by its constitution be not available to fight england 's battle except in the unite kingdom where they can never be fight except in the event of a defeat of the navy this heterogeneous tripartite army be exceedingly expensive its cost during the current year be accord to the estimate very little less than 29 million the cost of the personnel be 23-1\/2 million that of _ matriel _ be 4 million and that of administration 1\/2 million the british regular army can not multiply soldier as do the german army it receive about 37000 recruit a year but it send away to indium and the colony about 23000 each year and seldom receive they back before they eight year ' color service be over when they pass into the first-class reserve there pass into the reserve about 24000 man a year and as the normal term of reserve service be four year its normal strength be about 96000 man as the regular army contain only professional soldier who look at any rate for a period of eight year to soldier as a living and be prepare for six or seven year abroad there be a limit to the supply of recruit who be usually under nineteen year of age and to whom the pay of a shill a day be a attraction older man with prospects of regular work expect wages much higher than that and therefore do not enlist except when in difficulty xvii a national army i propose to show that a well-trained homogeneous army of great numerical strength can be obtain on the principle of universal service at no greater cost than the present mixed force the essential of a scheme base upon train the best manhood of the nation be : first that to be train be a matter of duty not of pay secondly that every trained man be bind as a matter of duty to serve with the army in a national war thirdly that the training must be long enough to be thorough but no longer fourthly that the instructor shall be the best possible which imply that they must be pay professional officer and non-commissioned officer i take the age at which the training should begin at the end of the twentieth year in order that in case of war the man in the rank may be the equal in strength and endurance of the man in the rank of any oppose army the number of man who reach the age of twenty every year in the unite kingdom exceed 400000 continental experience show that less than half of these would be reject as not strong enough the annual class would therefore be about 200000 the principle of duty apply of course to the navy as well as to the army and any man go to the navy will be exempt from army training but it be doubtful whether the navy can be effectively man on a system of very short service such as be inevitable for a national army the present personnel of the navy be maintain by so small a yearly contingent of recruit that it will be cover by the excess of the annual class over the figure here assume of 200000 the actual number of man reach the age of twenty be more than 400000 and the probable number out of 400000 who will be physically fit for service be at least 213000 i assume that for the infantry and field artillery a year 's training would with good instruction be sufficient and that even better and more lasting result would be produce if the last two month of the year be replace by a fortnight of field maneuver in each of the four summer follow the first year for the cavalry and horse artillery i believe that the training should be prolong for a second year the liability to rejoin the color in case of a national war should continue to the end of the 27th year and be follow by a period of liability in the second line landwehr or territorial army the first thing to be observe be the numerical strength of the army thus raise and train if we assume that any body of man lose each year from death disablement and emigration five per cent of its number the annual class would be as follow : -- 1st year age 20-21 200000 -lrb- at the end of the 2nd 21-22 170000 first year 20000 3rd 23-24 161300 be to go abroad 4th 24-25 153425 as explain below -rrb- 5th 25-26 145754 6th 26-27 138467 -------- total on mobilisation 968946 = = = = = = = = this give a army of close upon a million man in first line in addition to the british force in indium egypt and the colonial station if from the age of 27 to that of 31 the man be in the landwehr that force would be compose of four annual class as follow : -- 7th year age 27-28 131544 8th 28-29 124967 9th 29-30 118719 10th 30-31 112784 -------- total of landwehr 488014 = = = = = = = = there be no need to consider the further strength that would be available if the liability be prolong to the age of 39 as it be in germany the liability thus enforce upon all man of sound physique be to fight in a national war a conflict involve for england a struggle for existence but that do not and ought not to involve serve in the garrison of egypt or of indium during peace nor be call upon to take part in one of the small war wage for the purpose of police the empire or its border these function must be perform by professional ie pay soldier the british army have 76000 man in indium and 45000 in egypt south africa and certain colonial station these force be maintain by draft from the regular army at home the draft amount in 1908 to 12000 for indium and 11000 for the colony out of every annual class of 200000 young man there will be a number who after a year 's training will find soldier to they taste and will wish to continue it these should be give the option of engage for a term of eight year in the british force in indium egypt or the colony there they would receive pay and have prospects of promotion to be non-commissioned officer sergeant warrant officer or commission officer and of renew they engagement if they wish either for service abroad or as instructor in the army at home these man would leave for indium egypt or a colony at the end of they first year i assume that 20000 would be require because eight annual class of that strength diminish at the rate of five per cent per annum give a total of 122545 and the eight annual class would therefore suffice to maintain the 121000 now in indium egypt and the colony provision be thus make for the maintenance of the force in indium egypt and the colony there must also be provision for the small war to which the empire be liable this would be make by engage every year 20000 who have finish they first year 's training to serve for pay say 1 a day for a period say of six month of the second year and afterwards to join for five year the present first-class reserve at 6d a day with liability for small war and expedition at the end of the five year these man would merge in the general unpaid reserve of the army they might during they second year 's training be form into a special corps devote most of the time to field maneuver in which supplementary or reserve officer could receive special instruction it would be necessary also to keep with the color for some month after the first year 's training a number of garrison artillery and engineer to provide for the security of fortress during the period between the time of send home one annual class and the preliminary lesson of the next these man would be pay i allow 10000 man for this purpose and these with the 20000 prolong they training for the pay reserve and with the mount troops undergo the second year 's training would give during the winter month a garrison strength at home of 50000 man the mobilised army of a million man would require a great number of extra officer who should be man of the type of volunteer officer select for good education and specially train after they first year 's service in order to qualify they as officer similar provision must be make for supplementary non-commissioned officer xviii the cost it will probably be admit that a army raise and train on the plan here set forth would be far superior in war to the heterogeneous body which figure in the army estimate at a total strength of 540000 regular militia and volunteer its cost would in no case be more than that of the exist force and would probably be considerably less this be the point which require to be prove the 17th appendix to the army estimate be a statement of the cost of the british army arrange under the four heading of : -- 1 cost of personnel of regular army and army reserve # 18279234 2 cost of special reserve and territorial force 5149843 3 cost of armament work store & c 3949463 4 cost of staff and administration 1414360 ___________ make a total of # 28792900 = = = = = = = = = = = in the above table nearly a million be set down for the cost of certain labor establishment and of certain instructional establishment which may for the present purpose be neglect leave they out the present cost of the personnel of the regular army apart from staff be # 15942802 for this cost be maintain officer non-commissioned officer and man numbering altogether 170000 the lowest pay give be that of 1 a day to infantry private the private of the other arm receive somewhat higher and the non-commissioned officer very much higher rate of pay if compulsory service be introduce into great britain pay would become unnecessary for the private soldier but he ought to be and would be give a daily allowance of pocket-money which probably ought not to exceed fourpence the mount troops would be pay at the rate of 1 a day during they second year 's service assume then that the private soldier receive fourpence a day instead of 1 a day and that the officer and non-commissioned officer be pay as at present the cost of the army would be reduce by a amount correspond to 8d a day for 148980 private that amount be # 1812590 the deduction of which would reduce the total cost to # 14137212 at the same rate a army of 200000 private and 20000 non-commissioned officer and man would cost # 18295215 second year of 20000 mount troops at # 60 a year each 1200000 add to this cost of first-class reserve of 96000 at # 10 7 6d

outlay due to larger number -rrb- 4500000 staff and administration 1500000 ------------ total cost of army at home and in the colony # 31294519 this be slightly in excess of the present cost of the personnel of the army but whereas the present charge only provide for the heterogeneous force already describe of 589000 man the charge here explain provide for a short-service homogeneous army of one million and a half as well as for the 45000 troops permanently maintain in egypt and the colony the estimate just give be however extravagant the british system have innumerable different rate of pay and extra allowance of all kind and be so full of anomaly that it be bind to be costly unfortunately the army estimate be so put together that it be difficult to draw from they any exact inference as to the actual annual cost of a private soldier beyond he pay the average annual cost effective and non-effective of a officer in the cavalry artillery engineer and infantry be # 473 this sum cover all the arrangement for pension and retire allowance i propose in the follow calculation to assume the average cost of a officer to be # 500 a year a sum which would make it possible for the average combatant officer to be somewhat better pay than he be at present the normal pay of a sergeant in the infantry of the line be 2s 4d a day or # 42 11 8d a year the army estimate do not give the cost of a private soldier but the statement be make that the average annual cost per head of 150000 warrant officer non-commissioned officer and man be # 63 6 7d the warrant officer and non-commissioned officer appear to be much more expensive than the private and as the minimum pay of a private be # 18 5 the balance # 45 1 7d be probably much more than the cost of housing clothing feeding and equip the private whose food the most expensive item certainly do not cost a shill a day or # 18 a year i assume that the cost of maintain a private soldier be cover by # 36 a year while he allowance of 4d a day amount to # 6 1 4d in order to cover the extra allowance which may be make to corporal bugler and trumpeter i assume the average cost of the rank and file to be # 45 a year i also assume that

the present war establishment which give 5625 officer for 160500 of the other rank it do not include those in egypt and the colony the cost of the officer be take at a higher average rate than that of british officer of the combatant arm under the present system and both for sergeant and for private ample allowance appear to I to be make even on the basis of they present cost when it be consider that germany maintain with the color a force of 600000 man at a cost of # 29000000 that france maintain 550000 for # 27000000 and that italy maintain 221000 for # 7500000 it can not be admit that great britain would be unable to maintain 220000 officer and man at a annual cost of # 17500000 and the probability be that with effective administration this cost could be considerably reduce it may at first sight seem that the logical course would have be to assume two year ' service in the infantry and three year ' service in the mount arm in accord with the german practice but there be several reason that appear to I to make such a proposal unnecessary in the first place great britain 's principal weapon must always be she navy while germany 's principal weapon will always be she army which guarantee the integrity of she three frontier and also guard she against invasion from oversea germany 's navy come only in the second place in any scheme for a german war while in any scheme for a british war the navy must come in the first place and the army in the second the german practice for many year be to retain the bulk of the man for three year with the color it be believe by the older generation of soldier that any reduction of this period would compromise that cohesion of the troops which be the characteristic mark of a disciplined army but the view of the younger man prevail and the period have be reduce by a third the reduction of time have however place a heavier responsibility upon the body of professional instructor the actual practice of the british army prove that a recruit can be fully train and be make fit in every way to take he place in he company by a six month ' training but in my opinion that be not sufficient preparation for war the recruit when thoroughly teach require a certain amount of experience in field operation or maneuver this he would obtain during the summer immediately follow upon the recruit training for the three month of summer or of summer and autumn ought to be devote almost entirely to field exercise and maneuver if the soldier be then call out for maneuver for a fortnight in each of four subsequent year or for a month in each of two subsequent year i believe that the lesson he have learn of operation in the field will thereby be refresh renew and digest so as to give he sufficient experience and sufficient confidence in himself in he officer and in the system to qualify he for war at any moment during the next five or six year the additional three month ' maneuver training beyond the mere recruit training appear to I indispensable for a army that be to be able to take the field with effect but that this period should suffice and that the whole training should be give in nine or ten month of one year follow by annual period of maneuver involve the employment of the best method by a body of officer steep in the spirit of modern tactic and inspire by a general staff of the first order the question what be the shortest period that will suffice to produce cohesion belong to educational psychology how long do it take to form habit how many repetition of a lesson will bring a man into the condition in which he respond automatically to certain call upon he as do a swimmer drop into the water a reporter in form he shorthand word or a cyclist guide and balance he machine in each case two process be necessary there be first the series of progressive lesson in which the movement be learn and master until the pupil can begin practice then follow a period of practice more or less prolonged without which the lesson learn do not become part of the man 's nature he retain the uncertainty of a beginner the recruit course of the british army be of four month a first practice period of six month follow by fresh practice period of a month each in two subsequent year or by four practice period of a fortnight each in four successive year be in the proposal here sketch assume to be sufficient if they be prove inadequate i believe the right plan of supplement they would be rather by add to the number and duration of the maneuver practice of the subsequent year than by prolong the first period of continuous training the follow table show the cost of two year ' service calculate on the same basis as have be assume above two year ' service would mean a army with the color not of 200000 but of 390000 man this would require double the number of officer and sergeant and the annual estimate for personnel would be # 34000000 and the total army estimate # 41000000 there would also be a very

outline could be facilitate at comparatively small cost by the adoption of certain preparatory instruction to be give partly in the school and partly to young man between the age of seventeen and twenty it have never appear to I desirable to add to the school curriculum any military subject whatever and i be convince that no greater mistake could be make see that schoolmaster be universally agree that the curriculum be already overload and require to be lighten and that the best preparation that the school can give for make a boy likely to be a good soldier when grow up be to develop he intelligence and physique as far as the condition of school life admit but if all school child be drill in the evolution of infantry in close order the evolution be always precisely the same as those practice in the army the army would receive its man already drill and would not need to spend much time in recapitulate these practice which make no appreciable demand upon the time of school child again there seem to be no doubt that boy between the age of seventeen and twenty can very well be teach to handle a rifle and the time require for such instruction and practice be so small that it would in no way affect or interfere with the ordinary occupation of the boy whatever they class in life every school of every grade ought as a part of its ordinary geography lesson to teach the pupil to understand to read and to use the ordnance map of great britain and that this should be the case have already be recognize by the board of education a soldier who can read such a map have thereby acquire a knowledge and a habit which be of the greatest value to he both in maneuver and in the field the best physical preparation which the school can give they pupil for the military life as well as for any other life be a well-directed course of gymnastics and the habit of activity order initiative and discipline derive from the practice of the national game a national army be a school in which the young man of a nation be educate by a body of specially train teacher the officer the education give for war consist in a special training of the will and of the intelligence in order that it should be effective the teacher or trainer must not merely be master of the theory and practice of war and of its operation but also proficient in the art of education this conception of the officer ' function fix they true place in the state they duty require for they proper performance the best head as well as the best-schooled will that can be find and impose upon they a laborious life there can be no good teacher who be not also a student and a national army require from its officer a high standard not only of character but of intelligence and knowledge it should offer a career to the best talent a national army must therefore attract the pick man of the university to become officer the attraction to such man consist chiefly in they faith in the value of the work to be do and to a less degree in the prospect of a assure living adequate though not necessarily high pay must be give and there must be a probability of advancement in the career proportionate to the devotion and talent give to the work but they work must be rely upon by the nation otherwise they can not throw they energy into it with full conviction this be the reason why if there be to be a national army it must be the only regular army and the nation must rely upon nothing else to keep a voluntary pay standing army side by side with a national army raise upon the principle of universal duty be neither morally nor economically sound either the nation will rely upon its school or it will not if the school be good enough to serve the nation 's turn a second school on a different basis be needless if a second school be require that would mean that the first could not be trust there can be no doubt that in a national school of war the professional officer must be the instructor otherwise the nation will not rely upon the young man train the 200000 pass through the school every year will be the nation 's best therefore so soon as the system have be at work long enough to produce a force as large as the present total that be after the third year there will be no need to keep up the establishment of 138000 pay private the special reserve or the now exist territorial force there will be one homogeneous army of which a small annual contingent will after each year 's training be enlist for pay service in indium egypt and the oversea station and a second small contingent with extra training will pass into the pay reserve for service in small oversea expedition the professional officer and sergeant will of course be interchangeable between the national army at home and its professional branch in indium egypt and the oversea station and the cadre of the battalion battery and squadron station outside the unite kingdom can from time to time be relieve by the cadre of the battalion ' from the training army at home this relief of battalion be make practicable by the national system one of the first consequence of the new mode of recruiting will be that all recruit will be take on the same give date probably the 1st of January in each year and as this will apply as well to the man who re-engage to serve abroad as to all other so soon as the system be in full work order the man of any battalion abroad will belong to annual class and the engagement of each class will terminate on the same day xx the transition i have now explain the nature and working of a national army and show the kind of strength it will give and the probable maximum cost which it will involve when adopt the chief difficulty attendant upon its adoption lie in the period of transition from the old order to the new if great britain be to keep she place and do she duty in the world the change must be make but the question arise how be the gulf between one and the other to be bridge war come like a thief in the night and it must not catch this country unready the complete readiness which the new system when in full swing will produce can not be obtain immediately all that can be do in the transition period be to see that the number and quality of man available for mobilisation shall be at least as high as it be under the exist system it may be worth while to explain how this result can be secure let we assume that the act authorise the new system be pass during a year which may be call '00 and that it be to come into force on the 1st January of the year '01 the act would probably exempt from its operation the man at the date of its pass already serve in any of the exist force include the territorial army and the discussion on the bill would no doubt have the effect of fill the territorial army up to the limit of its establishment 315000 man on the 31st December '00 the available troops would therefore be : -- regular in the unite kingdom -lrb- present figure -rrb- 138000

regular if need be the old regular could before the fourth year be pass into the pay reserve and the full contingent of 200000 one year 's man take the man of the special reserve and territorial force would on the termination of they engagement pass into the second line reserve or landwehr until the age of thirty-one or thirty-two it will be see that during the year of transition additional expense must be incur as until the change have be complete some portion of the exist force must be maintained side by side with the new national army it be partly in order to facilitate the operation of the transition period that i have assume a large addition to the number of officer there will also be additional expense cause by the increase of barrack accommodation need when the establishment be raise from 138000 private to 200000 but this additional accommodation will not be so great as it might at first sight appear because it be reasonable to suppose that those young man who wish it and whose parent wish it will be allow to live at home instead of in barracks provide they regularly attend all drill parade and class it have be necessary in discuss the british military system to consider the arrangement for provide the garrison of indium egypt and certain oversea station during peace and to make provision for small war or imperial police but i may point out that the system by which provision be make out of the resource of the unite kingdom alone for these two military requirement of the empire be in the present condition of the empire a anomaly the new nation which have grow up in canada australium and new zealand be anxious above all thing to give reality to the bond between they and the mother country they desire be to render imperial service and the proper way of give they the opportunity to do so be to call upon they to take they part in maintain the garrison in indium and egypt and in the work of imperial police how they should do it it be for they to decide and arrange but for englishman at home to doubt for a moment either they will or they capacity to take they proper share of the burden be to show a unworthy doubt of the sincerity of the daughter nation and of they attachment to the mother country and the empire if great britain should be compel to enter upon a struggle for existence with one of the great european power the part which canada australia new zealand and south africa could play in that struggle be limited and specific for the conflict would in the first instance take the form of a naval war to this the king 's dominion beyond the sea can do little more than assist during peace by they contribution either of ship man or money in strengthen the british navy but during the actual course of such a war while it be doubtful whether either canada australium or new zealand could render much material help in a european struggle they could undoubtedly greatly contribute to the security of indium and egypt by the despatch of contingent of they own troops to reinforce the british garrison maintain in those country this appear to I to be the direction to which they attention should turn not only because it be the most effective way in which they can promote the stability of the empire but also because it be the way along which they will most speedily reach a full appreciation of the nature of the empire and its purpose in the world xxi the principle on which army be raise i have now sketch the outline of a national military system applicable to the case of great britain it remain to show why such a system be necessary there be three main point in respect of each of which a choice have to be make they be the motive which induce man to become soldier the time devoted to military education and the nature of the liability to serve in war the distinction which strike the popular imagination be that between voluntary and compulsory service but it cover another distinction hardly less important -- that between pay and unpaid soldier the volunteer between 1860 and 1878 or 1880 when pay begin to be introduce for attendance in camp give they time and they attention with no external inducement whatever they have no pay of any kind and there be no constraint to induce they to join or have join to continue in they corps the regular soldier on the other hand make a contract with the state he agree in return for he pay clothes board and lodging to give he whole time for a specific number of year to the soldier 's life the principle of a contract for pay be necessary in the case of a professional force maintain abroad for purpose of imperial police but it be not possible on that principle to raise or maintain a national army the principle of voluntary unpaid service appear to have a deeper moral foundation than that of service by a contract of hire but if the time require be greater than be consistent with the man 's give a full day 's work to they industrial occupation the unpaid nature of the service can not be maintain and the man must be pay for they time the merit of the man 's free gift of himself be thereby obscure wherein do that merit consist if there be no merit in a man 's make himself a soldier without other reward than that which consist in the education he receive then the voluntary system have no special value but if there be a merit it must consist in the man 's confer a benefit upon or render a service to he country in other word the excellence of the unpaid voluntary system consist in its be a acceptance by those who serve under it of a duty towards the state the performance of that duty raise they citizenship to a higher plane if that be the case it must be desirable in the interest both of the state and of its citizen that every citizen capable of the duty should perform it but that be the principle upon which the national system be base the national system be therefore a extension of the spirit of the volunteer or unpaid voluntary system the term compulsory service and universal service be neither of they strictly accurate there be no means of make every adult male without exception a soldier because not every boy that grow up have the necessary physical qualification nor do the word compulsion give a true picture it suggest that as a rule man would not accept the duty if they could evade it which be not the case the number of man who have be volunteer since 1860 show that the duty be widely accept indeed in a country of which the government be democratic a duty can not be impose by law upon all citizen except with the concurrence of the majority but a duty recognize by the majority and prescribe by law will commend itself as necessary and right to all but a very few if a popular vote be to be take on the question whether or not it be every citizen 's duty to be train as a soldier and to fight in case of a national war it be hardly conceivable that the principle would fail to be affirm by a overwhelming majority the point as to which opinion be divide be the time and method of training and the nature of the liability to serve in war there be roughly speak three scheme of training to be consider -- first the old volunteer plan of weekly evening drill with a annual camp training secondly the militia plan of three month ' recruit training follow by a month 's camp training in several subsequent year and lastly the continental plan of a continuous training for one or more year follow by one or more period of annual maneuver the choice between these three method be the crucial point of the whole discussion it must be determine by the standard of excellence render necessary by the need of the state the evidence give to the norfolk commission convince that body that neither the first nor the second plan will produce troops fit to meet on equal term those of a good modern army professional officer be practically unanimous in prefer the third method the liability of the trained citizen to serve in war during he year in the rank and he year as a first-class reservist must be determine by the military need of the country i have give the reason why i believe the need to be for a army that can strike a blow in a continental war i myself become a volunteer because i be convince that it be a citizen 's duty to train himself to bear arm in he country 's cause i have be for many year a ardent advocate of the volunteer system because i believe as i still believe that a national army must be a army of citizen soldier and from the beginning i have look for the efficiency of such a army mainly to the tactical skill and the educate power of its officer but experience and observation have convince I that a national army such as i have so long hope for can not be produce merely by the individual zeal of its member nor even by they devoted co-operation with one another the spirit which animate they must animate the whole nation if the right result be to be produce for it be evident that the effort of the volunteer continue for half a century to make themselves a army have meet with insuperable obstacle in the social and industrial condition of the country the norfolk commission 's report make it quite clear that the condition of civil employment render it impossible for the training of volunteer to be extend beyond the present narrow limit of time and it be evident that those limit do not permit of a training sufficient for the purpose which be victory in war against the best troops that another nation can produce yet the officer and man of the volunteer force have not carry on they fifty year ' work in vain they have little by little educate the whole nation to think of war as a reality of life they have diminish the prejudice which use to attach to the name of soldier and they have enable they countryman to realize that to fight for he country 's cause be a part of every citizen 's duty for which he must be prepare by train the adoption of this principle will have further result so soon as every able-bodied citizen be by law a soldier the administration of both army and navy will be watch criticise and support with a intelligence which will no longer tolerate dilettantism in authority the citizen 's interest in the state will begin to take a new aspect he will discover the nature of the bond which unite he to he fellow-citizen and from this perception will spring that regeneration of the national life from which alone be to be expect the uplifting of england xxii the chain of duty the reader who have accompany I to this point will perhaps be willing to give I a few minute more in which we may trace the different thread of the argument and see if we can twine they into a rope which will be of some use to we we begin by agree that the people of this country have not make entirely satisfactory arrangement for a competitive struggle at any rate in its extreme form of war with another country although such conflict be possible at any time and we observe that british political arrangement have be make rather with a view to the controversy between party at home than to united action in contest with a foreign state we then glance at the probable consequence to the british people of any serious war and at the much more dreadful result of failure to obtain victory we discuss the theory which lead some of we countryman to be unwilling to consider the nature and condition of war and which make many of they imagine that war can be avoid either by trust to international arbitration or by international agreement for disarmament we agree that it be not safe to rely upon these theory examine the condition of war as they be reveal in the great struggle which finish a hundred year ago we see that the only chance of carry on war with any prospect of success in modern time lie in the nationalisation of the state so that the government can utilise in conflict all the resource of its land and its people in the last war great britain 's national weapon be she navy which she have for century use as a means of maintain the balance of power in europe the service she thus render to europe have its reward in the monopoly of sea power which last through the nineteenth century the great event of that century be the attainment by germany of the unity that make a nation and she consequent remarkable growth in wealth and power result in a maritime ambition inconsistent with the position which england hold at sea during the nineteenth century and be dispose to think eternal great britain in the security due to she victory at sea be able to develop she colony into nation and she east indium company into a empire but that same security cause she to forget she nationalism with the result that now she security itself be imperil during this period when the conception of the nation be in abeyance some of the condition of sea power have be modify with the result that the british monopoly be at a end while the possibility of a similar monopoly have probably disappear so that the british navy even if successful could not now be use as it be a hundred year ago as a means of entirely destroy the trade of a adversary accordingly if in a future war britain be to find a continental ally she must be able to offer he the assistance not merely of naval victory but also of a strong army moreover during the epoch in which great britain have turn she back upon europe the balance of power have be upset and there be no power and no combination able to stand up against germany as the head of the triple alliance this be a position of great danger for england because it be a open question whether in the absence of a strong british army any group of power even in alliance with england could afford to take up a quarrel against the combination of the central state it thus appear that great britain by neglect the condition of she existence as a nation have lose the strength in virtue of which at previous crisis in european history she be the successful champion of that independence of state which in the present stage of human development be the substance of freedom we consideration of the question of might show that if great britain be to be strong enough to meet she responsibility she people must nationalise themselves while we reflection on the question of right show that only from such nationalisation be a sound policy to be expect in short only in so far as she people have the unity of spirit and of will that mark a nation can great britain be either strong or just the idea of the nation imply a work to be do by the british state which have to be on the watch against challenge from a continental rival to great britain 's right to the headship of she empire and which at the same time have to give to that empire the direction without which it can not remain united great britain can not do the work thus impose upon she by she position and she history unless she have the co-operation of all she people thus the conception of the nation reveal itself in the twofold shape of duty lay upon england and of duty consequently lay upon every englishman it mean that england must either decline and fall or do a certain work in the world which be impossible for she unless she constrain all she people to devote themselves to she service it thus appear that england and she people can expect no future worth have except on the principle of duty make the mainspr both of public and of private life we attempt to apply the principle involve in the word nation to the obvious and urgent need of the british state at the present time victory at sea be indispensable for great britain in case of conflict we inquire into the condition of victory and find in the parallel instance of nelson and napoleon that both by sea and land the result of the nationalisation of war be to produce a leader who be the personification of a theory or system of operation the history of the rise of the german nation show how the effort to make a nation produce the necessary statesman bismarck nationalisation create the right leadership -- that of the man who be master of he work review the need of the naval administration we see that what be want at the present time be rather proper organization at the admiralty than a increase in mere material strength while turn to the army we discover that the only system on which can be produce the army that great britain require be that which make every able-bodied citizen a soldier to make the citizen a soldier be to give he that sense of duty to the country and that consciousness of do it which if spread through the whole population will convert it into what be require -- a nation therefore to reform the army accord to some such plan as have be here propose be the first step in that national revival which be the one thing needful for england and if that step be take the rest will follow of itself nationalisation will bring leadership which in the political sphere become statesmanship and the right kind of education to give which be the highest ultimate function of national existence i have try in these page to develop a idea which have haunt I for many year i think if the reader would extend to it even for a short time the hospitality of he mind he might be willing to make it he constant companion for it seem to I to show the way towards the solution of other problem than those which have here be directly discuss i can not but believe that if we could all accustom ourselves to make some sacrifice for the sake of england if only by give a few minute every day to think about she and by try to convince ourselves that those who be not of we party be yet perhaps animated by the same love of they country as we ourselves we might realize that the question of duty be answer more easily by performance than by speculation i suspect that the relation between the political party between capital and labor between master and servant between rich and poor between class and class would become simpler and better if englishman be to come to see how natural it be that they should spend they life for england the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of britain at bay by spenser wilkinson
