in the century handbook of write and the century desk book of good english both of which manual be issue by the present publisher but this volume confines itself to the one task of place at you disposal the means of add to you stock of word of increase you vocabulary it do not assume that you be a scholar or try to make you one to be sure it recognize the end of scholarship as worthy it levy at every turn upon the fact which scholarship have accumulate but it demand of you no technical equipment nor lead you into any of those bypath of knowledge alluring indeed of which the benefit be not immediate for example in chapter v it form into group word etymologically akin to each other it do this for a end entirely practical -- namely that the word you know may help you to understand the word you do not know do it go farther -- do it account for minor difference in these word by show that they spring from related rather than identical original do it explain how and how variously they form have be modify in the long process of they descent -- it would pass beyond its strict utilitarian bound this it refrain from do and thus everything it contain it rigorously subject to the test of serviceability it help you to bring more and more word into workaday harness -- to gain such mastery over they that you can speak and write they with fluency flexibility precision and power it enable you in you use of word to attain the readiness and efficiency expect of a capable and cultivate man there be many way of build a vocabulary as there be many way of attaining and preserve health fanatic may insist that one should be cultivate to the exclusion of the other just as health-crank may declare that diet should be watch in complete disregard of recreation sanitation exercise the need for medicine and one 's mental attitude to life but the sum of human experience rather than fanaticism must determine we procedure moreover experience have show that the various successful method of bring word under man 's sway be not mutually antagonistic but may be practice simultaneously just as health be promote not by attend to diet one year to exercise the next and to mental attitude the third but by bestow wise and fairly constant attention on all yet it would be absurd to state that all method of increase one 's vocabulary or of attain vigor of physique be equally valuable this volume offer everything that help and it yield space in proportion to helpfulness aside from a brief introductory chapter a chapter -lrb- number x -rrb- give over to a list of word and a brief conclude chapter the subject matter of the volume fall into three main division chapter ii and iii be base on the fact that we must all use word in combination -- must fling the word out by the handful even as the accomplished pianist must strike he note chapter iv and v be base on the fact that we must become thoroughly acquaint with individual word -- that no one who scorn to study the separate element of speech can command powerful and discriminate utterance chapter vi vii viii and ix be base on the fact that we need synonym as we constant lackey -- that we should be able to summon not a word that will do but a word that will express the idea with precision exercise scatter throughout the book together with five of the six appendix provide well-nigh inexhaustible material for practice for be it understand once for all that this volume be not a machine which you can set go and then sit idly beside the while you vocabulary broaden mastery over word like worthy mastery of any kind whatsoever involve effort for yourself you can of course contemplate the nature and activity of the mechanism and learn something thereby but also you must work -- work hard work intelligently as you can not acquire health by watch a gymnast take exercise or a doctor swallow medicine or a dietician select food so you can not become a overlord of word without first fight battle to subjugate they hence this volume be for you less a labor-saving machine than a collection and arrangement of material which you must put together by hand it assemble everything you need it tag everything plainly it tell you just what you must do in these way it make you task far easier _ but the task be yours _ industry persistence a fair amount of common sense -- these three you must have without they you will accomplish nothing even with they -- let the forewarning be candid -- you will not accomplish everything you can not learn all there be to be learn about word any more than about human nature and what you do achieve will be not a sudden attainment but a growth this be not the dark side of the picture it be a honest avowal that the picture be not compose altogether of light but as the result of you effort a adequate vocabulary will some day be yours nor will you have to wait long for a earnest of ultimate success just as system will speedily transform a haphazard business into

word appear to we to be only a kind of parlor trick and sometimes it _ be _ just that the command of a wide vocabulary be in truth a accomplishment and like any other accomplishment it may be use for show but not necessarily just as a man may have money without flash it or a extensive wardrobe without sport gaudy necktie or wear a dress suit in the morning so may he possess linguistic resource without make a caddish exhibition of they indeed the more distant he stand from verbal bankruptcy the less likely he be to indulge in needless display again glibness of speech sometimes awaken we distrust we like action rather than word we prefer that character personality and kindly feeling should be they own mouthpiece so be it but there be thought and emotion properly to be share with other people yet incapable of be reveal except through language it be only when language be insincere -- when it express lofty sentiment or generous sympathy yet spring from design selfishness -- that it justly arouse misgiving power over word like power of any other sort be for use not abuse that it sometimes be abused must not mislead we into think that it should in itself be scorn or neglect we contempt and distrust do not mean that we fundamental idea about language be unsound beneath we wholesome dislike for shallow facility and insincerity of speech we have a conviction that the mastery of word be a good thing not a bad we be therefore unwilling to take the vow of linguistic poverty if we lack the ability to bend word to we use it be from laziness not from scruple we desire to speak competently but without affectation we know that if we diction rise to this dual standard it silently distinguish we from the sluggard the weakling and the upstart for such diction be not to be have on sudden notice like a tailor-made suit nor can it like such a suit deceive anybody as to we true status a man 's utterance reveal what he be it be the measure of he inward attainment the assertion have be make that for a man to express himself freely and well in he native language be the surest proof of he culture meditate the say can you think of a proof that be surer but a man 's speech do more than lend he distinction it do more than reveal to other what manner of man he be it be a instrument as well as a index it be a agent -- oftentimes indeed it be _ the _ agent -- of he influence upon other how silly be those person who oppose word to thing as if word be not thing at all but air-born unreality word be among the most powerful reality in the world you vote the republican ticket why because you have study the issue of the campaign and reach a well-reasoned conclusion how the general interest may be serve possibly but nine time in ten it will be because of that _ word _ republican you may believe that in a give instance the republican cause or candidate be inferior you may have nothing personally to lose through republican defeat yet you squirm and twist and seek excuse for cast a republican ballot such be the power -- aye sometimes the tyranny -- of a word the word _ republican _ have not be select invidiously _ democrat _ would have serve as well or take religious word -- _ catholic methodist presbyterian episcopalian baptist lutheran _ or what not a man who belong in person or by proxy to one of the sect designate may be more indifferent to the institution itself than to the word that represent it thus you may attack in he presence the tenet of presbyterianism for example but you must be wary about call the presbyterian name _ mother the flag _ -- what sooner than a insult couple with these term will rouse a man to fight but do that man kiss he mother or salute the flag or pay much heed to either probably not word not reality with what reality must we more carefully reckon word be as dangerous as dynamite as beneficent as brotherhood a unfortunate word may mean a plea reject a enterprise baffle half the world plunge into war a fortunate word may open a triple-barred door avert a disaster bring thousand of people from jealousy and hatred into coöperation and goodwill nor be it solely on they emotional side that man may be affect by word they thinking and they esthetic nature also -- they hard sense and they personal likes and dislike -- be subject to the same influence you interview a potential investor do he accept you proposition or not a prospective customer walk into you store do he buy the goods you show he you enter the draw room of one of the elite be you invite again and again you word will largely decide -- you word or you verbal abstinence for be it remember that word no more than dollar be to be scatter broadcast for the sole reason that you have they the right word should be use at the right time -- and at that time only silence be oftentimes golden nevertheless there be occasion for we to speak frequent occasion to be inarticulate _ then _ may mean only embarrassment it may -- some day it will -- mean suffering and failure that we may make the most of the important occasion sure to come we must have we instrument ready those instrument be word he who command word command event -- command man ii word in combination : some pitfall you wish then to increase you vocabulary of course you must become observant of word and inquisitive about they for word be like people : they have they own particular characteristic they do they work well or ill they be in good odor or bad and they yield best service to he who love they and try to understand they you curiosity about they must be burn and insatiable you must study they when they have withdraw from the throng of they fellow into the quiescence of they natural self you must also see they and study they in action not only as they be employ in good book and by careful speaker but likewise as they fall from the lip of unconventional speaker who through they secure vivid and telling effect in brief you must learn word nature as you learn human nature from a variety of source now in ordinary speech most of we use word not as individual thing but as part of a whole -- as cog in the machine of utterance by which we convey we thought and feeling we do not think of they separately at all and this instinct be sound in we expression we be like large-scale manufacturing plant rather than one-man establishment we have at we disposal not one worker but a multitude hence we be concern with we employee collectively and with the total production of which they be capable to be sure we understanding of they as individual will increase the worth and magnitude of we output but clearly we must have large dealings with they in the aggregate this chapter and the follow therefore be give over to the study of word in combination as in all matter there be a negative as well as a positive side to be reckon with let we consider the negative side first <tameness> correct diction be too often insipid there be nothing wrong with it but it do not interest we -- it lack character lack color lack power it too closely resemble what we conceive of the angel as have -- impeccability without the warmth of camaraderie speech like a man should be alive it need not of course be boisterous it may be intense in a quiet modest way but if it too sedulously observe all the _ thou shalt not 's _ of the rhetorician it will refine the vitality out of itself and leave its hearer unmoved that be why you should become a disciple of the pithy everyday conversationalist and of the rough-and-ready master of harangue as well as of the practitioner of precise and scrupulous discourse many a speaker or writer have thwart himself by try to be literary even burn when he write classic english be somewhat conscious of himself and make in most instance no extraordinary impression but the piece he impetuously dash off in he native scotch dialect can never be forget the man who begin by write naturally but as he importance in the publishing world grow pay more and more attention to felicity -- to style -- and so spoil himself be know to the editor of every magazine any editorial office force can insert miss comma and semicolon and iron out blunder in the english but it have not the time if indeed the ability to instil life into a lifeless manuscript a living style be rarer than a inoffensive one and the road of literary ambition be strew with failure due to correctness cultivate readiness even daring of utterance a single turn of expression may be so audacious that it pluck a idea from its shroud or place within we a emotion still quiver and warm sustained discourse may unflaggingly clarify or animate but such triumph be beyond the reach of those whether speaker or writer who be constantly pause to grope for word this do not mean that scrutiny of individual word be waste effort such scrutiny become the basis indeed of the more venturesome and inspired achievement we must serve we apprenticeship to language we must know word as a general know the man under he -- all they rank they capability they shortcoming the detail and routine of they daily existence but the end for which we gain we understanding must be to hurl these word upon the enemy not as disconnect unit but as battalion as brigade as corps as army dr johnson one of the most effective talker in all history resolve early in life that always and whatever topic might be broach he would on the moment express he thought and feeling with as much vigor and felicity as if he have unlimited leisure to draw on and patrick henry one of the few

burke 's turn of phrase be extremely bold and original as the religion most prevalent in we northern colony be a refinement on the principle of resistance it be the dissidence of dissent and the protestantism of the protestant religion moreover with all he fulness of diction burke could cleave to the heart of a idea in a few word as freedom be to they -lrb- the southern slave-holder -rrb- not

at least make a mental note of halt or listless expression in a sermon a public address or a conversation find more emphatic wording for the idea thus mar 9 to train yourself in readiness and daring of utterance practice impromptu discussion of any of the topic in activity 1 for exercise - discourse <slovenliness> though we be to recognize the advantage of work in the undress of speech rather than in stiffly-laundered literary linen though we be not to despise the accession of strength and of charm which we may obtain from the homely and familiar we must never be careless the man whose speech be slovenly be like the man who chew gum -- unblushingly commonplace we must struggle to maintain we individuality we must not be a mere copy of everybody else we must put into we word the cordiality we put into we daily demeanor if we greet friend or stranger carelessly conventionally we should soon be regard as person of no force or distinction so of we speech and we write nothing to be sure be more difficult than to give they freshness without rob they of naturalness and ease yet that be what we must learn to do we shall not acquire the power in a day we shall acquire it as a chess or a baseball player acquire he skill -- by long effort hard practice one thing to avoid be the use of word in loose or fast-and-loose sens do not say that own a watch be a fine proposition if you mean that it be advantageous do not say that you tremble on the brink of disaster if you be threaten with no more than inconvenience or comparatively slight injury do not say you be literally scare to death if you be yet alive to tell the story exercise - slovenliness i give moderate or accurate utterance to the follow idea : the burning of the hen-coop be a mighty conflagration the fact that the point of the pencil be break profoundly surprised I we have a perfectly gorgeous time it be a beastly shame that i miss my car it be awfully funny that he should die the saleslady pull the washlady 's hair a cold bath be pretty nice of morning to go a little late be just the article another thing to avoid be the use of word in the wrong part of speech as a noun for a verb or a adjective for a adverb sometimes newspaper be guilty of such fault for journalistic english though pithy show here and there trace of its rapid composition you must look to more leisurely authority the speaker and writer on whom you may rely will not say to burglarize to suspicion to enthuse plenty rich real tired considerable discourage a combine or human a exhaustive list of such error can not be insert here if you feel yourself uncertain in these detail of usage you should have access to such a volume as _ the century desk book of good english _ exercise - slovenliness ii 1 for each quote expression in the precede paragraph compose a sentence which shall contain the correct form or the grammatical equivalent of the expression 2 correct the follow sentence : the tramp suicide she be real excite he gesture angry he be some anxious to get to the eat all of we have a invite they boy have sure be tease the canine another thing to avoid be triteness the english language teem with phrase once strikingly original but now smooth-worn and vulgarize by incessant repetition it can scarcely be say that you be to shun these altogether now and then you will find one of they come happily as well as handily into you speech but you must not use they too often above all you must rid yourself of any dependence upon they the scope of this book permit only a few illustration of the kind of word and phrase mean but the person who speak of lurid flame or untiring effort or specimen of humanity -- who view with alarm or have a native heath or be to the manner bear -- do more than advertise the scantness of he verbal resource he brand himself mentally indolent he deprive he thought itself of all sharpness exactness and power exercise - slovenliness iii replace with more original expression the trite phrase -lrb- italicize -rrb- in the follow sentence : _ last but not least _ we have _ in we midst _ one who begin life _ poor but honest _ after we have _ do justice to a dinner _ and gather in the draw room we listen _ with bated breath _ while she _ favor we with a selection _ _ a goodly number _ of _ the fair sex _ perceive that _ the psychological moment _ have come _ applaud

well-chosen word _ he _ bring order out of chaos _ the way my effort be _ nip in the bud _ simply _ beggar description _ i be somewhat _ the worse for wear hope you be the same _ i remain yours sincerely ned burke finally to the extent that you use slang at all be its master instead of its slave you have many time be tell that the overuse of slang disfigure one 's speech and hamper he standing with cultivate people you have also be tell that slang constantly change so that one 's accumulation of it today will be a profitless clutter tomorrow these thing be true but a even more cogent objection remain slang be detrimental to the formation of good intellectual habit from its very nature it can not be precise can not discriminate closely it be a vehicle for loose-thinking people it be fraught with unconsidered general meaning it move in a region of mental mist it could not flourish as it do be fewer of we content to express vague thought and feeling instead of those which be sharply and specifically ours unless therefore you wish you intellectual process to be as hazy and haphazard as those of mental shirker and loafer you must eschew not necessarily all slang but all heedless all habitual use of it now and then a touch of slang judiciously choose be effective now and then it fulfil a legitimate purpose of language but normally you should express yourself as befit one who have at he disposal the rich treasury of the dictionary instead of a mere stock of greasy counterfeit phrase exercise - slovenliness iv replace the follow slang with acceptable english : we pull a new wrinkle he be a easy mark oh you be nutty beat it i have all the inside dope you can not bamboozle I what a phiz the bloke have you be talk through you hat we have a long

on the rough stuff and there i get pinch by a cop for parking my tin lizzie <wordiness> as a precaution against tameness you should cultivate spontaneity and daring as a precaution against slovenliness you should cultivate freshness and accuracy but to display spontaneity daring freshness accuracy you must have or acquire a large stock a wide range of word now this possession like any other bring with it temptation if we have word we like to use they nor do we wait for a indulgence in this luxury until we have consciously set to work to amass a vocabulary verbosity be in truth the beset linguistic sin most people be lavish with word as most people be lavish with money this be not to say that in the currency of language they be rich but even if they lack the means -- and the desire -- to be extravagant they yet make they purchase heedlessly or fail to count they linguistic change the degree of we thrift not the amount of we income or resource be what mark we as be or not be verbal spendthrift the frugal manager buy he idea at exactly the purchase price he do not expend a twenty-dollar bill for a box of match have word by all mean the more of they the better but use they temperately sparingly do not think that a passage to be admirable must be stud with ostentatious term consider the gettysburg address or the parable of the prodigal son these convey they thought and feeling perfectly yet both be simple -- exquisitely simple they strike we indeed as be inevitable -- as if they phrasing could not have be other than it be they have they be finality what could glitter phraseology add to they nothing it could only mar they yet lincoln and the scriptural writer be not afraid to use big word when occasion require what they seek be to make they speech adequate without carry a superfluous syllable the sun set be more natural and effective than the celestial orb that bless we terrestrial globe with its warm and luminous ray sink to its nocturnal repose behind the western horizon great writer -- the true master -- have often hold fine writing and pretentious speak up to ridicule thus shakespeare have kent who have be rebuke for he bluntness indulge in a grandiloquent outburst : sir in good sooth in sincere verity under the allowance of you grand aspect whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire on flicker phoebus ' front -- no wonder kent be interrupt with a what meanest by this sometimes great writer use ornate utterance for humorous effect thus dickens again and again have mr micawber express a commonplace idea in sound term which at length fail he so that he must interject a in short and summarize he meaning in a phrase amusing through its homely contrast but humor base on ponderous diction be too often wearisome better say simply he die or colloquially he kick the bucket than he propel he pedal extremity with violence against the wooden pail which be customarily employ in the transportation of the aquatic fluid exercise

on the right side of public question to occupy the position of president of the united state of america he who pass at a accelerate pace may nevertheless be capable of peruse a masculine member of the human race be mount on a equine quadruped but the number of the term we employ as well as they ostentatiousness must be consider most of we blunder around in the neighborhood of we meaning instead of express it briefly and clearly we throw a handful of word at a idea when one word would suffice we try to bring the idea down with a shotgun instead of a rifle of course one mean of correction be that we should acquire accuracy a quality already discuss another be that we should practice condensation first let we learn to omit the word which add nothing to the meaning thus in the sentence a important essential in cash a check be that you should indorse it on the back several word or group of word needlessly repeat idea which be express elsewhere the sentence be as complete in substance and far terser in form when it read a essential in cash a check be that you should indorse it next let we when we may reduce phrase and even clause to a word thus the clause at the beginning and the phrase at the close of the following sentence constitute sheer verbiage : man who have let they temper get the better of they be often in a mood to do harm to somebody the sentence tell we nothing that may not be tell in five word : angry man be often dangerous finally let we substitute phrase or clause for unnecessary sentence the following series of independent assertion contain avoidable repetition : one morning i be ride on the subway to my work it be always my custom to ride to my work on the subway this morning i meet harry blake the full thought may better be embody in a single sentence : one morning while i be as usual ride on the subway to my work i meet harry blake by apply these instruction to any page at hand -- one from you own write one from a letter some friend have send you one from a book or magazine -- you will often be able to strike out many of the word without at all impair the meaning another means of acquire succinct expression be to practice the composition of telegram and cable message you will of course lessen the cost by eliminate every word that can possibly be spare on the other hand you must bear it in mind that you punctuation will not be transmit and that the recipient must be absolutely safeguard against read together word mean to be separate or separate word mean to be read together that be you message must be both concise and unmistakably clear exercise - wordiness ii 1 condense the editorial -lrb- appendix 1 -rrb- by eliminate unnecessary word and find briefer equivalent for roundabout expression 2 try to condense similarly the parable of the sower -lrb- appendix 3 -rrb- and the seven age of man -lrb- appendix 4 -rrb- -lrb- the task will largely or altogether baffle you but will involve minute study of tersely

shriek of the locomotive it sound terrible too i hear what kind of chauffeur he be a former employer of he tell I he be a chauffeur who speed in reckless fashion because he be fond of have all the excitement possible 4 condense the follow into telegram of ten word or less : arrive here in toledo yesterday morning talk with the director find they not hostile to we but friendly detective report they think evidence now point to innocence of man arrest and to former employee as the burglar 5 the follow telegram be ambiguous clarify they jane escape illness i fear charley better buy oil if

of the stock in a give company you find that many of the stockholder distrust or dislike the president and be willing to sell some of these ask only $ 50 a share for they holding the owner of 100 share want as much as $ 92 the average price ask be $ 76 by buy out all the president 's enemy which you can now do beyond question you would secure a bare majority of the stock but $ 92 a share seem to you excessive that be you think that by work quietly among the president 's friend you can get 100 share at $ 77 or thereabout and thus save approximately $ 1500 on the other hand should you dealings with the friend of the president give he premature warning he might stop the sale by these friend and himself begin buy from he enemy and thus make you purchase of a majority of the stock

tick and that cause I to look at it it sit on the mantelpiece with some layer of paper under one corner where the mantel be warped when the papers slip out or we move the clock a little as we be dust the tick stop right away of course the clock 's not a new one at all but it be a old one it have be in the family for many a long year yes from even before my father 's time let I see it be buy by my grandfather no it could not have be grandfather that buy it it be he brother oh yes i remember now my mother tell I all about it and i would forget what she say till this minute but really my grandfather 's brother do not exactly buy it he just trade for it he give two pig and a saddle that be what my mother say you see he be afraid he hog might take cholera and so he want to get rid of they and as for the saddle he have sell he riding-horse and he do not have any more use for that well it be not a valuable clock like a grandfather clock or anything of that sort though it be antique as i be say when i glance at it it read seven minute to six i remember the time very well for just then the factory whistle blow and i remember say to myself : it be seven minute slow today you see it be old and we do not keep it oil and so it be always lose time hardly a day pass but i set it up -- sometimes twice a day as for the matter of that -- and i usually go by the factory whistle too though now and then i go by dwight 's gold watch well anyhow that tell I what time it be i be certain i can not be wrong 2 study on the other hand the castaway -lrb- appendix 5 -rrb- for its judicious use of detail defoe in he story be a supreme master of verisimilitude -lrb- likeness to truth -rrb- as we read he we can not help believe that these thing actually happen more than in anything else the secret of he lifelikeness lie in he constant faithfulness to reality he put in the little mishap that would have befall a man so situate the thing he would have do the difficulty he might have avoid have he exercise forethought though defoe have little insight into the complexity of man 's inner life he have not be surpass in he accumulation of naturalistic outer detail these do not cumber he narrative they contribute to its purpose and add to its effectiveness in this selection -lrb- appendix 5 -rrb- observe how plausible be such homely detail as crusoe 's see no sign of he comrade except three of they hat one cap and two shoe that be not fellow as he difficulty in get aboard the ship again and as he have he clothes wash away by the rising of the tide find half a dozen other such incident that you consider especially effective <verbal discords> we may pitch we talk or we writing in almost any i key we choose we mood may be dreamy or eager or hilarious or grim or blustering or somber or bantering or scornful or satirical or whatever we will but once we have establish the tone we should not -- except sometimes for broadly humorous effect -- change it needlessly or without clear forewarning if we do we create a one or the other of two obstacle or both of they for whoever be try to follow what we say in the first place we obscure we meaning for example we have be speak ironically and suddenly swerve into serious utterance or we have be speak seriously and then incongruously adopt a ironic tone how be we listener we reader to take we they be puzzle they do not know in the second place we offend -- perhaps in insidious indefinable fashion -- the esthetic propriety we violate the natural fitness of thing for example we have be speak with colloquial freedom sprinkle we discourse with _ should not _ and _ will not _ suddenly we be come formal and say _ should not _ and will _ not _ we meaning be as obvious as before but the verbal harmony have be interrupt we hearer or reader be uneasily aware of a break in the unity of tone a speaker or writer be a host to verbal guest when he invite they to he assembly he give each the tacit assurance that it will not be bring into fellowship with those which in one or another of a dozen subtle way will be uncongenial company for it he must never be forgetful of this unspoken promise if he be to avoid a linguistic breach he must constantly have he wit about he must study out he combination carefully and use all he knowledge all he tact he will make due use of spontaneous impulse but that this may be wise and disciplined he will form the habit of curiosity about word they station they savor they aptitude they limitation they outspokenness they reticence they affinity and antipathy thus when he have need of a phrase to fill out a verbal dinner party he will know which one to select certain broad classification of word be manifest even to the most obtuse user of english _ shady behead _ and _ lie _ be popular word while they synonym _ umbrageous _ decapitate _ and _ mendacious _ be learn word _ flabbergast _ and _ higgledy-piggledy _ be colloquial while _ roseate _ and _ whilom _ be literary _ affidavit allegro _ _ lee shore _ and _ pinch hit _ be technical while _ vamp _ _ savvy bum hunch _ and _ skiddoo _ be slang it would be disenchant indeed be extreme of this sort bring together but offens of a less glaring kind be as hard to shut out as February cold from a heated house unusual be the speech or composition even the short one in which every word be in keep be in perfect tune with the rest for the attainment of this ultimate verbal decorum we should have to possess knowledge almost unbounded together with unerring artistic instinct but diction of a kind only measurably inferior to this be possible to we if we be in earnest to attain it we must study the difference between abstract and concrete term and let neither intrude unadvisedly upon the presence or function of the other do the same by literal and figurative term and instruct ourselves in the nature and significance of connotation before consider these more detailed matter however we may pause for a general exercise on verbal harmony exercise - discord 1 study the editorial in appendix 1 for unforewarned change in mood and assemblage of mutually uncongenial word rewrite the worst two paragraph to remove all blemish of these kind 2 compare burke 's speech -lrb- appendix 2 -rrb- with defoe 's narrative -lrb- appendix 5 -rrb- for the difference in tone between they do each keep the tone it adopt -lrb- that be except for desirable change -rrb- 3 note the change in tone in the seven age of man -lrb- appendix 4 -rrb- do the change in substance make these change in tone desirable 4 in the follow passage make such change and omission as be necessary to unify the tone : how i love to stroll on those long indian summer afternoon into the quiet meadow where the mild-breathed kine be grazing a old cow that switch she tail at fly and put she foot in the bucket when you milk she i absolutely loathe how i love to hear the bird sing to listen to the fall of ripe autumnal apple it be not the girl yclept sally this girl be not so vivacious as sally but she have a mug on she that be a lot less ugly to look at gee when she stand there in front of I with those mute ineffable

<i abstract vs concrete terms general vs specific terms> abstract term convey idea concrete term call up picture if we say honesty be the best policy we speak abstractly nobody can see or hear or touch the thing _ honesty _ or the thing _ policy _ the apprehension of they must be purely intellectual but if we say the rat begin to gnaw the rope we speak concretely _ rat _ _ gnaw _ and _ rope _ be tangible perceptible thing the word bring to we vision of particular object and action now when we engage in explanation and discussion of principle theory broad social topic and the like -- when we expound moralize or philosophize -- we subject matter be general we approach we reader or hearer on the think the rational side of they nature we phraseology be therefore normally abstract but when on the other hand we narrate a event or depict a appearance we subject matter be specific we approach we reader or hearer on the sensory or emotional side of they nature we phraseology be therefore normally concrete you should be able to express yourself accord to either method you should be able to choose the word best suit to make people understand also to choose the word best suit to make people realize vividly and feel now to some extent you will adopt the right method by intuition but if you do not reinforce you intuition with a careful study of word you will vacillate from one method to the other and strike crude discord of phrasing of course if you switch method intelligently and of purpose that be quite another matter a abstract discussion may be enliven by a concrete illustration a concrete narrative or portrayal may be give weight and rationalize by generalization moreover many thing lie on the borderland between the two domain and may properly be attach to either thus the abstraction be legitimate when you say or write : a man wish to acquire the comfort and luxury as well as the necessaries of life the concreteness be likewise legitimate when you say or write : john smith wish to earn cake as well as bread and butter in most instance general term be the same as abstract and specific the same as concrete some subtle discrimination may however be make of these the only one that need concern we here be that the wording of a passage may not be abstract and yet be general suppose for example you be tell the story of the prodigal son and should say : he be very hungry and could not obtain food anywhere when he have come to he sens he think ' i should be better off at home ' this language be not abstract but it be general rather than specific when jesus tell the story he wish to put the situation as poignantly as possible and therefore avoid both abstract and general term : and he would fain have fill he belly with the husk that the swine do eat : and no man give unto he and when he come to himself he say how many hire servant of my father 's have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger many a person who shun abstraction and talk altogether of the concrete thing of life yet trap out circumstance in general rather than specific term to do this be always to sacrifice force exercise - abstract 1 discuss as abstractly as possible such topic as those list in activity 1 for exercise - discourse or as the following : be there any such thing as luck be the golden rule practicable in the modern business world be modesty rather than self-assertion regard he own merit and ability the better policy for a employee be substantial home-keeping girl or girl rather fast and frivolous the more likely to obtain good husband be it desirable for a young man to take out life insurance be self-education better than collegiate training should one always tell the truth 2 discuss as concretely as possible the topic you have select from 1 use illustration draw from life 3 restate in concrete term such generalization as the following : experience be the best teacher self-preservation be the first law of nature to he who in the love of nature hold communion with she visible form she speak a various language necessity be the mother of invention the bravest be the tenderest vanity of vanity all be vanity pride goeth before destruction the evil that man do life after they 4 compare the abstract statement truth and high ethical principle be receive by various man in various way with the concrete presentation of the same idea in appendix 3 which expression of the thought would be the more easily understand by the average person why which would you yourself remember the longer why 5 compare the statement the second period of a human being 's life be that of he reluctant attendance at school with shakespeare 's picture of the schoolboy in appendix 4 6 burke near the close of he speech -lrb- appendix 2 -rrb- present a idea first in general term and then in specific term thus : no contrivance can prevent the effect ofdistance in weaken government sea roll and month pass between the order and the execution and the want of a speedy explanation of a single point be enough to defeat a whole system find elsewhere in burke 's speech and in the editorial -lrb- appendix i -rrb- general assertion which may be make more forceful by restatement in specific term and supply these specific restatement 7 state in you own word the general thought or teaching of the parable of the prodigal son -lrb- _ luke _ 15 : 11-24 -rrb- 8 make the follow statement more concrete : in front of we house be a tree that at a certain season of the year display highly color foliage a celebrated orator say : give I liberty or give I death on the table be some viand that assail my nostril agreeably and other that put into my mouth sensation of anticipated enjoyment from this window above the street i can hear a variety of noise by day and a variety of different noise by night as he grope through the pitch-dark room he could feel many article of furniture 9 state in general term the thought of the follow sentence : a burnt child dread the fire a stitch in time save nine a cat may look at a king a bark dog never bite if he son ask bread will he give he a stone if two man ride a horse one must ride behind stone wall do not a prison make a merry heart go all the day thrice be he arm that have he quarrel just as the twig be bent so the tree be inclined 10 describe a town as see from a particular point of view or at a particular time of day or under particular atmospheric condition make you description as concrete as possible 11 compare you description with this from stevenson : the town come down the hill in a cascade of brown gable bestride by smooth white roof and spangled here and there with light window stevenson 's sentence contain twenty-five word how many of they be color word how many motion word how many of the first twenty-five word in you description appeal to one or another of the five sens 12 narrate as vividly as possible a experience in you own life compare what you have write with the account of crusoe 's escape to the island -lrb- appendix 5 -rrb- which narrative be the more concrete how much -lrb- 2 literal vs figurative term -rrb- phraseology be literal when it say exactly what it mean be figurative when it say one thing but really mean another thus he fight bravely be literal he be a lion in the fight be figurative literal phraseology as a rule appeal to we scientific or understand faculty figurative to we emotional faculty here again as with abstraction and concreteness you should learn to express yourself by either method both have they advantage and they drawback we all admire the man who have observe and can state accurately it be upon this belief of ours in the literal that defoe shrewdly traffic -lrb- see appendix 5 -rrb- he do not stir we as some writer do but he gain we implicit confidence dame quickly on the contrary make egregious use of the literal -lrb- see paragraph above exercise - wordiness iii above -rrb- she fact be accurate yes but how strictly how unsparingly accurate and how many of they be beside the point she quite convince we that the devotee of the literal may be dull a advantage of the figurative also be that it may make meaning lucid thus when burke near the close of he discussion -lrb- appendix 2 -rrb- wish to make it clear that by a law of nature the authority of extensive empire be slighter in its more remote territory he have recourse to a figure of speech : in large body the circulation of power must be less vigorous at the extremity nature have say it more often however the function of the figurative be to drive home a thought or a mood of which a mere statement would leave we unmoved -- to make we _ feel _ it thus burke say of the american they love of liberty as with you fix and attach on this specific point of tax he add : here they feel its pulse and as they find that beat they think themselves sick or sound have you be one of he parliamentary hearer would not that second sentence have make more real and more important the colonial attitude to taxation the poet of course make frequent and noble use of the figurative this be how coleridge tell we that the descent of a tropical night be sudden : the sun 's rim dip the star rush out at one stride come the dark the word _ rush out _ and _ at one stride come _ convert the star and the darkness into vast being or at least vast personal force the comparison be so natural as to seem inevitable we be transport to the very scene and feel the overwhelming abruptness of the nightfall but if a figure of speech seem artificial if it be strain or far-fetched or merely decorative it subtract from the effectiveness of the passage thus when tennyson say : when the breeze of a joyful dawn blow free in the silken sail of infancy we must stop and ponder before we perceive that what he mean be when i be a happy child the figure be like a exotic plant rather than a natural outgrowth of the soil it appear to we something think up and stick on it be a parasite rather than a helper of course as with abstraction and concreteness you should develop facility in glide from literalness to figurativeness and back again but you be always to remember that you gymnastics be not to militate against verbal concord you must never set word scowl and growl at each other through injudicious combination like this : she be five foot four and three-quarter inch high have a small round scar between she nose and she left cheek-bone and move with the lissom and radiant grace of a queen exercise - literal 1 give the specification for a house you intend to build 2 make a list of comparison -lrb- as to a nest a haven a goal -rrb- to show what such a house might mean in the life of a man expand as many of these comparison as you can but do not carry the process to absurd length -lrb- in the figure of the nest you may mention the parent bird they activity the nestling in the figure of the haven you may mention the quiet sheltered water in contrast to the turbulent billow outside in the figure of the goal you may mention the struggle necessary to reach it -rrb- 3 describe the look of the house use as many figure of speech as you can if you can find no appropriate figure at least make you word specific 4 give a surveyor 's or a tax assessor 's or a conveyancer 's description of a piece of land then describe the land through figure of speech which will vivify its outward appearance or its emotional significance to the owner 5 observe that the parable of the sower -lrb- appendix 3 -rrb- be a extended figure of speech be the main figure effective be its detailed application effective 6 the seven age of man -lrb- appendix 4 -rrb- be also a extended figure of speech do it as shakespeare intend bring vividly to you consciousness the course motive stage evolution of a human being 's life there be several subsidiary figure do these add force definiteness to the picture shakespeare be draw at that moment 7 observe from appendix 3 appendix 4 and the sentence list in activity 9 for exercise - abstract above that a thing mean to be concrete be likely to be state figuratively 8 examine the castaway -lrb- appendix 5 -rrb- for its proportionate use of literal and figurative element see activity 2 of exercise - wordiness iii above for a statement of defoe 's purpose could he have effect this purpose so well have he employ more figure of speech 9 examine appendix 2 for its use of figure be the figure appropriate to the subject matter be there enough of they 10 galvanize the thought of any sentence or paragraph in editorial -lrb- appendix 1 -rrb- by the use of a figure of speech 11 summarize or illustrate you opinion on any of the topic list in activity 1 for exercise - discourse through the employment of figure of speech 12 be these figure effective man be bear unto trouble as the spark fly upward the flower of we young manhood be scale the ladder of success fair as a star when only one be shine in the sky silence like a poultice come to heal the blow of sound in my head many thought of trouble come like to fly upon a plum let I tell you first about those barnacle that clog the wheel of society by poisoning the spring of rectitude with they upas-like eye the day be do and the darkness fall from the wing of night as a feather be waft downward from a eagle in he flight yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil life like a dome of many-colored glass stain the white radiance of eternity mountain stand out like pimple or lay like broken welt across the habitable ground life 's but a walk shadow a poor player that strut and fret he hour upon the stage and then be hear no more it be a tale tell by a idiot full of sound and fury signify nothing i see he in russium where the infantry of the snow and the cavalry of the wild blast scatter he legion like winter 's withered leaf 13 recast the follow sentence to eliminate the clashing of literal and figurative element : life be like a rich treasure entrust to we and to sustain it we must have three square meal a day she glance at the mirror but do not really see herself she be try to puzzle out the right course and could only see as through a glass darkly arm himself with the sword of zeal and the buckler of integrity he write the letter he sweep the floor every morning and be a ray of sunshine in the office he also empty the waste basket and clean the cuspidor -lrb- 3 connotation -rrb- the connotation of a word be the subtle implication the emotional association it carry -- often quite apart from its dictionary definition thus the word _ house _ and _ home _ in large measure overlap in meaning but emotionally they be not equivalent at all you can say _ house _ without experience any sensation whatever but if you utter the word _ home _ it will call back however slightly tender and cherish recollection _ bald head _ and _ gray hair _ be both indicative of age but you would pronounce the former in disparage allusion to elderly person and the latter with sentiment of veneration you would say of a clodpole that he play the _ fiddle _ but of fritz kreisler that he play the _ violin _ and just as you unconsciously adapt word to feeling in these obvious instance you must learn on peril of striking false note verbally to do so when distinction be less gross moreover circumstance as well as sentiment may control the connotation of a word a word or phrase may have a double or triple connotation and depend upon vocal inflection upon gesture upon the word with which it be link upon the experience of speaker or hearer upon time place and external fact or upon other force outside it for the sense in which it be to be take you may be call old dog in a insulting manner or -lrb- especially if a slap on the shoulder accompany the phrase -rrb- in a affectionate manner you may properly say calhoun have logic on he side add however the word but he face be to the past and you spoil the sentence -- for _ face _ give a reflex connotation to _ side _ slight perhaps and momentary but disconcerting think over the funny story you have hear many of they turn you will find on the outcropping of new significance in a phrase because of its environment thus the anecdote of the servant who have be instruct to summon the visit english nobleman by tap on he bedroom door and inquire my lord have you yet rise and who could only stammer my god be not you up yet or the anecdote of the minister who in a sermon on the parable of the prodigal son tell how a young man living dissolutely in a city have be compel to send to the pawnbroker first he overcoat next he suit next he silk shirt and finally he very underclothing -- and then add the minister he come to himself only by unrest vigilance can you evade verbal discord if not of this magnitude at least of much frequency and stylistic harm exercise - connotation 1 note the contrast in emotional suggestion that come to you from hear the word : sodium chloride and salt a test-tube of h2o and a cup of cold water a pair of brogan and a little empty shoe bump and collide a brilliant fellow and a flashy fellow bungle it and do not succeed tumble and fall dawn and 6 be lick and worst fat and plump weep and blubber cheek and self-assurance stink and disagreeable odor steal and embezzle thievishness and kleptomania educate and highbrow job and position tell a lie and fall into verbal inexactitude a drunkard -lrb- a stranger -rrb- and a drunkard -lrb- you father -rrb- 2 make a list of you own similar to that in exercise 1 3 read the sentence list in exercise - slovenliness iii and iv what do these sentence suggest to you as to the social and mental qualification of the person who employ they 4 read the second paragraph of appendix 2 what do it suggest to you as to burke 's social and mental qualification 5 suppose you be tell that a passage of twenty-eight line contain the follow expression : mewling and puke whine schoolboy satchel sigh like furnace round belly spectacles on nose shrink shank san -lrb- without -rrb- tooth san eye san taste san everything would you believe the passage be poetry -- that its total effect be one of poetic elevation read the seven age of man -lrb- appendix 4 -rrb- _ be _ it poetry how do shakespeare reconcile the general poetic tone with such expression as those quote 6 what be wrong with the connotation of the follow the servant tell we that the young lady be all in all my poor success be due to you he insist on carry a revolver and so the college authority fire he the carpenter too have he castle in spain he rest he old bone by the wayside and he gaunt dog stand sniff at they on the other hand he have a white elephant to dispose of when he come to the fork of the road he show he be not on the square body for funeral purpose must be sell at once city automobile agency 7 can you express the follow idea in other word without sacrifice of emotional suggestion try the music yearning like a god in pain alone alone all all alone alone on a wide wide sea but o for the touch of a vanish hand and the sound of a voice that be still old unhappy far-off thing and battle long ago it be night in the lonesome October how they tinkle tinkle tinkle in the icy air of night while the star that oversprinkle all the heaven seem to twinkle with a crystalline delight the moan of dove in immemorial elm and murmuring of innumerable bee ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot merrily merrily shall i live now under the blossom that hang on the bough ` tis as easy now for the heart to be true as for grass to be green or sky to be blue -- ` tis the natural way of live we be such stuff as dream be make of and we little life be round with a sleep 8 with the most connotative word at you command describe the following : you first sweetheart a solemn experience a ludicrous experience a terrifying experience a mysterious experience the circus parade you see in you boyhood a servant girl a dude a odd character you have know the old homestead you board house a scene suggest the intense heat of a midsummer day night on the river the rush for the subway car the traffic policeman you boss anything list in the first part of activity 9 of exercise - discourse iii word in combination : how master the more dangerous pitfall for those who use word in combination -- as all of we do -- have be point out the best way of avoid these pitfall have also be indicate but we work together have thus far be chiefly negative to be sure many task assign for you performance have be constructive as well as precautionary but _ the end _ hold ever before you have be the avoidance of feeble or ridiculous diction in the present chapter we must take up those aspect of the mastery of word in combination which be primarily positive <preliminaries: general purposes and methods> before come to specific aspect and assignment however we shall do well to consider certain large general purpose and method <i a ready an accurate or a wide vocabulary> first what kind of vocabulary do we wish to acquire a facile readily use one a accurate one or one as nearly as may be comprehensive the three kind do not necessarily coexist the possession of one may even hinder and retard the acquisition of another thus if we seek a ready vocabulary a accurate vocabulary may cause we to halt and hesitate for word which shall correspond with the shading of we thought and emotion and a wide vocabulary may embarrass we with the plenitude of we verbal riches but _ may _ be not _ must _ though the three kind of vocabulary may interfere with each other there be no reason except superficially why they should we purpose should be therefore to acquire not a single kind but all three we should be like the boy who when ask whether he would have a small slice of apple pie or a small slice of pumpkin pie reply resolutely thank you i will take a large piece of both that the assignment in this chapter may help you develop a vocabulary which shall be promptly responsive to you need you should perform some of they rapidly you thought and feeling regard a topic may be anything but clear but you must not pause to clarify they the word best suit to the matter may not be instantly available but you must not tarry for accession of language stumble flounder if you must yea rearrange you idea even as you present they but press resolutely ahead comforting yourself with the assurance that in the heat and stress of circumstance a man rarely do he work precisely as he wish when you have finish the discussion repeat it immediately -- and with no more loitering than before you will find that you idea have shift and enlarged and that more appropriate word have become available further repetition will assist you the more but the goal you should set yourself as you proceed from topic to topic be the attainment of the power to be at you best in the first discussion you may never reach this goal but at least you may approach it that the assignment in this chapter may assist you in make you vocabulary accurate you should perform some of they in another way when you have select a topic you should first of all think it through in do this arrange you idea as consistently and logically as you can and test they with you reason then set they forth in language which shall be lucid and exact tolerate no slipshod diction no vaguely render general meaning send every sentence every word like a skilful drop-kick -- straight above the crossbar when you have do you best with the topic lay it by for a space time be a great revealer of hidden defect and you must not regard you labor as end until you achievement be the maturest possible for you if the quantity of what you accomplish be meager suffer no distress on that account the desideratum now be not quantity but quality the assignment in this chapter will do less toward make you vocabulary wide than toward make it facile and precise to be sure they will now and then set you to hunting for word that be new better still they will give you a mastery over some of you outlying word -- word know to you eye or ear but not to you tongue but these advantage will be somewhat incidental means for the systematic extension of you verbal domain into region as yet unexplored by you be reserve for the later chapter of this book -lrb- 2 a vocabulary for speech or for write -rrb- in the second place be we to develop a vocabulary for oral discourse or a vocabulary for write it may be that we chief impediment or we chief ambition lie in one field rather than in the other nevertheless we should strive for a double mastery we ought to speak well _ and _ write well indeed the two power so react upon each other that we ought to cultivate both for the sake of either true some man though inexpert as writer have make themselves proficient as speaker or though shamble and ineffective as speaker have make themselves proficient as writer but this be not natural or normal moreover these man might have glean more abundantly from they choose field have they not shut it off from the acre adjacent fence waste space and curtail harvest the assignment in this chapter be of such a nature that you may perform they either orally or in write you should speak and write alternately sometimes on the same topic sometimes on topic take in rotation in you oral discussion you should perhaps absent yourself at first from human auditor a bedstead or a dresser will not make you self-conscious or in any way distract you attention and it will permit you to sit down afterward and think out the degree of you failure or success ultimately of course you must speak to human being -- in informal conversation at the outset in more ambitious way later as occasion permit in you write you may find it advantageous to make preliminary outline of what you wish to say but above all you must be willing to blot to revise to take infinite pain you should remember the old admonition that easy reading be devilish hard writing <the mastery of words in combination> these purpose and method be general we now come to the specific field in which we may with profit cultivate word in combination of these field there be four <i mastery through translation> if you read a foreign language whether laboriously or with ease you should make this power assist you to amass a good english vocabulary take composition or part of composition write in the foreign tongue and turn they into idiomatic english how much you should translate at a give time depend upon you leisure and you adeptness employ all the method -- the spontaneous the carefully perfect the oral the write -- heretofore explain in this chapter in you final work on a passage you should aim at a faultless rendition and should spend time and ransack the lexicon rather than come short of this ideal the habit of translation be a excellent habit to keep up for the study of a alien tongue not only improve you english but have compensation in itself exercise - translation 1 translate from any accessible book in the foreign language you can read 2 subscribe for a period of at least two or three month for a newspaper or magazine in that language if it be a modern one translate as before but give most of you time to rapid oral translation for a real or imaginary american hearer 3 when you have complete you final write translation of a passage from the foreign language make yourself master of all the english word you have not previously -lrb- 1 -rrb- know or -lrb- 2 -rrb- use but have encounter in you work of translation -lrb- 2 mastery through paraphrasing -rrb- it may be that you be not familiar with a foreign language at any rate you have some knowledge of english put this knowledge to use in paraphrase for thus you will enrich you vocabulary and make it surer and more flexible the process of paraphrasing be simple though the actual work be not easy you take passage write in english -- the more of they the better and the more diversified the better -- and both reproduce they substance and incarnate they mood in word you yourself shall choose you may have a passage before you and paraphrase it unit by unit more often however you should follow the plan adopt by franklin when he emulate addison by rewrite the _ spectator papers _ that be you should steep yourself in the thought and emotion of a piece of write and then lay the piece aside until its wording have fade from you memory when you should reëmbody the substance in language that seem to you natural and fitting much of the benefit will come from you compare you version as franklin do he with the original when you perceive that you have fall short you should consider the respects wherein you inferiority lie -- and should make another attempt and yet another and another when you perceive that in any way you have surpass the original you should feel a just pride in you achievement -- and should resolve that next time you cause for pride shall

consist in either discussion or explanation analysis ordinarily be almost ignore argument be indulge in and so be description -lrb- though less freely -rrb- but they be of the bluntest and broadest

what not -- that come into you mind or you may make a list of such topic write each on a separate piece of paper may jumble the slip in a hat and may thus have always at you elbow a collection of

though inartistic to be sure be in some contingency the only kind that will serve but you should cultivate procedure of a type more urbane let you very reasonableness be the most potent weapon you wield to this end you should form the habit of look for good point on both side of a question as a still further precaution against contentiousness you should uphold the two side successively in narrate you should as a rule stick to simple occurrence though you may occasionally vary you work by summarize the plot of a novel or give the gist and drift of big historical event you should confine yourself in large part to incident in which you have be personally involve or which you yourself have witness as mishap unexpected encounter bickering even rescue or riot you should omit non-essential and make the happen itself live for you hearer if you can so interest he in it that he will not notice you manner of tell it you success be but the greater finally in describe you should deal for the most part with being object and appearance familiar to you description be usually hard to make vivid this be because the object and scene be likely to be immobile and -lrb- at least when tell about

must have its place in we equation you do not speak or write in a vacuum you object you ultimate object at least in build up you vocabulary be to address man and woman and among man and woman the variety of training of station of outlook of sentiment of prejudice of caprice be infinite to gain a unbiased hearing you must take persistent cognizance of flesh and blood in adapt discourse to

incorrigible adventurer you will not broach a subject at all to which you hearer feel absolute indifference or hostility normally you should pick a subject capable of interesting they in present it you should pay heed to both you matter and you manner you should emphasize for you listener those aspect of the subject which they will most respond to or most need to hear whether or not the phase be

and argument the chief barrier you encounter be likely to be those of the mind you must make due allowance for the intellectual limitation of you auditor though many who have capacity enough may for some cause or other be unreceptive to idea in description you must reckon with the imaginative faculty with the possibility that you hearer can not visualize what you tell they -- and you must make

far we have study word as group together into phrase sentence paragraph whole composition we must now enter upon a new phase of we effort to extend we vocabulary we must study word as individual entity you may think the order of we study should be reverse no great harm would result if it be the learning of individual word and the combine of they into sentence be parallel rather than successive process in we babyhood we do not accumulate a large stock of term before we frame phrase and clause and we attainment of the power of continuous iteration do not check we inroad among individual word we do the two thing simultaneously each contribute to we success with the other there be plenty of analogy for this procedure a good baseball player for instance tirelessly study both the minutiae of he technique -lrb- as how to hold a bat how to stand at the plate -rrb- and the big combination and possibility of the game a good musician keep unremitting command over every possible touch of each key and at the same time seek sweeping mastery over vast and complex harmony so we if we would have the obedience of we vocabulary dare not lag into desultory attention to either word when disjoin or word as potentially combine into the larger unit of thought and feeling we might therefore consider either the individual first or the group first but the majority of speaker and writer pay more heed to rough general substance than to separate instrument and item hence we have think best to begin where most work be go on already -- with word in combination as you turn from the group to the individual you must understand that you labor will be onerous and detailed you must not assume that by nature all word be much alike any more than you assume that all man be much alike of course the similarity be many and striking and the fundamental fact be that a word be a word as a man be a man but you will be no adept in handle either the one or the other until you knowledge go much farther than this let we glance first at the human variation each man have he own business and conduct it in he own way -- a way never absolutely match with that of any other mortal be all this you may see but besides the man 's visible employment he may be connect in devious fashion with a score of enterprise the public know nothing about furthermore he lead a private life -lrb- again not precisely correspond to that of any other -rrb- have he hobby and aversion be stamp with a character a temperament of he own in short though in thousand of respects he be like he fellow he have after all no human counterpart he be a distinct individual self to know he to use he to count upon he service in whatsoever contingency it might bestead you you must deem he something more than a member of the great human family you must cultivate he personally cultivate he without weariness or stint and undergo inconvenience in so do even so with a word commonplace enough it may seem but it have its peculiar characteristic its activity undisclosed except to the curious its subtle inclination its repugnance its latent potentiality there be no precise duplicate for it in all the wide domain of language to know it intimately and thoroughly to be on entirely free term with it to depend upon it just so far as dependence be safe to have a sure understanding of what it can do and what it can not you must arduously cultivate it word like people yield themselves to the worthy they hunger for friendship -- and lack the last barrier of reserve which hedge all human communion thus linguistically speak you must search out the individual you must step aside from you way for the sake of a new acquaintance in conversation in sermon in address in letter in journalistic column in standard literature you must grasp the stranger by the hand and look he straight in the eye nor must you treat cavalierly the word you know already you must study they afresh you must learn they over and learn they better you must come to understand they not only for what they be but for what they will do <what words to learn first> what then be you first task somebody have lay down the injunction -- and as always when anything be enjoin other have give it currency -- that each day you should learn two new word so be it -- but which two the first two in the dictionary or hitherto leave untouched in you systematic conquest of the dictionary the first two you hear speak the first two that stare at you from casual everyday print the first two you can ferret from some technical jargon some special department of human interest or endeavor in any of these way you may obey the behest of these mentor but be not such way arbitrary haphazard and suppose after do you daily stint you should encounter a word it behoove you to know what then be you to sulk to withhold yourself from further exertion on the plea of a vocabulary-builder 's eight-hour day to adopt any of the method designate would be like resolve to invest in city lot and then buy property as you encounter they with no regard for expenditure for value in general or for special serviceability to you surely such procedure would be unbusinesslike if you pay out good money you meditate well whether that which you receive for it shall compensate you likewise if you devote time and effort to gain ownership of word you should exercise foresight in determine whether they will yield you commensurate return what then be the principle upon which at the outset you should proceed what better than to insure the possession of the word regard which you know this already that you need they and should make they yours <the analysis of your own vocabulary> the natural way and the best to begin be with a analysis of you own vocabulary you be of course aware that of the enormous number of word contain in the dictionary relatively few be at you beck and bidding but probably you have make no attempt to ascertain the nature and extent of you actual linguistic resource you should make a inventory of the stock on hand before send in you order for additional goods you will speedily discover that you vocabulary embrace several distinct class of word of these the first consist of those word which you have at you tongue 's end -- which you can summon without effort and use in you daily speech they be old verbal friend number with they to be sure there may be few with sens and connotation you be ignorant of -- friend of yours let we say with a reservation even these you may woo with a little care into uncurbed fraternal abandon with the exception of these few you know the word of the first class so well that without think about it at all you may rely upon they give you the moment you need they they untempered uttermost service you need be at no further pain about they they be yours already a second class of word be make up of those you speak on occasion either special or formal -- occasion when you be try perhaps not to show off but at least to put you best linguistic foot foremost some of they have a meaning you be not quite sure of some of they seem too ostentatious for workaday purpose some of they you might have be use but somehow have not word of this class be not you bosom friend they be you speaking acquaintance or perhaps a little better than that you must convert they into friend into prompt and staunch supporter in time of need that be to say you must put they into class one in bring about this change of foot you yourself must make the advance you must say go to i will bear they in mind as i would a person i wish to cultivate when occasion rise you must introduce they into you talk you will feel a bit shy about it for introduction be difficult to accomplish gracefully you will steal a furtive glance at you hearer perchance and another at the word itself as you would when first label a man my friend mr blank but the embarrassment be momentary and there be no other way assume a friendship if you have it not and presently the friendship will be real you must be steadfast in intention for the word that have hold aloof from you be many and to unloose all at once on a single victim would well-nigh brand you criminal but you will make sure headway and will be conscious besides that no other class of word in the language will so well repay the master for these be word you _ do _ use and need to use more and more freely -- word you own experience stamp as valuable if not indeed vital to you the third class of word be make up of those you do not speak at all but sometimes write they be acquaintance one degree farther remove than those of the second class you task be to bring they into class two and thence into class one -- that be to introduce they into you more formal speech and from this gradually into you everyday speech the fourth class of word be make up of those you recognize when you hear or read they but yourself never employ they be acquaintance of a very distant kind you nod to they let we say and they to you but there the intercourse end obviously they be not to be bring without considerable effort into a position of try and trust friendship and shall we be absolutely honest -- some of they may not justify such assiduous care as they complete subjugation would call for but even these you should make you feudal retainer you should constrain they to membership in class three and at you discretion in class two apart from the word in class four you will not to this point have make actual addition to you vocabulary but you will have make you vocabulary infinitely more serviceable you will be like a man with a host of friend where before when he necessity be sorest he find -lrb- along with some friend -rrb- many distant and timid acquaintance outside the bound of you present vocabulary altogether be the word you encounter but do not recognize except -lrb- it may be -rrb- dimly and uncertainly some counselor would have you look up all such word in a dictionary but the task would be irksome moreover those who prescribe it be loath to perform it themselves you own candid judgment in the matter be the safest guide if the word be incidental rather than vital to the meaning of the passage that contain it and if it give promise of but rarely cross you vision again you should deign it no more than a civil glance plenty of way will be leave you to expend time wisely in the service of you vocabulary exercise - analysis 1 make a list of the word in class two of you own vocabulary and similar list for class three and four -lrb- to make a list for class one would be but a waste of time -rrb- procure if you can for this purpose a loose-leaf notebook and in the several list reserve a full page for each letter of the alphabet as use initially do not scamp the list though they proper preparation consume many day many week try to make they really exhaustive they value will be in proportion to they accuracy and fulness 2 con the word in each list carefully and repeatedly you task be to transfer these word into a more intimate list -- those in class four into class three those in three into two those in two into one you be then to promote again the word in the lower class except that -lrb- if you judgment so dictate -rrb- you may leave the new class three wholly or partially intact to carry out this exercise properly you must keep these word in mind make they part and parcel of you daily life -lrb- for a special device for bring they under subjection see the next exercise -rrb- 3 to write a word down help you to remember it that be why the normal way to transfer a word from class four into class two be to put it temporarily into the intermediary class three you first _ see _ or _ hear _ the word next _ write _ it afterwards _ speak _ it the mere write down of you list have probably do much to bring the word write into the circuit of you memory where you can more readily lay hold of they also it have fortify you confidence in use they for to write a word out letter by letter make you surer that you have its right form with many of you word you will likely have no more trouble they will be at hand anxious for employment and you may use they accord to you need but some of you word will still stubbornly withhold themselves from memory weed these out from you list make a special list of they copy it frequently construct short sentence into which the troublesome word fit by dint of write the word so often you will soon make they more tractable 4 make a fifth list of word -- those you hear or see print do not understand the meaning of but yet feel you should know obtain and confirm a grasp of they by the successive process use with word in the precede list <the definition of words> another means of buttress you command of you present vocabulary be to define word you use or be familiar with do not bewilder yourself with word -lrb- like _ and the _ -rrb- which call for ingenuity in handle somewhat technical term or with word -lrb- like _ thing affair condition _ -rrb- which loosely cover a multitude of meaning -lrb- you may however concentrate you effort upon some one meaning of word in the latter group -rrb- select word with a fairly definite signification and express this as precisely as you can you may afterwards consult a dictionary for means of check up on what you have do but in consult it think only of idea not of form you be not train yourself in dictionary definition but in the sharpness and clarity of you understanding of meaning about the only rule to be lay down regard the definition of verb adjective and adverb be that you must not define a word in term of itself thus if you define _ grudgingly _ as in a grudging manner you do not dissipate you hearer 's uncertainty as to what the word mean if you define it as unwillingly or in a manner that show reluctance to yield possession you give you hearer a clear-cut idea in no wise dependent upon he ability to understand the word that puzzle he in the first place normally in define a noun you should assign the thing name to a general class and to its special limit within that class in other word you should designate its genus and species you must take care to differentiate the species from all other comprise within the genus you will in most instance first indicate the genus and then the species but at you convenience you may indicate the species first thus if you affirm a cigar be smoking-tobacco in the form of a roll of tobacco-leaf you name the genus first and later the characteristic of the species you have give a satisfactory definition if on the other hand you affirm a cigar be a roll of tobacco-leaves mean for smoking you first designate the species and then merely imply the genus again you have give a satisfactory definition for you have permit no doubt that the genus be smoking-tobacco and have prescribe such limit for the species as exclude tobacco intend for a pipe or a cigarette in define noun by the genus-and-species method restrict the genus to the narrowest possible bound you will thus save the need for exclusion later have you in you first definition of a cigar begin by say that it be tobacco rather than smoking-tobacco you would have violate this principle and you would have have to amplify the rest of you

yours through you own unaided effort for convenience we have group with they some word of a nature more baffling -- word of which you know perhaps but a single aspect rather than the totality or upon which you can obtain but a feeble and precarious grip these slightly known word belong more to the class now to be consider than to that just dispose of for we have now to deal with word over which you can establish no genuine rulership unless you have outside help you must own a dictionary have it by you consult it carefully and often do not select one for purchase upon the basis of either mere bigness or cheapness if you do you may make yourself the owner of a out-of-date reprint from stereotyped plate what to choose depend partly upon personal preference partly upon whether you need be for comprehensiveness or compression if you be a scholar _ murray 's _ many-volumed _ new english dictionary _ may be the publication for you but if you be a ordinary person you will probably content yourself with something less expensive and exhaustive you will find the _ century dictionary and cyclopedia _ in twelve volume or _ webster 's new international dictionary _ a admirable compilation the _ new standard dictionary _ will also prove useful all in all if you can afford it you should provide yourself with one or the other of these three large and authoritative but not too inclusive work of the smaller lexicon _ webster 's collegiate dictionary webster 's secondary school dictionary _ the _ practical standard dictionary _ and the _ desk standard dictionary _ answer most purpose well a dictionary be not for show you must learn to use it what ordinarily pass for use be in fact abuse wherein let we say that you turn to you lexicon for the meaning of a word of the various definition give you disregard all save the one which enable the word to make sense in its present context or which fit you preconception of what the word should stand for have engage in this solemn mummery you mentally record the fact that you have be squander you time and enter into a compact with yourself that no more will you so do at best you have tide over a transitory need or have verify a surmise you have not truly _ learn _ the word bring it into a vassal 's relationship with you so fixed it in memory that henceforth night or day you can take it up like a familiar tool this procedure be blunder farcical futile incorrect to suppose you have learn a word by so cursory a glance at its resource be like suppose you have learn a man through have have he render you some temporary and trivial service as lending you a match or tell you the time of day to acquaint yourself thoroughly with a word -- or a man -- involve effort application you must go about the work seriously intelligently one secret of consult a dictionary properly lie in find the primary the original meaning of the word you must go to the source if the word be of recent formation and be native rather than naturalized english you have only to look through the definition give such a word will not cause you much trouble but if the word be derive from primitive english or from a foreign language you must seek its origin not in one of the number subhead of the definition but in a etymological record you will perceive within bracket or parenthesis here you will find the anglo-saxon -lrb- old english -rrb- latin greek french german italian scandinavian or other word from which spring the word you be study and along with this authentic original you may find cognate word in other language these you may examine if you care to observe they resemblance to you word but the examination be not necessary it could teach you only the earlier or other _ form _ of you word whereas what you be after be the original _ meaning _ this too be set down within the bracket if you search be in earnest you can not possible miss it and have discover this original meaning you must get it in mind it be one of the really significant thing about the word you next step be to find the present import of the word look therefore through the modern definition of these there may be too many with too delicate shading in thought between they for you to keep all clearly in mind in fact you need not try consider they of course but out of they seek mainly the drift the central meaning after a little practice you will be able to disengage it from the other you now know the original sense of the word and its central signification today the two may be identical they may be widely different but through reflection or study of the entire definition you will establish some sort of connection between they when you have do this you have master the word from the two meaning you can surmise the other wherever and whenever encounter for the other be but outgrowth and application of they one warning will not be amiss you must not suppose that the term use in define a word be its absolute synonym or may be substitute for it indiscriminately you must develop a feeling for _ the limit _ of the word so that you may perceive where its likeness to the other term leave off and its unlikeness begin thus if one of the term employ in define _ command _ be _ control _ you must not assume that the two word be interchangeable you must not say for instance that the captain control he man to present arm such abstractly state be the way to look up a word in the dictionary let we now take a concrete illustration start with the word _ tension _ let we ascertain what we can about it in the _ century dictionary and cyclopedia _ we first quest be the original meaning for this we consult the bracket matter there we meet the french spanish portuguese and italian kinsman of the word and learn that they be traceable to a common ancestor the latin _ tensio -lrb- n -rrb- _ which come from the latin verb _ tendere _ the meaning of _ tensio -lrb- n -rrb- _ be give as stretch that of _ tendere _ as stretch extend thus we know of the original word that in form it closely resemble the modern word and that in mean it involve the idea of stretch what be the central meaning of the word today to acquaint ourselves with this we must run through the definition list here -lrb- in condensed form -rrb- they be -lrb- 1 -rrb- the act of stretch -lrb- 2 -rrb- in _ mechanic _ stress or the force by which something be pull -lrb- 3 -rrb- in _ physics _ a constrain condition of the particle of body -lrb- 4 -rrb- in _ statical electricity _ surface-density -lrb- 5 -rrb- mental strain stress or application -lrb- 6 -rrb- a strained state of any kind as political or social -lrb- 7 -rrb- a attachment to a sewing-machine for regulate the strain of the thread now of these definition -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- 4 -rrb- and -lrb- 7 -rrb- be too highly specialize to conduct we of themselves into the highway of the word 's meaning they bear out however the evidence of -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 5 -rrb- and -lrb- 6 -rrb- which have as they core the idea of stretch or of the strain which stretch produce we must now lay the original meaning alongside the central meaning today in order to draw we conclusion we perceive that the two meaning correspond yet by prying into they we make out one marked difference between they the original meaning be literal the modern largely figurative to be sure the figure have be so long use that it be now scarcely feel as a figure its force and definiteness have depart consequently we may speak of be on a tension without have in mind at all a comparison of we nervous system with a stretch garment or with a outreach arm or with a tightly string musical instrument or with a taut rope what then be the net result of we investigation simply this that _ tension _ mean stretch and that the stretch may be conceive either literally or figuratively with these two fact in mind we need not -lrb- unless we be expert in mechanic physics statical electricity or the sewing-machine -rrb- go to the trouble of commit the special sens of _ tension _ for should occasion bid we can -- from we position at the heart of the word -- easily grasp they rough purport and from other person than specialist no more would be require exercise - dictionary for each of the follow word find -lrb- a -rrb- the original meaning -lrb- b -rrb- the central meaning today -lrb-

be the task of the linguistic scholar we province be the practical and the present-day but word like man be largely what they be because of what they have be and to turn a gossip 's eye upon they past be to procure for ourselves often not only enlightenment but also entertainment this fact though bring out in some part already deserve separate and fuller discussion in the first place curiosity as to word ' past experience enable we to read with keener understand the literature of precede age of course we should not even so go farther back than about three century to read anything earlier than shakespeare would require we to delve too deeply into linguistic bygones and to read shakespeare himself require effort -- but reward it let we see how a insight into word will help we to interpret the seven age of man -lrb- appendix 4 -rrb- in line 2 of this passage appear the word _ merely _ in shakespeare 's time it frequently mean altogether or that and nothing else as here use it may be take to mean this or to have its modern meaning or to stand in mean midway between the two and to be suggestive of both there be no way of determine precisely in line 12 the word _ pard _ mean leopard in line 18 _ saw _ mean saying -lrb- compare the phrase a old saw -rrb- _ modern _ mean moderate commonplace _ instance _ mean what we mean by it today example illustration -lrb- line 18 as a whole

20 be interesting the patron saint of venice be st pantaleon -lrb- the term be from greek means all-lion and possibly refer to the lion of st mark 's cathedral -rrb- _ pantaloon _ come therefore to signify -lrb- 1 -rrb- a venetian -lrb- 2 -rrb- a garment worn by venetian and consist of breeches and stocking in one the second sense be preserved substantially in we term _ pantaloons _ the first sense lead to the use of the word -lrb- in the mouth of the venetian ' enemy -rrb- for buffoon and then -lrb- in early italian comedy -rrb- for a lean and foolish old man it be this stock figure of the stage that shakespeare evoke in line 22 _ hose _ mean the cover for a man 's body from he waist to he nether-stock -lrb- compare the present meaning : a cover for the foot and the _ lower _ part of the leg -rrb- in line 27 _ mere _ mean absolute in line 28 _ san _ means without of the word we have examine only _ san _ be obsolete though _ pard _ _ saw _ and _ pantaloon _ be perhaps not entirely familiar that be only one word in the passage so far as its outward form go be completely alien to we knowledge but how different the matter stand when we consider meaning the word be word of today but the meaning be the meaning of shakespeare we should be baffle and mislead as to the dramatist 's think if we have make no inquiry into the vehicle therefor in the second place to look beyond the present into the more remote signification of word will put we on we guard against the reappearance of submerge or half-forgotten meaning we have see that the word _ tension _ may be use without conscious connection with the idea of stretch but if we incautiously place the word in the wrong environment the idea will be resurrect to we undoing we associate _ ardor _ with strong and eager desire for ordinary purpose this conception of the word suffice but _ ardor _ be one of the child of fire its primary sense be burn -lrb- compare _ arson _ -rrb- therefore to pronounce the three vocable overflow with ardor be to mix figure of speech absurdly we should fall into a similar mistake if we say brilliant fluency and into a mistake of another kind -lrb- that of tautology or repetition of a idea -rrb- if we say heart-felt cordiality for _ cordiality _ mean feeling of the heart _ appreciate _ mean set a -lrb- due -rrb- value on we may perhaps say really appreciate but

and by the proportion of they admixture determine human temperament next a man 's outstanding temperamental quality -lrb- the thing itself rather than the cause of it -rrb- then oddity which people may laugh at then the spirit of laughter and good nature in general normally we do not connect the idea of moisture with the word we may even speak of a dry humor but we should not say now and then a dry humor crop out for then too many bury meaning lie in the same grave for the very dead to rest peacefully together even apart from read old literature and from have when you use word no ghost of

very prime of manhood they vicissitude be such as to make they seem human some rise in the world some sink some start along the road of grandeur or obliquity and then backslide or reform some be social climber and mingle in company where verbal dress coat be wear some be social degenerate and consort with the ragamuffin and guttersnipe of language some marry at they own social level some above they some beneath some go down in childless bachelorhood or leave a unkempt and illegitimate progeny and if you trace they own lineage you will find for some that it be but decent and middle-class for some that it be mongrelize and miscegenetic for some that it be proud ancient yea perhaps patriarchal it be contrary to nature for a word as for a man to live the life of a hermit through external compulsion or internal characteristic a word have contact with its fellow and its most intimate most spontaneous association be normally with its own kindred in we work hitherto we have have nothing to say of verbal consanguinity but we have not wholly ignore its existence for the very good reason that we could not for example in the latter portion of chapter iv we proceed on the hypothesis that at least some word have ancestor also in the analysis of the dictionary definition of _ tension _ we learn that the word have not only a latin forebear but french spanish portuguese and italian kinsman as well one thing omit from that analysis would have reveal something further -- namely that the word have its english kinfolk too for the bracket part of the dictionary definition mention two other english word _ tend _ and _ tense _ which from they origin involve the same idea as that of _ tension _ -- the idea of stretch now word may be akin in either of two way they may be relate in blood or they may be relate by marriage let we consider these two kind of connection more fully <words related in blood> as a illustration of blood kinship enjoy by a native english word take the adjective _ good _ we can easily call to mind other member of its family : goodly goodish goody-goody good-hearted good-natured good - humor good-tempered goods goodness goodliness gospel -lrb- good story -rrb- goodby goodwill goodman goodwife good-for-nothing good den -lrb- good evening -rrb- the good book the connection between these word be obvious next consider a group of word that have be naturalized : scribe prescribe ascribe proscribe transcribe circumscribe subscriber indescribable scribble script scripture postscript conscript rescript manuscript nondescript inscription superscription description it be clear that these word be each other 's kith and kin in blood and that the strain or stock common to all be _ scribe _ or -lrb- as sometimes modify -rrb- _ script _ what do this strain signify the idea of write the _ scribe _ be a write clan some of they to be sure have stray somewhat from the ancestral call for word be as wilful -- or as independent -- as man _ ascribe _ for example do not act like a member of the household of writer whatever it may look like we should have to scrutinize it carefully or consult the record for it in that verbal who be who the dictionary before we could understand how it come by its scribal affiliation honestly but once we begin to reflect or to probe we find we have not mistaken its identity _ ascribe _ be the offspring of _ ad _ -lrb- to -rrb- and _ scribo _ -lrb- write -rrb- both latin term it originally mean write to a person 's name or after it -lrb- that be impute to the person by means of write word -rrb- some quality or happen of which he be regard as the embodiment source or cause nowadays we may saddle the matter on he through oral rather than write speech that be _ ascribe _ have largely lose the write trait but all the same it be manifestly of the write blood the _ scribe _ be of undivided racial stock latin consider now the _ manu _ or _ man _ word which spring from the latin _ manus _ mean hand here be some of they : manual manoeuver mandate manacle manicure manciple emancipate manage manner manipulate manufacture manumission manuscript amanuensis these too be child of the same father they be brother and sister to each other but what shall we say of legerdemain -lrb- light or sleight of hand -rrb- maintain coup de main and the like they bear a resemblance to the _ man 's _ and _ manu 's _ yet one that casual observer would not notice be there kinship between the two set of word there be but not the full fraternal or sororal relation the _ main _ be child of _ manus _ by a french marriage he contract with this french blood in they vein they be only half-brother half-sister of the _ manu 's _ and the _ man 's _ you examination of the family tree of word will be practical rather than highly scholastic in nature you need not track every word in the dictionary to the den of its remote parentage nor need you bother you head with the name of the distant ancestor but in the case of the large number of word that have a numerous kindred you should learn to detect the inherit strain you will then know that the word be the brother or cousin of certain other word of you acquaintance and this knowledge will apprise you of quality in it with which you should reckon to this extent only must you make yourself a student of verbal genealogy

hitherto in we study of verbal relationship we have usually start with the family have stray -lrb- as by good luck -rrb- into a assembly of kinsman we have observe the common strain and the general characteristic and have then place the individual with reference to these but we do not normally meet word any more than we meet man in the domestic circle we meet they and greet they hastily as they hurry through the task of the day with no other associate about they than such as chance or momentary need may dictate if we be to see anything of they family life it must be through effort we ourselves put forth we must be inquisitive about they conjugal and blood relationship how then start with the individual word can you come into a knowledge of it not in its public capacity but in what be even more important its personal connection you must form the habit of ask two question about it : -lrb- 1 -rrb- be it married -lrb- 2 -rrb- of what family or family be it bear if you can get a understanding answer to these two question a answer that will tell you what its relation stand for as well as what they name be you inquiry will be anything but bootless let we illustrate you procedure concretely suppose you read or hear the word _ conchology _ it be a somewhat unusual word but see what you can do with it yourself before call on the dictionary to help you observe the word closely and you will obtain the answer to you first question _ conchology _ be no bachelor no verbal old maid it be a married pair you second and more difficult task await you you must ascertain the meaning of the family connection with mr conch you be on speak term you know he as one of the shell but the utmost you can recall about he wife be that she be one of a whole flock of _ ology _ what significance do this relationship possess you be uncertain but do not thumb the dictionary yet pass in mental review all the _ ology _ you can assemble wait also for the other that through the unconscious operation of memory will tardily straggle in be on the lookout for _ ology _ as you read as you listen in time you will muster a sizable company of they and you will draw a conclusion as to the meaning of the blood that flow through they vein _ ology _ imply speech or study _ conchology _ then must be the study of conch you investigation thus far have do more than teach you the meaning of the word you begin with they have bring you some of the by-product of the study of verbal kinship for you no longer pass the _ ology _ by with face avert or bow timidly venture you have become so well acquaint with they that even a new one wherever encounter would flash upon you the face of a friend but now you desire be whet you wish to find out how much you _ can _ learn you at last consult the dictionary here a huge obstacle confront you the _ ology _ like the _ port _ -lrb- above -rrb- be a haughty clan they be the woo rather than the woo member of most marital household that contain they now the marriage licens record in the dictionary be enter under the name of the suitor not of the person seek hence you labor under a severe handicap as you take the census of the _ ology _ let we imagine the handicap the most severe possible let we suppose that no _ ology _ have ever be the suitor even so you would not be entirely baffle for you could look up in the dictionary the _ ology _ you you self have be able to recall to what profit first you could verify or correct you surmise as to what the _ ological _ blood betoken secondly you could perhaps obtain cross-reference to yet other _ ology _ than those you remember but you be not reduce to these extremity the _ ology _ arrogant as they be sometimes be the applicant for matrimony and the marriage registry of the dictionary so indicate to be sure they do not when thus appear at the beginning of word take the form _ ology _ they take the form _ log _ but you must be resourceful enough to keep after you quarry in spite of the omission of a vowel or two also from some lexicon you may obtain still further help you may find _ ology logy logo _ or _ log _ list as a combine form its meaning give and example of its use in compound cite by you zeal and persistence you have now bring together a goodly array of the _ ology _ -- all or most let we say of the following : conchology biology morphology phrenology physiology osteology histology zoology entomology bacteriology ornithology pathology psychology cosmology eschatology demonology mythology theology astrology archeology geology meteorology mineralogy chronology genealogy ethnology anthropology criminology technology doxology anthology trilogy philology etymology terminology neologism phraseology tautology analogy eulogy

these word the kinship which exist in all for the _ loquy _ group -- see -lrb- 1 -rrb- soliloquy below -rrb- of course you will discard some item from this list as be too learn for you purpose but you will observe of the other that once you know the meaning of _ ology _ you be likely to know the whole word thus from you study of _ conchology _ you have master not a individual term but a tribe in _ conchology _ only one element _ ology _ be really dubious at the outset let we take a word of which both element give you pause suppose you thought be arrest by the word _ eugenics _ you perhaps know the word as a whole but not its component for by look at it and think about it you decide that its state be marry that it comprise the household of mr eu and he wife formerly miss gen but you can not say offhand just what kind of person either mr eu or the erstwhile miss gen be likely to prove have you meet any of the _ eu 's _ elsewhere you think vaguely that you have but can not lay claim to any real acquaintance to the dictionary you accordingly betake yourself there you find that mr eu be of a family quite respectable but not prone to marriage _ euphony eupepsium euphemism euthanasia _ be of he retire kindred the meaning of the _ eu _ blood so the dictionary inform you be well the _ gen _ blood as you see exemplify in gentle general genital engender carry with it the idea of begetting of produce of birth or -lrb- by extension -rrb- of kinship _ eugenics _ then be a alliance of well and begotten -lrb- or bear -rrb- you immediate purpose be fulfil but you resolve let we say to make the acquaintance of more of the _ gen _ whose number you have perceive to be legion you be duly introduce to the following : genus generic genre gender genitive genius general gentile gentle gentry gentleman genteel generous genuine genial congeniality congener genital congenital engender generation progeny progenitor genesis genetics eugenics pathogenesis biogenesis ethnogeny palingenesis unregenerate degenerate monogeny indigenous exogenous homogeneous heterogeneous genealogy ingenuous ingenious ingenue engine engineer hygiene hydrogen oxygen endogen primogeniture philoprogeniture miscegenation some of these be professional rather than social you decide not to leave you card at they door other have assume a significance somewhat un_gen _ - like though the relationship may be trace if you be not averse to trouble thus _ engine _ in its superficial aspect seem alien to the idea of bear but it be the child of _ ingenious _ -lrb- innate inborn -rrb- _ ingenious _ be the inborn power to accomplish and _ engine _ be the result of the application of that power whether you care to bother with such subtlety or not enough _ gen _ be leave to make the family one well worth you cultivation thus by study two word _ conchology _ and _ eugenics _ you have for the first time place yourself on a intimate footing with three verbal family -- the _ ology _ the _ eu 's _ and the _ gen _ observe that though you study the _ ology _ apart from the _ eu 's _ and the _ gen _ you knowledge -- once you have acquire it -- can not be keep pigeonhole for the _ ology _ have intermarry with both the other family hence you on meeting _ eulogy _ can exclaim : how do you do mr eu i be honor in make you acquaintance mr eu -- i be about to call you by you maiden name for i be a friend of you sister the miss ology who marry mr conch and you too mr eu -- i can not regard you as a stranger i have look in so often on the family of you brother -- the euphony family i mean what a beautiful literary household it be yet it have be neglect by the world-yea even by the people who write well the loss be theirs who do the neglect and _ genealogy _ you can greet with a equal parade of family lore : do not trouble to tell I who you be i be hob and nob with you folk on both side of the family and my word for it the relationship be write all over you mr gen i envy you the pride you must feel in the prominence give nowadays to the _ eugenics _ household and it must delight you miss ology-that-wa that connoisseur be so keenly interested in _ conchology _ how be grandfather gen and

we second be the study of individual word in two of they aspect -- first as they be see in isolation next as they be see in verbal family now we third task confront we it be the study of word as they be associate not in actual blood kinship but in mean such a association in meaning may involve only two word -lrb- pair -rrb- or larger group in this chapter we shall confine ourselves to the study of pair of the relationship between pair there be three type in the first the word be hostile to each other in the second they may easily be confuse with each other in the third they be parallel with each other we shall examine the three type successively but we must make a explanation first although we shall in this and the follow chapter have frequent occasion to give the meaning of individual word we shall give they without regard to dictionary method we shall not attempt formal water-tight or exhaustive definition we purpose be to convey in the simplest and most human manner possible brief general explanation of what the word stand for <opposites> pair of the first type be make up of word by nature opposite to each other or else thought of as opposite because they be so often contrast here be a familiar everyday list : east west straight crooked myself other large small pretty ugly major minor laugh cry walk ride light darkness top bottom hard soft friend enemy sweet sour clean dirty temporal spiritual meat drink merry sad means extreme land water private public jew gentile man woman noisy quiet independent dependent old new general particular sublime ridiculous age youth wholesale retail give receive sick well savage civilized pride humility brain brawn wealth poverty constructive destructive soul body positive negative none of these word need explain if you think of one of they you will think of its opposite at least its opposite will be lurk in the back of you mind as proof of this fact you have only to glance at the follow list from which the second member of each pair be omit : hot -- black -- boy -- in -- off -- over -- love -- wrong -- strong -- wet -- first -- day -- long -- fast -- good -- hope -- least -- asleep -- buy -- leave -- alive -- winter -- war -- succeed -- creditor -- fat -- internal -- wise -- drunk -- many word of a more difficult kind be thus pit against each other and we learn they not singly but in pair at least we should as good verbal hunter we should be alert to the chance of kill two bird with one stone _ allopath _ and _ homeopath _ for example be difficult opposite we know of the existence of the two class of medical practitioner we know that they use different method but beyond this we knowledge be likely to be hazy let we set out then to _ learn _ the two word the best way be to learn they together _ allopathy _ mean other suffer _ homeopathy _ like suffer a allopath use remedy which create within the patient a condition that squarely conflict with the further progress of the disease a homeopath prescribe medicine -lrb- in small dose -rrb- which produce within the patient the same condition that the disease would produce he beat the disease to it so to speak -- take the job himself and leave the disease nothing to do the allopath travel around a race-track in the opposite direction from the disease and thwart it through a head-on collision the homeopath travel around the race-track in the same direction as the disease and thwart it by pull at the rein if we consider the two word together and get these idea in mind we shall have no further trouble with allopath and homeopath -- except perhaps when they have render they service and present they bill _ objective _ and _ subjective _ be also a troublesome pair a thing be objective if it be a actual object or be if it exist in itself rather than in we surmise a thing be subjective if it be the creature of a state of mind if it have its existence in the thought or imagination of some person or other thus if i meet a bear in the wild that bear be objective whatever may be the state of my thought _ he be there _ -- and it would be to my advantage to reckon with this fact but if a child who be send off to bed alone say there be a bear in the room the bear be subjective it be not a living monster that will devour anybody but a creature call into the mind of the child through dread exercise - opposite study the follow word in

acatalectic <words often confused> pair of the second type be make up of word which be often confuse by careless writer and speaker and which should be accurately discriminate sometimes the word be actually akin to each other _ continuous - continual _ and _ enormity-enormousness _ be example sometimes they merely look or sound much alike _ mean-demean _ and _ affect - effect _ be example sometimes the thing they designate be more or less related so that the idea behind the word rather than the word themselves be responsible for the confusion _ contagious-infectious _ and _ knowledge-wisdom _ be example let we distinguish between the two member of each of the pair name a thing be _ continuous _ if it suffer no interruption whatever _ continual _ if it be break at regular interval but as regularly renew thus a continuous stretch of forest the continual drip of water from the eaves _ enormity _ pertain to the moral and sometimes the social _ enormousness _ to the physical thus the enormity of the crime the enormity of this social offense the enormousness of prehistoric animal _ demean _ be often use reproachfully because of its suppose relation to _ mean _ but it have nothing to do with _ mean _ the word with which to connect it be _ demeanor _ -lrb- conduct -rrb- thus we observe how he demean himself imply no adverse criticism of either the man or he deportment both may be debase to be sure but they may be exemplary to _ affect _ mean to feign or to have a influence upon to _ effect _ to bring to pass thus he affect a fondness for classical music the little orphan 's story affect those who hear it we effect a compromise _ affect _ be never properly use as a noun _ effect _ as a noun mean result consequence or practical operation thus the shot take instant effect he put this idea into effect a disease be _ contagious _ when the only way to catch it be through direct contact with a person already have it or through contact with article such a person have use a disease be _ infectious _ when it be presumably cause not by contact with a person but through widespread general condition as of climate or sanitation we _ knowledge _ be we

as a rule they still be closely related in thought sometimes however the divergence between they be wide why do word have the same meaning find lodgment in the language in the first place the law of linguistic economy forbid any such happen and only through sheer good fortune do english come to possess duplication the original anglo-saxon do not contain they but the roman catholic clergy bring to england the language of religion and of scholarship latin later the norman whose speech as a branch of french be a offshoot of latin come to the island as conqueror for a time therefore three language

the best principle for the extension of one 's mastery of synonym be the principle already use over and over in this book -- that of proceed from the know to the unknown it be the fundamental principle indeed of any kind of successful learning we should build on what we have fit each new piece of material into the structure already erect but normally it be we ill fortune to learn through chance rather than through system we perceive elucidation here draw a inference there these isolate fragment of knowledge may mislead rather than inform we the principle of proceed from the know to the unknown may be apply to synonym in various way two of these -- the two of most importance -- we must consider here first you should reckon with you personal demonstrate need just as you have already analyze you work vocabulary for its general limit and shortcoming so should you analyze it with particular reference to you poverty in synonym watch you actual speech make a list of the word -- noun verb and adjective particularly -- that you employ again and again make each of these word the starting-point for a linguistic explore expedition first write the word down then under it write all the synonym that come forthwith to you mind these constitute you present available stock in speak or write you could if you keep yourself mentally alert summon they on the moment but the list as you know be not exhaustive draw a line under it and subjoin such synonym as come to you after reflection these constitute a second stock not instantaneously available yet to be tag as among you resource next add a list of the synonym you find through research through a ransacking of dictionary and book of synonym this third stock but dimly familiar if familiar at all be in no practical sense yours and indeed some of the word be too abstruse learn or technical for you to burden you memory with they but many -- most -- be worth acquire by write down the word of these three class you have do something to stamp they upon you memory as associate you must now make it you business to bring they into use never call upon they for volunteer but like a wise commander summon the individual that can rightly perform a particular service thus will you speech perhaps vague and indolent now become exact discriminate competent vital in the second place you should obtain specific and detailed command of general idea not of out-of-the-way idea but of the great basic idea that be the common possession of all mankind for through these basic idea be the most natural and profitable approach to the study of synonym each of they be represent by a generic word so elementary be idea and word alike that a person can not have the one in mind without have the other ready and a-quiver on he tongue every person be master of both but it be unsafe to predicate the person 's acquaintance with the shades and phase of the idea or with the corresponding discrimination in language he may not know they at all he may know they partially he may know they through and through let we suppose he ignorant of they but determine to learn he progress both in the thought and in the language will be from the general to the specific he acquaintance with the idea in the large he will gradually extend to a acquaintance with it in detail and he command of the broad term for it he will little by little supplement with definite term for its phase a illustration will make this clear we be aware that the world be make up of various class and condition of man how do we learn this let we go back to the time when we mind be a blank when we be babe and suckling when we have not perceive that man exist much less that mankind be infinitely complex a baby come slowly to understand that all object in the universe be divisible into two class human and non-human and that a member of the former may be separate from the other and regard as a individual it have reach the initial stage of its knowledge on the subject it have the basic idea that of the individual human be as soon as it can speak it acquire a designate term -- not of course the sophisticated _ human be _ but the simpler _ man _ it use this word in the generic sense to indicate _ any _ member of the human race for as yet it know nothing and care nothing about difference in species with increase enlightenment however it discern five species and distinguish among they by swell this branch of its vocabulary to five word : man -lrb- in the sense of adult male -rrb- woman boy girl baby -lrb- to be sure it may chance to have acquire a specific term as _ boy _ or _ baby _ before the generic term _ man _ but if so it have attach this term to some particular individual as the grocer 's boy or itself rather than to the individual of a species its understanding of the species as a species come after its understanding of the genus -rrb- as time pass it divide mankind into yet further species by sundry other method : accord to occupation for example as doctor chauffeur gardener to race or color as white man negro malay chinese to disposition as hero gift-giver teaser talker and so on it perceive moreover that species be make up of sub-species thus instead of lump all boy together it begin to distinguish they as big boy little boy middle-sized boy boy in long trousers boy in short trousers barefoot boy schoolboy poor boy rich boy sick boy well boy friend enemy bully and what not it even divide the sub-species thus it classify schoolboy as bright boy dullard worker shirker teacher ' favorite scapegoat athlete note-throwers truant-player and the like and of these class it may make yet further sub-division or at least it may separate they into the individual that compose they in fine with its grow power and experience it abandon its old conception that all person be practically alike and follow human nature through the countless ramification of man 's status temperament activity or fate and it augment its vocabulary to keep pace roughly at least with its expand idea in thought and terminology alike its growth be from genus to species so it be with all we idea and with all we word to cap they we radiate from a ascertain center into new area of knowledge we proceed from the broad fundamental generic to the precise discriminatory specific upon this natural law be base the exercise in this chapter and the two to follow the starting-point be always a word representative of a elementary idea -- a word and a idea which everybody know the advance be into the unknown or the unused at any rate into the particular now fundamental idea be not very numerous and these exercise include the commoner one such a method of study synonym must therefore yield large and tangible result one matter however should be explain most book of synonym start with a word and list all the term in any way related to it the idea of the compiler be that the more they give the student the more they help he but oftentimes by give more than be strictly pertinent they actually hinder and confuse he they may do this in various way of which two must be mention first they follow a idea too far afield thus in list the synonym of _ love _ they include such term as _ kindness _ and _ lenity _ word only through stretch usage connect with _ love _ secondly they trace not one meaning of a word but two or more unrelated meaning when the word chance to possess they thus in list the synonym of _ cry _ they include both the idea of weep and the idea of call or scream what be the result of these method the student find a clutter where he expect rationalize order he find he must exclude many word which lie in the border and fringe of the meaning moreover he find mere chance association mingle with marked kinship in both case he find dull distinction this book offer synonym that be apropo and definite rather than comprehensive start with a basic idea it find the generic term it then disregard dim and distant relationship confines itself rigorously to one of perhaps two or three legitimate sens and refuse to consider the peculiar twist and devious way of subsidiary word when they wander from the idea it be trace it thus deliberately blind itself to much that be interesting but this partial blindness enable it to concentrate attention upon the matter actually under study to give sharper distinction and surer guidance exercise a after three introductory group -lrb- deal with thoroughly concrete idea and word -rrb- the synonym in this exercise be arrange alphabetically accord to the first word in each group this first word be generic it be immediately follow by a list of its synonym these be then informally discriminate or else -lrb- in a few instance -rrb- question be ask about

collect or compose twenty or more sentence in which the word be use as largely as possible take they from actual experience in do this you must listen to the use of the word in everyday talk after you have make you list of sentence as varied and extensive as you can try to substitute synonym that will express the idea more accurately note whether a knowledge of the attendant circumstance be necessary to a understanding of the original word to a understanding of the word substitute for it bad fine matter affair nice common case boost exercise k analyze each of the word give below into its various use or application then for it in each of these application assemble as many synonym as you can unaided finally have recourse to a dictionary or book of synonym for the further extension of you list -lrb- by way of illustration let we take the word _ quiet _ through meditation and analysis we discover that it may be apply -lrb- a -rrb- to water or any liquid not in motion -lrb- b -rrb- to a place that be without sound -lrb- c -rrb- to a place shut off from activity or bustle -lrb- d -rrb- to a person who be not demonstrative or forward in manner we then think of all the word we can that can be substitute for it in each of these use no matter how incompletely or unsatisfactorily we feel we be perform this task we must not give it over until we have find every word we can summon then we turn to a dictionary or book of synonym thus for _ quiet _ we shall assemble such synonym as -lrb- a -rrb- calm still motionless placid tranquil serene smooth unruffled undisturbed pacific

soft yield keen <literal vs figurative applications> one of the most interesting thing to watch in the study of word be they development from a literal to a figurative application the first man who break away from the confines of the literal meaning of a word and apply the word to something that only in a figurative sense have quality analogous to the original meaning be create poetry he be make a imaginative flight comparable in daring to the wright brother ' first aeronautic flight but as the word be use over and over in this figurative way the imaginative flight become more and more commonplace at last it cease to be imaginative at all through frequent repetition it have settle into the matter of course a glance back at the _ concise _ group above will show you that with time the comparison which be once the basis and the life of the figurative use of word be dull obscure even lose as a further enforcement of this fact let we analyze the word _ rough _ in its literal application it may designate any surface that have ridge projection or inequality and be therefore uneven jagged rugged scraggy or scabrous now frequently a man 's face or head be rough because unshaved or uncombed also the fur of a animal be rough hence the term could be use for unkempt disheveled shaggy hairy coarse bristly the child run its hand over its father 's rough cheek and the bear have a rough coat be sentence that even the most unimaginative mind can understand we speak of rough timber because its surface have not be plane or make smooth we speak of a rough diamond because it be unpolished uncut note that all these use be literal that in each instance some unevenness of surface be refer to but man urge on by the desire to say what he mean with more novelty strikingness or force apply the word to idea that have no surface to be uneven he imagine what these idea would be like if they have surface of course in put these conception into language he be create figure of speech some of they startlingly apt some of they merely far-fetched he say a man have a _ rough _ voice as though the voice be like a cactus in its prickly irregularity by _ rough _ he mean what he fellow mean when they speak of the voice as harsh grate jarring discordant inharmonious strident raucous or unmusical go farther that early poet say the weather be _ rough _ he think of clement weather as be smooth and even but of inclement severe stormy tempestuous or violent weather as be full of projection to rend and harass one thus a everyday use of the term today be once wrench and immoderate speech possibly the first man who hear of rough weather be puzzle for a moment then amuse or delighted as he catch the figure it do not require great originality to think of a crowd as _ rough _ in its movement but we poet apply the idea to a individual to he a rude uncivil impolite ungracious uncourteous unpolished uncouth boorish blunt bluff gruff brusk or burly person be as the unplaned lumber or the unpolished gem and we imitative modern still call such a man _ rough _ but we do not think of the man as cover with projection that need to be take off unless forsooth we receive _ rough _ treatment at he hand and note how far we have journey from the original idea of the word when we say i give the report a _ rough _ glance meaning cursory hasty superficial or incomplete consideration many very simple word include several of those already treat in this chapter be two-sided in that they be both literal and figurative exercise l trace each of the follow word from its literal to its figurative application give synonym for each of its use open bright stiff hard low cool sharp flat keen strong dull raw small odd warm deep eccentric <imperfectly understood facts and ideas> thus far in this chapter we have be consider many-sided word we must now turn to a certain class of fact and idea that deserve better understanding and closer analysis than we usually accord they these fact and idea be suppose to be matter of common knowledge and in they broad scope and purport they be because acquaintance with they be take for grant it behoove we to know they yet they be in reality complicated and when we attempt to deal with they in detail we assurance forsake we all of we have we blind side intellectually -- quake to have certain area of discussion enter because we foresee that we must sit idly by without power to make sensible comment unto as many as possible of these blind side of ourselves we should pronounce the bless word let there be light we have therefore to consider certain matter and topic which be suppose to belong to the common currency of social information but with which we familiarity be less thoroughgoing than it should be what be these fact and topic take for illustration the subject of aeronautics suppose we have but the vaguest conception of the part play or likely to be play by aircraft in war commerce and pleasure suppose we be not aware that some craft be make to float and other to be drive by propeller suppose such term as zeppelin blimp monoplane biplane hydroplane dirigible have no definite import for we do not we knowledge fall short of that expect of well-informed man in this present age or take military term everybody use they -- clergyman pacifist clubman social reformer novelist tramp brick-layer big-sticker we can not escape they if we would we ourselves use they but do we use they with precise and masterly understanding you call one civilian colonel and another major which have you pay the higher compliment you be uncertain whether a give officer be a colonel or a major and you wish to address he in such fashion as will least offend he sensitiveness as to rank and nomenclature which title -- colonel or major -- be the less perilous you be tell that a major have command of a battalion do that tell you anything about he you be tell that he have command of a squadron of a brigade of a platoon do these change in circumstance have any import for you if not you have too falter a grasp upon military fact and terminology the best remedy for such shortcoming be to be insatiably curious on all subject this of course be the ideal nobody ever fully attain it nevertheless exercise m will set you to grope into certain broad matter relevant to ordinary need thereafter if you purpose be strong enough you will carry the same method there acquire into other field of knowledge you may object that all this be as much mental as linguistic -- that what be propose will result in as large accession of general information as of vocabulary let this be admit deficiency of language be often perhaps almost invariably link with deficiency of knowledge to repair the one we must at the same time repair the other this may seem a hard say to those who seek or would impart mere glibness of phrase without regard for the substance -- who worship word word word without thought of the matter there be such a thing as froth of utterance but who have respect therefor or be deceive thereby speech that be not inform be like a house without a foundation you should not desire to possess it abroad in this world of ours already be too many people who darken counsel by word without knowledge exercise m a second lieutenant be the commission officer of lowest

to dwell with to toil with it exact much of you-make you for each page you turn pay with the sweat of you brain but assume that you have do you part what have you gain without answer this question at all fully we may at this juncture engage in a brief retrospect first of all you have rid yourself of the notion that word be dead thing unreality worthy of no more than wooden and mechanical employment as much as anything else in the world word be alive and responsive be fraught with unmeasured possibility of good or ill you have take due cognizance of the fact that word must be consider in the aggregate as well as individually and have reckon with the pitfall and danger as well as with the advantage of they use in combination but the basis of everything be a keener knowledge of word severally you have therefore come to study word with the zest and insight you exhibit -lrb- or should exhibit -rrb- in study man incidentally you have acquire the habit of look up dictionary definition not merely to satisfy a present need but also to add permanently to you linguistic resource you have carry the study of individual farther you have come to know word inside and out such knowledge not only assist you in you dealings with you contemporary it illuminate for you great literature of the past that otherwise would remain obscure how much keener for example be you understanding of shakespeare 's passage on the seven age of man because of you thorough acquaintance with the single word _ pantaloon _ how quickly do the awe for big word slip from you when you perceive that _ precocious be _ in origin the equivalent of _ half-baked _ what intimacy of insight into word you feel when you find that a _ companion be _ a _ sharer of one 's bread _ what a link of language with life you discover when you learn the original signification of _ presently _ of _ idiot _ of _ rival _ of _ sandwich _ of _ pocket handkerchief _ and what revelation as into a mystic fraternalism with word do you obtain when you confront such a phrase as the bank _ teller _ or cut to the _ quick _ not only have word become more like live being to you you have learn to think of they in relation analogous to the human you can detect the blood kinship for example between _ prescribe _ and _ manuscript _ and know that the strain of _ fact _ or fie or fy in a word be pretty sure to betoken make or do you know that there be elaborate intermarriage among word you recognize _ phonograph _ for example as a married couple you even have confidential word as to the dowry bring by each of the contracting party to the new verbal household you have discover further that the language actually swarm with pair -- word join with each other not in blood or by marriage but through mean you have so familiarize yourself with hundred of these pair that to think of one word be to call the other to mind finally and in many respects most important of all you have acquire a vast stock of synonym you have have it bring to you attention that the number of basic idea in the world be surprisingly small that for each of these idea there be in we language one generic word that most people use this one word constantly instead of seek the subsidiary term that express a particular phase of the idea and that you as a builder of you vocabulary must while hold fast to the basic idea with one hand reach out with the other for the fit sure material of specific word nor have you rest in the mere perception of theory you have have abundant practice have yourself cover the ground foot by foot you can therefore proceed with reasonable freedom from the commoner idea of the human mind to that expression of definite aspect of they which be anything but common you have not of course achieve perfection there still be much for you to do there always will be nevertheless in the way just review and in various other way not mention in this chapter you have make yourself verbally rich you be one of the millionaire of language when you speak it be not with stammer incompetence but with confident readiness when you write it be with energy and assurance in the very flow of the ink where you have long be a slave you have become a freeman and can look you fellow in the eye you have the best badge of culture a human being can possess you have power at you tongue 's end you have the proud

population cityward -lrb- a editorial -rrb- to a individual who from whatever motive of personal advantage or mere curiosity have make himself a observer of current tendency the drift of we rural population cityward give food for serious reflection this drift be one of the most pronounced of the social and economic phenomenon of the day its consequence upon the life welfare and future of the great nation to which we be proud to acknowledge we whole-hearted allegiance be matter of such paramount importance to all concern that we should turn aside more often than we do from the distracting exaction of we ordinary activity to give they prolonged and earnest consideration a generation or so ago human being be content to spend the full term of they earthly existence amid rural surroundings or if in they decline day they long for more of the comfort and association which be among the craving of mortality it be a easy proposition to move to the nearest village or if they be too high and mighty for this simple measure to satisfy they they could indulge in the more grandiose performance of reside in the county seat but nowadays we people want more rich or poor tall or dumpy totter grandmother or baby in swaddling-clothes they long for ampler pasture they brawny arm or hoary head must bedeck nothing less than the metropolis itself and perchance put shoulder to the wheel in the incessant grind of the urban treadmill can you beat it unquestioned profit do not attend the migration it stand to reason that some of the very advantage seek have be sacrifice on the altar of the drift cityward let we say you have you individual domicile or the cramped and sunless apartment you dub you habitation within corporate limit do that mean that the privilege of the city be at you disposal so that you have merely to reach forth you hand and pluck they well hardly you certainly do not reside in the downtown section or if you do you wish to heaven you do not and you can reach this section only with delay and inconvenience whether in the hour of business or in the subsequent period devote to the glitter of nocturnal revelry and amusement but whatever the disadvantage of the city the people who endure they be convince that to go back to the vine and figtree of they native heath would be jump out of the frying pan into the fire why well for one thing there be no such thing as leisure in the area that lie beyond those vast aggregation of humanity which constitute we city not only be there innumerable and seemingly interminable chore that must follow the regular occupation of the day but a thousand emergency due to chance weather or the natural cussedness of thing must be dispose of as they arise regardless of what plan the rustic swain cherish for the use of he spare time urban laborer have contrived by one mean or another to bring about a limitation of the number of hour per diem they be force to toil to the farmer such a alleviation of they hardship be not within the realm of practicability they kick about it of course they say it be a bloom nuisance but neither they heartburning nor they struggle can efface it as a fact again the means of entertainment be more limited and that by a big lot with the farmer than with those who dwell in the city it be all very well to talk about the blessing of the rural telephone rural free delivery and the automobile these thing do make communication easier than it use to be but after all they be only a drop in the bucket and do little to stop the drift cityward we may remark just here that if you live a thousand mile from nowhere and be willing to drive you tin lizzie into town for the advantage you be not likely to get much even along the line of the movie and you 'll get less still if what you be after be a a-1 school for you progeny finally the widespread impression that the farmer be a bloated and unscrupulous profiteer have do much to disgust he with he station and employment in life we do not say he be the one and only when it come to the virtue maybe he have not sprout any wing yet what if he have not the city with they brothel they big business and they municipal government -- you would not have the face to say that there be anything wrong with they now would you oh no of course not the farmer pay high for he machinery and go clear to the bottom of he pocketbook when he have to buy shoe or a sack of flour but let he have a steer 's hide or a wagon load of wheat to sell and it be somebody else 's ox that be gore consumer pay big price for farm product goodness know but they do not pay they to the farmer not on you tintype the middleman get he you need not question that we beg pardon a thousand time we mean the middle_men _ there be no end to those human parasite and so farmer after farmer break up the old homestead and contribute he mite to the drift cityward what will be the result that come out of it all the effect upon the farmer deserve a editorial all to itself here we must limit ourselves to the effect on the future of we beloved american nation and even these we can now do no more than mention we lack space to elaborate they one effect if the tendency continue will be such a reduction in home-produced foodstuff that we shall have to import from other country lie abroad a good portion of the means of we physical sustenance and shall face such a increase in the cost of the same that thousand and thousand of we people will find it increasingly harder as the year pass by to maintain they relative economic position another effect will be that we civilization which to this point have sprawl over broad acre will become a urban civilization pen in amid condition restraint privation and perhaps also opportunity unprecedented in we past history and unknown to the experience we have have hitherto a final effect will be that we most conservative class the rural populace will no longer present resistance that be formidable to the innovation which those who hold extreme view be forever exhort we to embrace and the result may well be that the disintegration of this staying and stabilize element in we citizenship -- one that retard and mollify if it do not inhibit change -- will produce consequence in its train which may be as dire as they be difficult to foretell _ appendix _ 2 cause for the american spirit of liberty -lrb- from the _ speech on conciliation with the colony _ -rrb- by edmund burke in this character of the american a love of freedom be the predominate feature which mark and distinguish the whole and as a ardent be always a jealous affection you colony become suspicious restive and untractable whenever they see the least attempt to wrest from they by force or shuffle from they by chicane what they think the only advantage worth live for this fierce spirit of liberty be stronger in the english colony probably than in any other people of the earth and this from a great variety of powerful cause which to understand the true temper of they mind and the direction which this spirit take it will not be amiss to lay open somewhat more largely first the people of the colony be descendant of englishman england sir be a nation which still i hope respects and formerly adore she freedom the colonist emigrate from you when this part of you character be most predominant and they take this bias and direction the moment they part from you hand they be therefore not only devoted to liherty but to liberty accord to english idea and on english principle abstract liberty like other mere abstraction be not to be find liberty inhere in some sensible object and every nation have form to itself some favorite point which by way of eminence become the criterion of they happiness it happen you know sir that the great contest for freedom in this country be from the earliest time chiefly upon the question of tax most of the contest in the ancient commonwealth turn primarily on the right of election of magistrate or on the balance among the several order of the state the question of money be not with they so immediate but in england it be otherwise on this point of tax the ablest pen and most eloquent tongue have be exercise the greatest spirit have act and suffer in order to give the fullest satisfaction concern the importance of this point it be not only necessary for those who in argument defend the excellence of the english constitution to insist on this privilege of grant money as a dry point of fact and to prove that the right have be acknowledge in ancient parchment and blind usage to reside in a certain body call a house of common they go much farther they attempt to prove and they succeed that in theory it ought to be so from the particular nature of a house of common as a immediate representative of the people whether the old record have deliver this oracle or not they take infinite pain to inculcate as a fundamental principle that in all monarchy the people must in effect themselves mediately or immediately possess the power of grant they own money or no shadow of liberty can subsist the colony draw from you as with they life-blood these idea and principle they love of liberty as with you fix and attach on this specific point of tax liberty might be safe or might be endanger in twenty other particulars without they be much pleased or alarm here they feel its pulse and as they find that beat they think themselves sick or sound i do not say whether they be right or wrong in apply you general argument to they own case it be not easy indeed to make a monopoly of theorem and corollary the fact be that they do thus apply those general argument and you mode of govern they whether through lenity or indolence through wisdom or mistake confirm they in the imagination that they as well as you have a interest in these common principle they be further confirm in this pleasing error by the form of they provincial legislative assembly they government be popular in a high degree some be merely popular in all the popular representative be the most weighty and this share of the people in they ordinary government never fail to inspire they with lofty sentiment and with a strong aversion from whatever tend to deprive they of they chief importance if anything be want to this necessary operation of the form of government religion would have give it a complete effect religion always a principle of energy in this new people be no way wear out or impaired and they mode of profess it be also one main cause of this free spirit the people be protestant and of that kind which be the most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion this be a persuasion not only favorable to liberty but build upon it i do not think sir that the reason of this averseness in the dissent church from all that look like absolute government be so much to be seek in they religious tenet as in they history every one know that the roman catholic religion be at least coeval with most of the government where it prevail that it have generally go hand in hand with they and receive great favor and every kind of support from authority the church of england too be form from she cradle under the nursing care of regular government but the dissent interest have spring up in direct opposition to all the ordinary power of the world and could justify that opposition only on a strong claim to natural liberty they very existence depend on the powerful and unremitted assertion of that claim all protestantism even the most cold and passive be a sort of dissent but the religion most prevalent in we northern colony be a refinement on the principle of resistance it be the dissidence of dissent and the protestantism of the protestant religion this religion under a variety of denomination agree in nothing but in the communion of the spirit of liberty be predominant in most of the northern province where the church of england notwithstanding its legal rights be in reality no more than a sort of private sect not compose most probably the tenth of the people the colonist leave england when this spirit be high and in the emigrant be the highest of all and even that stream of foreigner which have be constantly flow into these colony have for the greatest part be compose of dissenter from the establishment of they several country who have bring with they a temper and character far from alien to that of the people with whom they mix sir i can perceive by they manner that some gentleman object to the latitude of this description because in the southern colony the church of england form a large body and have a regular establishment it be certainly true there be however a circumstance attend these colony which in my opinion fully counterbalance this difference and make the spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those to the northward it be that in virginium and the carolina they have a vast multitude of slave where this be the case in any part of the world those who be free be by far the most proud and jealous of they freedom freedom be to they not only a enjoyment but a kind of rank and privilege not see there that freedom as in country where it be a common blessing and as broad and general as the air may be unite with much abject toil with great misery with all the exterior of servitude liberty look amongst they like something that be more noble and liberal i do not mean sir to commend the superior morality of this sentiment which have at least as much pride as virtue in it but i can not alter the nature of man the fact be so and these people of the southern colony be much more strongly and with a higher and more stubborn spirit attach to liberty than those to the northward such be all the ancient commonwealth such be we gothic ancestor such in we day be the pole and such will be all master of slave who be not slave themselves in such a people the haughtiness of domination combine with the spirit of freedom fortify it and render it invincible permit I sir to add another circumstance in we colony which contribute no mean part towards the growth and effect of this untractable spirit i mean they education in no country perhaps in the world be the law so general a study the profession itself be numerous and powerful and in most province it take the lead the greater number of the deputy send to the congress be lawyer but all who read and most do read endeavor to obtain some smattering in that science i have be tell by a eminent bookseller that in no branch of he business after tract of popular devotion be so many book as those on the law export to the plantation the colonist have now fall into the way of print they for they own use i hear that they have sell nearly as many of blackstone 's commentary in america as in england general gage mark out this disposition very particularly in a letter on you table he state that all the people in he government be lawyer or smatterer in law and that in boston they have be enable by successful chicane wholly to evade many part of one of you capital penal constitution the smartness of debate will say that this knowledge ought to teach they more clearly the rights of legislature they obligation to obedience and the penalty of rebellion all this be mighty well but my honorable and learn friend on the floor who condescend to mark what i say for animadversion will disdain that ground he have hear as well as i that when great honor and great emolument do not win over this knowledge to the service of the state it be a formidable adversary to government if the spirit be not tame and break by these happy method it be stubborn and litigious _ abeunt studium in mores _ this study render man acute inquisitive dexterous prompt in attack ready in defense full of resource in other country the people more simple and of a less mercurial cast judge of a ill principle in government only by a actual grievance here they anticipate the evil and judge of the pressure of the grievance by the badness of the principle they augur misgovernment at a distance and snuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze the last cause of this disobedient spirit in the colony be hardly less powerful than the rest as it be not merely moral but lay deep in the natural constitution of thing three thousand mile of ocean lie between you and they no contrivance can prevent the effect of this distance in weaken government sea roll and month pass between the order and the execution and the want of a speedy explanation of a single point be enough to defeat a whole system you have indeed winged minister of vengeance who carry you bolt in they pounce to the remotest verge of the sea but there a power step in that limit the arrogance of rage passion and furious element and say _ so far shalt thou go and no farther _ who be you that you should fret and rage and bite the chain of nature nothing worse happen to you than do to all nation who have extensive empire and it happen in all the form into which empire can be throw in large body the circulation of power must be less vigorous at the extremity nature have say it

relaxation in all he border spain in she province be perhaps not so well obey as you be in yours she comply too she submit she watch time this be the immutable condition the eternal law of extensive and detach empire then sir from these six capital source -- of descent of form of government of religion in the northern province of manners in the southern of education of the remoteness of situation from the first mover of government-from all these cause a fierce spirit of liberty have grow up it have grow with the growth of the people in you colony and increase with the increase of they wealth a

by daniel defoe and now we case be very dismal indeed for we all see plainly that the sea go so high that the boat could not escape and that we should be inevitably drown as to make sail we have none nor if we have could we have do anything with it so we work at the oar towards the land though with heavy heart like man go to execution for we all know that when the boat come near the shore she would be dash in a thousand piece by the beach of the sea however we commit we soul to god in the most earnest manner and the wind drive we towards the shore we hasten we destruction with we own hand pull as well as we could towards land what the shore be whether rock or sand whether steep or shoal we know not the only hope that could rationally give we the least shadow of expectation be if we might happen into some bay or gulf or the mouth of some river where by great chance we might have run we boat in or get under the lee of the land and perhaps make smooth water but there be nothing of this appear but as we make nearer and nearer the shore the land look more frightful than the sea after we have row or rather drive about a league and a half as we reckon it a rage wave mountain-like come roll astern of we and plainly bid we expect the _ coup de grace _ in a word it take we with such a fury that it overset the boat at once and separate we as well from the boat as from one another give its not time hardly to say o god for we be all swallow up in a moment nothing can describe the confusion of thought which i feel when i sink into the water for though i swam very well yet i could not deliver myself from the wave so as to draw breath till that wave have drive I or rather carry I a vast way on towards the shore and have spend itself go back and leave I upon the land almost dry but half dead with the water i take in i have so much presence of mind as well as breath leave that see myself nearer the mainland than i expect i get upon my foot and endeavor to make on towards the land as fast as i could before another wave should return and take I up again but i soon find it be impossible to avoid it for i see the sea come after I as high as a great hill and as furious as a enemy which i have no means or strength to contend with : my business be to hold my breath and raise myself upon the water if i could and so by swim to preserve my breathing and pilot myself towards the shore if possible my greatest concern now be that the wave as it would carry I a great way toward the shore when it come on might not carry I back again with it when it give back towards the sea the wave that come upon I again bury I at once twenty or thirty foot deep in its own body and i could feel myself i carry with a mighty force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way but i hold my breath and assist myself to swim still forward with all my might i be ready to burst with hold my breath when as i feel myself rise up so to my immediate relief i find my head and hand shoot out above the surface of the water and though it be not two seconds of time that i could keep myself so yet it relieve I greatly give I breath and new courage i be cover again with water a good while but not so long but i hold it out and find the water have spend itself and begin to return i strike forward against the return of the wave and feel ground again with my foot i stand still a few moment to recover breath and till the water go from I and then take to my heel and run with what strength i have farther towards the shore but neither would this deliver I from the fury of the sea which come pour in after I again and twice more i be lift up by the wave and carry forwards as before the shore be very flat the last time of these two have well-nigh be fatal to I for the sea have hurry I along as before land I or rather dash I against a piece of a rock and that with such force as it leave I senseless and indeed helpless as to my own deliverance for the blow take my side and breast beat the breath as it be quite out of my body and have it return again immediately i must have be strangle in the water but i recover a little before the return of the wave and see i should be cover again with the water i resolve to hold fast by a piece of the rock and so to hold my breath if possible till the wave go back now as the wave be not so high as at first be nearer land i hold my hold till the wave abate and then fetch another run which bring I so near the shore that the next wave though it go over I yet do not so swallow I up as to carry I away and the next run i take i get to the mainland where to my great comfort i clamber up the cliff of the shore and sit I down upon the grass free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water i be now land and safe on shore and begin to look up and thank god that my life be save in a case wherein there be some minute before scarce any room to hope i believe it be impossible to express to the life what the ecstasy and transport of the soul be when it be so save as i may say out of the very grave : and i do not wonder now at that custom when a malefactor who have the halter about he neck be tie up and just go to be turn off and have a reprieve bring to he -- i say i do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it to let he blood that very moment they tell he of it that the surprise may not drive the animal spirit from the heart and overwhelm he for sudden joy like grief confound at first i walk about on the shore lift up my hand and my whole be as i may say wrapt up in a contemplation of my deliverance make a thousand gesture and motion which i can not describe reflect upon all my comrade that be drown and that there should not be one soul save but myself for as for they i never see they afterwards or any sign of they except three of they bat one cap and two shoe that be not fellow i cast my eye to the stranded vessel when the breach and froth of the sea be so big i could hardly see it it lay so far off and consider lord how be it possible i could get on shore after i have solace my mind with the comfortable part of my condition i begin to look round I to see what kind of place i be in and what be next to be do : and i soon find my comfort abate and that in a word i bad a dreadful deliverance : for i be wet have no clothes to shift I nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort I neither do i see any prospect before I but that of perish with hunger or be devour by wild beast : and that which be particularly afflict to I be that i have no weapon either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance or to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill I for theirs in a word i have nothing about I but a knife a tobacco-pipe and a little tobacco in a box this be all my provision and this throw I into terrible agony of mind that for awhile i run about like a madman night come upon I i begin with a heavy heart to consider what would be my lot if there be any ravenous beast in that country see at night they always come abroad for they prey all the remedy that offer to my thought at that time be to get up into a thick busby tree like a fir but thorny which grow near I and where i resolve to sit all night and consider the next day what death i should die for as yet i see no prospect of life i walk about a furlong from the shore to see if i could find any fresh water to drink which i do to my great joy and have drunk and put a little tobacco in my mouth to prevent hunger i go to the tree and get up into it endeavor to place myself so that if i should sleep i might not fall and have cut I a short stick like a truncheon for my defense i take up my lodging and be excessively fatigued i fall fast asleep and sleep as comfortably as i believe few could have do in my condition and find myself more refresh with it than i think i ever be on such a occasion when i wake it be broad day the weather clear and the storm abate so that the sea do not rage and swell as before but that which surprise I most be that the ship be lift off in the night from the sand where she lay by the swell of the tide and be drive up almost as far as the rock which i at first mention where i have be so bruise by the wave dashing I against it this be within about a mile from the shore where i be and the ship seem to stand upright still i wish myself on board that at least i might save some necessary thing for my use when i come down from my apartment in the tree i look about I again and the first thing i find be the boat which lay as the wind and sea have toss she up upon the land about two mile on my right hand i walk as far as i could upon the shore to have get to she but find a neck or inlet of water between I and the boat which be about half a mile broad so i come back for the present be more intent upon get at the ship where i hope to find something for my present subsistence a little after noon i find the sea very calm and the tide ebb so far out that i could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship and here i find a fresh renew of my grief for i see evidently that if we have keep on board we have be all safe : that be to say we have all get safe on shore and i have not be so miserable as to be leave entirely destitute of all comfort and company as i now be this forced tear to my eye again but as there be little relief in that i resolve if possible to get to the ship - so i pull off my clothes for the weather be hot to extremity and take the water but when i come to the ship my difficulty be still greater to know how to get on board for as she lay aground and high out of the water there be nothing within my reach to lay hold of i swam round she twice and the second time i espied a small piece of rope which i wonder i do not see at first hang down by the fore-chain so low that with great difficulty i get hold of it and by the help of that rope get up into the forecastle of the ship here i find that the ship be bulge and have a great deal of water in she hold but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand or rather earth that she stern lay lift up upon the bank and she head low almost to the water by this mean all she quarter be free and all that be in that part be dry for you may be sure my first work be to search and to see what be spoil and what be free and first i find that all the ship 's provision be dry and untouched by the water and be very well disposed to eat i go to the bread-room and fill my pocket with biscuit and eat it as i go about other thing for i have no time to lose i also find some rum in the great cabin of which i take a large dram and which i have indeed need enough of to spirit I for what be before I now i want nothing but a boat to furnish myself with many thing which i foresaw would be very necessary to I it be in vain to sit still and wish for what be not to be have and this extremity rouse my application we have several spare yard and two or three large spar of wood and a spare topmast or two in the ship : i resolve to fall tp work with these and i flung as many of they overboard as i could manage for they weight tie every one with a rope that they might not drive away when this be do i go down the ship 's side and pull they to I i tie four of they together at both end as well as i could in the form of a raft and lay two or three short piece of plank upon they crossways i find i could walk upon it very well but that it be not able to bear any great weight the piece be too light so i go to work and with the carpenter 's saw i cut a spare topmast into three length and add they to my raft with a great deal of labor and pain but the hope of furnish myself with necessaries encourage I to go beyond what i should have be able to have do upon another occasion my raft be now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight my next care be what to load it with and how to preserve what i lay upon it from the surf of the sea : but i be not long consider this i first lay all the plank or board upon it that i could get and have consider well what i most want i first get three of the seaman 's chest which i have break open and empty and lower they down upon my raft the first of these i fill with provision -- viz bread rice three dutch cheese five piece of dry goat 's flesh -lrb- which we live much upon -rrb- and a little remainder of european corn which have be lay by for some fowl which we bring to sea with we but the fowl be kill there have be some barley and wheat together but to my great disappointment i find afterwards that the rat have eat or spoil it all as for liquor i find several case of bottle belong to we skipper in which be some cordial water and in all about five or six gallon of arrack these i stow by themselves there be no need to put they into the chest nor any room for they while i be do this i find the tide begin to flow though very calm and i have the mortification to see my coat shirt and waistcoat which i have leave on shore upon the sand swim away as for my breeches which be only linen and open-kneed i swam on board in they and my stocking however this put I upon rummage for clothes of which i find enough but take no more than i want for present use for i have other thing which my eye be more upon as first tool to work with on shore : and it be after long search that i find out the carpenter 's chest which be indeed a very useful prize to I and much more valuable than a ship-lading of gold would have be at that time i get it down to my raft whole as it be without lose time to look into it for i know in general what it contain my next care be for some ammunition and arm there be two very good fowling-piece in the great cabin and two pistol these i secure first with some powder-horn a small bag of shot and two old rusty sword i know there be three barrel of powder in the ship but know not where we gunner have stow they but with much search i find they two of they dry and good the third have take water those two i get to my raft with the arm and now i think myself pretty well freighted and begin to think how i should get to shore with they have neither sail oar nor rudder and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation i have three encouragement : first a smooth calm sea secondly the tide rise and set in to the shore thirdly what little wind there be blow I towards the land and thus have find two or three broken oar belong to the boat and besides the tool which be in the chest two saw a axe and a hammer with this cargo i put to sea for a mile or thereabout my raft go very well only that i find it drive a little distant from the place where i have land before : by which i perceive that there be some indraught of the water and consequently i hope to find some creek or river there which i might malze use of as a port to get to land with my cargo as i imagine so it be there appear before I a little opening of the land i find a strong current of the tide set into it so i guide my raft as well as i could to keep in the middle of the stream but here i have like to have suffer a second shipwreck which if i have i think verily would have break my heart for know nothing of the coast my raft run aground at one end of it upon a shoal and not be aground at the other end it want but a little that all my cargo have slip off towards the end that be afloat and so fall into the water i do my utmost by set my back against the chest to keep they in they place but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength neither durst i stir from the posture i be in but hold up the chest with all my might i stand in that manner near half a hour in which time the rising of the water bring I a little more upon a level and a little after the water still rise my raft float again and i thrust she off with the oar i have into the channel and then drive up higher i at length find myself in the mouth of a little river with land on both side and a strong current or tide run up i look on both side for a proper place to get to shore for i be not willing to be drive too high up the river hope in time to see some ship at sea and therefore resolve to place myself as near the coast as i could at length i spy a little cove on the right shore of the creek to which with great pain and difficulty i guide my raft and at last get so near that reach ground with my oar i could thrust she directly in but here i have like to have dip all my cargo into the sea again for that shore lie pretty steep-that be to say sloping -- there be no place to land but where one end of my float if it run on shore would lie so high and the other sink lower as before that it would endanger my cargo again all that i could do be to wait till the tide be at the highest keep the raft with my oar like a anchor to hold the side of it fast to the shore near a flat piece of ground which i expect the water would flow over and so it do as soon as i find water enough for my raft draw about a foot of water i thrust she upon that flat piece of ground and there fasten or moor she by stick my two broken oar into the ground-one on one side near one end and one on the other side near the other end and thus i lay till the water ebb away and leave my raft and all my cargo safe on shore _ appendix 6 _ reading list one of the best way to _ know _ word be through see they use by the master for
