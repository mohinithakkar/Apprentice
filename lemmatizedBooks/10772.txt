produce by jeroen hellingman inca land exploration in the highland of peru by hiram bingham 1922 ------ figure something hide go and find it go and look behind the range -- something lose behind the range lose and wait for you go kiple : the explorer ------ this volume be affectionately dedicate to the muse who inspire it the little mother of seven son preface the follow page represent some of the result of four journey into the interior of peru and also many exploration into the labyrinth of early writings which treat of the inca and they land although my travels cover only a part of southern peru they take I into every variety of climate and force I to camp at almost every altitude at which man have construct house or erect tent in the western hemisphere -- from sea level up to 21703 foot it have be my lot to cross bleak andean pass where there be heavy snowfall and low temperature as well as to wend my way through gigantic canyon into the dense jungle of the amazon basin as hot and humid a region as exist anywhere in the world the inca live in a land of violent contrast no desert in the world have less vegetation than those of sihua and maje no luxuriant tropical valley have more plant life than the jungle of conservidayoc in inca land one may pass from glacier to tree fern within a few hour so also in the labyrinth of contemporary chronicle of the last of the inca -- no historian go more rapidly from fact to fancy from accurate observation to grotesque imagination no writer omit important detail and give conflict statement with greater frequency the story of the inca be still in a maze of doubt and contradiction it be the mystery and romance of some of the wonderful picture of a nineteenth-century explorer that first lead I into the relatively unknown region between the apurimac and the urubamba sometimes call the cradle of the inca although my photograph can not compete with the imaginative pencil of such a artist nevertheless i hope that some of they may lead future traveler to penetrate still farther into the land of the inca and engage in the fascinating game of identify elusive place mention in the chronicle some of my story have already be tell in harper 's and the national geographic to whose editor acknowledgment be due for permission to use the material in its present form a glance at the bibliography will show that more than fifty article and monograph have be publish as a result of the peruvian expedition of yale university and the national geographic society other report be still in course of preparation my own observation be base partly on a study of these monograph and the writings of former traveler partly on the map and note make by my companion and partly on a study of we peruvian photograph a collection now numbering over eleven thousand negative another source of information be the opportunity of frequent conference with my fellow explorer one of the great advantage of large expedition be the bring to bear on the same problem of mind which have receive widely different training my companion on these journey be in 1909 mr clarence l hay in 1911 dr isaiah bowman professor harry ward

------ figure sketch map of southern peru ------ inca land chapter i cross the desert a kind friend in bolivium once place in my hand a copy of a most interesting book by the late e george squier entitle peru travel and exploration in the land of the inca in that volume be a marvelous picture of the apurimac valley in the foreground be a delicate suspension bridge which commence at a tunnel in the face of a precipitous cliff and hang in mid-air at great height above the swirl water of the great speaker in the distance towering above a mass of stupendous mountain be a magnificent snow-capped peak the desire to see the apurimac and experience the thrill of cross that bridge decide I in favor of a overland journey to lima as a result i go to cuzco the ancient capital of the mighty empire of the inca and be there urge by the peruvian authority to visit some newly re-discovered inca ruin as reader of across south america will remember these ruin be at choqquequirau a interesting place on top of a jungle-covered ridge several thousand foot above the roar rapid of the great apurimac there be some doubt as to who have originally live here the prefect insist that the ruin represent the residence of the inca manco and he son who have seek refuge from pizarro and the spanish conqueror of peru in the ande between the apurimac and urubamba river while mr clarence l hay and i be on the slope of choqquequirau the cloud would occasionally break away and give we tantalizing glimpse of snow-covered mountain there seem to be a unknown region behind the range which might contain great possibility we guide could tell we nothing about it little be to be find in book perhaps manco 's capital be hide there for month afterwards the fascination of the unknown draw my thought to choqquequirau and beyond in the word of kipling 's explorer : a voice as bad as conscience ring interminable change on one everlasting whisper day and night repeat -- so : ` something hidden go and find it go and look behind the range -- something lose behind the range lose and wait for you go ' to add to my unrest during the follow summer i read bandelier 's titicaca and koatus which have just appear in one of the interesting footnote be this startling remark : it be much to be desire that the elevation of the most prominent peak of the western or coast range of peru be accurately determine it be likely that coropuna in the peruvian coast range of the department arequipa be the culminate point of the continent it exceed 23000 foot in height whereas aconcagua -lrb- concede to be the highest peak in the western hemisphere -rrb- be but 22763 foot -lrb- 6940 meter -rrb- above sea level he estimate be base on a survey make by the civil engineer of the southern railway of peru use a section of the railroad as a base my sensation when i read this be difficult to describe although i have be study south american history and geography for more than ten year i do not remember ever to have hear of coropuna on most map it do not exist fortunately on one of the sheet of raimondus 's large-scale map of peru i finally find coropuna -- 6949 m -- 9 meter higher than aconcagua -- one hundred mile northwest of arequipa near the 73d meridian west of greenwich look up and down the 73d meridian as it cross peru from the amazon valley to the pacific ocean i see that it pass very near choqquequirau and actually traverse those very land behind the range which have be beckon to I the coincidence be intriguing the desire to go and find that something hide be now reënforced by the temptation to go and see whether coropuna really be the highest mountain in america there follow the organization of a expedition whose object be a geographical reconnaissance of peru along the 73d meridian from the head of canoe navigation on the urubamba to tidewater on the pacific we achieve more than we expect we success be due in large part to we unit-food-box a device contain a balanced ration which professor harry w foote have cooperate with I in assemble the object of we idea be to facilitate the provision of small field party by packing in a single box everything that two man would need in the way of provision for a give period these box have give such general satisfaction not only to the explorer themselves but to the surgeon who have the responsibility of keep they in good condition that a few word in regard to this feature of we equipment may not be unwelcome the best unit-food-box provide a balanced ration for two man for eight day breakfast and supper be hearty cook meal and luncheon light and uncook it be not intend that the man should depend entirely on the food-box but should vary they diet as much as possible with whatever the country afford which in southern peru frequently mean potato corn egg mutton and bread nevertheless each box contain sliced bacon tin corned beef roast beef chicken salmon crushed oats milk cheese coffee sugar rice army bread salt sweet chocolate assorted jam pickle and dry fruit and vegetable by see that the jam dry fruit soup and dry vegetable be well assorted a sufficient variety be procure without destroy the balanced character of the ration on account of the great difficulty of transportation in the southern ande we have to eliminate food that contain a large amount of water like french pea baked bean and can fruit however delicious and desirable they might be in addition to food we find it desirable to include in each box a cake of laundry soap two yard of dish toweling and three empty cotton-cloth bag to be use for carry lunch and collect specimen the most highly appreciate article of food in we box be the rolled oats a dish which on account of its be already partially cook be easily prepare at high elevation where rice can not be properly boil it be difficult to satisfy the member of the expedition by provide the right amount of sugar at the beginning of the field season the allowance -- one third of a pound per day per man -- seem excessive and i be criticize for have overload the box after a month in the field the allowance prove to be too small and have to be supplement many people seem to think that it be one of the duty of a explorer to rough it and to trust to luck for he food i have find on my first two expedition in venezuelum and colombium and across south america that the result of be oblige to subsist on irregular and haphazard ration be most unsatisfactory while rough it be far more entice to the inexperienced and indiscreet explorer i learn in peru that the humdrum expedient of carefully prepare month in advance a comprehensive bill of fare sufficiently vary wholesome and well-balanced be the better part of valor the truth be that provide a abundance of appetizing food add very greatly to the effectiveness of a party to be sure it may mean trouble and expense for one 's transportation department and some of the younger man may feel that they reputation as explorer be likely to be damage if it be know that strawberry jam sweet chocolate and pickle be frequently find on they menu nevertheless experience have show that the result of trust to luck and living as the native do mean not only loss of efficiency in the day 's work but also lessen power of observation and diminish enthusiasm for the drudgery of scientific exploration exciting thing be always easy to do no matter how you be live but frequently they produce less important result than task which depend upon daily drudgery and daily drudgery depend upon a regular supply of wholesome food we reach arequipa the propose base for we campaign against mt coropuna in June 1911 we learn that the peruvian winter reach its climax in July or August and that it would be folly to try to climb coropuna during the winter snowstorm on the other hand the summer month begin with November be cloudy and likely to add fog and mist to the difficulty of climb a new mountain furthermore June and July be the best month for exploration in the eastern slope of the ande in the upper amazon basin the land behind the range although the montaña or jungle country be rarely actually dry there be less rain then than in the other month of the year so we decide to go first to the urubamba valley the story of we discovery there of identify uitico the capital of the last inca and of the finding of machu picchu will be find in later chapter in September i return to arequipa and start the campaign against coropuna by endeavor to get adequate transportation facility for cross the desert arequipa as everybody know be the home of a station of the harvard observatory but arequipa be also famous for its large mule unfortunately a mule trust have recently be form -- needless to say by a american -- and i find it difficult to make any satisfactory arrangement after two week of skirmish the tejada brother appear two arriero or muleteer who seem willing to listen to we proposal we offer they a thousand sole -lrb- five hundred dollar gold -rrb- if they would supply we with a pack train of eleven mule for two month and go with we wherever we choose we agree not to travel on a average more than seven league -lrb- 2 -rrb- a day it sound simple enough but it take no end of argument and persuasion on the part of we friend in arequipa to convince these worthy arriero that they be not go to be everlastingly ruin by this bargain the trouble be that they own they mule know the great danger of cross the desert that lay between we and mt coropuna and fear to travel on unknown trail like most muleteer they be afraid of unfamiliar country they magnify the imaginary evil of the road to a inconceivable pitch the argument that finally persuade they to accept the proffer contract be my promise that after the first week the cargo would be so much less that at least two of the pack mule could always be free the tejada realize only too well the propensity of pack animal to get sore back and go lame regard my promise in the light of a factor of safety lame mule would not have to carry load everything be ready by the end of the month mr h l tucker a member of professor h c parker 's 1910 mr mckinley expedition and thoroughly familiar with the detail of snow-and-ice-climbing whom i have ask to be responsible for secure the proper equipment be now entrust with planning and direct the actual ascent of coropuna whatever success be achieve on the mountain be due primarily to mr tucker 's skill and foresight we have no swiss guide and have originally intend to ask two other member of the expedition to join we on the climb however the exigency of make a geological and topographical cross section along the 73d meridian through a practically unknown region and across one of the highest pass in the ande -lrb- 17633 ft -rrb- have delay the survey party to such a extent as to make it impossible for they to reach coropuna before the first of November on account of the approach of the cloudy season it do not seem wise to wait for they coöperation accordingly i secure in arequipa the service of mr casimir watkin a english naturalist and of mr f hinckley of the harvard observatory it be propose that mr hinckley who have twice ascended el mistus -lrb- 19120 ft -rrb- should accompany we to the top while mr watkin who have only recently recover from a severe illness should take charge of the base camp the prefect of arequipa obligingly offer we a military escort in the person of corporal gamarra a full-blooded indian of rather more than average height and considerably more than average courage who know the country as a member of the mount gendarmerie gamarra have be station at the provincial capital of cotahuasus a few month previously one day a mob of drunken riotous revolutionist storm the government building while he be on sentry duty gamarra stand he ground and when they attempt to force they way past he shoot the leader of the crowd the mob scatter a grateful prefect make he a corporal and realize that he life be no longer safe in that particular vicinity transfer he to arequipa like nearly all of he race however he fall a easy prey to alcohol there be no doubt that the chief of the mount police in arequipa when order by the prefect to furnish we a escort for we journey across the desert be glad enough to assign gamarra to we he courage could not be call in question even though he habit might lead he to become troublesome it happen that gamarra do not know we be plan to go to cotahuasus have he know this and also have he suspect the trial that be before he on mt coropuna he probably would have beg off -- but i be anticipate on the 2d of October tucker hinckley corporal gamarra and i leave arequipa watkin follow a week later the first stage of the journey be by train from arequipa to vitor a distance of thirty mile the arriero send the cargo along too in addition to the food-box we bring with we tent ice axis snowshoe barometer thermometer transit fiber case steel box duffle bag and a folding boat we pack train be suppose to have start from arequipa the day before we hope it would reach vitor about the same time that we do but that be expect too much of arriero on the first day of they journey so we have a all-day wait near the primitive little railway station we amuse ourselves wander off over the neighbor pampa and study the médanos crescent-shaped sand dune which be common in the great coastal desert one read so much of the great tropical jungle of south america and of wellnigh impenetrable forest that it be difficult to realize that the west coast from ecuador on the north to the heart of chile on the south be a great desert break at interval by oasis or valley whose river come from melting snow of the ande be here and there divert for purpose of irrigation lima the capital of peru be in one of the largest of these oasis although frequently envelop in a damp fog the peruvian coastal town be almost never subject to rain the cause of this phenomenon be easy to understand wind come from the east laden with the moisture of the atlantic ocean and the steam amazon basin be rapidly cool by the eastern slope of the ande and force to deposit this moisture in the montaña by the time the wind have cross the mighty cordillera there be no rain leave in they conversely the wind that come from the warm pacific ocean strike a cold area over the frigid humboldt current which sweep up along the west coast of south america this cold belt wring the water out of the westerly wind so that by the time they reach the warm land they relative humidity be low to be sure there be month in some year when so much moisture fall on the slope of the coast range that the hillside be clothe with flower but this verdure last but a short time and do not seriously affect the great stretch of desert pampa in the midst of which we now be like the other pampas of this region the flat surface incline toward the sea over it the sand be roll along by the wind and finally build into crescent-shaped dune these médanos interested we greatly the prevail wind on the desert at night be a relatively gentle breeze that come down from the cool mountain slope toward the ocean it tend to blow the lighter particle of sand along in a regular dune roll it over and over downhill leave the heavier particle behind this be reverse in the daytime as the heat increase toward noon the wind come rush up from the ocean to fill the vacuum cause by the rapidly ascend current of hot air that rise from the overheate pampas during the early afternoon this wind reach a high velocity and swirl the sand along in cloud it be now strong enough to move the heavier particle of sand uphill it sweep the heaviest one around the base of the dune and deposit they in pointed ridge on either side the heavier material remain stationary at night while the lighter particle be roll downhill but the whole mass travel slowly uphill again during the gale of the follow afternoon the result be the beautiful crescent-shaped médano about five o'clock we mule a fine-looking lot -- far superior to any that we have be able to secure near cuzco -- trot briskly into the dusty little plaza it take some time to adjust the load and it be nearly seven o'clock before we start off in the moonlight for the oasis of vitor as we leave the plateau and strike the dusty trail wind down into a dark canyon we catch a glimpse of something white shimmering faintly on the horizon far off to the northwest coropuna shortly before nine o'clock we reach a little corral where the mule be unloaded for ourselves we find a shed with a clean stone-paved floor where we set up we cot only to be awaken many time during the night by pass caravan anxious to avoid the terrible heat of the desert by day ------ figure mt coropuna from the northwest ------ where the oasis be only a few mile apart one often travel by day but when cross the desert be a matter of eight or ten hour ' steady jogging with no place to rest no water no shade the pack animal suffer greatly consequently most caravan travel so far as possible by night we first desert the pampa of sihua be report to be narrow so we prefer to cross it by day and see what be to be see we get up about half-past four and be off before seven then we trouble begin either because he live in arequipa or because they think he look like a good horseman or for reason best know to themselves the tejada have give mr hinckley a very spirited saddle-mule the first thing i know she rider carry a heavy camera a package of plate-holder and a large mercurial barometer borrow from the harvard observatory be pitch headlong into the sand fortunately no damage be do and after a lively chase the runaway mule be bring back by corporal gamarra after mr hinckley be remount on he dangerous mule we ride on for a while in peace between cornfield and vineyard over path flank by willow and fig tree the chief industry of vitor be the making of wine from vine which date back to colonial day the wine be age in huge jar each over six foot high bury in the ground we have a glimpse of seventeen of they stand in a line await sale it make one think of alus baba and the forty thief who would have have no trouble at all hide in these cyclopean crock the edge of the oasis of vitor be the contour line along which the irrigating canal run there be no gradual peter out of foliage the desert begin with a stunning crash on one side be the bright luxurious green of fig tree and vineyard on the other side be the absolute stark nakedness of the sandy desert within the oasis there be a abundance of water much of it run to waste the wine grower receive more than they can use in fact more land could easily be put under cultivation the chief difficulty be the scarcity of port from which produce can be ship to the outer world the expense of the transportation system of pack train over the desert which intervene between the oasis and the railroad and the lack of capital otherwise the irrigation system might be extend over great stretch of rich volcanic soil now unoccupied a steady climb of three quarter of a hour take we to the northern rim of the valley here we again see the snowy mass of coropuna glistening in the sunlight seventy-five mile away to the northwest we view be a short one for in less than three minute we have to descend another canyon we cross this and climb out on the pampa of sihua there be little to interest we in we immediate surroundings but in the distance be coropuna and i have just begin to study the problem of possible route for climb the highest peak when mr hinckley 's mule trot briskly across the trail directly in front of I kick up she heel and again send he sprawl over the sand barometer camera plate and all unluckily this time he foot catch in a stirrup and still hold the bridle he be drag some distance before he get it loose he struggle to he foot and try to keep the mule from run away when a violent kick release he hold and knock he out we immediately set up we little mummery tent on the hot sandy floor of the desert and render first-aid to the unlucky astronomer we find that the sharp point of one of the vicious mule 's new shoe have open a large vein in mr hinckley 's leg the cut be not dangerous but too deep for successful mountain climb with gamarra 's aid mr hinckley be able to reach arequipa that night but he enforced departure not only shatter he own hope of climb coropuna but also make we wonder how we be go to have the necessary three-men-on-the-rope when we reach the glacier to be sure there be the corporal -- but would he go indian do not like snow mountain pack up the tent again we resume we course over the desert the oasis of sihua another beautiful garden in the bottom of a huge canyon be reach about four o'clock in the afternoon we should have be compel to camp in the open with the arriero have not the parish priest invite we to rest in the cool shade of he vine-covered arbor he graciously serve we with cake and sweet native wine and ask we to stay as long as we like the desert of maje which now lay ahead of we be perhaps the widest hottest and most barren in this region we arriero be unwilling to cross it in the daytime they say it be forty-five mile between water and water the next day we enjoy the hospitality of we kindly host until after supper so sure be the inhabitant of these oasis that it be not go to rain that they house be build merely as a shelter against the sun and wind they be make of the cane that grow in the jungle of the larger river bottom or along the bank of irrigate ditch on the roof the space between the cane be fill with adobe sun-dried mud it be not necessary to plaster the side of the house for it be pleasant to let the air have free play and it be amusing to look out through the crack and see everything that be pass that evening we saddle in the moonlight slowly we climb out of the valley to spend the night jogging steadily hour after hour across the desert as the moon be set we enter a hilly region and at sunrise find ourselves in the midst of a tumbled mass of enormous sand dune -- the result of hundred of médanos blow across the pampa of maje and deposit along the border of the valley it take we three hour to wind slowly down from the level of the desert to a point where we could see the great canyon a mile deep and two mile across its steep side be of various color rock and sand the bottom be a bright green oasis through which flow the rapid maje river too deep to be ford even in the dry season a very large part of the flood plain of the unruly river be not cultivate and consist of a wild jungle difficult of access in the dry season and impossible when the river rise during the rainy month the contrast between the gigantic hill of sand and the luxurious vegetation be very striking but to we the most beautiful thing in the landscape be the long glisten white mass of coropuna now much larger and just visible above the opposite rim of the valley at eight o'clock in the morning as we be wonder how long it would be before we could get down to the bottom of the valley and have some breakfast we discover at a place call pita -lrb- or cerro colorado -rrb- a huge volcanic boulder cover with rude pictograph further search in the vicinity reveal about one hundred of these boulder each with its quota of crude drawing i do not notice any ruin of house near the rock neither of the tejada brother who have be past here many time nor any of the native of this region appear to have any idea of the origin or meaning of this singular collection of pictographic rock the drawing represent jaguar bird man and dachshund-like dog they deserve careful study yet not even the interest and excitement of investigate the roca jeroglifico as they be call here could make we forget that we have have no food or sleep for a good many hour so after take a few picture we hasten on and cross the maje river on a very shaky temporary bridge it be build to last only during the dry season to construct a bridge which would withstand flood be not feasible at present we spend the day at corirus a pleasant little village where it be almost impossible to sleep on account of the myriad of gnat the next day we have a short ride along the western side of the valley to the town of aplao the capital of the province of castillum call by its present inhabitant maje although on raimondus 's map that name be apply only to the river and the neighbor desert in 1865 at the time of he visit it have a bad reputation for disease now it seem more healthy the sub-prefect of castillum have be inform by telegraph of we come and invite we to a excellent dinner the people of maje be largely of mixed white and indian ancestry many of they appear to be unusually businesslike the proprietor of one establishment be a great admirer of american shoe the name of which he pronounce in a manner that puzzle we for a long time w be unknown in spanish and the letter a l and k be never find in juxtaposition when he ask we what we think of valluck-ofair ' accent strongly the last syllable we could not imagine what he mean he be equally at a loss to understand how we could be so stupid as not to recognize immediately the well-advertised name of a widely known shoe at maje we observe cotton which be send to the mill at arequipa alfalfa highly prize as fodder for pack animal sugar cane from which aguardiente or white rum be make and grape it be say that the maje vineyard date back to the sixteenth century and that some of the huge bury earthenware wine jar now in use be make as far back as the reign of philip ii the presence of so much wine in the community do not seem to have a deleterious effect on the native who be not only hospitable but energetic -- far more so in fact than the native of town in the high ande where the intense cold and the difficulty of make a living have react upon the indian often cause they to be morose sullen and without ambition the residence of the wine grower be sometimes very mislead a typical country house of the better class be not much to look at its long low flat roof and rough unwhitewashed mud-colored wall give it a unattractive appearance yet to one 's intense surprise the inside may be clean and comfortable with modern furniture a piano and a phonograph we conscientious and hard-working arriero rise at two o'clock the next morning for they know they mule have a long hard climb ahead of they from a elevation of 1000 foot above sea level to 10000 foot after a all-day journey we camp at a place where forage could be obtain we have now leave the region of tropical product and come back to potato and barley the follow day a short ride bring we past another pictographic rock recently blast open by a energetic treasure seeker of chuquibamba this town have 3000 inhabitant and be the capital of the province of condesuyo it be the place which we have select several month before as the rendezvous for the attack on coropuna the climate here be delightful and the fruit and cereal of the temperate zone be easily raise the town be surround by garden vineyard alfalfa and grain field all show evidence of intensive cultivation it be at the head of one of the branch of the maje valley and be surround by high cliff the people of chuquibamba be friendly we be kindly welcome by señor benavide the sub-prefect who hospitably tell we to set up we cot in the grand salon of he own house here we receive call from the local official include the provincial physician dr pastór and the director of the colegio nacional professor alejandro coello the last two be keen to go with we up mt coropuna they tell we that there be a hill near by call the calvario whence the mountain could be see and offer to take we up there we accept think at the same time that this would show who be best fit to join in the climb for we need another man on the rope professor coello easily distance the rest of we and win the coveted place from the calvario hill we have a splendid view of those white solitude whither we be bind now only twenty-five mile away it seem clear that the western or truncate peak which give its name to the mass -lrb- koro = cut off at the top puna = a cold snowy height -rrb- be the highest point of the range and higher than all the eastern peak yet behind the flat-topped dome we could just make out a northerly peak tucker wonder whether or not that might prove to be higher than the western peak which we decide to climb no one know anything about the mountain there be no native guide to be have the wildest opinion be express as to the best route and method of get to the top we finally engage a man who say he know how to get to the foot of the mountain so we call he guide for want of a more appropriate title the peruvian spring be now well advanced and the day be fine and clear it appear however that there have be a heavy snowstorm on the mountain a few day before if summer be come unusually early it behoove we to waste no time and we proceed to arrange the mountain equipment as fast as possible we instrument for determine altitude consist of a special mountain-mercurial barometer make by mr henry j green of brooklyn capable of record only such air pressure as one might expect to find above 12000 foot a hypsometer loan we by the department of terrestrial magnetism of the carnegie institution of washington with thermometer especially make for we by green a large mercurial barometer borrow from the harvard observatory which notwithstanding its rough treatment by mr hinckley 's mule be still do good service and one of green 's sling psychrometer we most serious want be a aneroid in case the fragile mercurial should get break six month previously i have write to j hick the celebrated instrument maker of london ask he to construct with special care two large watkin aneroid capable of record altitude five thousand foot higher than coropuna be suppose to be he reply have never reach I nor do any one in arequipa know anything about the barometer apparently my letter have miscarry it be not until we open we specially order mountain grub box here in chuquibamba that we find alongside of the pemmican and self-heating tin of stew which have be pack for we in london by grace brother the two precious aneroid each as large as a big alarm clock with these two new aneroid make with a wide margin of safety we feel satisfied that once at the summit we should know whether there be a chance that bandelier be right and this be indeed the top of america for exact measurement we depend on topographer hendriksen who be due to triangulate coropuna in the course of he survey along the 73d meridian my chief excuse for go up the mountain be to erect a signal at or near the top which hendriksen could use as a station in order to make he triangulation more exact my real object it must be confess be to enjoy the satisfaction which all alpinist feel of conquer a virgin peak chapter ii climb coropuna the desert plateau above chuquibamba be nearly 2500 foot higher than the town and it be nine o'clock on the morning of October 10th before we get out of the valley thereafter coropuna be always in sight and as we slowly approach it we study it with care the plateau have a elevation of over 15000 foot yet the mountain stand out conspicuously above it coropuna be really a range about twenty mile long its gigantic massif be cover with snow field from one end to the other so deep do the fresh snow lie that it be generally impossible to see where snow field end and glacier begin we could see that of the five well-defined peak the middle one be probably the lowest the two next highest be at the right or eastern end of the massif the culminate truncate dome at the western end with its smooth uneroded side apparently belong to a later volcanic period than the rest of the mountain it seem to be the highest peak of all to reach it do not appear to be difficult rock-covered slope run directly up to the snow snow field without many rock-fall appear to culminate in a saddle at the base of the great snowy dome the eastern slope of the dome itself offer a unbroken if steep path to the top if we could once reach the snow line it look as though with the aid of ice-creeper or snowshoe we could climb the mountain without serious trouble ------ figure mt coropuna from the south ------ between we and the first snow-covered slope however lay more than twenty mile of volcanic desert intersect by deep canyon steep quebrada and very rough aa lava direct by we guide we leave the cotahuasus road and strike across country dodge the lava flow and slowly ascend the gentle slope of the plateau as it become steeper we mule show sign of suffer while wait for they to get they wind we go ahead on foot climb a short rise and to we surprise and chagrin find ourselves on the rim of a steep-walled canyon 1500 foot deep which cut right across in front of the mountain and lay between we and its higher slope after the mule have rest the guide now decide to turn to the leave instead of go straight toward the mountain a dispute ensue as to how much he know even about the foot of coropuna he deny that there be any hut whatever in the canyon abandonado despoblado desierto a waste a solitude a wilderness so he describe it have he be there no señor luckily we have be able to make out from the rim of the canyon two or three hut near a little stream as there be no question that we ought to get to the snow line as soon as possible we decide to dispense with the service of so well-informed a guide and make such way as we could alone the altitude of the rim of the canyon be 16000 foot the mule show sign of acute distress from mountain sickness the arriero begin to complain loudly but do what they could to relieve the mule by punch hole in they ear the theory be that bloodlet be a good thing for soroche as soon as the timid arriero reach a point where they could see down into the canyon they spot some patch of green pasture cheer up a bit and even smile over the dismal ignorance of the guide soon we find a trail which lead to the hut near the hut be a taciturn indian woman who refuse to furnish we with either fuel or forage although we try to pay in advance and offer she silver nevertheless we proceed to pitch we tent and take advantage of the shelter stone wall of she corral for we camp fire after peace have settle down and it become perfectly evident that we be harmless the door of one of the hut open and a indian man appear doubtless the cause of he disappearance before we arrival have be the easily discernible presence in we midst of the brass button of corporal gamarra possibly he who have select this remote corner of the wilderness for he abode have a guilty conscience and at the sight of a gendarme decide that he have better hide at once more probably however he fear the visit of a recruit party since it be quite likely that he have not serve he legal term of military service at all event when he wife discover that we be not look for she man she allow he curiosity to overcome he fear we find that the indian keep a few llama they also make crude pottery firing it with straw and llama dung they live almost entirely on gruel make from chuño frozen bitter potato little else than potato will grow at 14000 foot above the sea for neighbor the indian have a solitary old man who live half a mile up nearer the glacier and a small family a mile and a half down the valley before dark the neighbor come to call and we try we best to persuade the man to accompany we up the mountain and help to carry the load from the point where the mule would have to stop but they decline absolutely and positively i think one of the man might have go but as soon as he quiet well-behaved wife see he waver she break out in a torrent of violent denunciation tell he the mountain would eat he up and that unless he want to go to heaven before he time he have better let well enough alone and stay where he be cieza de leon one of the most careful of the early chronicler -lrb- 1550 -rrb- say that at coropuna the devil talk more freely than usual for some secret reason know to god it be say that devil walk visibly about in that place and that the indian see they and be much terrify i have also hear that these devil have appear to christian in the form of indian perhaps the voluble housewife be herself one of the famous coropuna devil she certainly talk more freely than usual or possibly she think that the coropuna devil be now appear to indian in the form of christian anyhow the indian say that on top of coropuna there be a delightful warm paradise contain beautiful flower luscious fruit parrot of brilliant plumage macaw and even monkey those faithful denizen of hot climate the soul of the depart stop to rest and enjoy themselves in this charming spot on they upward flight like most primitive people who live near snow-capped mountain they have a abject terror of the forbid summit and the snowstorm that seem to come down from they probably the indian hope to propitiate the demon who dwell on the mountain top by invent charming story relate to they abode it be interesting to learn that in the neighbor hamlet of pampacolca the great explorer raimondus in 1865 find the native exile from the civilized world still preserve they primitive custom carry idol to the slope of the great snow mountain coropuna and there offer they as a sacrifice apparently the mountain still inspire fear in the heart of all those who live near it the fact that we agree to pay in advance unheard-of wages ten time the usual amount earn by laborer in this vicinity that we add offer of the precious coca leave the greatly-to-be-desired fire-water the rarely see tobacco and other good thing usually covet by peruvian highlander have no effect in the face of the terror of the mountain they know only too well that snow-blindness be one of the least of ill to be encounter while the advantage of dark-colored glass warm clothes kerosene stove and plenty of good food which we freely offer be far too remote from the realm of credible possibility professor coello understand all these matter perfectly and be able to speak quichua the language of we prospective carrier do he best in the way of argument not only out of loyalty to the expedition but because peruvian gentleman always regard the carrying of a load as extremely undignified and improper i have know one of the most energetic and efficient business man in peru a highly respect gentleman in a mountain city so to dislike be oblige to carry a rolled and unmounted photograph little larger than a lead pencil that he send for a cargador a indian porter to bear it for he as a matter of fact professor coello be perfectly willing to do he share and more but neither he nor we be anxious to climb with heavy pack on we back in the rarefy air of elevation several thousand foot higher than mont blanc the argument with the indian be long and verbose and the offering of money and goods be make more and more generous all be in vain we finally come to realize that whatever supplies and provision be carry up coropuna would have to be bear on we own shoulder that evening the top of the truncate dome which be just visible from the valley near we camp be bath in a roseate alpine glow unspeakably beautiful the air however be very bitter and the neighbor brook freeze solid during the night the gendarme 's mule become homesick and disappear with coello 's horse gamarra be send to look for the stray with order to follow we as soon as possible as no bearer or carrier be to be secure it be essential to persuade the tejada to take they pack mule up as far as the snow a feat they decline to do the mule don pablo say have already go as far as and farther than mule have any business to go soon after reach camp tucker have go off on a reconnaissance he report that there be a path lead out of the canyon up to the llama pasture on the lower slope of the mountain the arriero deny the accuracy of he observation however after a long argument they agree to go as far as there be a good path and no farther there be no question of we ride it be simply a case of get the load as high up as possible before we have to begin to carry they ourselves it may be imagine that the arriero pack very slowly and grudgingly although the load be now considerably reduce finally leave behind we saddle ordinary supplies and everything not consider absolutely necessary for a two week ' stay on the mountain we set off we could easily walk faster than the loaded mule and think it best to avoid trouble by keep far enough ahead so as not to hear the arriero ' constant complaint after a hour of not very hard climb over a fairly good llama trail the tejada stop at the edge of the pasture and shout to we to come back we reply equally vociferously call they to come ahead which they do for half a hour more slowly zigzag up a slope of coarse black volcanic sand then they not only stop but commence to unload the mule it be necessary to rush back and commence a violent and acrimonious dispute as to whether the letter of the contract have be fulfil and the mule have go as far as they could reasonably be expect to go the truth be the tejada be terrify at approach mysterious coropuna they be sure it would take revenge on they by destroy they mule who would certainly die the follow day of soroche we offer a bonus of thirty sole -- fifteen dollar -- if they would go on for another hour and threaten they with all sort of thing if they would not at last they readjust the load and start climb again the altitude be now about 16000 foot but at the foot of a steep little rise the arriero stop again this time they succeed in unload two mule before we could scramble down over the sand and boulder to stop they threat and prayer be now of no avail the only thing that would satisfy be a legal document they demand a agreement in write that in case any mule or mule die as a result of this foolish attempt to get up to the snow line i should pay in gold two hundred sole for each and every mule that die further i must agree to pay a bonus of fifty sole if they would keep climb until noon or until stop by snow this document have be duly draw up by professor coello seat on a lava rock amidst the clinker-like cinder of the old volcano be duly sign and seal in order that there might be no dispute as to the time my best chronometer be hand over to pablo tejada to carry until noon the mule be reload and again the ascent begin presently the mule encounter some pretty bad go on a steep slope cover with huge lava boulder and scoriaceous sand we expect more trouble every minute however the arriero have make a advantageous bargain do they best to carry it out fortunately the mule reach the snow line just fifteen minute before twelve o'clock the tejada lose no time in unload claim they bonus promise to return in ten day and almost before we know it have disappear down the side of the mountain we spend the afternoon establish we base camp we have three tent the mummery a very light and diminutive wall tent about four foot high make by edgington of london a ordinary wall tent 7 by 7 of fairly heavy material with floor sew in and a improve pyramidal tent make by david abercrombie but design by mr tucker after one use on mt mckinley by professor parker tucker 's tent have two opening -- a small vent in the top of the pyramid capable of be close by a adjustable cap in case of storm and a oval entrance through which one have to crawl this opening could be close to any desire extent with a pucker string a fairly heavy waterproof floor measure 7 by 7 be sew to the base of the pyramid so that a single pole without guy rope be all that be necessary to keep the tent upright after the floor have be securely peg to the ground or snow tucker 's tent offer the advantage of be carry without difficulty easily erect by one man readily ventilate and yet give shelter to four man in any weather we propose to leave the wall tent at the base but to take the pyramidal tent with we on the climb we determine to carry the mummery to the top of the mountain to use while take observation the elevation of the base camp be 17300 foot we be surprised and pleased to find that at first we have good appetite and no soroche less than a hundred yard from the wall tent be a small diurnal stream feed by melting snow whenever i go to get water for cooking or wash purpose i notice a startling and rapid rise in pulse and increase shortness of breath my normal pulse be 70 after i walk slowly a hundred foot on a level at this altitude it rise to 120 after i have be seat awhile it drop down to 100 gradually we sense of well-being depart and be follow by a feeling of malaise and general disability there be a splendid sunset but we be too sick and cold to enjoy it that night all sleep badly and have some headache a high wind sweep around the mountain and threaten to carry away both of we tent as we lay awake wonder at what moment we should find ourselves desert by the frail canvas shelter we could not help think that coropuna be give we a fair warning of what might happen higher up ------ figure the base camp coropuna at 17300 foot ------ ------ figure camping at 18450 foot on the slope of coropuna ------ for breakfast we have pemmican hard-tack pea soup and tea we all want plenty of sugar in we tea and drink large quantity of it experience on mt mckinley have lead tucker to believe heartily in the advantage of pemmican a food especially prepare for arctic explorer neither coello nor gamarra nor i have ever taste it before we decide that it be not very palatable on first acquaintance although doubtless of great value when one have to spend long period of time in the arctic where even seal 's blubber be a delicacy as good as cow 's cream i presume we could have do just as well without it it be decide to carry with we from the base enough fuel and supplies to last through any possible misadventure even of a week 's duration account of climb in the high ande be full of failure due to the necessity of the explorer ' be oblige to return to food warmth and shelter before have effect the conquest of a new peak one remember the frequent disappointment that come to such intrepid climber as whymper in ecuador martin conway in bolivium and fitzgerald in chile and argentina due to high wind the sudden advent of terrific snowstorm and the weakness cause by soroche at the cost of carry extra-heavy load we determine to try to avoid be oblige to turn back we could only hope that no unforeseen event would finally defeat we effort tucker decide to establish a cache of food and fuel as far up the mountain side as he and coello could carry fifty pound in a single day 's climb leave I to reset the demoralize tent and do other chore they start off packing load of about twenty-five pound each to I they progress up the mountain side seem extraordinarily slow be they never go to get anywhere they frequent stop seem ludicrous i be to learn later that it be as difficult at a high elevation for one who be not climb to have any sympathy for those suffer from soroche as it be for a sailor to appreciate the sensation of one who be seasick during the morning i set up the barometer and take a series of observation it be pleasant to note that the two new mountain aneroid register exactly alike all the different unit of the cargo that be to be take up the mountain then have to be weigh so that they might be equitably distribute in we load the following day we have two small kerosene stove with primus burner we grub order month before specially for this climb consist of pemmican in 8 1\/4 - pound tin kola chocolate in half-pound tin seed raisin in 1-pound tin cube sugar in 4-pound tin hard-tack in 6 1\/2 - pound tin jam stick of dry pea soup plasmon biscuit tea and a few of silver 's self-heating messtin contain irish stew beef à la mode et al corporal gamarra appear during the day have find he mule which have stray twelve mile down the canyon he do not relish the prospect of climb coropuna but when he see the warm clothes which we have provide for he and learn that he would get a bonus of five gold sovereign on top of the mountain he decide to accept he duty philosophically tucker and coello return in the middle of the afternoon report that there seem to be no serious difficulty in the first part of the climb and that a cache have be establish about 2000 foot above the base camp on a snow field tucker now assign we pack for the morrow and skillfully prepare the tump-line and harness with which we be to carry they notwithstanding a unusual headache which last all day long i still have some appetite we supper consist of pemmican pudding with raisin hard-tack and pea soup which every one be able to eat if not to enjoy that night we sleep better one reason be that the wind do not blow as hard as it have the night before the weather continue fine watkin be due to arrive from arequipa in a day or two but we decide not to wait for he or run any further risk of encounter a early summer snowstorm the next morning after adjust we fifty-pound load to we unaccustomed back we leave camp about nine o'clock we wear appalachian mountain club snow-creeper or crampon heavy scotch mitten knit woolen helmet dark blue snow-glass and very heavy clothing it will be remember by visitor to the zermatt museum that the swiss guide who once climb huascaran in the northern peruvian ande have be maim for life by they experience in the deep snow of those great altitude we determine to take no chance and in order to prevent the possibility of frost-bite each man be order to put on four pair of heavy woolen sock and two or three pair of heavy underdrawer professor coello and corporal gamarra wear large heavy boot i have woolen puttee and arctic overshoe tucker improvise what he regard as highly satisfactory sandal out of feel slipper and piece of a rubber poncho since there seem to be no rock-climbing ahead of we we decide to depend on crampon rather than on the heavy hob-nailed climb boot with which alpinist be familiar the snow be very hard until about one o'clock by three o'clock it be so soft as to make further progress impossible we find that load as we be we could not climb a gentle rise faster than twenty step at a time on the more level snow field we take twenty-five or thirty step before stop to rest at the end of each stint it seem as though they would be the last step we should ever take pant violently fatigue beyond belief and overcome with mountain-sickness we would stop and lean on we ice axis until able to take twenty-five step more it do not take very long to recover one 's wind finally we reach a glacier mark by a network of crevasse none very wide and nearly all cover with snow-bridge we be rope together and although there be a occasional fall no great strain be put on the rope then come great snow field with not a single crevasse for the most part we day be simply a unending succession of stint -- twenty-five step and a rest repeat four or five time and follow by thirty-five step and a longer rest take lie down in the snow we peg along until about half-past two when the rapidly melting snow stop all progress at a altitude of about 18450 foot the tucker tent be pitch on a fairly level snow field we now notice with dismay that the two big aneroid have begin to differ as the sun decline the temperature fall rapidly at half-past five the thermometer stand at 22 ° f during the night the minimum thermometer register 9 ° f we notice a considerable number of lightning flash in the northeast they be not accompany by any thunder but alarm we considerably we fear the expect November storm might be ahead of time we close the tent door on account of a bite wind owe to the ventilate device at the top of the tent we manage to breathe fairly well mountain climber at high altitude have occasionally observe that one of the symptom of acute soroche be a very annoying rack cough as violent as whooping cough and frequently accompany by nausoa we have not experience this at 17000 foot but now it begin to be painfully noticeable and continue during the ensue day and night particularly night until we get back to the indian ' hut again we sleep very poorly and continually awaken one another by cough the next morning we have very little appetite no ambition and a miserable sense of malaise and great fatigue there be nothing for it but to shoulder we pack arrange we tump-line and proceed with the same steady drudgery -- now a little harder than the day before we break camp at half-past seven and by noon have reach a altitude of about 20000 foot on a snow field within a mile of the saddle between the great truncate peak and the rest of the range it look possible to reach the summit in one more day 's climb from here the aneroid now differ by over five hundred foot leave I to pitch the tent the other go back to the cache to bring up some of the supplies due to the fact that we be carry load twice as heavy as those which tucker and coello have first bring up we have not pass they cache until to-day by the time my companion appear again i be so completely rest that i marveled at the snail-like pace they make over the nearly level snow field it seem incredible that they should find it necessary to rest four time after they be within one hundred yard of the camp we be none of we hungry that evening we crave sweet tea before turn in for the night we take the trouble to melt snow and make a potful of tea which could be warm up the first thing in the morning we pass another very bad night the thermometer register 7 ° f but we do not suffer from the cold in fact when you stow away four man on the floor of a 7 by 7 tent they be oblige to sleep so close together as to keep warm furthermore each man have a eiderdown sleeping-bag blanket and plenty of heavy clothes and sweater we do however suffer from soroche violent whooping cough assail we at frequent interval none of we sleep much i amuse myself by count my pulse occasionally only to find that it persistently refuse to go below 120 and if i move would jump up to 135 i do not know where it go on the actual climb so far as i could determine it do not go below 120 for four day and night on the morning of October 15th we get up at three o'clock hot sweet tea be the one thing we all crave the tea-pot be find to be freeze solid although it have be hang up in the tent it take a hour to thaw and the tea be just warm enough for practical purpose when i make a awkward move in the crowded tent and kick over the tea-pot never do man keep they temper better under more aggravating circumstance not a word of reproach or indignation greet my clumsy accident although poor corporal gamarra who be lie on the down side of the tent have to beat a hasty retreat into the colder -lrb- but somewhat drier -rrb- weather outside my clumsiness necessitate a delay of nearly a hour in start while we be melt more frozen snow and re-make the tea we warm up some pea soup and irish stew tucker and i manage to eat a little coello and gamarra have no stomach for anything but tea we decide to leave the tucker tent at the 20000 foot level together with most of we outfit and provision from here to the top we be to carry only such thing as be absolutely necessary they include the mummery tent with peg and pole the mountain-mercurial barometer the two watkin aneroid the hypsometer a pair of zeiss glass two 3a kodak six film a sling psychrometer a prismatic compass and clinometer a stanley pocket level a eighty-foot red-strand mountain rope three ice axis a seven-foot flagpole a american flag and a yale flag in order to avoid disaster in case of storm we also carry four of silver 's self-heating can of irish stew and mock-turtle soup a cake of chocolate and eight hard-tack besides raisin and cube of sugar in we pocket we load weigh about twenty pound each to we great satisfaction and relief the weather continue fine and there be very little wind on the precede afternoon the snow have be so soft one frequently go in over one 's knee but now everything be freeze hard we leave camp at five o'clock it be still dark the great dome of coropuna loom up on we left cut off from direct attack by gigantic ice fall to reach it we must first surmount the saddle on the main ridge from there a apparently unbroken slope extend to the top we progress be distressingly slow even with the light load when we reach the saddle there come a painful surprise to the north of we loom a great snowy cone the peak which we have at first notice from the chuquibamba calvario now it actually look higher than the dome we be about to climb from the sihua desert eighty mile away the dome have certainly seem to be the highest point so we stick to we task although constantly face the possibility that we painful labor might be in vain and that eventually this north peak would prove to be higher we begin to doubt whether we should have strength enough for both loss of sleep soroche and lack of appetite be rapidly undermine we endurance the last slope have a inclination of thirty degree we should have have to cut step with we ice axis all the way up have it not be for we snow-creeper which work splendidly as it be not more than a dozen or fifteen step actually have to be cut even in the steepest part tucker be first on the rope i be second coello third and gamarra bring up the rear we be not a very gay party the high altitude be sap all we ambition i find that a occasional lump of sugar act as the best rapid restorative to sag spirit it be astonishing how quickly the carbon in the sugar be absorb by the system and come to the relief of smolder bodily fire a single cube give new strength and vigor for several minute of course one could not eat sugar without limit but it do help to tide over difficult place we zigzag slowly up hour after hour alternately rest and climb until we be about to reach what seem to be the top obviously alas not as high as we enemy to the north just then tucker give a great shout the rest of we be too much out of breath to ask he why he be waste he strength shout when at last we painfully come to the edge of what look like the summit we see the cause of he joy there immediately ahead of we lay another slope three hundred foot higher than where we be stand it may seem strange that in we weakened condition we should have be glad to find that we have three hundred foot more to climb remember however that all the morning we have be gaze with dread at that aggravate north peak whenever we have have a moment to give to the consideration of anything but the immediate difficulty of we climb we heart have sink within we at the thought that possibly after all we might find the north peak higher the fact that there lay before we another three hundred foot which would undoubtedly take we above the highest point of that aggravate north peak be so very much the less of two possible evil that we understand tucker 's shout yet none of we be lusty enough to echo it with faint smile and renew courage we peg along rest on we ice axis as usual every twenty-five step until at last at half-past eleven after six hour and a half of climb from the 20000-foot camp we reach the culminate point of coropuna as we approach it tucker although naturally much elate at have successfully engineer the first ascent of this great mountain stop and with extraordinary courtesy and self-abnegation smilingly motion I to go ahead in order that the director of the expedition might be actually the first person to reach the culminate point in order to appreciate how great a sacrifice he be willing to make it should be state that he willingness to come on the expedition be due chiefly to a fondness for mountain climbing and he desire to add coropuna to he sheaf of victory greatly as i appreciate he kindness in make way for I i could only acquiesce in so far as to continue the climb by he side we reach the top together and sink down to rest and look about ------ figure the camp on the summit of coropuna elevation 21703 foot ------ ------ figure one of the frequent rest in the ascent of coropuna ------ the truncate summit be a oval-shaped snow field almost flat have a area of nearly half a acre about 100 foot north and south and 175 foot east and west if it once be as we suppose a volcanic crater the pit have long since be fill up with snow and ice there be no rock to be see on the rim -- only the hard crust of the glisten white surface the view from the top be desolate in the extreme we be in the midst of a great volcanic desert dot with isolate peak cover with snow and occasional glacier not a atom of green be to be see anywhere apparently we stand on top of a dead world mountain climber in the ande have frequently speak of see condor at great altitude we see none northwest twenty mile away across the pampa colorada a reddish desert rise snow-capped solimana in the other direction we look along the range of coropuna itself several of the lesser peak be only a few hundred foot below we elevation far to the southwest we imagine we could see the faint blue of the pacific ocean but it be very dim my father be a ardent mountain climber glory not only in the difficulty of the ascent but particularly in the satisfaction come from the magnificent view to be obtain at the top he zeal have lead he once in winter to ascend the highest peak in the pacific mauna kea on hawaius he teach I as a boy to be fond of climb the mountain of oahu and mauus and to be appreciative of the view which could be obtain by such expenditure of effort yet now i could not take the least interest or pleasure in the view from the top of coropuna nor could my companion no sense of satisfaction in have attain a difficult objective cheer we up we all feel greatly depressed and say little although gamarra ask for he bonus and regard the gold coin with grim complacency after we have rest awhile we begin to take observation unsling the aneroid which i have be carry i find to my surprise and dismay that the needle show a height of only 21525 foot above sea level tucker 's aneroid read more than a thousand foot higher 22550 foot but even this fall short of raimondus 's estimate of 22775 foot and considerably below bandelier 's 23000 foot this be a keen disappointment for we have hope that the aneroid would at least show a margin over the altitude of mt aconcagua 22763 foot this discovery serve to dampen we spirit still further we take what comfort we could from the fact that the aneroid which have check each other perfectly up to 17000 foot be now so obviously untrustworthy we could only hope that both might prove to be inaccurate as actually happen and that both might now be read too low anyhow the north peak do look lower than we be to satisfy any doubt on this subject tucker take the wooden box in which we have bring the hypsometer lay it on the snow level it up carefully with the stanley pocket level and take a squint over it toward the north peak he smile and say nothing so each of we in turn lay down in the snow and take a squint it be all right we be at least 250 foot higher than that aggravating peak we be also 450 foot higher than the east peak of coropuna and a thousand foot higher than any other mountain in sight at any rate we should not have to call upon we fast-ebbing strength for any more hard climb in the immediate future after arrive at this satisfactory conclusion we pitch the little mummery tent set up the tripod for the mercurial barometer arrange the boiling point thermometer with its apparatus and with the aid of kodak and notebook proceed to take as many observation as possible in the next four hour at two o'clock we read the mercurial know that at the same hour reading be be make by watkin at the base camp and by the harvard astronomer in the observatory at arequipa the barometer be suspend from a tripod set up in the shade of the tent the mercury which at sea level often stand at 31 inch now stand at 13838 inch the temperature of the thermometer on the barometer be exactly +32 ° f at the same time inside the tent we get the water to boil and take a reading with the hypsometer water boil at sea level at a temperature of 212 ° f here it boil at 174 ° f after take the reading we greedily drink the water which have be heat for the hypsometer we be thirsty enough to have drunk five time as much we be not hungry and make no use of we provision except a few raisin some sugar and chocolate after complete we observation we fasten the little tent as securely as possible banking the snow around it and leave it on top first have place in it one of the appalachian mountain club 's brass record cylinder in which we have seal the yale flag a contemporary map of peru and two brief statement regard the ascent the american flag be leave fly from a nine-foot pole which we plant at the northwest rim of the dome where it could be see from the road to cotahuasus here mr casimir watkin see it a week later and dr isaiah bowman two week later when chief topographer hendriksen arrive three week later to make he survey it have disappear probably a severe storm have blow it over and bury it in the snow we leave the summit at three o'clock and arrive at the 20000 foot camp two hour and fifteen minute later the first part of the way down to the saddle we attempt a glissade then the slope grow steeper and we get up too much speed for comfort so we finally have to be content with a slower method of locomotion that night there be very little wind mountain climber have more to fear from excessively high wind than almost any other cause we be very lucky nothing occur to interfere with the best progress we be physically capable of make it turn out that we do not need to have bring so many supplies with we in fact it be a open question whether we acute mountain-sickness would have permit we to outlast a long storm or leave we enough appetite to use the provision although one do get accustom to high altitude we feel very doubtful no one in the western hemisphere have ever make night camp at 20000 foot or pitch a tent as high as the summit of coropuna the severity of mountain-sickness differ greatly in different locality apparently not depend entirely on the altitude i do not know how long we could have stand it it be difficult to believe that with strength enough to achieve the climb we should have feel as weak and ill as we do that night although we be very weary none of we sleep much the violent whooping cough continue and all of we be nauseated again in the morning we feel so badly and be able to take so little nourishment that it be determine to get to a lower altitude as fast as possible to lighten we load we leave behind some of we supplies we break camp at 9:20 eighteen minute later without have to rest the cache be reach and the few remnant be pick up although many thing have be abandon we load seem heavier than ever we have some difficulty in negotiate the crevasse but gamarra be the only one actually to fall in and he be easily pull out again about noon we hear a faint halloo and finally make out two animated speck far down the mountain side the effect of again see somebody from the outside world be rather curious i have a choke sensation tucker who lead the way tell I long afterward that he could not keep the tear from run down he cheek although we do not see it at the time the speck turn out to be watkin and a indian boy who come up as high as be safe without rope or crampon and relieved we of some weight the base camp be reach at half-past twelve one of the first thing tucker do on return be to weigh all the pack to my surprise and disgust i learn that on the way down tucker afraid that some of we would collapse have carry sixty-one pound and gamarra sixty-four while he have give I only thirty-one pound and the same to coello this of course do not include the weight of we ice-creeper axis or rope the next day all of we feel very tired and drowsy in fact i be almost overcome with inertia it be a fearful task even to lift one 's hand the sun have burn we face terribly we lip be painfully swollen we cough and whoop it seem best to make every effort to get back to a still lower altitude for the mule so we break camp get the load ready without wait put we sleeping-bag and blanket on we back and go rapidly down to the indian ' hut immediately we malaise leave we we feel physically stronger we take deep breath as though we have get back to sea level there be no sensation of oppression on the chest yet we be still actually higher than the top of pike 's peak we could move rapidly about without get out of breath the aggravate whooping cough leave we and we appetite return to be sure we still suffer from the effect of snow and sun on the ascent i have be very thirsty and foolishly have allow myself to eat a considerable amount of snow as a result my tongue be now so extremely sensitive that piece of soda biscuit taste like broken glass corporal gamarra who have be unwilling to keep he snow-glass always in place and think to relieve he eye by frequently dispense with they now suffer from partial snow-blindness the rest of we be spare any inflammation of the eye there follow two day of rest and wait then the smile arriero surprised and delighted at see we alive again after we adventure with coropuna arrive with we mule the tejada give we hearty embrace and promptly go off up to the snow line to get the load the next day we return to chuquibamba in November chief topographer hendriksen complete he survey and find the latitude of coropuna to be 15 ° 31 ' south and the longitude to be 72 ° 42 ' 40 '' west of greenwich he compute its altitude to be 21703 foot above sea level the result of compare the reading of we mercurial barometer take at the summit with the simultaneous reading take at arequipa give practically the same figure there be less than sixty foot difference between the two although coropuna prove to be thirteen hundred foot lower than bandelier 's estimate and a thousand foot lower than the highest mountain in south america still it be a thousand foot higher than the highest mountain in north america while we be glad we be the first to reach the top we all agree we would never do it again chapter iii to parinacocha after a few day in the delightful climate of chuquibamba we set out for parinacocha the flamingo lake of the inca the late sir clement markham literary and historical successor of the author of the conquest of peru have call attention to this unexplored lake in one of the publication of the royal geographical society and have name a bathymetric survey of parinacocha as one of the principal desideratum for future exploration in peru so far as one could judge from the publish map parinacocha although much smaller than titicaca be the largest body of water entirely in peru a thorough search of geographical literature fail to reveal anything regard its depth the only thing that seem to be know about it be that it have no outlet general william miller once british consul general in honolulu who have as a young man assist general san martin in the war for the independence of chile and peru publish he memoirs in london in 1828 during the campaign against the spanish force in peru he have have occasion to see many out-of-the-way place in the interior on one of he rough sketch map he indicate the location of lake parinacocha and note the fact that the water be brackish this statement of general miller 's and the suggestion of sir clement markham that a bathymetric survey of the lake would be a important contribution to geographical knowledge be all that we be able to learn we arriero the tejada have never be to parinacocha but know in a general way its location and be not afraid to try to get there some of they friend have be there and come back alive first however it be necessary for we to go to cotahuasi the capital of the province of antabamba and meet dr bowman and mr hendriksen who have slowly be work they way across the ande from the urubamba valley and who would need a new supply of food-box if they be to complete the geographical reconnaissance of the 73d meridian we route lead we out of the chuquibamba valley by a long hard climb up the steep cliff at its head and then over the gently slope semi-arid desert in a northerly direction around the west flank of coropuna when we stop to make camp that night on the pampa of chumpillo we arriero use dry moss and dung for fuel for the camp fire there be some bunch-grass and there be llama pasture on the plain near we tent be some inca ruin probably the dwelling of a shepherd chief or possibly the remains of a temple describe by cieza de leon -lrb- 1519-1560 -rrb- whose remarkable account of what he see and learn in peru during the time of the pizarro be very highly regard he say that among the five most important temple in the land of the inca be one much venerated and frequent by they name coropuna it be on a very lofty mountain which be cover with snow both in summer and winter the king of peru visit this temple make present and offering it be hold for certain -lrb- by treasure hunter -rrb- that among the gift offer to this temple there be many load of silver gold and precious stone bury in place which be now unknown the indian conceal another great sum which be for the service of the idol and of the priest and virgin who attend upon it but as there be great mass of snow people do not ascend to the summit nor be it know where these be hide this temple possess many flock farm and service of indian no one live here now but there be many flock and llama and not far away we see ancient storehouse and burial place that night we suffer from intense cold and be keep awake by the bitter wind which sweep down from the snow field of coropuna and shake the wall of we tent violently the next day we cross two small oasis little gulch water from the melting snow of coropuna here there be a abundance of peat and some small gnarled tree from which chuquibamba derive part of its fuel supply we climb slowly around the lower spur of coropuna into a bleak desert wilderness of lava block and scoriaceous sand the red desert or pampa colorada it be for the most part between 15000 and 16000 foot above sea level and be bound on the northwest by the canyon of the rio arma 2000 foot deep where we make we camp and pass a more agreeable night the follow morning we climb out again on the farther side of the canyon and skirt the eastern slope of mt solimana soon the trail turn abruptly to the leave away from we old friend coropuna we wonder how long ago we mountain be a active volcano to-day less than two hundred mile south of here be live peak like el mistus and ubina which still smolder occasionally and have be know in the memory of man to give forth great shower of cinder cover a wide area possibly not so very long ago the great truncate peak of coropuna be form by a last flickering of the ancient fire dr bowman say that the greater part of the vast accumulation of lava and volcanic cinder in this vicinity go far back to a period precede the last glacial epoch the enormous amount of erosion that have take place in the adjacent canyon and the great number of stratum compose of lava flow lay bare by the mighty stream of the glacial period all point to this conclusion my saddle mule be one of those cantankerous beast that be gentle enough as long as they be allow to have they own way in she case this mean that she be happy only when go along close to she friend in the caravan if rein in while i take some note she become very restive finally whirling around plunge and kick contrariwise no amount of spur or lash with a stout quirt avail to make she go ahead of she comrade this morning i be particularly anxious to get a picture of we pack train jogging steadily along over the desert directly away from coropuna since my mule would not gallop ahead i have to dismount run a couple of hundred yard ahead of the rapidly advance animal and take the picture before they reach I we be now at a elevation of 16000 foot above sea level yet to my surprise and delight i find that it be relatively as easy to run here as anywhere so accustomed have my lung and heart become to very rarefy air have i attempt such a strenuous feat at a similar altitude before climb coropuna it would have be physically impossible any one who have try to run two hundred yard at three mile above sea level will understand we be still in a very arid region mostly coarse black sand and pebble with typical desert shrub and occasional bunch of tough grass the slope of mt solimana on we leave be fairly well cover with sparse vegetation among the bush we see a number of vicuñas the smallest wild camel of the new world we try in vain to get near enough for a photograph they be extremely timid and scamper away before we be within three hundred yard seven or eight mile more of very gradual downward slope bring we suddenly and unexpectedly to the brink of a magnificent canyon the densely populated valley of cotahuasus the wall of the canyon be cover with innumerable terrace -- thousand of they it seem at first glance as though every available spot in the canyon have be either terraced or allotted to some compact little village one could count more than a score of town include cotahuasus itself its long main street outline by whitewashed house as we zigzag down into the canyon we road lead we past hundred of the artificial terrace and through little village of thatched hut huddle together on spur rescue from the all-embracing agriculture after spend several week in a desert region where only the narrow valley bottom show any sign of cultivation it seem marvelous to observe the extent to which terracing have be carry on the side of the cotahuasus valley although we be now in the zone of light annual rain it be evident from the extraordinary irrigation system that agriculture here depend very largely on ability to bring water down from the great mountain in the interior most of the terrace and irrigation canal be build century ago long before the discovery of america no part of the ancient civilization of peru have be more admire than the development of agriculture mr cook say that there be no part of the world in which more pain have be take to raise crop where nature make it hard for they to be plant in other country to be sure we find reclamation project where irrigation canal serve to bring water long distance to be use on arid but fruitful soil we also find great fertilizer factory turn out accord to proper chemical formulum the need constituent to furnish impoverished soil with the necessary material for plant growth we find man overcome many obstacle in the way of transportation in order to reach great region where nature have provide fertile field and make it easy to raise life-giving crop nowhere outside of peru either in historic or prehistoric time do one find farmer spend incredible amount of labor in actually create arable field besides bring the water to irrigate they and the guano to fertilize they yet that be what be do by the ancient highlander of peru as they spread over a country in which the arable flat land be usually at so great a elevation as to be suitable for only the hardiest of root crop like the white potato and the oca they be drive to use narrow valley bottom and steep though fertile slope in order to raise the precious maize and many of the other temperate and tropical plant which they domesticate for food and medicinal purpose they be constantly confront by a extraordinary scarcity of soil in the valley bottom torrential river meander from side to side be engage in a endless endeavor to tear away the arable land and bear it off to the sea the slope of the valley be frequently so very steep as to discourage the most ardent modern agriculturalist the farmer might wake up any morning to find that a heavy rain during the night have wash away a large part of he carefully plant field consequently there be develop through the century a series of stone-faced andene terrace or platform examination of the ancient andene disclose the fact that they be not make by simply hoe in the earth from the hillside back of a carefully construct stone wall the space back of the wall be first fill in with coarse rock clay and rubble then follow smaller rock pebble and gravel which would serve to drain the subsoil finally on top of all this and to a depth of eighteen inch or so be lay the finest soil they could procure the result be the best possible field for intensive cultivation it seem absolutely unbelievable that such a immense amount of pain should have be take for such relatively small result the need must have be very great in many case the terrace be only a few foot wide although hundred of yard in length usually they follow the natural contour of the valley sometimes they be two hundred yard wide and a quarter of a mile long to-day corn barley and alfalfa be grow on the terrace cotahuasus itself lie in the bottom of the valley a pleasant place where one can purchase the most fragrant and highly prize of all peruvian wine the climate be agreeable and have attract many landlord whose estate lie chiefly on the bleak plateau of the surround highland where shepherd tend flock of llama sheep and alpaca we be cordially welcome by señor viscarra the sub-prefect and invite to stay at he house he be a stranger to the locality and as the visible representative of a powerful and far-away central government be none too popular with some of the people of he province very few resident of a provincial capital like cotahuasus have ever be to lima -- probably not a single member of the lima government have ever be to cotahuasus consequently one could not expect to find much sympathy between the two the difficulty of travel in peru be so great as to discourage pleasure trip with we letter of introduction and the telegram that have precede we from the prefect at arequipa we be know to be friend of the government and so be doubly welcome to the sub-prefect by nature a kind and generous man of more than usual education and intelligence señor viscarra show himself most courteous and hospitable to we in every particular in we honor he call together he friend they bring picture of theodore roosevelt and elihu root and make a large american flag a courtesy we deeply appreciate even if the flag do have only thirty-six star finally they give we a splendid banquet as a tribute of friendship for america one day the sub-prefect offer to have he personal barber attend we it be some time since mr tucker and i have see a barber-shop the chance be that we should find none at parinacocha consequently we accept with pleasure when the barber arrive closely guard by a gendarme arm with a loaded rifle we learn that he be a convict from the local jail i do not like to ask the nature of he crime but he look like a murderer when he unwrap a ancient pair of clipper from a unspeakably soil and oily rag i wish i be in a position to decline to place myself under he ministration the sub-prefect however have be so kind and be so apologetic as to the inconvenience of the barber-shop that there be nothing for it but to go bravely forward although it be unpleasant to have one 's hair trim by a uncertain pair of rusty clipper i could not help experience a feeling of relief that the convict do not have a pair of shears he be work too near my jugular vein finally the period of torture come to a end and the prisoner accept he fee with a profound salutation we breathe sigh of relief not unmixed with sympathy as we see he march safely away by the gendarme we have arrive in cotahuasus almost simultaneously with dr bowman and topographer hendriksen they have encounter extraordinary difficulty in carry out the reconnaissance of the 73d meridian but be now past the worst of it they supplies be exhaust so those which we have bring from arequipa be doubly welcome mr watkin be assign to assist mr hendriksen and a few day later dr bowman start south to study the geology and geography of the desert he take with he as escort corporal gamarra who be only too glad to escape from the machination of he enemy it will be remember that it be gamarra who have successfully defend the cotahuasus barracks and jail at the time of a revolutionary riot which occur some month previous to we visit the sub-prefect accompany dr bowman out of town for gamarra 's sake they leave the house at three o'clock in the morning and we generous host agree to ride with they until daybreak in he important monograph the ande of southern peru dr bowman write : at four o'clock we whisper arrangement be make we open the gate noiselessly and we small cavalcade hurry through the pitch-black street of the town the soldier ride ahead he rifle across he saddle and directly behind he ride the sub-prefect and myself the pack mule be in the rear we have almost reach the end of the street when a door open suddenly and a shower of spark fly out ahead of we instantly the soldier strike spur into he mule and turn into a side street the sub-prefect draw he horse back savagely and when the next shower of spark fly out push I against the wall and whisper ` for god 's sake who be it ' then suddenly he shout ` stop blow stop blow ' the cause of all the disturbance be a shabby hard-working tailor who have get up at this unearthly hour to start he day 's work by press clothes for some insistent customer he have in he hand a ancient smoothing-iron fill with live coal on which he have be vigorously blow hence the spark that a penitent tailor and he ancient goose should have be able to cause such terrific excitement at that hour in the morning would have interested we own oliver wendell holme who be fond of refer to this picturesque apparatus and who might have write a appropriate essay on the goose that startle the soldier of cotahuasus with particular reference to he be a possible namesake of the goose that arouse the soldier of ancient rome ------ figure the sub-perfect of cotahuasus he military aide and messr tucker hendriksen bowman and bingham inspect the local rug-weaving industry ------ the most unusual industry of cotahuasus be the weave of rug and carpet on vertical hand loom the local carpet weaver make the warp and woof of woolen yarn in which loop of alpaca wool black gray or white be insert to form the desire pattern the loop be cut so as to form a deep pile the result be a delightfully thick warm gray rug ordinarily the native peruvian rug have no pile probably the industry be bring from europe by some spaniard century ago it seem to be restricted to this remote region the rug maker be a small group of indian who live outside the town but who carry they hand loom from house to house as require it be the custom for the person who desire a rug to buy the wool supply the pattern furnish the weaver with board lodging coca tobacco and wine and watch the rug grow from day to day under the shelter of he own roof the rug weaver be very clever in copy new pattern through the courtesy of señor viscarra we eventually receive several small rug weave especially for we from monogram design draw by mr hendriksen early one morning in November we say good-bye to we friendly host and direct by a picturesque old guide who say he know the road to parinacocha we leave cotahuasus the highway cross the neighbor stream on a treacherous-looking bridge the central pier of which be build of the crudest kind of masonry pile on top of a gigantic boulder in midstream the main arch of the bridge consist of two long log across which have be throw a quantity of brush hold down by earth and stone there be no rail on either side but we mule have cross bridge of this type before and make little trouble on the northern side of the valley we ride through a compact little town call mungus and begin to climb out of the canyon pass hundred of very fine artificial terrace at present use for crop of maize and barley in one place we road lead we by a little waterfall a altogether surprising and unexpected phenomenon in this arid region investigation however prove that it be artificial as well as the field its presence may be due to a temporary connection between the upper and lower level of ancient irrigation canal hour after hour we pack train painfully climb the narrow rocky zigzag trail the climate be favorable for agriculture wherever the side of the canyon be not absolutely precipitous stone-faced terrace and irrigation have transform they long ago into arable field four thousand foot above the valley floor we come to a very fine series of beautiful terrace on a shelf near the top of the canyon we pitch we tent near some rough stone corral use by shepherd whose flock graze on the lofty plateau beyond and near a tiny brook which be partly freeze over the next morning we camp be at a elevation of 14500 foot above the sea near by be turreted rock curious result of wind-and-sand erosion the next day we enter a region of mountain pasture we pass occasional swamp and little pool of snow water from one of these we turn and look back across the great cotahuasus canyon to the glacier of solimana and snow-clad coropuna now grow fainter and fainter as we go toward parinacocha at a altitude of 16500 foot we strike across a great barren plateau cover with rock and sand -- hardly a living thing in sight in the midst of it we come to a beautiful lake but it be not parinacocha on the plateau it be intensely cold occasionally i dismount and jog along beside my mule in order to keep warm again i notice that as the result of my experience on coropuna i suffer no discomfort nor any symptom of mountain-sickness even after trot steadily for four or five hundred yard in the afternoon we begin to descend from the plateau toward lampa and find ourselves in the pasture land of ajochiucha where ichu grass and other little foliage plant water by rain and snow furnish forage for large flock of sheep llama and alpaca they owner live in the cultivate valley but the indian herdsman must face the storm and pierce wind of the high pasture alpaca be usually timid on this occasion however possibly because they be thirsty and be seek water hole in the upper course of a little swale they stop and allow I to observe they closely the fleece of the alpaca be one of the softest in the world however due to the fact that shrewd tradesman find that the fabric manufacture from alpaca wool be highly desire many year ago give the name to a far cheaper fabric the alpaca of commerce a material use for coat lining umbrella and thin warm-weather coat be a fabric of cotton and wool with a hard surface and generally dye black it usually contain no real alpaca wool at all and be fairly cheap the real alpaca wool which come into the market to-day be not so call long and silky straighter than the sheep 's wool it be strong small of fiber very soft pliable and elastic it be capable of be weave into fabric of great beauty and comfort many of the silky fluffy knit garment that command the highest price for winter wear and which be call by various name such as vicuña camel 's hair etc be really make of alpaca the alpaca like its cousin the llama be probably domesticate by the early peruvian from the wild guanaco largest of the camel of the new world the guanaco still exist in a wild state and be always of uniform coloration llama and alpaca be extremely variegate the llama have so coarse a hair that it be seldom weave into cloth for wear apparel although heavy blanket make from it be in use by the native breed to be a beast of burden the llama be accustom to the presence of stranger and be not any more timid of they than we horse and cow the alpaca however require better and scarcer forage -- short tender grass and plenty of water -- frequent the most remote and lofty of the mountain pasture be handle only when the fleece be remove seldom see any one except the peaceful shepherd and be extremely shy of stranger although not nearly as timid as its distant cousin the vicuña i shall never forget the first time i ever see some alpaca they look for all the world like the woolly-dog of we toy shop -- woolly along the neck right up to the eye and woolly along the leg right down to the invisible wheel there be something inexpressibly comic about these long-legged animal they look like toy on wheel but actually they can gallop like cow the llama with far less hair on head neck and leg be also amusing but in a different way he expression be haughty and supercilious in the extreme he usually look as though he presence near one be due to circumstance over which he really have no control pride of race and excessive haughtiness lead he to carry he head so high and he neck so stiffly erect that he can be corral with other of he kind by a single rope pass around the neck of the entire group yet he can be buy for ten dollar on the pasture land of ajochiucha there be many ewe and lamb both of llama and alpaca even the shepherd be mostly child more timid than they charge they crouch inconspicuously behind rock and shrub endeavor to escape we notice about five o'clock in the afternoon on a dry pampa we find the ruin of one of the largest known inca storehouse chichipampa a interesting reminder of the day when benevolent despot rule the ande and like the pharaoh of old provide against possible famine the locality be not occupy yet near by be populous valley as soon as we leave we camp the next morning we come abruptly to the edge of the lampa valley this be another of the mile-deep canyon so characteristic of this region we pack mule grunt and groan as they pick they way down the corkscrew trail it overhang the mud-colored indian town of colta a rather scatter collection of a hundred or more hut here again as in the cotahuasus valley be hundred of ancient terrace extend for thousand of foot up the side of the canyon many of they be badly out of repair but those near colta be still be use for raise crop of corn potato and barley the uncultivated spot be cover with cactus thorn bush and the gnarled stunt tree of a semi-arid region in the town itself be half a dozen specimen of the australian eucalyptus that agreeable and extraordinarily successful colonist which one encounter not only in the heart of peru but in the ande of colombium and the new forest preserve of californium and the hawaiian island ------ figure inca storehouse at chinchipampa near colta ------ colta have a few two-storied house with tiled roof some of they have open veranda on the second floor -- a sure indication that the climate be at time comfortable they wall be build of sun-dried adobe and so be the wall of the little grass-thatched hut of the majority judge by the rather irregular plan of the street and the great number of terrace in and around town one may conclude that colta go far back of the sixteenth century and the day of the spanish conquest as indeed do most peruvian town the city of lima and arequipa be noteworthy exception leave colta we wind around the base of the project ridge on the side of which be many evidence of ancient culture and come into the valley of huancahuanca a large arid canyon the guide say that we be near parinacocha not many mile away across two canyon be a snow-capped peak sarasara lampa the chief town in the huancahuanca canyon lie on a great natural terrace of gravel and alluvium more than a thousand foot above the river part of the terrace seem to be irrigated and under cultivation it be propose by the energetic farmer at the time of we visit to enlarge the system of irrigation so as to enable they to cultivate a larger part of the pampa on which they live in fact the new irrigation scheme be actually in process of be carry out and have probably long since be complete we reception in lampa be not cordial it will be remember that we military escort corporal gamarra have go back to arequipa with dr bowman we two excellent arriero the tejada brother declare they prefer to travel without any brass button so we have not ask the sub-prefect of cotahuasus to send one of he small handful of gendarme along with we probably this be a mistake unless one be travel in peru on some easily understand matter such as prospect for mine or represent one of the great import and commission house or actually peddle goods one can not help arouse the natural suspicion of a people to whom travel on muleback for pleasure be unthinkable and scientific exploration for its own sake be incomprehensible of course if the explorer arrive accompany by a gendarme it be perfectly evident that the enterprise have the approval and probably the financial backing of the government it be surmise that the explorer be well pay and what would be otherwise inconceivable become merely one of the ordinary experience of life south american government almost without exception be paternalistic and they citizen be lead to expect that all measure connect with research whether it be scientific economic or social be to be conduct by the government and pay for out of the national treasury individual enterprise be not encourage during all my precede exploration in peru i have have such a easy time that i not only forget but fail to realize how often a ever-present gendarme provide through the courtesy of president leguium 's government have quiet suspicion and assure we a cordial welcome now however when without a gendarme we enter the smart little town of lampa we find ourselves immediately and unquestionably the object of extreme suspicion and distrust yet we could not help admire the well-swept street freshly whitewash house and general air of prosperity and enterprise the gobernador of the town live on the main street in a red-tiled house whose courtyard and colonnade be probably two hundred year old he have hear nothing of we undertaking from the government he friend urge he to take some hostile action fortunately we arriero respectable man of high grade although stranger in lampa be able to allay he suspicion temporarily we be not place under arrest although i be sure he action be not approve by the very suspicious town councilor who find it far easier to suggest reason for we be fugitive from justice than to understand the real object of we journey the very fact that we be bind for lake parinacocha a place well know in lampa add to they suspicion it seem that lampa be famous for its weaver who utilize the wool of the countless herd of sheep alpaca and vicuñas in this vicinity to make poncho and blanket of high grade much desire not only in this locality but even in arequipa these be market as so often happen in the outlying part of the world at a great annual fair attend by trader who come hundred of mile bring the manufacture article of the outer world and seek the highly desire product of these secluded town the great fair for this vicinity have be hold for untold generation on the shore of lake parinacocha every one be anxious to attend the fair which be a occasion for see one 's friend a opportunity for jollification carousing and general enjoyment -- like a large county fair at home except for this annual fair week the basin of parinacocha be as bleak and desolate as we own fair-grounds with scarcely a house to be see except those that be use for the purpose of the fair have we be bind for parinacocha at the proper season nothing could have be more reasonable and praiseworthy why anybody should want to go to parinacocha during one of the other fifty-one week in the year be utterly beyond the comprehension or understanding of these village worthy so to we selectman be the idiosyncrasy of itinerant gypsy who wish to camp in we desert fair-grounds the tejada be not anxious to spend the night in town -- probably because accord to we contract the cost of feed the mule devolve entirely upon they and fodder be always far more expensive in town than in the country it be just as well for we that this be so for i be sure that before morning the village gossip would have persuade the gobernador to arrest we as it be however he be pleasant and hospitable and considerably amuse at the embarrassment of a indian woman who be weave at a hand loom in he courtyard and whom we desire to photograph she could not easily escape for she be sit on the ground with one end of the loom fasten around she waist the other end tie to a eucalyptus tree so she cover she eye and mouth with she hand and almost weep with mortification at we strange procedure peruvian indian woman be invariably extremely shy rarely like to be photograph and be anxious only to escape observation and notice the lady of the gobernador 's own family however of mixed spanish and indian ancestry not only have no objection to be photograph but be move to unseemly and unsympathetic laughter at the predicament of they unfortunate sister after leave lampa we find ourselves on the best road that we have see in a long time its excellence be undoubtedly due to the enterprise and energy of the people of this pleasant town one might expect that citizen who keep they town so clean and neat and be engage in the unusual act of construct new irrigation work would have a comfortable road in the direction toward which they usually would wish to go namely toward the coast as we climb out of the huancahuanca valley we notice no evidence of ancient agricultural terrace either on the side of the valley or on the alluvial plain which have give rise to the town of lampa and whose product have make its people well feed and energetic the town itself seem to be of modern origin one wonder why there be so few if any evidence of the ancient régime when there be so many a short distance away in colta and the valley around it one can not believe that the inca would have overlook such a fine agricultural opportunity as a extensive alluvial terrace in a region where there be so little arable land possibly the very excellence of the land and its relative flatness render artificial terracing unnecessary in the mind of the ancient people who live here on the other hand it may have be occupy until late inca time by one of the coast tribe whatever the cause certainly the deep canyon of huancahuanca divide two very different region to come in a few hour from thickly terraced colta to unterraced lampa be so striking as to give we cause for thought and speculation it be well know that in the early day before the inca conquest of peru not so very long before the spanish conquest there be marked difference between the tribe who inhabit the high plateau and those who live along the shore of the pacific they pottery be as different as possible in design and ornamentation the architecture of they city and temple be absolutely distinct relative abundance of flat land never lead they to develop terracing to the same extent that the mountain people have do perhaps on this alluvial terrace there live a remnant of the coastal people excavation would show scarcely have we climb out of the valley of huancahuanca and surmount the ridge when we come in sight of more artificial terrace beyond a broad deep valley rise the extinct volcanic cone of mt sarasara now relatively close at hand its lower slope separate from we by another canyon snow lay in the gulch and ravine near the top of the mountain we road run near the town of pararca and colcabamba the latter much like colta a straggle village of thatched hut surround by hundred of terrace the vegetation on the valley slope indicate occasional rain near pararca we pass field of barley and wheat grow on old stone-faced terrace on every hand be sign of a fairly large population engage in agriculture utilize field which have be carefully prepare for they by they ancestor they be not use all however we notice hundred of terrace that do not appear to have be under cultivation recently they may have be lie fallow temporarily we arriero avoid the little town and select a camp site on the roadside near the finca rodadero after all when one have a comfortable tent good food and skillful arriero it be far pleasanter to spend the night in the clean open country even at a elevation of 12000 or 13000 foot than to be surround by the smell and noise of a indian town the next morning we go through some wheat field past the town of puyusca another large indian village of thatched adobe house place high on the shoulder of a rocky hill so as to leave the best arable land available for agriculture it be in a shallow well-watered valley full of spring the appearance of the country have change entirely since we leave cotahuasus the desert and its steep-walled canyon seem to be far behind we here be a region of gently slope hill cover with terrace where the cereal of the temperate zone appear to be easily grow finally leave the grain field we climb up to a shallow depression in the low range at the head of the valley and find ourselves on the rim of a great upland basin more than twenty mile across in the center of the basin be a large oval lake its border be pink the water in most of the lake be dark blue but near the shore the water be pink a light salmon-pink what could give it such a curious color nothing but flamingo countless thousand of flamingo -- parinacocha at last chapter iv flamingo lake the parinacocha basin be at a elevation of between 11500 and 12000 foot above sea level it be about 150 mile northwest of arequipa and 170 mile southwest of cuzco and enjoy a fair amount of rainfall the lake be feed by spring and small stream in past geological time the lake then very much larger have a outlet not far from the town of puyusca at present parinacocha have no visible outlet it be possible that the large spring which we notice as we come up the valley by puyusca may be feed from the lake on the other hand we find numerous small spring on the very border of the lake generally occur in swampy hillock -- build up perhaps by mineral deposit -- three or four foot higher than the surround plain there be very old beach mark well above the shore the native tell we that in the wet season the lake be considerably higher than at present although we could find no recent evidence to indicate that it have be much more than a foot above its present level nevertheless a rise of a foot would enlarge the area of the lake considerably when make preparation in new haven for the bathymetric survey of lake parinacocha suggest by sir clement markham we find it impossible to discover any indication in geographical literature as to whether the depth of the lake might be ten foot or ten thousand foot we decide to take a chance on its not be more than ten hundred foot with the kind assistance of mr george bassett i secure a thousand foot of stout fish line know to angler as 24 thread wound on a large wooden reel for convenience in handle while we be at chuquibamba mr watkin have spend many weary hour insert one hundred and sixty-six white and red cloth marker at six-foot interval in the strand of this heavy line so that we might be able more rapidly to determine the result in fathom arrive at a low peninsula on the north shore of the lake tucker and i pitch we camp send we mule back to puyusca for fodder and set up the acme folding boat which we have bring so many mile on muleback for the sound operation the acme prove easy to assemble although this be we first experience with it its lightness enable it to be float at the edge of the lake even in very shallow water and its rigidity be much appreciate in the late afternoon when the high wind raise a vicious little sea rowing out on water which we be tell by the native have never before be navigate by craft of any kind i begin to take sounding lake titicaca be over nine hundred foot deep it would be aggravate if lake parinacocha should prove to be over a thousand for i have bring no extra line even nine hundred foot would make sound slow work and the lake cover a area of over seventy square mile it be with mixed feeling of trepidation and expectation that i row out five mile from shore and make a sound hold the large reel firmly in both hand i cast the lead overboard the reel give a turn or two and stop something be wrong the line do not run out be the reel stick no the apparatus be in perfect run order then what be the matter the bottom be too near alas for all the pain that mr bassett have take to put a thousand foot of the best strong 24-thread line on one reel alas for mr watkin and he patient insertion of one hundred and sixty-six fathom-marker the bottom of the lake be only four foot away from the bottom of my boat after three or four day of strenuous rowing up and down the eighteen mile of the lake 's length and back and forth across the seventeen mile of its width i never succeed in wet watkin 's first marker several hundred sounding fail to show more than five foot of water anywhere possibly if we have come in the rainy season we might at least have wet one marker but at the time of we visit -lrb- November 1911 -rrb- the lake have a maximum depth of 4 1\/2 foot the satisfaction of make this slight contribution to geographic knowledge be i fear lose in the chagrin of not find a really noteworthy body of water who would have think that so long a lake could be so shallow however my feeling be soothe by remember the story of the captain of a man-of-war who be once tell that the salt lake near one of the red hill between honolulu and pearl harbor be report by the native to be bottomless he order one of the ship 's heavy boat to be carry from the shore several mile inland to the salt lake at great expenditure of strength and labor the story tell I in my boyhood do not say how much sound line be bring anyhow they find this fathomless body of water to be not more than fifteen foot deep notwithstanding my disappointment at the depth of parinacocha i be very glad that we have bring the little folding boat for it enable I to float gently about among the myriad of bird which use the shallow water of the lake as a favorite feeding ground pink flamingo white gull small diver large black duck sandpiper black ibis teal duck and large goose on the bank be ground owl and woodpecker it be not surprising that the native should have name this body of water parinacocha -lrb- parina = flamingo cocha = lake -rrb- the flamingo be here in incredible multitude they far outnumber all other bird and as i have say actually make the shallow water of the lake look pink fortunately they have not be hunt for they plumage and be not timid after two day of familiarity with the boat they be willing to let I approach within twenty yard before finally take wing the color in this land of drab gray and brown be a delight to the eye the head be white the beak black the neck white shade into salmon-pink the body pinkish white on the back the breast white and the tail salmon-pink the wing be salmon-pink in front but the tip and the under-part be black as they stand or wade in the water they general appearance be chiefly pink-and-white when they rise from the water however the black under-part of the wing become strikingly conspicuous and cause a flock of fly flamingo to be a wonderful contrast in black-and-white when fly the flamingo seem to keep he head move steadily forward at a even pace although the ropelike neck undulate with the slow beating of the wing i could not be sure that it be not a optical delusion nevertheless i think the heavy body be propel irregularly while the head move forward at uniform speed the difference be catch up in the undulation of the neck ------ figure flamingo on lake parinacocha and mt sarasara ------ the flamingo be a amusing bird to watch with its haughty roman nose and long ropelike neck which it coil and twist in a most incredible manner it seem specially intend to distract one 's mind from bathymetric disappointment its hoarse croak what be it what be it seem to express deep-throated sympathy with the sound operation on one bright moonlight night the flamingo be very noisy keep up a continual clatter of very hoarse what-is-it 's apparently they fail to find out the answer in time to go to bed at the proper time for next morning we find they all sound asleep standing in quiet bay with they head tuck under they wing during the course of the forenoon when the water be quiet they wade far out into the lake in the afternoon as wind and wave arise they come in nearer the shore but seldom leave the water the great extent of shallow water in parinacocha offer they a splendid wide feeding ground we wonder where they all come from apparently they do not breed here although there be thousand and thousand of bird we could find no flamingo nest either old or new search as we would it offer a most interesting problem for some enterprising biological explorer probably mr frank chapman will some day solve it next in number to the flamingo be the beautiful white gull -lrb- or tern -rrb- look strangely out of place in this andean lake 11500 foot above the sea they usually keep together in flock of several hundred there be quantity of small black diver in the deeper part of the lake where the flamingo do not go the diver be very quick and keen true individualist operate alone and show astonishing ability in swim long distance under water the large black duck be much more fearless than the flamingo and be willing to swim very near the canoe when frighten they race over the water at a tremendous pace use both wing and foot in they effort to escape these duck keep in large flock and be about as common as the small diver here and there in the lake be a few tiny little island each contain a single desert nest possibly belong to a ibis or a duck in the bank of a low stream near we first camp be hole make by woodpecker who in this country look in vain for tree and telegraph pole occasionally a mile or so from shore my boat would startle a great amphibious ox standing in the water up to he middle calmly eat the succulent water grass to secure it he have to plunge he head and neck well under the surface while i be raise blister and frightening ox and flamingo mr tucker triangulate the parinacocha basin make the first accurate map of this vicinity as he carry he theodolite from point to point he often stir up little ground owl who gaze at he with solemn reproachful look and they be not the only individual to regard he activity with suspicion and dislike part of my work be to construct signal station by pile rock at conspicuous point on the well-rounded hill so as to enable the triangulation to proceed as rapidly as possible during the night some of these signal station would disappear tear down by the superstitious shepherd who live in scatter cluster of hut and decline to have strange god set up in they vicinity perhaps they think they pasture be be preempt we see hundred of they sheep and cattle feed on flat land formerly the bed of the lake the hill of the parinacocha basin be bare of tree and offer some pasturage in some place they be cover with broken rock the grass be keep closely crop by the degenerate descendant of sheep bring into the country during spanish colonial day they be small in size and mostly white in color although there be many black one we be tell that the sheep be worth about fifty cent apiece here on we first arrival at parinacocha we be leave severely alone by the shepherd but two day later curiosity slowly overcome they shyness and a group of young shepherd and shepherdess gradually bring they grazing flock nearer and nearer the camp in order to gaze stealthily on these strange visitor who live in a cloth house actually move over the forbid water of the lake and busy themselves from day to day with strange magic raising and lower a glittering glass eye on a tripod the woman wear dress of heavy material the skirt reach halfway from knee to ankle in lieu of hat they have small variegated shawl make on hand loom fold so as to make a pointed bonnet over the head and protect the neck and shoulder from sun and wind each woman be busily spin with a hand spindle but carry she baby and its gear and blanket in a hammock or sling attach to a tump-line that go over she head these sling carry-all be neatly weave of soft wool and decorate with attractive pattern both woman and boy be barefoot the boy wear old feel hat of native manufacture and coat and long trousers much too large for they at one end of the upland basin rise the graceful cone of mt sarasara the view of its snow-capped peak reflect in the glassy water of the lake in the early morning be one long to be remembered sarasara must once have be much higher than it be at present its volcanic cone have be sharply erode by snow and ice in the day of its greater altitude and consequently wider snow field the melting snow probably serve to make parinacocha a very much larger body of water although we be here at the beginning of summer the wind that come down from the mountain at night be very cold we minimum thermometer register 22 ° f near the bank of the lake at night nevertheless there be only a very thin film of ice on the border of the lake in the morning and except in the most shallow bay there be no ice visible far from the bank the temperature of the water at 10:00 be near the shore and ten inch below the surface be 61 ° f while farther out it be three or four degree warmer by noon the temperature of the water half a mile from shore be 675 ° f shortly after noon a strong wind come up from the coast stir up the shallow water and cool it soon afterwards the temperature of the water begin to fall and although the hot sun be shine brightly almost directly overhead it go down to 65 ° by 2:30 pm the water of the lake be brackish yet we be able to make we camp on the bank of small stream of sweet water although in each case near the shore of the lake a specimen of the water take near the shore be bring back to new haven and analyze by dr george s jamieson of the sheffield scientific school he find that it contain small quantity of silica iron phosphate magnesium carbonate calcium carbonate calcium sulphate potassium nitrate potassium sulphate sodium borate sodium sulphate and a considerable quantity of sodium chloride parinacocha water contain more carbonate and potassium than that of the atlantic ocean or the great salt lake as compare with the salinity of typical salt water that of lake parinacocha occupy a intermediate position contain more than lake koko-nor less than that of the atlantic and only one twentieth the salinity of the great salt lake when we move to we second camp the tejada brother prefer to let they mule rest in the puyusca valley where there be excellent alfalfa forage the arriero engage at they own expense a pack train which consist chiefly of parinacocha burro it be the custom hereabouts to enclose the pack in large-meshed net make of rawhide which be then fasten to the pack animal by a surcingle the indian who come with the burro train be pleasant-faced sturdy fellow dress in store clothes and straw hat they burro be as cantankerous as donkey can be never fractious or flighty but stubbornly resist step by step every effort to haul they near the load we second camp be near the village of incahuasus the house of the inca at the northwestern corner of the basin raimondus visit it in 1863 the representative of the owner of parinacocha occupy one of the house the other building be use only during the third week in August at the time of the annual fair in the now desert plaza be many low stone rectangle partly cover with adobe and ready to be convert into booth the plaza be surround by long thatched building of adobe and stone mostly of rough ashlar a few ashlar show sign of have be carefully dress by ancient stonemason some loose ashlar weigh half a ton and have baffle the attempt of modern builder in construct the large church advantage be take of a beautifully lay wall of close-fitting ashlar incahuasus be well name there have be at one time a inca house here possibly a temple -- lake be once object of worship -- or rest-house construct in order to enable the chief and tax-gatherer to travel comfortably over the vast domain of the inca we find the slope of the hill of the parinacocha basin to be well cover with remains of ancient terrace probably potato and other root crop be once raise here in fairly large quantity perhaps deforestation and subsequent increase aridity might account for the desertion of these once-cultivated land the hill west of the lake be intersect by a few dry gulch in which be cave that have be use as burial place the cave have at one time be wall in with rock lay in adobe but these wall have be partly break down so as to permit the sepulcher to be rifle of whatever object of value they might have contain we find nine or ten skull lie loose in the rubble of the cave one of the skull seem to have be trepan on top of the ridge be the remains of a ancient road fifty foot wide a broad grassy way through field of loose stone no effort have be make at grading or paving this road and there be no evidence of its have be use in recent time it run from the lake across the ridge in a westerly direction toward a broad valley where there be many terrace and cultivate field it be not far from nasca probably the stone be pick up and pile on each side to save time in drive caravan of llama across the stony ridge the llama dislike to step over any obstacle even a very low wall the grassy roadway would certainly encourage the supercilious beast to proceed in the desire direction in many place on the hill be to be see outline of large and small rock circle and shelter erect by herdsman for temporary protection against the sudden storm of snow and hail which come up with unexpected fierceness at this elevation -lrb- 12000 foot -rrb- the shelter be in a very ruinous state they be make of rough scoriaceous lava rock the circular enclosure vary from 8 to 25 foot in diameter most of they show no evidence whatever of recent occupation the smaller wall may have be the foundation of small circular hut the larger wall be probably intend as corral to keep alpaca and llama from stray at night and to guard against wolf or coyote i confess to be quite mystified as to the age of these remain it be possible that they represent a settlement of shepherd within historic time although from the shape and size of the wall i be incline to doubt this the shelter may have be build by the herdsman of the inca anyhow those on the hill west of parinacocha have not be use for a long time nasca which be not very far away to the northwest be the center of one of the most artistic pre-inca culture in peru it be famous for its very delicate pottery we third camp be on the south side of the lake near we the trace of the ancient road lead to the ruin of two large circular corral substantiate my belief that this curious roadway be intend to keep the llama from stray at will over the pasture land on the south shore of the lake there be more sign of occupation than on the north although there be nothing so clearly belong to the time of the inca as the ashlar and finely build wall at incahuasus on top of one of the rocky promontory we find the rough stone foundation of the wall of a little village the slope of the promontory be nearly precipitous on three side forty or fifty very primitive dwelling have be at one time huddle together here in a position which could easily be defend we find among the ruin a few crude potsherd and some bit of obsidian there be nothing about the ruin of the little hill village to give any indication of inca origin probably it go back to pre-inca day no one could tell we anything about it if there be tradition concern it they be well conceal by the silent superstitious shepherd of the vicinity possibly it be regard as a unlucky spot curse by the god the neighboring slope show faint evidence of have be roughly terraced and cultivate the tutu potato would grow here a hardy variety not edible in the fresh state but consider highly desirable for make potato flour after have be repeatedly freeze and its bitter juice all extract so would other highland root crop of the peruvian such as the oca a relative of we sheep sorrel the añu a kind of nasturtium and the ullucu -lrb- ullucus tuberosus -rrb- on the flat near the shore be large corral still keep in good repair new wall be be build by the indian at the time of we visit near the southeast corner of the lake be a few modern hut build of stone and adobe with thatched roof inhabit by drover and shepherd we see more cattle at the east end of the lake than elsewhere but they seem to prefer the sweet water grass of the lake to the tough bunch-grass on the slope of sarasara viscacha be common amongst the gray lichen-covered rock they be hunt for they beautiful pearly gray fur the chinchilla of commerce they be also very good eating so they have disappear from the more accessible part of peru one rarely see they although they may be find on bleak upland in the mountain of uilcapampa a region rarely visit by any one on account of treacherous bog and deep tam writer sometimes call viscacha rabbit-squirrel they have large round ear long hind leg a long bushy tail and do look like a cross between a rabbit and a gray squirrel surmount one of the higher ridge one day i come suddenly upon a unusually large herd of wild vicuñas it include more than one hundred individual they relative fearlessness also testify to the remoteness of parinacocha and the small amount of hunting that be do here vicuñas have never be domesticate but be often hunt for they skin they silky fleece be even finer than alpaca the more fleecy portion of they skin be sew together to make quilt as soft as eider down and of a golden brown color after mr tucker finish he triangulation of the lake i tell the arriero to find the shortest road home they smile murmured arequipa and start south we soon come to the rim of the maraicasa valley where peep up over one of the hill far to the south we get a little glimpse of coropuna the maraicasa valley be well inhabit and there be many grain field in sight although few seem to be terrace the surround hill be smooth and well round and the valley bottom contain much alluvial land we pass through it and after dark reach sondor a tiny hamlet inhabit by extremely suspicious and inhospitable drover in the darkness don pablo plead with the owner of a well-thatched hut and tell they how important we be they be unwilling to give we any shelter so we be force to pitch we tent in the very rocky and dirty corral immediately in front of one of the hut where pig dog and cattle annoy we all night if we have arrive before dark we might have receive a different welcome as a matter of fact the herdsman only show the customary hostility of mountaineer and wilderness folk to those who do not arrive in the daytime when they can be plainly see and fully discuss the next morning we pass some fairly recent lava flow and note also many curious rock form cause by wind and sand erosion we have now leave the belt of grazing land and once more come into the desert at length we reach the rim of the mile-deep caravelus canyon and we eye be gladden at sight of the rich green oasis a striking contrast to the barren wall of the canyon as we descend the long wind road we pass many fine specimen of tree cactus at the foot of the steep descent we find ourselves separate from the nearest settlement by a very wide river which it be necessary to ford neither of the tejada have ever be here before and its depths and danger be unknown fortunately pablo find a forlorn individual living in a tiny hut on the bank who indicate which way lay safety after a exciting two hour we finally get across to the desire shore animal and man be glad enough to leave the high arid desert and enter the oasis of caravelus with its luscious green field of alfalfa its shady fig tree and tall eucalyptus the air pungent with the smell of rich vegetation seem cooler and more invigorating we find at caravelus a modern british enterprise the gold mine of la victorium mr prain the manager and he associate at the camp give we a cordial welcome and a wonderful dinner which i shall long remember after two month in the coastal desert it seem like home during the evening we learn of the difficulty mr prain have have in bring he machinery across the plateau from the nearest port we own trouble seem as nothing the cost of transport on muleback each of the larger piece of the quartz stamping-mill be equivalent to the price of a first-class pack mule as a matter of fact although it be only a two day ' journey pack animal ' back be not build to survive the strain of carry piece of machinery weigh five hundred pound over a desert plateau up to a altitude of 4000 foot mule bring the machinery from the coast to the brink of the canyon but no mule could possibly have carry it down the steep trail into caraveli accordingly a windlass have be construct on the edge of the precipice and the machinery have be lower piece by piece by block and tackle such be one of the obstacle with which these undaunted engineer have have to contend have the man who design the machinery ever travel with a pack train climb up and down over these rocky stairway call mountain trail i be sure that he would have make he casting much smaller ------ figure mr tucker on a mountain trail near caravelus ------ ------ figure the main street of chuquibamba ------ it be astonishing how often people who ship goods to the interior of south america fail to realize that no single piece should be any heavier than a pack animal can carry comfortably on one side one hundred and fifty pound ought to be the extreme limit of a unit even a large strong mule will last only a few day on such trail as be show in the accompany illustration if the total weight of he cargo be over three hundred pound when a single piece weigh more than two hundred pound it have to be balance on the back of the animal then the load rock and chafe the unfortunate mule besides cause great inconvenience and constant worry to the muleteer as a matter of expediency it be better to have the individual unit weigh about seventy-five pound such a weight be easier for the arriero to handle in the load unload and reload that go on all day long particularly if the trail be up-and-down as usually happen in the ande furthermore one seventy-five-pound unit make a fair load for a man or a llama two be right for a burro and three for a average mule four can be load if necessary on a stout mule the hospitable mining engineer urge we to prolong we stay at la victorium but we have to hasten on leave the pleasant shade tree of caravelus we climb the barren desolate hill of coarse gravel and lava rock and leave the canyon we be surprise to find near the top of the rise the scatter foundation of fifty little circular or oval hut average eight foot in diameter there be no water near here hardly a green thing of any sort be to be see in the vicinity yet here have once be a village it seem to belong to the same period as that find on the southern slope of the parinacocha basin the road be one of the worst we encounter anywhere be at time merely a rough rocky trail over and among huge pile of lava block several of the larger boulder be cover with pictograph they represent a serpent and a sun besides man and animal shortly afterwards we descend to the rio grande valley at callanga where we pitch we camp among the most extensive ruin that i have see in the coastal desert they cover a area of one hundred acre the house be crowd closely together it give one a strange sensation to find such a very large metropolis in what be now a desolate region the general appearance of callanga be strikingly reminiscent of some of the large group of ruin in we own southwest nothing about it indicate inca origin there be no terrace in the vicinity it be difficult to imagine what such a large population could have do here or how they live the wall be of compact cobblestone rough-laid and stucco with adobe and sand most of the stucco have come off some of the house have seat or small sleeping-platform build up at one end other contain two or three small cell possibly storeroom with neither door nor window we find a number of burial cist -- some square other round -- line with small cobblestone in one house at the foot of cellar stair we find a subterranean room or tomb the entrance to it be cover with a single stone lintel in examine this tomb mr tucker have a narrow escape from be bite by a boba a venomous snake nearly three foot in length with vicious mouth long fang like a rattlesnake and a strikingly mottled skin at one place there be a low pyramid less than ten foot in height to its top lead a flight of rude stone step among the ruin we find a number of broken stone dish rudely carve out of soft highly porous scoriaceous lava the dish must have be hard to keep clean we also find a small stone mortar probably use for grind paint a broken stone war club and a broken compact stone mortar and pestle possibly use for grind corn two stone a foot and a half long roughly round with a shallow groove across the middle of the flatter side resemble sinker use by fisherman to hold down large net although ten time larger than any i have ever see use perhaps they be to tie down roof in a gale there be a few potsherd lie on the surface of the ground so weathered as to have lose whatever decoration they once have we do no excavate callanga offer a interesting field for archeological investigation unfortunately we have hear nothing of it previously come upon it unexpectedly and have but little time to give it after the first night camp in the midst of the dead city we make the discovery that although it seem to be entirely desert it be as a matter of fact well populated i be remind of professor t d seymor 's story of he study in the ruin of ancient greece we wonder what the flea live on ordinarily we next stopping-place be the small town of andaray whose thatched house be build chiefly of stone plaster with mud near it we encounter two man with a mule which they say they be take into town to sell and be willing to dispose of cheaply the tejada could not resist the temptation to buy a good animal at a bargain although the circumstance be suspicious drawing on we for six gold sovereign they smilingly add the new mule to the pack train only to discover on reach chuquibamba that they have purchase it from thief we be able to clear we arriero of any complicity in the theft nevertheless the owner of the steal mule be unwilling to pay anything for its return so they lose they bargain and they gold we spend one night in chuquibamba with we friend señor benavide the sub-prefect and once more take up the well-traveled route to arequipa we leave the maje valley in the afternoon and as before spend the night cross the desert about three o'clock in the morning -- after we have be jogging steadily along for about twelve hour in the dark and quiet of the night the only sound the shuffle of the mule ' foot in the sand the only sight a occasional crescent-shaped dune dimly visible in the starlight -- the eastern horizon begin to be faintly illumine the moon have long since set could this be the approach of dawn sunrise be not due for at least two hour in the tropics there be little twilight precede the day the dawn come up like thunder surely the moon could not be go to rise again what could be the meaning of the rapidly brighten eastern sky while we watch and marvel the pure white light grow brighter and brighter until we cry out in ecstasy as a dazzling luminary rise majestically above the horizon a splendor neither of the sun nor of the moon shone upon we it be the morning star for sheer beauty divine enchant ravishment venus that day surpass anything i have ever see in the word of the great eastern poet who have often see such a sight in the desert of asia the morning star sing together and all the son of god shout for joy chapter v titicaca arequipa be one of the pleasantest place in the world : mountain air bright sunshine warm day cool night and a sparkling atmosphere dear to the heart of star-gazer the city lie on a plateau surround by mighty snow-capped volcano chachanus -lrb- 20000 ft -rrb- el mistus -lrb- 19000 ft -rrb- and pichu pichu -lrb- 18000 ft -rrb- arequipa have only one nightmare -- earthquake about twice in a century the spirit of the sleep volcano stir roll over and go to sleep again but they shake the bed and arequipa rest on they bed the possibility of a terremoto be always present in the subconscious mind of the arequipeño one evening i happen to be dine with a friend at the hospitable arequipa club suddenly the window rattle violently and we hear a loud explosion at least that be what it sound like to I to the member of the club however it mean only one thing -- a earthquake everybody rush out the street be already crowd with hysterical people cry shout and run toward the great open plaza in front of the beautiful cathedral here some drop on they knee in gratitude at have escape from fall wall other pray to the god of earthquake to spare they city yet no wall have fall in the business district a great column of black smoke be rise gradually it become know to the panic-stricken throng that the noise and the tremble have not be due to a earthquake but to a explosion in a large warehouse which have contain gasoline kerosene dynamite and giant powder in this city of 35000 people the second largest of peru fire be so very rare not even annual scarcely biennial that there be no fire engine a bucket brigade be form and try to quench the roar furnace by dip water from one of the azequia or canal that run through the street the fire continue to belch forth dense mass of smoke and flame in any american city such a blaze would certainly become a great conflagration while the fire be at its height i go into the adjoining building to see whether any help could be render to my utter amazement the surface of the wall next to the fiery furnace be not even warm such be the result of build house with massive wall of stone furthermore the roof in arequipa be of tile consequently no harm be do by spark so without a fire department this really terrible fire be limit to one warehouse the next day the newspaper talk about the dire necessity of secure fire engine it be difficult for I to see what good a fire engine could have do nothing could have save the warehouse itself once the fire get under way and surely the house next door would have suffer more have they be deluge with stream of water the fact be almost incredible to a american we take it as a matter of course that city should have fire and explosion in arequipa everybody think it be a earthquake a day 's run by a excellent railroad take one to puno the chief port of lake titicaca elevation 12500 foot puno boast a soldier 's monument and a new theater really a movie palace there be a good harbor although dredging be necessary to provide for steamer like the inca repair to the lake boat be make on a marine -- or rather a lacustrine -- railway the bay of puno grow quantity of totoras giant bulrush sometimes twelve foot long age ago the lake dweller learn to dry the totoras tie they securely in long bundle fasten the bundle together turn up the end fix smaller bundle along the side as a free-board and so construct a fishing-boat or balsa of course the balsa eventually become water-logged and spend a large part of they existence on the shore dry in the sun even so they be not very buoyant i can testify that it be difficult to use they without get one 's shoe wet as a matter of fact one should go barefooted or wear sandal as the native do the balsa be clumsy and difficult to paddle the favorite method of locomotion be to pole or when the wind favor sail the mast be a a-shaped contraption twelve foot high make of two light pole tie together and fasten one to each side of the craft slightly forward of amidship pole be extremely scarce in this region -- lumber have to be bring from puget sound 6000 mile away -- so nearly all the mast i saw be make of small piece of wood splice two or three time to the apex of the a be attach a fork stick over which run the halyard the rectangular sail be nothing more nor less than a large mat make of rush a short forestay fasten to the side of the a about four foot above the hull prevent the mast from fall when the sail be hoist the main halyard take the place of a backstay the balsa can not beat to windward but behave very well in shallow water with a favor breeze when the wind be contrary the boatman must pole they be extremely careful not to fall overboard for the water in the lake be cold 55 ° f and none of they know how to swim lake titicaca itself never freeze over although during the winter ice form at night on the shallow bay and near the shore ------ figure a lake titicaca balsa at puno ------ ------ figure a step-topped niche on the island of koatus ------ when the indian wish to go in the shallowest water they use a very small balsa not over eight foot long barely capable of support the weight of one man on the other hand large balsa construct for use in cross the rough water of the deeper portion of the lake be capable of carry a dozen people and they luggage once i see a ploughman and he team of ox be ferry across the lake on a bulrush raft to give greater security two balsa be sometimes fasten together in the fashion of a double canoe one of the more highly speculative of the bolivian writer señor posnansky of la paz believe that gigantic balsa be use in bring ten-ton monolith across the lake to tiahuanaco this theory be base on the assumption that titicaca be once very much higher than it be now a hypothesis which have not commend itself to modern geologist or geographer dr isaiah bowman and professor herbert gregory who have study its geology and physiography have not be able to find any direct evidence of former high level for lake titicaca or of its have be connect with the ocean nevertheless señor posnansky believe that lake titicaca be once a salt sea which become separate from the ocean as the ande rise the fact that the lake fish be fresh-water rather than marine form do not bother he señor posnansky pin he faith to a small dry seahorse once give he by a titicaca fisherman he seem to forget that dry specimen of marine life include starfish be frequently offer for sale in the ande by the dealer in primitive medicine who may be find in almost every market-place probably señor posnansky 's seahorse be bring from the ocean by some particularly enterprising trader although starfish be common enough in the ande and a seahorse have actually find its resting-place in la paz this do not alter the fact that scientific investigator have never find any strictly marine fauna in lake titicaca on the other hand it have two or three kind of edible fresh-water fish one of they belong to a species find in the rimac river near lima it seem to I entirely possible that the inca with they scorn of the difficulty of carry heavy burden over seemingly impossible trail might have deliberately transplant the desirable fresh-water fish of the rimac river to lake titicaca polo de ondegardo who live in cuzco in 1560 say that the inca use to bring fresh fish from the sea by special runner and that they have record in they quipus of the fish have be bring from tumbez a distance of more than three hundred league the actual transference of water jar contain the fish would have offer no serious obstacle whatever to the inca provide the idea happen to appeal to they as desirable yet i may be as far wrong as señor posnansky at any rate the romantic story of a gigantic inland sea vastly more extensive than the present lake and actually surround the ancient city of tiahuanaco must be treat with respectful skepticism tiahuanaco at the southern end of lake titicaca in bolivium be famous for the remains of a pre-inca civilization unique among prehistoric remains in the highland of peru or bolivium be its carve monolithic image although they have suffer from weather and from vandalism enough remain to show that they represent clothed human figure the richly decorate girdle and long tunic be carve in low relief with a intricate pattern while some of the design be undoubtedly symbolic of the rank achievement or attribute of the divinity or chief here portray there be nothing hieroglyphic the image be stiff and show no appreciation of the beauty of the human form probably the ancient artist never have a opportunity to study the human body in andean village even little child do not go naked as they do among primitive people who live in warm climate the highlander of peru and bolivium be always heavily clothed day and night force by they climate to seek comfort in the amount and thickness of they apparel they have develop a excessive modesty in regard to bodily exposure which be in striking contrast to people who live on the warm sand of the south sea inca sculptor and potter rarely employ the human body as a motif tiahuanaco be pre-inca yet even here the image be clothe they be not represent as clothe in order to make easier the work of the sculptor he carve show he have great skill be observant and have true artistic feeling apparently the taboo against nakedness be too much for he among the thirty-six island in lake titicaca some belong to peru other to bolivia two of the latter titicaca and koatus be peculiarly venerate in inca day they be cover with artificial terrace most of which be still use by the indian farmer of to-day on both island there be ruin of important inca structure on titicaca island i be show two cave out of which say the indians come the sun and moon at they creation these cave be not large enough for a man to stand upright but to a people who do not appreciate the size of the heavenly body it require no stretch of the imagination to believe that those bright disk come forth from cave eight foot wide the myth probably originate with dweller on the western shore of the lake who would often see the sun or moon rise over this island on a ancient road that run across the island my native guide point out the footprint of the sun and moon -- two curious effect of erosion which bear a distant resemblance to the footprint of giant twenty or thirty foot tall the present-day indian know as aymara seem to be hard-working and fairly cheerful the impression which bandelier give in he island of titicaca and koatus of the degradation and surly character of these indian be not apparent at the time of my short visit in 1915 it be quite possible however that if i have to live among the indian as he do for several month digging up they ancient place of worship disturb they superstitious prejudice and possibly upset in they mind the proper balance between wet weather and dry i might have bring upon myself uncivil look and rough churlish treatment such as he experience in judge the attitude of mind of the native of titicaca one should remember that they live under most try condition of climate and environment during several month of the year everything be dry up and parch the brilliant sun of the tropics burn mercilessly through the rarefy air cause the scant vegetation to wither then come torrential rain i shall never forget my first experience on lake titicaca when the steamer encounter a rain squall the result deluge actually come through the deck needless to say such downpour tend to wash away the soil which the farmer have painfully gather for field or garden the sun in the daytime be extremely hot yet the difference in temperature between sun and shade be excessive furthermore the wind at night be very damp the cold be intensely penetrate fuel be exceedingly scarce there be barely enough for cooking purpose and none for artificial heat food be hard to get few crop can be grow at 12500 foot some barley be raise but the soil be lack in nitrogen the principal crop be the bitter white potato which after be freeze and dry become the insipid chuño chief reliance of the poorer family the inca system of bring guano from the island of the pacific coast have long since be abandon there be no money to pay for modern fertilizer consequently crop be poor on titicaca island i see native woman who have just harvest they maize engage in shucking and dry ear of corn which vary in length from one to three inch to be sure this miniature corn have the advantage of mature in sixty day but good soil and fertilizer would double its size and productiveness naturally these indian always feel themselves at the mercy of the element either a long rainy season or a drought may cause acute hunger and extreme suffering consequently one must not blame the bolivian or peruvian highlander if he frequently appear to be sullen and morose on the other hand one ought not to praise samoan for be happy hospitable and light-hearted those fortunate polynesian be surround by warm water in which they can always enjoy a swim tree from which delicious food can always be obtain and cocoanut from which cooling drink be secure without cost who could not develop cheerfulness under such condition on the small island koatus some of the inca stonework be remarkably good and have several unusual feature such as the elaboration of the large reëntrant ceremonial niche form by step-topped arch one within the other small ornamental niche be use to break the space between these recess and the upper corner of the whole rectangle contain they also unusual be the niche between the doorway make in the form of a elaborate quadrate cross it might seem at first glance as though this feature show spanish influence since a papal cross be create by the shadow cast in the intervene recessed course within they design as a matter of fact the cross nowy quadrant be a natural outcome of use for ornamental purpose the step-shaped design both erect and invert all over the land of the inca one find flight of step or terrace use repeatedly for ornamental or ceremonial purpose some stair be large enough to be use by man other be in miniature frequently the step be cut into the sacred boulder consecrate to ancestor worship it be easy for a inca architect accustom to the stairway motif to have conceive these curious doorway on koatus and also the cross-like niche between they even if he have never see any representation of a papal cross or a cross nowy quadrant my friend mr bancel la farge have also suggest a striking resemblance which the sedilia-like niche bear to arabic or moorish architecture as show for instance in the court of the lion in the alhambra the step-topped arch be distinctly oriental in form yet flight of step or terrace be also thoroughly incaic the principal structure on koatus be build around three side of a small plaza construct on a artificial terrace in a slight depression on the eastern side of the island the fourth side be open and afford a magnificent view of the lake and the wonderful snow-covered cordillera real 200 mile long and nowhere less than 17000 foot high this range of lofty snow-peak of surpass beauty culminate in mt sora 21520 foot high to the worshiper of the sun and moon who come to the sacred island for some of they most elaborate religious ceremony the sight of those heavenly luminary rise over the majestic snow mountain they glory reflect in the shine water of the lake must have be a sublime spectacle on such occasion the little plaza would indeed have be worth see we may imagine the gayly caparisoned inca they face light up by the color of rosy-fingered dawn daughter of the morning they ceremonial formation sharply outline against the high decorate wall of the building behind they perhaps the ruler and high priest have special station in front of the large step-topped niche one may be sure that a people who be fond of bright color who be able to manufacture exquisite textile and who love to decorate they garment with spangle and disk of beaten gold would have lose no opportunity for make the ancient ceremony truly resplendent on the peninsula of copacabana opposite the sacred island a great annual pageant be still stage every August although at present connect with a pious pilgrimage to the shrine of the miraculous image of the virgin of copacabana this vivid spectacle the most celebrated fair in all south america have its origin in the dim past it come after the maize be harvest and correspond to we thanksgive festival the scene be lay in the plaza in front of a large bizarre church during the first ten day in August there be gather here thousand of the mountain folk from far and near everything dear to the heart of the aymara indian be offer for sale include quantity of he favorite beverage trader usually woman sit in long row on blanket lay on the cobblestone pavement some of they be protect from the sun by primitive umbrella consist of a square cotton sheet stretch over a bamboo frame in one row be those trader who sell parch and pop corn in another those who deal in sandal and shoe the simple gear of the humblest wayfarer and the elaborately decorate high-laced boot affect by the wealthy cholum woman of la paz in another row be the dealer in indian blanket still another be devote to such trinket as one might expect to find in a needle-and-thread shop at home there be stolid aymara peddler with score of bamboo flute vary in size from a piccolo to a bassoon the hat merchant with pile of freshly make native felt warrant to last for at least a year and vendor of aniline dye the fabric which have come to we from inca time be color with beautifully soft vegetable dye among inca ruin one may find small stone mortar in which the primitive pigment be ground and mixed with infinite care although the modern indian still prefer the product of hand loom he have be quick to adopt the harsh aniline dye which be not only easier to secure but produce more striking result as a citizen of connecticut it give I quite a start to see carelessly expose to the weather on the rough cobblestone of the plaza bright new hardware from new haven and new britain -- lock key spring scale bolt screw eye hook and other wooden nutmeg at the table of the money-changer just outside of the sacred enclosure be the real moneymaker who give nothing for something thimble-rigger and three-card-monte-men do a brisk business and stand ready to fleece the guileless native or the unsuspecting foreigner the operator may wear ragged poncho and appear to be incapable of deep design but they know all the trick of the trade the most striking feature of the fair be the presence of various aymara secret society whose member wear repulsive mask be clothe in the most extraordinary costume which can be invent by primitive imagination each society have its own uniform make up of tinsel and figure satin tin-foil gold and silver leaf gaudy textile magnificent epaulet bear large golden star on a background of silver decorate with glitter gem of color glass tint ostrich plume of many color stick straight up eighteen inch above the head of they wearer gaudy ribbon beruffle bodice puff sleeve and slash trunk some of these strange costume be actually reminiscent of the sixteenth century the wearer be provide with flute whistle cymbal flageolet snare drum and rattle or other noise-maker the result be a indescribable hubbub a garish human kaleidoscope accompany by fiendish clamor and unmusical noise which fairly outstrip a dozen jazz band it be bedlam let loose a scene of wild uproar and confusion the member of one group be dress to represent female angel they head tightly turban so as to bear the maximum number of tall wave variegated plume on they back be gaudy wing resemble the butterfly of child 's pantomime many wear color goggles they march solemnly around the plaza playing on bamboo flageolet they plaintive tune drown in the din of big bass drum and blatant trumpet in a eddy in the seething crowd be a placid-faced aymara bedeck in the most tawdry manner with gewgaw from birmingham or manchester sedately play a melancholy tune on a rustic syrinx or pan 's pipe charmingly make from little tube of bamboo from eastern bolivium at the close of the festival on a Sunday afternoon the costume disappear and there occur a bull-baiting strong temporary barrier be erect at the comer of the plaza householder bar they door a riotous crowd compose of hundred of pleasure-seeker well fortify with dutch courage gather for the fray all be ready to run helter-skelter in every direction should the bull take it into he head to charge toward they it be not a bullfight there be no picador arm with lance to prick the bull to madness no banderillero with barb dart no heroic matador ready with shine blade to give a mad and weary bull the coup de grace here all be fun and frolic to be sure the bull be duly annoy by boastful boy or drunken aymara who prod he with stick and shake bright poncho in he face until he dash after he tormentor and cause a mighty scattering of some spectator amid shriek of delight from everybody else when one animal get tired another be bring on there be no chance of a bull be wound or seriously hurt at the time of we visit the only animal who seem at all anxious to do real damage be let alone he show no disposition to charge at random into the crowd the spectator surround the plaza so thickly that he could not distinguish any one particular enemy on whom to vent he rage he gallop madly after any individual who cross the plaza five or six bull be let loose during the excitement but no harm be do and every one have a uproariously good time such be the spectacle of copacabana a mixture of business and pleasure pagan and christian spain and titicaca bedlam be not pleasant to one 's ear yet to see the staid mountain herdsman attire in plume petticoat epaulet and goggles blow mightily with puffed-out lip on bamboo flageolet be worth a long journey chapter vi the vilcanota country and the peruvian highlander in the northernmost part of the titicaca basin be the grassy foothill of the cordillera vilcanota where large herd of alpaca thrive on the sweet tender pasturage santa rosa be the principal town here wool-buyers come to bid for the clip the high price which alpaca fleece command have bring prosperity excellent blanket renown in southern peru for they weight and texture be make here on hand loom notwithstanding the altitude -- nearly as great as the top of pike 's peak -- the stocky inhabitant of santa rosa be hardy vigorous and energetic ricardo charaja the best quichua assistant we ever have come from santa rosa nearly all the citizen be of pure indian stock they own many fine llama there be abundant pasturage and the llama be well care for by the indian who become personally attach to they flock and be loath to part with any of the individual once i attempt through a cuzco acquaintance to secure the skin and skeleton of a fine llama for the yale museum my friend be favorably know and speak the quichua language fluently he offer a good price and obtain from various llama owner promise to bring the hide and bone of one of they camel for shipment but they never do apparently they regard it as unlucky to kill a llama and none happen to die at the right time the llama never show affection for they master as horse often do on the other hand i have never see a llama kick or bite at he owner the llama be the only beast of burden know in either north or south america before columbus it be find by the spaniard in all part of inca land its small two-toed foot with they rough pad enable it to walk easily on slope too rough or steep for even a nimble-footed mountain-bred mule it have the reputation of be a unpleasant pet due to its ability to sneeze or spit for a considerable distance a small quantity of acrid saliva when i be in college barnum 's circus come to town the menagerie include a dozen llama whose supercilious expression inoffensive look and small size -- they be only three foot high at the shoulder tempt some little urchin to tease they when the llama feel that the time have come for reprisal they aim be straight and the result a precipitate retreat they tormentor howl and rub they eye have to run home and wash they face curiously enough in the two year which i have spend in the peruvian highland i have never see a llama so attack a single human be on the other hand when i be in santa rosa in 1915 some one have a tame vicuña which be perfectly willing to sneeze straight at any stranger who come within twenty foot of it even if one 's motive be nothing more annoying than scientific curiosity the vicuña be the smallest american camel yet its long slender neck small head long leg and small body from which hang long feathery fleece make it look more like a ostrich than a camel in the churchyard of santa rosa be two or three gnarled tree which have be carefully preserve for century as object of respect and veneration some traveler have think that 14000 foot be above the tree line but the presence of these tree at santa rosa would seem to show that the use of the word tree line be a misnomer in the ande mr cook believe that the peruvian plateau with the exception of the coastal desert be once well cover with forest when man first come into the ande everything except rocky ledge snow field and glacier be cover with forest growth although many district be now entirely treeless mr cook find that the condition of light heat and moisture even at the highest elevation be sufficient to support the growth of tree also that there be ample fertility of soil he theory be well substantiate by several isolate tract of forest which i find grow alongside of glacier at very high elevation one forest in particular on the slope of mt soiroccocha have be accurately determine by mr bumstead to be over 15000 foot above sea level it be cut off from the inhabit valley by rock fall and precipice so it have not be available for fuel virgin forest be not know to exist in the peruvian highland on any land which could have be cultivate a certain amount of natural reforestation with native tree be take place on abandon agricultural terrace in some of the high valley although these tree belong to many different species and family mr cook find that they all have this striking peculiarity -- when cut down they sprout readily from the stump and be able to survive repeat pollard remarkable evidence of the fact that the primeval forest of peru be long ago cut down for fuel or burn over for agriculture near the santa rosa tree be a tall bell-tower the sight of a picturesque belfry with four or five bell of different size hang each in its respective window make a strong appeal it be quite otherwise on Sunday morning when these same bell out of tune with themselves or actually crack be all ring at the same time the result clangor and din be unforgettable i presume the chinese would say it be intend to drive away the devil -- and surely such noise must be thoroughly uncongenial even to the most irreclaimable devil as lord frederick hamilton say of the canton practice church bell in the united state and england be usually sweet-toned and intended to invite the hearer to come to service or else they ring out in joyous peal to announce some festive occasion there be nothing invite or joyous about the bell in southern peru once in a while one may hear a bell of deep sweet tone like that of the great bell in cuzco which be toll when the last sacrament be be administer to a die christian but the general idea of bell-ringer in this part of the world seem to be to make the greatest possible amount of racket and clamor on popular saint ' day this be accompany by firecracker aerial bomb and other noise-making device which again remind one of chinese folkway perhaps it be merely that fundamental fondness for make a noise which be find in all healthy child on Sunday afternoon the plaza of santa rosa be well fill with quichua holiday-maker many of whom have be imbibe freely of chicha a mild native brew usually make from ripe corn the crowd be remarkably good-natured and give to a unusual amount of laughter and gayety for they Sunday be truly a day of rest recreation and sociability on week day most of they even the smaller boy be off on the mountain pasture watch the herd whose wool bring prosperity to santa rosa one sometimes find the mountain indian on Sunday afternoon sodden thoroughly soak with chicha and incline to resent the presence of inquisitive stranger not so these good folk of santa rosa ------ figure indian alcalde at santa rosa ------ ------ figure native druggist in the plaza of sicuanus ------ to be sure the female vendor of egg potato pepper and sundry native vegetable squat in two long row on the plaza do not enjoy be photograph but the man and boy crowd eagerly forward very much interested in my endeavor some of the indian alcalde local magistrate elect yearly to serve as the responsible official for village or tribal precinct be very helpful and armed with they large silver-mounted staff of office try to bring the shy retire woman of the market-place to stand in a frightened disgruntled barefooted group before the camera the woman be dress in the customary tight bodice heavy woolen skirt and voluminous petticoat of the plateau over they shoulder be pin heavy woolen shawl weave on hand loom on they head be reversible pancake hat make of straw cover on the wet-weather side with coarse woolen stuff and on the fair-weather side with tinsel and velveteen in accordance with local custom tassel and fringe hang down on both side it be say that the first inca order the dress of each village to be different so that he official might know to which tribe a indian belong it be only with great difficulty and by the combined effort of a good-natured priest the gobernador or mayor and the alcalde that a dozen very reluctant female be finally persuade to face the camera the expression of they face be very eloquent some be highly indignant other look foolish or supercilious two or three be thoroughly frighten not know what evil might befall they next not one give any evidence of enjoy it or take the matter as a good joke although that be the attitude assume by all they male acquaintance in fact some of the man be so anxious to have they picture take that they follow we about and pose on the edge of every group man and boy all wear knit woolen cap with ear flap which they seldom remove either day or night on top of these be large feel hat turn up in front so as to give a bold aspect to they husky wearer over they shoulder be heavy woolen poncho decorate with bright stripe they trousers end abruptly halfway between knee and ankle a convenient style for herdsman who have to walk in the long dewy grass of the plateau these high-water pantaloons do not look badly when wear with sandal as be the usual custom but since this be Sunday all the well-to-do man have put on european boot which do not come up to the bottom of they trousers and produce a singular effect hardly likely to become fashionable the prosperity of the town be also show by corrugated iron roof far less picturesque than thatch or tile they require less attention and give greater satisfaction during the rainy season they can also be securely bolt to the rafter on this wind-swept plateau we frequently notice that a thatched roof be hold in place by rope pass over the house and weight rest on the roof sometimes to the peak of a gable be fasten cross tiny flag or the skull of animal -- probably to avert the evil eye or bring good luck horseshoe do not seem to be in demand horse ' skull however be deem very efficacious on the rim of the titicaca basin be la raya the watershed be so level that it be almost impossible to say whether any particular raindrop will eventually find itself in lake titicaca or in the atlantic ocean the water from a spring near the railroad station of araranca flow definitely to the north this spring may be say to be one of the source of the urubamba river a important affluent of the ucayalus and also of the amazon but i never have hear it refer to as the source of the amazon except by a adventurous lecturer captain blank whose move picture entertainment bear the alluring title from the source to the mouth of the amazon as most of he picture of wild animal in the jungle look as though they be take in the zoölogical garden at para and the exciting tragedy of he canoe trip be actually stage near a friendly hacienda at santa ana less than a week 's journey from cuzco it be perhaps unnecessary to censure he for give this particular little spring such a pretentious title the urubamba river be know by various name to the people who live on its bank the upper portion be sometimes speak of as the vilcanota a term which apply to a lake as well as to the snow-covered peak of the cordillera in this vicinity the lower portion be call by the inca the uilca or the uilcamayu near the water-parting of la raya i notice the remains of a interesting wall which may have serve century ago to divide the inca of cuzco from the colla or warlike tribe of the titicaca basin in place the wall have be keep in repair by the owner of grazing land but most of it can be but dimly trace across the valley and up the neighbor slope to the cliff of the cordillera vilcanota it be build of rough stone near the historic wall be the ruin of ancient house possibly once occupy by a inca garrison i observe no ashlar among the ruin nor any evidence of careful masonry it seem to I likely that it be a hastily thrown-up fortification serve for a single military campaign rather than any permanent affair like the roman wall of north britain or the great wall of china we know from tradition that war be frequently wage between the people of the titicaca basin and those of the urubamba and cuzco valley it be possible that this be a relic of one of those war on the other hand it may be much older than the inca montesino -lrb- 3 -rrb- one of the best early historian tell we of titu yupanqui pachacuti vi sixty-second of the peruvian amauta ruler who long precede the inca against pachacutus vi there come -lrb- about 800 ad -rrb- large horde of fierce soldier from the south and east lay waste field and capture city and town evidently barbarian migration which appear to have continue for some time during these war the ancient civilization which have be build up with so much care and difficulty during the precede twenty century be seriously threaten pachacutus vi more religious than warlike ruler of a people whose great achievement have be agricultural rather than military be frighten by he soothsayer and priest they tell he of many bad omen instead of induce he to follow a policy of military preparedness he be urge to make sacrifice to the deity nevertheless he order he captain to fortify the strategic point and make preparation for defense the invader may have come from argentina it be possible that they be spur on by hunger and famine cause by the gradual exhaustion of forested area and the subsequent spread of untillable grassland on the great pampas montesino indicate that many of the people who come up into the highland at that time be seek arable land for they crop and be flee from a race of giant -- possibly patagonian or araucanian -- who have expel they from they own land on they journey they have pass over plain swamp and jungle it be obvious that a great readjustment of the aborigine be in progress the governor of the district through which these horde pass be not able to summon enough strength to resist they pachacuti vi assemble the larger part of he army near the pass of la raya and await the approach of the enemy if the account give in montesino be true this wall near la raya may have be build about 1100 year ago by the chief who be tell to fortify the strategic point certainly the pass of la raya long the gateway from the titicaca basin to the important city and town of the urubamba basin be the key to the situation it be probable that pachacutus vi draw up he army behind this wall he man be undoubtedly arm with sling the weapon most familiar to the highland shepherd the invader however carry bow and arrow more effective arm swifter more difficult to see less easy to dodge as pachacutus vi be carry over the field of battle on a golden stretcher encourage he man he be kill by a arrow he army be route montesino state that only five hundred escape leave behind they wound they flee to tampu-tocco a healthy place where there be a cave in which they hide the precious body of they ruler most writer believe this to be at paccaritampu where there be cave under a interesting carve rock there be no place in peru to-day which still bear the name of tampu-tocco to try and identify it with some of the ruin which do exist and whose modern name be not find in the early spanish writer have be one of the principal object of my expedition to peru as will be describe in subsequent chapter ------ figure a potato-field at la raya ------ ------ figure lay down the warp for a blanket : near the pass of la raya ------ near the watershed of la raya we see great flock of sheep and alpaca numerous corral and the thatched-roofed hut of herdsman the quichua woman be never idle one often see they engage in the manufacture of textile -- shawl girdle poncho and blanket -- on hand loom fasten to stake drive into the ground when tend flock or walk along the road they be always wind or spin yarn even the man and older child be sometimes thus engage the younger child use as shepherd as soon as they reach the age of six or seven be rarely expect to do much except watch they charge some of they be accompany by long-haired suncca shepherd dog as large as airedale but very cowardly give to bark and slink away it be claim that the suncca as well as two other variety be domesticate by the inca none of they show any desire to make the acquaintance of checkers my faithful airedale they master however be always interested to see that checkers could understand english they have never see a dog that could understand anything but quichua on the hillside near la raya mr cook mr gilbert and i visit a healthy potato field at a elevation of 14500 foot a record altitude for potato when commence to plough or spade a potato field on the high slope near here it be the custom of the indian to mark it off into square by furrow about fifteen foot apart the quichua commence they task soon after daybreak due to the absence of artificial lighting and the discomfort of rise in the bitter cold before dawn they wife do not prepare breakfast before ten o'clock at which time it be either bring from home in covered earthenware vessel or cook in the open field near where the man be work we come across one energetic landowner supervise a score or more of indian who be engage in plough a potato field although he be dress in european garb and be evidently a man of means and intelligence and near the railroad there be no modern implement in sight we find that it be difficult to get indian to use any except the implement of they ancestor the process of plough this field be undoubtedly one that have be use for century probably long before the spanish conquest the man work in unison and in a long row each arm with a primitive spade or foot plough to the handle of which foothold be lash would at a signal leap forward with a shout and plunge they spade into the turf face each pair of man be a girl or woman whose duty it be to turn the clod over by hand the man have take off they poncho so as to secure greater freedom of action but the woman be fully clothe as usual modesty seem to require they even to keep heavy shawl over they shoulder although the work be hard and painful the toil be lighten by the joyous contact of community activity every one work with a will there appear to be a keen desire among the worker to keep up with the procession those who fall behind be subject to good-natured tease community work be sometimes pleasant even though it appear to require a strong direct hand the boss be right there such practice would never suit those who love independence in the century of inca domination there be little opportunity for individual effort private property be not understand everything belong to the government the crop be take by the priest the inca and the noble the people be not as unhappy as we should be one seldom have to labor alone everything be do in common when it be time to cultivate the field or to harvest the crop the laborer be order by the inca to go forth in huge family party they lessen the hardship of farm labor by village gossip and choral singing intersperse at regular interval with rest period in which quantity of chicha quench the thirst and cheer the mind habit of community work be still show in the ande one often see a score or more of indian carry huge bundle of sheaf of wheat or barley i have find a dozen yoke of oxen each a few yard from the other in a parallel line engage in plough synchronously small portion of a large field although the landlord frequently visit lima and sometimes go to pari and new york where they purchase for they own use the product of modern invention the field be still cultivate in the fashion introduce three century ago by the conquistador who bring the first draft animal and the primitive pointed plough of the ancient mediterranean crop at la raya be not confine to potato another food plant almost unknown to european even those who live in lima be cañihua a kind of pigweed it be be harvest at the time of we visit in April the threshing floor for cañihua be a large blanket lay on the ground on top of this the stalk be place and the flail apply the blanket serve to prevent the small grayish seed from escape the entire process use nothing of european origin and have probably not change for century we notice also quinoa and even barley grow at a elevation of 14000 foot quinoa be another species of pigweed it often attain a height of three to four foot there be several variety the white-seeded variety after be boil may be fairly compare with oatmeal mr cook actually prefer it to the scotch article both for taste and texture the seed retain they form after be cook and do not appear so slimy as oatmeal other variety of quinoa be bitter and have to be boil several time the water be frequently change the grow quinoa present a attractive appearance its leaf assume many color as we go down the valley the evidence of extensive cultivation both ancient and modern steadily increase great number of old terrace be to be see there be many field of wheat some of they grow high up on the mountain side in what be call temporale where owe to the steep slope there be little effort at tillage or cultivation the planter trust to luck to get some kind of a crop in reward for very little effort on April 14th just above sicuanus we see field where haba bean have be gather and the dry stalk pile in little stack at occobamba or the pampa where oca grow we find field of that useful tuber just now ripen near by be little thatched shelter erect for the temporary use of night watchman during the harvest season the peruvian highlander whom we meet by the roadside be different in feature attitude and clothing from those of the titicaca basin or even of santa rosa which be not far away they be typical quichua -- peaceful agriculturist -- usually spin wool on the little hand spindle which have be use in the ande from time immemorial they hut be build of adobe the roof thatch with coarse grass the quichua be brown in color they hair be straight and black gray hair be seldom see it be the custom among the man in certain locality to wear they hair long and braid beard be sparse or lack bald head be very rare tooth seem to be more endure than with we throughout the ande the frequency of well-preserved tooth be everywhere noteworthy except on sugar plantation where there be opportunity to indulge freely in crude brown sugar nibble from cake or mix with parched corn and eat as a travel ration the quichua face be broad and short its breadth be nearly the same as the eskimo freckle be not common and appear to be limit to face and arm in the few case in which they be observe on the other hand a large proportion of the indian be pock-marked and show the effect of live in a country which be free from medical tyranny there be no compulsory vaccination one hardly ever see a fat quichua it be difficult to tell whether this be a racial characteristic or due rather to the lack of fat-producing food in they diet although the peruvian highlander have make the best use he could of the llama he be never able to develop its slender leg and weak back sufficiently to use it for load weigh more than eighty or a hundred pound consequently for the carrying of really heavy burden he have to depend on himself as a result it be not surprising to learn from dr ferris that while he arm be poorly develop he shoulder be broader he back muscle stronger and the calf of he leg larger and more powerful than those of almost any other race the quichua be fond of shake hand when a visit indian join a group he nearly always go through the gentle ceremony with each person in turn i do not know whether this be introduce by the spaniard or come down from prehistoric time in any event this handshaking in no way resemble the hearty clasp familiar to undergraduate at the beginning of the college year as a matter of fact the quichua handshake be extremely fishy and lack cordiality in test the hand grip of the quichua by a dynamometer we surgeon find that the muscle of the forearm be poorly develop in the quichua and the maximum grip be weak in both sex the average for the man be only about half of that find among american white adult of sedentary habit dr ale hrdlicka believe that the aboriginal race of north and south america be of the same stock the wide difference in physiognomy observable among the different tribe in north and south america be perhaps due to they environmental history during the past 10000 or 20000 year mr frank chapman of the american museum of natural history have point out the interesting biological fact that animal and bird find at sea level in the cold region of tierra del fuego while not find at sea level in peru do exist at very high altitude where the climate be similar to that with which they be acquaint similarly it be interesting to learn that the inhabitant of the cold lofty region of southern peru living in town and village at altitude of from 9000 to 14000 foot above the sea have physical peculiarity closely resemble those live at sea level in tierra del fuego alaska and labrador dr ferris say the labrador eskimo and the quichua constitute the two best-known short-stature race on the american continent so far as we could learn by question and observation about one quarter of the quichua be childless in family which have child the average number be three or four large family be not common although we generally learn that the living child in a family usually represent less than half of those which have be bear infant mortality be very great the proper feeding of child be not understand and it be a marvel how any of they manage to grow up at all cough and bronchial trouble be very common among the indian in fact the most common affliction of the tableland be those of the throat and lung pneumonia be the most serious and most to be dread of all local disease it be really terrifying due to the rarity of the air and relative scarcity of oxygen pneumonia be usually fatal at 8000 foot and be uniformly so at 11000 foot patient be frequently ill only twenty-four hour tuberculosis be fairly common its prevalence undoubtedly cause by the living condition practice among the highlander who be unwilling to sleep in a room which be not tightly close and protect against any possible intrusion of fresh air in the warmer valley where bodily comfort have lead the native to use hut of thatch and open reed instead of the air-tight hovel of the cold bleak plateau tuberculosis be seldom see of course there be no board of health nor be the people bother by be oblige to conform to any sanitary regulation water supplies be so often contaminate that the people have learn to avoid drink it as far as possible instead they eat quantity of soup ------ figure the ruin of the temple of viracocha at racche ------ in the market-place of sicuanus the largest town in the valley and the border-line between the potato-growing upland and lowland maize field we attend the famous Sunday market many native druggist be present they stock usually consist of medicine whose efficacy be learn by the inca there be forty or fifty kind of simple and curiosity cure-all and specifics fully half be report to I as be useful against fresh air or the evil effect of draft the medicine include such mineral as iron ore and sulphur such vegetable as dry seed root and the leaf of plant domesticate hundred of year ago by the inca or gather in the tropical jungle of the lower urubamba valley and such animal as starfish bring from the pacific ocean some of they be really useful herb while other have only a psychopathic effect on the patient each medicine be in a attractive little particolored woolen bag the bag differ in design and color weave on miniature hand loom be arrange side by side on the ground the upper part turn over and roll down so as to disclose the contents not many mile below sicuanus at a place call racche be the remarkable ruin of the so-called temple of viracocha describe by squier at first sight racche look as though there be here a row of nine or ten lofty adobe pier forty or fifty foot high closer inspection however show they all to be part of the central wall of a great temple the wall be pierce with large door and the space between the door be break by niche narrower at the top than at the bottom there be small hole in the doorpost for bar-hold the base of the great wall be about five foot thick and be of stone the ashlar be beautifully cut and while not rectangular be roughly square and fit together with most exquisite care so as to insure they make a very firm foundation they surface be most attractive but strange to say there be unmistakable evidence that the builder do not wish the stonework to show this surface be at one time plaster with clay a very significant fact the builder want the wall to seem to be build entirely of adobe yet have the great clay wall rest on the ground flood and erosion might have succeed in undermine it instead it rest securely on a beautifully build foundation of solid masonry even so the great wall do not stand absolutely true but lean slightly to the westward the wall also seem to be less weather on the west side probably the prevail or strongest wind be from the east a interesting feature of the ruin be a round column about twenty foot high -- a very rare occurrence in inca architecture it also be of adobe on a stone foundation there be only one column now stand in squier 's day the remains of other be to be see but i could find no evidence of they there be probably a double row of these column to support the stringer and tiebeam of the roof apparently one end of a tiebeam rest on the circular column and the other end be embed in the main wall the hole where the tiebeam enter the wall have stone lintel near the ruin of the great temple be those of other building also unique so far as i know the base of the party wall decorate with large niche be of cut ashlar carefully lay the middle course be of adobe while the upper third be of rough uncut stone it look very odd now but be originally cover with fine clay or stucco in several case the plastered wall be still stand in fairly good condition particularly where they have be sheltered from the weather the chief marvel of racche however be the great adobe wall of the temple which be nearly fifty foot high it be slowly disintegrate as might be expect the wonder be that it should have stand so long in a rainy region without any roof or protect cover it be incredible that for at least five hundred year a wall of sun-dried clay should have be able to defy severe rainstorm the lintel make of hard-wood timber and partially embed in the wall be all go yet the adobe remain it would be very interesting to find out whether the water of the spring near the temple contain lime if so this might have furnish natural calcareous cement in sufficient quantity to give the clay a particularly tenacious quality able to resist weather the factor which have cause this extraordinary adobe wall to withstand the weather in such a expose position for so many century notwithstanding the heavy rain of each summer season from December to march be worthy of further study it have be claim that this temple be devote to the worship of viracocha a great deity the jove or zeus of the ancient pantheon it seem to I more reasonable to suppose that a primitive folk construct here a temple to the preside divinity of the place the god who give they this precious clay the principal industry of the neighbor village be still the manufacture of pottery no better clay for ceramic purpose have be find in the ande it would have be perfectly natural for the prehistoric potter to have desire to placate the preside divinity not so much perhaps out of gratitude for the clay as to avert he displeasure and fend off bad luck in bake pottery it be well know that the best pottery of the inca be extremely fine in texture student of ceramic be well aware of the uncertainty of the result of bake clay bad luck seem to come most unaccountably even when the greatest pain be take might it not have be possible that the people who be most concerned with create pottery decide to erect this temple to insure success and get as much good luck as possible near the ancient temple be a small modern church with two tower the churchyard appear to be a favorite place for bake pottery possibly the modern potter use the church to pray for success in they bake just as the ancient potter use the great temple of viracocha the wall of the church be compose partly of adobe and partly of cut stone take from the ruin not far away be a fairly recent though prehistoric lava flow it occur to I that possibly this flow destroy some of the clay bed from which the ancient potter get they precious material the temple may have be erect as a propitiatory offering to the god of volcano in the hope that the anger which have cause he to send the lava flow might be appease it may be that the inca viracocha a unusually gifted ruler be particularly interested in ceramic and be responsible for build the temple if so it would be natural for people who be devote to ancestor worship to have here worship he memory ------ figure route map of the peruvian expedition of 1912 ------ chapter vii the valley of the huatanay the valley of the huatanay be one of many valley tributary to the urubamba it differ from they in have more arable land located under climatic condition favorable for the raising of the food crop of the ancient peruvian contain a area estimate at less than 160 square mile it be the heart of the greatest empire that south america have ever see it be still intensively cultivate the home of a large percentage of the people of this part of peru the huatanay itself sometimes meander through the valley in a natural manner but at other time be see to be confine within carefully build stone wall construct by prehistoric agriculturist anxious to save they field from flood and erosion the climate be temperate extreme cold be unknown water freeze in the lowland during the dry winter season in June and July and frost may occur any night in the year above 13000 foot but in general the climate may be say to be neither warm nor cold this rich valley be apportion by the spanish conqueror to soldier who be grant large estate as well as the labor of the indian live on they this method still prevail and one may occasionally meet on the road wealthy landholder on they way to and from town although mule be essentially the most reliable saddle animal for work in the ande these landholder usually prefer horse which be larger and faster as well as be more gentle and better gait the gentry of the huatanay valley prefer a deep-seated saddle over which be lay a heavy sheepskin or thick fur mat the fashionable stirrup be pyramidal in shape make of wood decorate with silver band owe to the steepness of the road a crupper be consider necessary and be usually decorate with a broad embossed panel from which hang little trappings reminiscent of medieval harness the bridle be usually make of carefully braid leather decorate with silver and frequently furnish with a emboss leather eye shade or blinder to indicate that the horse be high-spirited this eye shade which may be pull down so as to blind both eye completely be more useful than a hitch post in persuade the horse to stand still the valley of the huatanay river be divide into three part the basin of lucre oropesa and cuzco the basaltic cliff near oropesa divide the lucre basin from the oropesa basin the pass at angostura or the narrow be the natural gateway between the oropesa basin and the cuzco basin each basin contain interesting ruin in the lucre basin the most interesting be those of rumiccolca and piquillacta at the extreme eastern end of the valley on top of the pass which lead to the vilcanota be a ancient gateway call rumiccolca -lrb- rumus = stone ccolca = granary -rrb- it be commonly suppose that this be a inca fortress intend to separate the chief of cuzco from those of vilcanota it be now locally refer to as a fortaleza the major part of the wall be well build of rough stone lay in clay while the side of the gateway be face with carefully cut andesite ashlar of a entirely different style it be conceivable that some great chieftain build the rough wall in the day when the highland be split up among many little independent ruler and that later one of the inca no longer need any fortification between the huatanay valley and the vilcanota valley tear down part of the wall and build a fine gateway the face of the ashlar be nicely finish except for several rough boss or nubbin they be probably use by the ancient mason in order to secure a better hold when finally adjust the ashlar with small crowbar it may have be the intention of the stone mason to remove these nubbin after the wall be complete in one of the unfinished structure at machu picchu i notice similar boss the name stone-granary be probably originally apply to a neighbor edifice now in ruin on the rocky hillside above rumiccolca be the ruin of many ancient terrace and some building not far from rumiccolca on the slope of mt piquillacta be the ruin of a extensive city also call piquillacta a large number of its house have extraordinarily high wall a high wall outside the city and run north and south be obviously build to protect it from enemy approach from the vilcanota valley in the other direction the slope be so steep as to render a wall unnecessary the wall be build of fragment of lava rock with which the slope of mt piquillacta be cover cactus and thorny scrub be grow in the ruin but the volcanic soil be rich enough to attract the attention of agriculturist who come here from neighbor village to cultivate they crop the slope above the city be still extensively cultivate but without terrace wheat and barley be the principal crop as a illustration of the difficulty of identify place in ancient peru it be worth note that the gateway now call rumiccolca be figure in squier 's peru as piquillacta on the other hand the ruin of the large city cover thickly a area nearly a square mile be call by squier the great inca town of muyna a name also apply to the little lake which lie in the bottom of the lucre basin as squier come along the road from racche he see mt piquillacta first then the gateway then lake muyna then the ruin of the city in each case the name of the most conspicuous harmless natural phenomenon seem to have be apply to ruin by those of whom he inquire my own experience be different ------ figure lucre basin lake muyna and the city wall of piquillacta ------ dr aguilar a distinguished professor in the university of cuzco who have a country place in the neighborhood and be very familiar with this region bring I to this ancient city from the other direction from he i learn that the city ruin be call piquillacta the name which be also apply to the mountain which lie to the eastward of the ruin and rise 1200 foot above they dr aguilar life near oropesa as one come from oropesa mt piquillacta be a conspicuous point and be directly in line with the city ruin consequently it would be natural for people view it from this direction to give to the ruin the name of the mountain rather than that of the lake yet the mountain may be name for the ruin piqui mean flea llacta mean town city country district or territory be this the territory of the flea or be it flea town and what be its name in the day of the inca be the old name abandon because it be consider unlucky whatever the reason it be a most extraordinary fact that we have here the evidence of a very large town possibly pre-inca long since abandon there be score of house and numerous compound lay out in regular fashion the street cross each other at right angle the whole cover a area considerably larger than the important town of ollantaytambo not a soul live here it be true that across the vilcanota to the east be a difficult mountainous country culminate in mt ausangate the highest peak in the department yet piquillacta be in the midst of a populous region to the north lie the thickly settle valley of pisac and yucay to the south the important vilcanota valley with dozen of village to the west the densely populated valley of the huatanay and cuzco itself the largest city in the highland of peru thousand of people live within a radius of twenty mile of piquillacta and the population be on the increase it be perfectly easy of access and be less than a mile east of the railroad yet it be abandonado -- desierto -- despoblado undoubtedly here be once a large city of great importance the reason for its be abandon appear to be the absence of run water although mt piquillacta be a large mass nearly five mile long and two mile wide rise to a point of 2000 foot above the huatanay and vilcanota river it have no stream brook or spring it be a isolate extinct volcano surround by igneous rock lava andesite and basalt how come it that so large a city as piquillacta could have be build on the slope of a mountain which have no run stream have the climate change so much since those day if so how be it that the surrounding region be still the populous part of southern peru it be inconceivable that so large a city could have be build and occupy on a plateau four hundred foot above the nearest water unless there be some way of provide it other than the arduous one of bring every drop up the hill on the back of man and llama if there be no place near here better provide with water than this site one could understand that perhaps its inhabitant be oblige to depend entirely upon water carrier on the contrary within a radius of six mile there be half a dozen unoccupied site near run stream until further study can be make of this puzzling problem i believe that the answer lie in the ruin of rumiccolca which be usually think of as a fortress squier say that this fortress be the southern limit of the dominion of the first inca the fortress reach from the mountain on one side to a high rocky eminence on the other it be popularly call ` el aqueducto ' perhaps from some fancy resemblance to a aqueduct -- but the name be evidently misapply yet he admit that the cross-section of the wall diminish as it do by graduation or step on both side might appear to conflict with the hypothesis of its be a work of defense or fortification if it occupy a different position he notice that the top of the wall be throughout of the same level become less in height as it approach the hill on either hand and diminish proportionately in thickness as a aqueduct should do yet so possess be he by the fortress idea that he reject not only local tradition as express in the native name but even turn he back on the evidence of he own eye it seem to I that there be little doubt that instead of the ruin of rumiccolca represent a fortification we have here the remains of a ancient azequium or aqueduct build by some powerful chieftain to supply the people of piquillacta with water a study of the topography of the region show that the river which rise southwest of the village of lucre and furnish water power for its modern textile mill could have be use to supply such a azequium the water collect at a elevation of 10700 foot could easily have be bring six mile along the southern slope of the lucre basin around mt rumiccolca and across the old road on this aqueduct at a elevation of about 10600 foot this would have permit it to flow through some of the street of piquillacta and give the ancient city a adequate supply of water the slope of rumiccolca be mark by many ancient terrace they upper limit correspond roughly with the contour along which such a azequium would have have to pass there be in fact a distinct line on the hillside which look as though a azequium have once pass that way in the valley back of lucre be also faint indication of old azequia there have be however a considerable amount of erosion on the hill and if as seem likely the water-works have be out of order for several century it be not surprising that all trace of they have disappear in place i regret very much that circumstance over which i have no control prevent my make a thorough study of the possibility of such a theory it remain for some fortunate future investigator to determine who be the inhabitant of piquillacta how they secure they water supply and why the city be abandon ------ figure sacsahuaman : detail of lower terrace wall ------ ------ figure ruin of the aqueduct of rumiccolca ------ until then i suggest as a possible work hypothesis that we have at piquillacta the remains of a pre-inca city that its chief and people cultivate the lucre basin and its tributary that as a community they be a separate political entity from the people of cuzco that the ruler of the cuzco people perhaps a inca finally become sufficiently powerful to conquer the people of the lucre basin and remove the tribe which have occupy piquillacta to a distant part of he domain a system of colonization well know in the history of the inca that after the people who have build and live in piquillacta depart no subsequent dweller in this region care to reoccupy the site and its aqueduct fall into decay it be easy to believe that at first such a site would have be consider unlucky its house unfamiliar and unfashionable in design would have be consider not desirable they high wall might have be use for a reconstructed city have there be plenty of water available in any case the ruin of the lucre basin offer a most fascinating problem in the oropesa basin the most important ruin be those of tipon a pleasant well-watered valley several hundred foot above the village of quispicanchus they include carefully construct house of characteristic inca construction contain many symmetrically arrange niche with stone lintel the wall of most of the house be of rough stone lay in clay tipon be probably the residence of the principal chief of the oropesa basin it command a pleasant view of the village and of the hill to the south which to-day be cover with field of wheat and barley at tipon there be a nicely construct fountain of cut stone some of the terrace be extremely well build with roughly square block fitting tightly together access from one terrace to another be obtain by step make each of a single bonder project from the face of the terrace few better construct terrace wall be to be see anywhere the terrace be still cultivate by the people of quispicanchus no one live at tipon now although little shepherd boy and goatherd frequent the neighborhood it be more convenient for the agriculturist to live at the edge of they largest field which be in the valley bottom than to climb five hundred foot into the narrow valley and occupy the old building motive of security no longer require a residence here rather than in the open plain while i be examine the ruin and digging up a few attractive potsherd bear inca design dr giesecke the president of the university of cuzco who have accompany I climb the mountain above tipon with dr aguilar and report the presence of a fortification near its summit my stay at oropesa be render most comfortable and happy by the generous hospitality of dr aguilar whose finca be between quispicanchus and oropesa and command a charming view of the valley from the oropesa basin one enter the cuzco basin through a opening in the sandstone cliff of angostura near the modern town of san geronimo on the slope above the south bank of the huatanay just beyond angostura be the ruin of a score or more of gable-roofed house of characteristic inca construction the ancient building have door window and niche in wall of small stone lay in clay the lintel have be of wood now decay when we ask the name of these ruin we be tell that it be saylla although that be the name of a modern village three mile away down the huatanay in the oropesa basin like piquillacta old sayllum have no water supply at present it be not far from a stream call the kkaira and could easily have be supply with water by a azequium less than two mile in length bring along the 11000 foot contour it look very much like the case of a village originally place on the hill for the sake of comparative security and isolation and later abandon through a desire to enjoy the advantage of live near the great highway in the bottom of the valley after the inca have establish peace over the highland there may be another explanation it appear from mr cook 's study that the deforestation of the cuzco basin by the hand of man and modern method of tillage on unterraced slope have cause a unusual amount of erosion to occur landslide be frequent in the rainy season opposite sayllum be mt picol whose twin peak be the most conspicuous feature on the north side of the basin waste material from its slope be cause the rapid growth of a great gravel fan north of the village of san geronimo professor gregory notice that the stream traverse the fan be even now engage in bury ancient field by transport gravel from the head of the fan to its lower margin and that the lower end of the cuzco basin where the huatanay hem in between the angostura narrow can not carry away the sediment as fast as it be bring down by its tributary be be choke up if old sayllum represent a fortress set here to defend cuzco against old oropesa it might very naturally have be abandon when the rule of the inca finally spread far over the ande on the other hand it seem more likely that the people who build sayllum be farmer and that when the lower cuzco basin be fill up by aggradation due to increase erosion they abandon this site for one nearer the arable land one may imagine the dismay with which the agricultural resident of these ancient house see they beautiful field at the bottom of the hill cover in a few day or even hour by enormous quantity of coarse gravel bring down from the steep slope of picol after some drive rainstorm it may have be some such catastrophe that lead they to take up they residence elsewhere as a matter of fact we do not know when it be abandon further investigation might point to its have be desert when the spanish village of san geronimo be found however i believe student of agriculture will agree with I that deforestation increase erosion and aggrading gravel bank probably drive the folk out of saylla the southern rim of the cuzco basin be break by no very striking peak although huanacauraus -lrb- 13427 ft -rrb- the highest point be connect in inca tradition with some of the principal festival and religious celebration the north side of the huatanay valley be much more irregular range from ttica ttica pass -lrb- 12000 ft -rrb- to mt pachatucsa -lrb- 15915 ft -rrb- whose five little peak be frequently snow-clad there be no permanent snow either here or elsewhere in the huatanay valley the people of the cuzco basin be very short of fuel there be no native coal what the railroad use come from australium firewood be scarce the ancient forest disappear long ago the only tree in sight be a few willow or poplar from europe and one or two grove of eucalyptus also from australium cuzco have be think of and write of as be above the tree line but such be not the case the absence of tree on the neighbor hill be due entirely to the hand of man the long occupation the necessity of early agriculturist who clear the forest before the day of intensive terrace agriculture and the firewood requirement of a large population the people of cuzco do not dream of have enough fuel to make they house warm and comfortable only with difficulty can they get enough for cooking purpose they depend largely on fagot and straw which be bring into town on the back of man and animal in the field of stubble leave from the wheat and barley harvest we see many sheep feed they be thin and long-legged and many of the ram have four horn apparently due to century of inbreeding and the failure to improve the original stock by the introduction of new and superior strain when one look at the great amount of arable slope on most of the hill of the cuzco basin and the unusually extensive flat land near the huatanay one readily understand why the heart of inca land witness a concentration of population very unusual in the ande most of the important ruin be in the northwest quadrant of the basin either in the immediate vicinity of cuzco itself or on the pampas north of the city the reason be that the arable land where most extensive potato cultivation could be carry out be nearly all in this quadrant in the midst of this potato country at the foot of the pass that lead directly to pisac and paucartambo be a picturesque ruin which bear the native name of pucará pucará be the quichua word for fortress and it need but one glance at the little hilltop crown with a rectangular fortification to realize that the term be justified the wall be beautifully make of irregular block closely fit together advantage be take of small cliff on two side of the hill to strengthen the fortification we notice opening or drain which have be cut in the wall by the original builder in order to prevent the accumulation of moisture on the terraced floor of the enclosed area which be several foot above that of the sloping field outside similar conduit may be see in many of the old wall in the city of cuzco apparently the ancient folk fully appreciate the importance of good drainage and take pain to secure it at present pucará be occupy by llama herdsman and drover who find the enclosure a very convenient corral probably pucará be build by the chief of a tribe of prehistoric herdsman who raise root crop and keep they flock of llama and alpaca on the neighbor grassy slope a short distance up the stream of the lkallum chaca above pucará be a warm mineral spring around it be a fountain of cut stone near by be the ruin of a beautiful terrace on top of which be a fine wall contain four large ceremonial niche level with the ground and about six foot high the place be now call tampu machaus polo de ondegardo who live in cuzco in 1560 while many of the royal family of the inca be still alive give a list of the sacred or holy place which be venerate by all the indian in those day among these he mention that of timpucpuquio the hot spring near tambo machaus call so from the manner in which the water boil up the next huaca or holy place he mention be tambo machaus itself a house of the inca yupanquus where he be entertain when he go to be marry it be place on a hill near the road over the ande they sacrifice everything here except child the stonework of the ruin here be so excellent in character the ashlar be very carefully fit together one may fairly assume a religious origin for the place the quichua word macchinus mean to wash or to rinse a large narrow-mouthed pitcher it may be that at tampu machaus ceremonial purification of utensil devote to royal or priestly use be carry on it be possible that this be the place where accord to molina all the youth of cuzco who have be arm as knight in the great November festival come on the 21st day of the month to bathe and change they clothes afterwards they return to the city to be lecture by they relative each relation that offer a sacrifice flog a youth and deliver a discourse to he exhort he to be valiant and never to be a traitor to the sun and the inca but to imitate the bravery and prowess of he ancestor tampu machaus be located on a little bluff above the lkallum chaca a small stream which finally join the huatanay near the town of san sebastian before it reach the huatanay the lkallum chaca join the cachimayo famous as be so highly impregnate with salt as to have cause the rise of extensive salt work in fact the pizarro name the place las salinas or the salt pit on account of the salt pan with which by a careful system of terrace the native have fill the cachimayo valley prescott describe the great battle which take place here on April 26 1539 between the force of pizarro and almagro the two leader who have unite for the original conquest of peru but quarrel over the division of the territory near the salt pan be many inca wall and the ruin of structure with niche call rumihuasus or stone house the presence of salt in many of the spring of the huatanay valley be a great source of annoyance to we topographic engineer who be frequently oblige to camp in district where the only water available be so saline as to spoil it for drink purpose and ruin the tea the cuzco basin be undoubtedly once the site of a lake a ancient water-body whose surface say professor gregory lay well above the present site of san sebastian and san geronimo this lake be believe to have reach its maximum expansion in early pleistocene time its rich silt so well adapt for raise maize haba bean and quinoa have always attract farmer and be still intensively cultivate it have be name lake morkill in honor of that loyal friend of scientific research in peru william l morkill esq without whose untiring aid we could never have bring we peruvian exploration as far along as we do in pre-glacial time lake morkill fluctuate in volume from time to time part of the shore be expose long enough to enable plant to send they root into the fine material and the sun to bake and crack the mud mastodon graze on its bank lake morkill probably exist during all or nearly all of the glacial epoch its drainage be finally accomplish by the huatanay cut down the sandstone hill near sayllum and develop the angostura gorge in the bank of the huatanay a short distance below the city of cuzco the stratified bed of the vanish lake morkill to-day contain many fossil shell above these be gravel bring down by the flood and landslide of more modern time in which may be find potsherd and bone one of the chief affluent of the huatanay be the chunchullumayo which cut off the southernmost third of cuzco from the center of the city its bank be terraced and be still use for garden and food crop here the hospitable canadian missionary have they pleasant station a veritable oasis of anglo-saxon cleanliness on a July morning in 1911 while stroll up the ayahuaycco quebrada a affluent of the chunchullumayo in company with professor foote and surgeon erving my interest be arouse by the sight of several bone and potsherd expose by recent erosion in the stratified gravel bank of the little gulch further examination show that recent erosion have also cut through a ancient ash heap on the side toward cuzco i discover a section of stone wall build of roughly finish stone more or less carefully fit together which at first sight appear to have be build to prevent further wash away of that side of the gulch yet above the wall and flush with its surface the bank appear to consist of stratified gravel indicate that the wall antedate the gravel deposit fifty foot farther up the quebrada another portion of wall appear under the gravel bank on top of the bank be a cultivate field half a hour 's digging in the compact gravel show that there be more wall underneath the field later investigation by dr bowman show that the wall be about three foot thick and nine foot in height carefully face on both side with roughly cut stone and fill in with rubble a type of stonework not uncommon in the foundation of some of the older building in the western part of the city of cuzco ------ figure huatanay vallye cuzco and the ayahuaycco quebrada ------ even at first sight it be obvious that this wall build by man be completely cover to a depth of six or eight foot by a compact water-laid gravel bank this be sufficiently difficult to understand yet a few day later while endeavor to solve the puzzle i find something even more exciting half a mile farther up the gulch the road newly cut run close to the compact perpendicular gravel bank about five foot above the road i see what look like one of the small rock which be freely intersperse throughout the gravel here closer examination show it to be the end of a human femur apparently it form a integral part of the gravel bank which rise almost perpendicularly for seventy or eighty foot above it impressed by the possibility in case it should turn out to be true that here in the heart of inca land a human bone have be bury under seventy-five foot of gravel i refrain from disturb it until i could get dr bowman and professor foote the geologist and the naturalist of the 1911 expedition to come with I to the ayahuaycco quebrada we excavate the femur and find behind it fragment of a number of other bone they be excessively fragile the femur be unable to support more than four inch of its own weight and break off after the gravel have be partly remove although the gravel itself be somewhat damp the bone be dry and powdery ashy gray in color the bone be carry to the hotel central where they be carefully photograph soak in melted vaseline pack in cotton batting and eventually bring to new haven here they be examine by dr george f eaton curator of osteology in the peabody museum in the meantime dr bowman have become convinced that the compact gravel of ayahuaycco be of glacial origin when dr eaton first examine the bone fragment he be surprise to find among they the bone of a horse unfortunately a careful examination of the photograph take in cuzco of all the fragment which be excavate by we on July 11th fail to reveal this particular bone dr bowman upon be question say that he have dig out one or two more bone in the cliff adjoining we excavation of July 11th and have add these to the original lot presumably this horse bone be one which he have add when the bone be pack it do not worry he however and so sure be he of he interpretation of the gravel bed that he declare he do not care if we have find the bone of a percheron stallion he be sure that the age of the vertebrate remain might be provisionally estimate at 20000 to 40000 year until further study could be make of the geology of the surround territory in a article on the bury wall dr bowman come to the conclusion that the wall be pre-inca that its relation to alluvial deposit which cover it indicate its erection before the alluvial slope in which it lie bury be form and that it represent the earliest type of architecture at present know in the cuzco basin dr eaton 's study of the bone bring out the fact that eight of they be fragment of human bone represent at least three individual four be fragment of llama bone one of the bone of a dog and three be bovine remain the human remains agree in all essential respects with the bone of modern quichua llama and dog might all have belong to inca or even more recent time but the bovine remain present considerable difficulty the three fragment be from bone which be among the least characteristic part of the skeleton that which be of greatest interest be the fragment of a first rib resemble the first rib of the extinct bison since this fragmentary bovine rib be of a form apparently characteristic of bison and not see in the domestic cattle of the united state dr eaton feel that it could not be deny that the material examine suggest the possibility that some species of bison be here represent yet it would hardly be in accordance with conservative method to differentiate bison from domestic cattle solely by character obtain from a study of the first rib of a small number of individual although staunchly support he theory of the age of the vertebrate remain dr bowman in he report on they geological relation admit that the weakness of he case lay in the fact that the bovine remain be not sharply differentiate from the bone of modern cattle and also in the possibility that the bluff in which the bone be find may be face by younger gravel and that the bone be find in a gravel veneer deposit during later period of partial valley fill although it still seem very unlikely report of glacial man in america have come from place as widely separate as californium and argentina careful investigation however have always throw doubt on any great age be certainly attributable to any human remains in view of the fragmentary character of the skeletal evidence the fact that no proof of great antiquity could be draw from the character of the human skeletal part and the suggestion make by dr bowman of the possibility that the gravel which contain the bone might be of a later origin than he think we determine to make further and more complete investigation in 1912 it be most desirable to clear up all doubt and dissolve all skepticism i feel perhaps mistakenly that while a further study of the geology of the cuzco basin undoubtedly might lead dr bowman to reverse he opinion as be expect by some geologist if it should lead he to confirm he original conclusion the same skeptic would be likely to continue they skepticism and say he be try to bolster up he own previous opinion accordingly i believe it preferable to take another geologist whose independent testimony would give great weight to those conclusion should he find they confirm by a exhaustive geological study of the huatanay valley i ask dr bowman 's colleague professor gregory to make the necessary study at he request a very careful map of the huatanay valley be prepare under the direction of chief topographer albert h bumstead dr eaton who have have no opportunity of see peru be invite to accompany we and make a study of the bone of modern peruvian cattle as well as of any other skeletal remains which might be find furthermore it seem important to I to dig a tunnel into the ayahuaycco hillside at the exact point from which we take the bone in 1911 so i ask mr k c heald whose engineering training have be in colorado to superintend it mr heald dig a tunnel eleven foot long with a cross-section four and a half by three foot into the solid mass of gravel he expect to have to use timbering but so firmly pack be the gravel that this be not necessary no bone or artifact be find -- nothing but coarse gravel uniform in texture and contain no unmistakable evidence of stratification apparently the bone have be in a land slip on the edge of a older compact gravel mass in he study of the cuzco basin professor gregory come to the conclusion that the ayahuaycco gravel bank might have be repeatedly bury and reëxcavated many time during the past few century he find evidence indicate periodic destruction and rebuilding of some gravel terrace even within the past one hundred year accordingly there be no longer any necessity to ascribe great antiquity to the bone or the wall which we find in the ayahuaycco quebrada although the cuzco gravel be believe to have reach they greatest extent and thickness in late pleistocene time more recent deposit have however be superimpose on top and alongside of they surface wash from the border slope control in amount and character by climatic change have probably be accumulate continuously since glacial time and have greatly increase since human occupation begin geologic datum do not require more than a few hundred of year as the age of the human remains find in the cuzco gravel but how about the bison soon after he arrival in cuzco dr eaton examine the first rib of carcass of beef animal offer for sale in the public market he immediately become convinced that the bison be a peruvian domestic ox under the life-condition prevail in this part of the ande and possibly in correlation with the increase action of the respiratory muscle in a rarefy air domestic cattle occasionally develop first rib closely approach the form observe in bison such be the sad end of the bison and the cuzco man who at one time i think might be forty thousand year old and now believe to have be two hundred year old perhaps the word ayahuaycco in quichua mean the valley of dead body or dead man 's gulch there be a story that it be use as a burial place for plague victim in cuzco not more than three generation ago chapter viii the oldest city in south america cuzco the oldest city in south america have change completely since squier 's visit in fact it have alter considerably since my own first impression of it be publish in across south america to be sure there be still the evidence of antiquity to be see on every side on the other hand there be correspond evidence of advancement telephone electric light street car and the movie have come to stay the street be cleaner if the modern traveler find fault with some of the condition he encounter he must remember that many of the achievement of the people of ancient cuzco be not yet duplicated in he own country nor have they ever be equal in any other part of the world and modern cuzco be steadily progress the great square in front of the cathedral be completely metamorphose by prefect nuñez in 1911 concrete walk and bed of bright flower have replace the market and the old cobblestone paving and make the plaza a favorite promenade of the citizen on pleasant evening the principal market-place now be the plaza of san francisco it be crowd with booth of every description nearly all of the food-stuff and utensil use by the indian may be buy here frequently throng with indian buy and sell argue and jabber it afford particularly in the early morning a never-ending source of entertainment to one who be fond of the picturesque and interested in strange manners and custom the retail merchant of cuzco follow the very old custom of congregate by class in one street be the dealer in hat in another those who sell coca the dressmaker and tailor be nearly all in one long arcade in a score or more of dark little shop they light seem to come entirely from the front door the occupant be operator of american sewing-machine who not only make clothing to order but always have on hand a large assortment of standard size and pattern in another arcade be the shop of those who

accordingly surgeon nelson set up a laboratory in the hotel central he subject be the unwilling victim of friendly gendarme who go out into the street with order to bring for examination only pure-blooded quichua most of the indian show no resentment and be in the end pleased and surprised to find themselves the recipient of a small silver coin as compensation for loss of time one might have suppose that a large proportion of dr nelson 's subject would have claim cuzco as they native place but this be not the case actually fewer indian come from the city itself than from relatively small town like anta huaracondo and mara this may have be due to a number of cause in the first place the gendarme may have prefer to arrest stranger from distant village who would submit more willingly secondly the city folk be presumably more likely to be in they shop attend to they business or watch they wares in the plaza a occupation which the gendarme could not interrupt on the other hand it be also probably true that the resident of cuzco be of more mixed descent than those of remote village where even to-day one can not find more than two or three individual who speak spanish furthermore the attention of the gendarme might have be draw more easily to the quaintly caparisoned indian temporarily in from the country where city fashion do not prevail than to those who through long residence in the city have learn to adopt a costume more in accordance with european notion in 1870 accord to squier seven eighth of the population of cuzco be still pure indian even to-day a large proportion of the individual whom one see in the street appear to be of pure aboriginal ancestry of these we find that many be visitor from outlying village cuzco be the mecca of the most densely populated part of the ande probably a large part of its citizen be of mixed spanish and quichua ancestry the spanish conquistador do not bring european woman with they nearly all take native wife the spanish race be compose of such a extraordinary mixture of people from europe and northern africa celt iberian roman and goth as well as carthaginian berber and moor that the hispanic people have far less antipathy toward intermarriage with the american race than have the anglo-saxon and teuton of northern europe consequently there have go on for century intermarriage of spaniard and indian with result which be difficult to determine some writer have say there be once 200000 people in cuzco with primitive method of transportation it would be very difficult to feed so many furthermore in 1559 there be accord to montesino only 20000 indian in cuzco one of the charm of cuzco be the juxtaposition of old and new street car clang over steel rail carry crowd of well-dressed

elaborately carve stonework which be so greatly desire by ecclesiastical architect of the sixteenth century as compare with the dense diorite which be extensively use by the inca the basalt weather

ancient axiom men sana in corpore sano modern cuzco be a city of about 20000 people although it be the political capital of the most important department in southern peru it have in 1911 only one hospital -- a semi-public non-sectarian organization on the west of the city next door to the largest cemetery in fact so far away be it from everything else and so close to the cemetery that the funeral wreath and the more prominent monument be almost the only interesting thing which the patient have to look at the building have large courtyard and open colonnade which would afford ideal condition for patient able to take advantage of open-air treatment at the time of surgeon erving 's visit he find the patient be all keep in ward whose window be small and practically always close and shutter so that the atmosphere be close and the light insufficient one could hardly imagine a stronger contrast than exist between such ward and those to which we be accustom in the united state where the maximum of sunlight and fresh air be seek and patient be encourage to sit out-of-door and even have they cot on porch there be no resident physician the utmost care be take throughout the hospital to have everything as dark as possible thus conform to the ancient mountain tradition regard the evil effect of sunlight and fresh air needless to say the hospital have a high mortality and a very poor local reputation yet it be the only hospital in the department outside of cuzco in all the town we visit there be no provision for care for the sick except in they own home in the larger place there be shop where some of the more common drug may be obtain but in the great majority of town and village no modern medicine can be purchase no wonder president giesecke of the university be urge

whether it represent the last effort of a die dynasty to erect a suitable residence for titu cusus 's cousin it be carefully preserve by don cesare lomellinus the leading business man of cuzco a merchant prince of italian origin who be at once a banker a exporter of hide and other country produce and a importer of merchandise of every description include pencil and sugar mill lumber and hat candy and hardware he be also a amateur of spanish colonial furniture as well as of the beautiful pottery of the inca furthermore he have always find time to turn aside from the press care of he large

important a factor be he in the success of we expedition that he deserve to be gratefully remember by all friend of exploration above he country house at colcampa be the hill of sacsahuaman it be possible to scramble up its face but only by make more exertion than be desirable at this altitude 11900 foot the easiest way to reach the famous fortress be by follow the course of the little tullumayu feeble stream the easternmost of the three canalize stream which divide cuzco into four part on its bank one first pass a tannery and then a short distance up a steep gorge the remains of a old mill the stone flume and the adjoining ruin be commonly ascribe by the people of cuzco to-day to the inca but do not look to I like inca stonework since the inca do not understand the mechanical principle of the wheel it be hardly likely that they would have know how to make any use of water power finally careful examination of the flume disclose the presence of lead cement a substance unknown in inca masonry a little farther up the stream one pass through a massive megalithic gateway and find one 's self in the presence of the astounding gray-blue cyclopean wall of sacsahuaman describe in across south america here the ancient builder construct three great terrace which extend one above another for a third of a mile across the hill between two deep gulch the lowest terrace of the fortress be face with colossal boulder many of which weigh ten ton and some weigh more than twenty ton yet all be fit together with the utmost precision i have visit sacsahuaman repeatedly each time it invariably overwhelm and astound to a superstitious indian who see these wall for the first time they must seem to have be build by god about a mile northeast of sacsahuaman be several small artificial hill partly cover with vegetation which seem to be compose entirely of gray-blue rock chip -- chip from the great limestone block quarry here for the fortress and later convey with the utmost pain down to sacsahuaman they represent the labor of countless thousand of quarryman even in modern time with steam drill explosive steel tool and light railway these hill would be noteworthy but when one pause to consider that none of these mechanical device be know to the ancient stonemason and that these mountain of stone chip be make with stone tool and be all carry from the quarry by hand it fairly stagger the imagination the ruin of sacsahuaman represent not only a incredible amount of human labor but also a very remarkable governmental organization that thousand of people could have be spare from agricultural pursuit for so long a time as be necessary to extract the block from the quarry hew they to the require shape transport they several mile over rough country and bond they together in such a intricate manner mean that the leader have the brain and ability to organize and arrange the affair of a very large population such a folk could hardly have spend much time in drilling or prepare for warfare they building operation require infinite pain endless time and devoted skill such quality could hardly have be call forth even by powerful monarch have not the result be please to the great majority of they people people who be primarily agriculturist they have learn to avert hunger and famine by rely on carefully build stone-faced terrace which would prevent they field be carry off and spread over the plain of the amazon it seem to I possible that sacsahuaman be build in accordance with they desire to please they god be it not reasonable to suppose that a people to whom stone-faced terrace mean so much in the way of life-giving food should have sometimes build massive terrace of cyclopean character like sacsahuaman as a offering to the deity who first teach they terrace construction this seem to I a more likely object for the gigantic labor involve in the construction of sacsahuaman than its possible usefulness as a fortress equally strong defens against a enemy attempt to attack the hilltop back of cuzco might have be construct of smaller stone in a infinitely shorter time with far less labor and pain such a display of the power to control the labor of thousand of individual and force they to superhuman effort on a unproductive undertaking which in its agricultural or strategic result be out of all proportion to the obvious cost might have be cause by the supreme vanity of a great soldier on the other hand the ancient peruvian be religious rather than warlike more inclined to worship the sun than to fight great battle be sacsahuaman due to the desire to please at whatever cost the god that fructify the crop which grow on terrace it be not surprising that the spanish conqueror warrior themselves and descendant of twenty generation of a fight race accustom as they be to the salient of european fortress should have look upon sacsahuaman as a fortress to they the military use of its bastion be perfectly obvious the value of its salient and reëntrant angle be not likely to be overlook for it have be only recently acquire by they crusading ancestor the height and strength of its powerful wall enable it to be of the greatest service to the soldier of that day they see that it be virtually impregnable for any artillery with which they be familiar in fact in the war of the inca and those which follow pizarro 's entry into cuzco sacsahuaman be repeatedly use as a fortress so it probably never occur to the spaniard that the peruvian who know nothing of explosive powder or the use of artillery do not construct sacsahuaman in order to withstand such a siege as the fortress of europe be only too familiar with so natural do it seem to the first european who see it to regard it as a fortress that it have seldom be think of in any other way the fact that the sacred city of cuzco be more likely to be attack by invader come up the valley or even over the gentle slope from the west or through the pass from the north which for century have be use as part of the main highway of the central ande never seem to have trouble writer who regard sacsahuaman essentially as a fortress it may be that sacsahuaman be once use as a place where the votary of the sun gather at the end of the rainy season to celebrate the vernal equinox and at the summer solstice to pray for the sun 's return from he farthest north in any case i believe that the enormous cost of its construction show that it be probably intend for religious rather than military purpose it be more likely to have be a ancient shrine than a mighty fortress it now become necessary in order to explain my exploration north of cuzco to ask the reader 's attention to a brief account of the last four inca who rule over any part of peru chapter ix the last four inca reader of prescott 's charming classic the conquest of peru will remember that pizarro after kill atahualpa the inca who have try in vain to avoid he fate by fill a room with vessel of gold decide to establish a native prince on the throne of the inca to rule in accordance with the dictate of spain the young prince manco a son of the great inca huayna capac name for the first inca manco ccapac the founder of the dynasty be select as the most acceptable figurehead he be a young man of ability and spirit he induction into office in 1534 with appropriate ceremony the barbaric splendor of which only make the farce the more pitiful do little to gratify he natural ambition as might have be foresee he chafe under restraint escape as soon as possible from he attentive guardian and raise a army of faithful quichua there follow the siege of cuzco briefly characterize by don alonzo enrique de guzman who take part in it as the most fearful and cruel war in the world when in 1536 cuzco be relieve by pizarro 's comrade almagro and manco 's last chance of regain the ancient capital of he ancestor fail the inca retreat to ollantaytambo here on the bank of the river urubamba manco make a determine stand but ollantaytambo be too easily reach by pizarro 's mount cavalier the inca 's follower although arouse to they utmost endeavor by the presence of the magnificent stone edifice fortress granary palace and hang garden of they ancestor find it necessary to retreat they flee in a northerly direction and make good they escape over snowy pass to uitico in the fastness of uilcapampa a veritable american switzerland ------ figure glacier between cuzco and uitico ------ the spaniard who attempt to follow manco find he position practically impregnable the citadel of uilcapampa a gigantic natural fortress defend by nature in one of she profoundest mood be only to be reach by ford dangerous torrent or cross the mountain by narrow defile which themselves be higher than the most lofty peak of europe it be hazardous for hannibal and napoleon to bring they army through the comparatively low pass of the alp pizarro find it impossible to follow the inca manco over the pass of panticallum itself a snowy wilderness higher than the summit of mont blanc in no part of the peruvian ande be there so many beautiful snowy peak near by be the sharp

scarcely ever be see except by some hardy prospector or inquisitive explorer these valley be to be reach only through pass where the traveler be likely to be waylay by violent storm of hail and snow during the rainy season a large part of uilcapampa be absolutely impenetrable even in the dry season the difficulty of transportation be very great the most sure-footed mule be sometimes unable to use the trail without assistance from man it be a ideal place for the inca manco the conquistador cieza de leon who write in 1550 a graphic account of the war of peru say that manco take with he a great quantity of treasure collect from various part and many load of rich clothing of wool delicate in texture and very beautiful and showy the spaniard be absolutely unable to conceive of the ruler of a country travel without rich treasure it be extremely doubtful whether manco burden himself with much gold or silver except for ornament there be little use to which he could have put the precious metal and they would have serve only to arouse the cupidity of he enemy he people have never be pay in gold or silver they labor be he due and only such part of it as be need to raise they own crop and make they own clothing be allot to they in fact they life be in he hand and the custom and usage of century make they faithful follower of they great chief that manco however actually do carry off with he beautiful textile and anything else which be useful may be take for grant in uitico safe from the armed force of he enemy the inca be also able to enjoy the benefit of a delightful climate and be in a well-watered region where corn potato both white and sweet and the fruit of the temperate and sub-tropical region easily grow use this as a base he be accustom to sally forth against the spaniard frequently and in unexpected direction he raid be usually successful it be relatively easy for he with a handful of follower to dash out of the mountain fastness cross the apurimac river either by swim or on primitive raft and reach the great road between cuzco and lima the principal highway of peru official and merchant whose business lead they over this route find it extremely precarious manco cheer he follower by make they realize that in these raid they be take sweet revenge on the spaniard for what they have do to peru it be interesting to note that cieza de leon justify manco in he attitude for the spaniard have indeed seize he inheritance force he to leave he native land and to live in banishment manco 's success in secure such a place of refuge and in use it as a base from which he could frequently annoy he enemy lead many of the orejone of cuzco to follow he the inca chief be call orejone big ear by the spaniard because the lobe of they ear have be enlarged artificially to receive the great gold earring which they be fond of wear three year after manco 's retirement to the wild of uilcapampa there be bear in cuzco in the year 1539 garcilasso inca de la vega the son of a inca princess and one of the conquistador as a small child garcilasso hear of the activity of he royal relative he leave peru as a boy and spend the rest of he life in spain after forty year in europe he write partly from memory he royal commentary a account of the country of he indian ancestor of the inca manco of whom he must frequently have hear uncomplimentary report as a child he speak apologetically he say : in the time of manco inca several robbery be commit on the road by he subject but still they have that respect for the spanish merchant that they let they go free and never pillage they of they wares and merchandise which be in no manner useful to they howsoever they rob the indian of they cattle -lrb- llama and alpaca -rrb- breed in the countrey the inca live in the mountain which afford no tame cattel and only produce tiger and lion and serpent of twenty-five and thirty foot long with other venomous insect -lrb- i be quote from sir paul rycaut 's translation publish in london in 1688 -rrb- garcilasso say manco 's soldier take only such food as they find in the hand of the indian which the inca do usually call he own say that he who be master of that whole empire might lawfully challenge such a proportion thereof as be convenient to supply he necessary and natural support -- a reasonable apology and yet personally i doubt whether manco spare the spanish merchant and fail to pillage they of they wares and merchandise as will be see later we find in manco 's palace some metal article of european origin which might very well have be take by manco 's raider furthermore it should be remember that garcilasso although often quote by prescott leave peru when he be sixteen year old and that he idea be largely color by he long life in spain and he natural desire to extol the virtue of he mother 's people a brown race despise by the white european for whom he write the method of warfare and the weapon use by manco and he follower at this time be thus describe by guzman he say the indian have no defensive arm such as helmet shield and armor but use lance arrow dub axis halberd dart and sling and another weapon which they call aylla -lrb- the bola -rrb- consist of three round stone sew up in leather and each fasten to a cord a cubit long they throw these at the horse and thus bind they leg together and sometimes they will fasten a man 's arm to he side in the same way these indian be so expert in the use of this weapon that they will bring down a deer with it in the chase they principal weapon however be the sling with it they will hurl a huge stone with such force that it will kill a horse in truth the effect be little less great than that of a arquebus and i have see a stone thus hurl from a sling break a sword in two piece which be hold in a man 's hand at a distance of thirty pace manco 's raid finally become so annoying that pizarro send a small force from cuzco under captain villadiego to attack the inca captain villadiego find it impossible to use horse although he realize that cavalry be the important arm against these indian confident in he strength and in the efficacy of he firearm and anxious to enjoy the spoil of a successful raid against a chief report to be travel surround by he family and with rich treasure he press eagerly on up through a lofty valley toward a defile in the mountain probably the pass of panticallum here fatigue and exhaust by they difficult march and suffer from the effect of the altitude -lrb- 16000 ft -rrb- he man find themselves ambush by the inca who with a small party little more than eighty indian attack the christian who number twenty-eight or thirty and kill captain villadiego and all he man except two or three to any one who have clamber over the pass of the cordillera uilcapampa it be not surprising that this military expedition be a failure or that the inca warn by keen-sighted indian post on appropriate vantage point could have succeed in defeat a small force of weary soldier arm with the heavy blunderbuss of the seventeenth century in a rocky pass protect by huge boulder and surround by quantity of natural ammunition for they sling it must have be relatively simple for eighty quichua who could hurl a huge stone with such force that it would kill a horse to have literally stone to death captain villadiego 's little company before they could have prepare they clumsy weapon for firing ------ figure the urubamba canyon a reason for the safety of the inca in uilcapampa ------ the fugitive return to cuzco and report they misfortune the importance of the reverse will be better appreciate if one remember that the size of the force with which pizarro conquer peru be less than two hundred only a few time larger than captain villadiego 's company which have be wipe out by manco its significance be further increase by the fact that the contemporary spanish writer with all they tendency to exaggerate place manco 's force at only a little more than eighty indian probably there be not even that many the wonder be that the inca 's army be not report as be several thousand francisco pizarro himself now hastily set out with a body of soldier determine to punish this young inca who have inflict such a blow on the prestige of spanish arm but this attempt also fail for the inca have withdraw across the river and mountain of uilcapampa to uitico where accord to cieza de leon he cheer he follower with the sight of the head of he enemy unfortunately for accuracy the custom of display on the end of pike the head of one 's enemy be european and not peruvian to be sure the savage indian of some of the amazonian jungle do sometimes decapitate they enemy remove the bone of the skull dry the shrunken scalp and face and wear the trophy as a mark of prowess just as the north american indian do the scalp of they enemy such custom have no place among the peace-loving inca agriculturist of central peru there be no spaniard live with manco at that time to report any such outrage on the body of captain villadiego 's unfortunate man probably the conquistador suppose that manco do what the spaniard would have do under similar circumstance follow the failure of francisco pizarro to penetrate to uitico he brother gonzalo undertake the pursuit of the inca and occupy some of he pass and bridge but be unsuccessful in penetrate the mountain labyrinth be less foolhardy than captain villadiego he do not come into actual conflict with manco unable to subdue the young inca or prevent he raid on traveler from cuzco to lima francisco pizarro with the assent of the royal officer who be with he establish the city of ayacucho at a convenient point on the road so as to make it secure for traveler nevertheless accord to montesino manco cause the good people of ayacucho quite a little trouble finally francisco pizarro have take one of manco 's wife prisoner with other indian strip and flog she and then shoot she to death with arrow account of what happen in uitico under the rule of manco be not very satisfactory father calancha who publish in 1639 he coronica moralizada or pious account of the missionary activity of the augustinian in peru say that the inca manco be obey by all the indian who live in a region extend for two hundred league and more toward the east and toward the south where there be innumerable indian in various province with customary monastic zeal and proper religious fervor father calancha accuse the inca of compelling the baptize indian who flee to he from the spaniard to abandon they new faith torture those who would no longer worship the old inca idol this story need not be take too literally although undoubtedly the escape indian act as though they have never be baptize besides indian flee from harsh master there come to uilcapampa in 1542 gomez perez diego mendez and half a dozen other spanish fugitive adherent of almagro rascal say calancha worthy of manco 's favor oblige by the civil war of the conquistador to flee from the pizarro they be glad enough to find a welcome in uitico to while away the time they play game and teach the inca checkers and chess as well as bowling-on-the-green and quoit montesino say they also teach he to ride horseback and shoot a arquebus they take they game very seriously and occasionally violent dispute arise one of which as we shall see be to have fatal consequence they be keep inform by manco of what be go on in the viceroyalty although encompass within craggy and lofty mountain the inca be thoroughly cognizant of all those revolution which might be of benefit to he perhaps the most exciting news that reach uitico in 1544 be in regard to the arrival of the first spanish viceroy he bring the new law a result of the effort of the good bishop las casas to alleviate the suffering of the indian the new law provide among other thing that all the officer of the crown be to renounce they repartimiento or holding of indian serf and that compulsory personal service be to be entirely abolish repartimiento give to the conqueror be not to pass to they heir but be to revert to the king in other word the new law give evidence that the spanish crown wish to be kind to the indian and do not approve of the pizarro this be good news for manco and highly please to the refugee they persuade the inca to write a letter to the new viceroy ask permission to appear before he and offer he service to the king the spanish refugee tell the inca that by this mean he might some day recover he empire or at least the best part of it they object in persuade the inca to send such a message to the viceroy become apparent when we learn that they also write as from themselves desire a pardon for what be past and permission to return to spanish dominion gomez perez who seem to have be the active leader of the little group be select to be the bearer of the letter from the inca and the refugee attend by a dozen indian whom the inca instruct to act as he servant and bodyguard he leave uilcapampa present he letter to the viceroy and give he a large relation of the state and condition of the inca and of he true and real design to doe he service the vice-king joyfully receive the news and grant a full and ample pardon of all crime as desire and as to the inca he make many kind expression of love and respect truly consider that the interest of the inca might be advantageous to he both in war and peace and with this satisfactory answer gomez perez return both to the inca and to he companion the refugee be delighted with the news and get ready to return to king and country they departure from uitico be prevent by a tragic accident thus describe by garcilasso the inca to humor the spaniard and entertain himself with they have give direction for make a bowling-green where play one day with gomez perez he come to have some quarrel and difference with this perez about the measure of a cast which often happen between they for this perez be a person of a hot and fiery brain without any judgment or understanding would take the least occasion in the world to contend with and provoke the inca be no longer able to endure he rudeness the inca punch he on the breast and bid he to consider with whom he talk perez not consider in he heat and passion either he own safety or the safety of he companion lift up he hand and with the bowl strike the inca so violently on the head that he knock he down -lrb- he die three day later -rrb- the indian hereupon be enrage by the death of they prince join together against gomez and the spaniard who flee into a house and with they sword in they hand defend the door the indians set fire to the house which be too hot for they they sally out into the marketplace where the indian assault they and shoot they with they arrow until they have kill every man of they and then afterwards out of mere rage and fury they design either to eat they raw as they custome be or to burn they and cast they ash into the river that no sign or appearance might remain of they but at length after some consultation they agree to cast they body into the open field to be devour by vulter and bird of the air which they suppose to be the highest indignity and dishonor that they could show to they corps garcilasso conclude : i inform myself very perfectly from those chief and noble who be present and eye-witness of the unparalleled piece of madness of that rash and hair-brained fool and hear they tell this story to my mother and parent with tear in they eye there be many version of the tragedy -lrb- 4 -rrb- they all agree that a spaniard murder the inca thus in 1545 the reign of a attractive and vigorous personality be bring to a abrupt close manco leave three young son sayri tupac titu cusus and tupac amaru sayrus tupac although he have not yet reach he majority become inca in he father 's stead and with the aid of regent reign for ten year without disturb he spanish neighbor or be annoy by they unless the reference in montesino to a propose burning of bridge near abancay under date of 1555 be correct by a curious lapse montesino ascribe this attempt to the inca manco who have be dead for ten year in 1555 there come to lima a new viceroy who decide that it would be safer if young sayrus tupac be within reach instead of live in the inaccessible wild of uilcapampa the viceroy wisely undertake to accomplish this difficult matter through the princess beatrix coya a aunt of the inca who be live in cuzco she take kindly to the suggestion and dispatch to uitico a messenger of the blood royal attend by indian servant the journey be a dangerous one bridge be down and the treacherous trail be well-nigh impassable sayrus tupac 's regent permit the messenger to enter uilcapampa and deliver the viceroy 's invitation but be not incline to believe that it be quite so attractive as appear on the surface even though bring to they by a kinsman accordingly they keep the visitor as a hostage and send a messenger of they own to cuzco to see if any foul play could be discover and also to request that one john sierra a more trust cousin be send to treat in this matter all this take time in 1558 the viceroy become impatient dispatch from lima friar melchior and one john betanzo who have marry the daughter of the unfortunate inca atahualpa and pretend to be very learn in he wife 's language montesino say he be a great linguist they start off quite confidently for uitico take with they several piece of velvet and damask and two cup of gilded silver as present anxious to secure the honor of be the first to reach the inca they travel as fast as they could to the chuquichaca bridge the key to the valley of uitico here they be detain by the soldier of the regent a day or so later john sierra the inca 's cousin from cuzco arrive at the bridge and be allow to proceed while the friar and betanzo be still detain john sierra be welcome by the inca and he noble and do he best to encourage sayrus tupac to accept the viceroy 's offer finally john betanzo and the friar be also send for and admit to the presence of the inca with the present which the viceroy have send sayrus tupac 's first idea be to remain free and independent as he have hitherto do so he request the ambassador to depart immediately with they silver gilt cup they be send back by one of the western route across the apurimac a few day later however after john sierra have tell he some interesting story of life in cuzco the inca decide to reconsider the matter he regent have a long debate observe the flying of bird and the nature of the weather but accord to garcilasso make no inquiry of the devil the omen be favorable and the regent finally decide to allow the inca to accept the invitation of the viceroy sayrus tupac anxious to see something of the world go directly to lima travel in a litter make of rich material carry by relay choose from the three hundred indian who attend he he be kindly receive by the viceroy and then go to cuzco where he lodge in he aunt 's house here he relative go to welcome he i myself say garcilasso go in the name of my father i find he then play a certain game use amongst the indian i kiss he hand and deliver my message he command I to sit down and presently they bring two gilded cup of that liquor make of mayz -lrb- chicha -rrb- which scarce contain four ounce of drink he take they both and with he own hand he give one of they to I he drink and i pledge he which as we have say be the custom of civility amongst they this ceremony be past he ask I why i do not meet he at uillcapampa i answer he ` inca as i be but a youngman the governor make no account of I to place I in such ceremony as these ' ` how ' reply the inca ' i would rather have see you than all the frier and father in town ' as i be go away i make he a submissive bow and reverence after the manner of the indian who be of he alliance and kindred at which he be so much pleased that he embrace I heartily and with much affection as appear by he countenance sayri tupac now receive the sacred red fringe of inca sovereignty be marry to a princess of the blood royal join she in baptism and take up he abode in the beautiful valley of yucay a day 's journey northeast of cuzco and never return to uitico he only daughter finally marry a certain captain garcium of whom more anon sayrus tupac die in 1560 leave two brother the older titu cusus yupanquus illegitimate and the younger tupac amaru he rightful successor a inexperienced youth ------ figure yucay last home of sayrus tupac ------ the throne of uitico be seize by titu cusi the new inca seem to have be suspicious of the untimely death of sayrus tupac and to have feel that the spaniard be capable of more foul play so with he half-brother he stay quietly in uilcapampa they first visitor so far as we know be diego rodriguez de figueroa who write a interesting account of uitico and say he give the inca a pair of scissors he be unsuccessful in he effort to get titu cusi to go to cuzco in time there come a augustinian missionary friar marco garcium who six year after the death of sayrus tupac enter the rough country of uilcapampa a land of moderate wealth large river and the usual rain whose forested mountain say father calancha be magnificent friar marco have a hard journey the bridge be down the road have be destroy and the pass block up the few indian who do occasionally appear in cuzco from uilcapampa say the friar could not get there unless he should be able to change himself into a bird however with that courage and pertinacity which have mark so many missionary enterprise friar marco finally overcome all difficulty and reach uitico the missionary chronicler say that titu cusus be far from glad to see he and receive he angrily it worry he to find that a spaniard have succeed in penetrate he retreat besides the inca be annoy to have any one preach against he idolatry titu cusus 's own story as write down by friar marco do not agree with calancha 's anyhow friar marco build a little church in a place call puquiura where many of the inca 's people be then live he plant cross in the field and on the mountain these be the best thing to frighten off devil he suffer many insult at the hand of the chief and principal follower of the inca some of they do it to please the devil other to flatter the inca and many because they dislike he sermon in which he scold they for they vice and abominate among he convert the possession of four or six wife so they punish he in the matter of food and force he to send to cuzco for victuals the convent send he hard-tack which be for he a most delicious banquet within a year or so another augustinian missionary friar diego ortiz leave cuzco alone for uilcapampa he suffer much on the road but finally reach the retreat of the inca and enter he presence in company with friar marco although the inca be not too happy to see a new preacher he be willing to grant he a entrance because the inca thought friar diego would not vex he nor take the trouble to reprove he so the inca give he a license they select the town of huarancallum which be populous and well located in the midst of a number of other little town and village there be a distance of two or three day journey from one convent to the other leave friar marco in puquiura friar diego go to he new establishment and in a short time build a church a house for himself and a hospital -- all poor building make in a short time he also start a school for child and become very popular as he go about healing and teaching he have a easier time than friar marco who with less tact and no skill as a physician be located nearer the center of the inca cult the principal shrine of the inca be describe by father calancha as follow : close to vitco -lrb- or uitico -rrb- in a village call chuquipalpa be a house of the sun and in it a white rock over a spring of water where the devil appear as a visible manifestation and be worship by those idolator this be the principal mochadero of those forested mountain the word ` mochadero ' -lrb- 5 -rrb- be the common name which the indian apply to they place of worship in other word it be the only place where they practice the sacred ceremony of kiss the origin of this the principal part of they ceremonial be that very practice which job abominate when he solemnly clear himself of all offence before god and say to he : ` lord all these punishment and even greater burden would i have deserve have i do that which the blind gentile do when the sun rise resplendent or the moon shine clear and they exult in they heart and extend they hand toward the sun and throw kiss to it ' a act of very grave iniquity which be equivalent to deny the true god thus do the ecclesiastical chronicler refer to the practice in peru of that particular form of worship of the heavenly body which be also widely spread in the east in arabium and palestine and be inveigh against by mohamm as well as the ancient hebrew prophet apparently this ceremony of the most profound resignation and reverence be practice in chuquipalpa close to uitico in the reign of the inca titu cusus calancha go on to say : in this white stone of the aforesaid house of the sun which be call yurac rumus -lrb- meaning in quichua a white rock -rrb- there attend a devil who be captain of a legion he and he legionary show great kindness to the indian idolator but great terror to the catholic they abuse with hideous cruelty the baptize one who now no longer worship they with kiss and many of the indian have die from the horrible fright these devil have give they one day when the inca and he mother and they principal chief and counselor be away from uitico on a visit to some of they outlying estate friar marco and friar diego decide to make a spectacular attack on this particular devil who be at the great white rock over a spring of water the two monk summon all they convert to gather at puquiura in the church or the neighbor plaza and ask each to bring a stick of firewood in order that they might burn up this devil who have torment they a innumerable multitude come together on the day appoint the convert indian be most anxious to get even with this devil who have slay they friend and inflict wound on themselves the doubter be curious to see the result the inca priest be there to see they god defeat the christian ' while as may readily be imagine the rest of the population come to see the excitement start out from pucyura they march to the temple of the sun in the village of chuquipalpa close to uitico arrive at the sacred palisade the monk raise the standard of the cross recite they orison surround the spring the white rock and the temple of the sun and pile high the firewood then have exorcise the locality they call the devil by all the vile name they could think of to show they lack of respect and finally command he never to return to this vicinity call on christ and the virgin they apply fire to the wood the poor devil then flee roaring in a fury and make the mountain to tremble it take remarkable courage on the part of the two lone monk thus to desecrate the chief shrine of the people among whom they be dwelling it be almost incredible that in this remote valley separate from they friend and far from the protect hand of the spanish viceroy they should have dare to commit such a insult to the religion of they host of course as soon as the inca titu cusus hear of it he be greatly annoyed he mother be furious they return immediately to pucyura the chief wish to slay the monk and tear they into small piece and undoubtedly would have do so have it not be for the regard in which friar diego be hold he skill in cure disease have so endeared he to the indian that even the inca himself dare not punish he for the attack on the temple of the sun friar marco however who probably originate the plan and have do little to gain the good will of the indian do not fare so well calancha say he be stone out of the province and the inca threaten to kill he if he ever should return friar diego particularly beloved by those indian who come from the fever-stricken jungle in the lower valley be allow to remain and finally become a trust friend and adviser of titu cusi one day a spaniard name romero a adventurous prospector for gold be find penetrate the mountain valley and succeed in get permission from the inca to see what mineral be there he be too successful both gold and silver be find among the hill and he show enthusiastic delight at he good fortune the inca fear that he report might encourage other to enter uilcapampa put the unfortunate prospector to death notwithstanding the protestation of friar diego foreigner be not want in uilcapampa in the year 1570 ten year after the accession of titu cusi to the inca throne in uitico a new spanish viceroy come to cuzco unfortunately for the inca don francisco de toledo a indefatigable soldier and administrator be excessively bigoted narrow-minded cruel and pitiless furthermore philip ii and he council of the indy have decide that it would be worth while to make every effort to get the inca out of uitico for thirty-five year the spanish conqueror have occupy cuzco and the major portion of peru without have be able to secure the submission of the indian who live in the province of uilcapampa it would be a great feather in the cap of toledo if he could induce titu cusus to come and live where he would always be accessible to spanish authority during the ensue rainy season after a unusually lively party the inca get soak have a chill and be lay low in the meantime the viceroy have pick out a cuzco soldier one tilano de anaya who be well like by the inca to try to persuade titu cusus to come to cuzco tilano be instruct to go by way of ollantaytambo and the chuquichaca bridge luck be against he titu cusi 's illness be very serious friar diego he physician have prescribe the usual remedy unfortunately all the monk 's skill be unavailing and he royal patient die the remedy be hold by titu cusus 's mother and she counselor to be responsible the poor friar have to suffer the penalty of death for have cause the death of the inca the third son of manco tupac amaru bring up as a playfellow of the virgin of the sun in the temple near uitico and now happily marry be select to rule the little kingdom he brow be deck with the scarlet fringe of sovereignty but thanks to the jealous fear of he powerful illegitimate brother he training have not be that of a soldier he be destine to have a brief unhappy existence when the young inca 's counselor hear that a messenger be come from the viceroy seven warrior be send to meet he on the road tilano be prepare to spend the night at the chuquichaca bridge when he be attack and kill the viceroy hear of the murder of he ambassador at the same time that he learn of the martyrdom of friar diego a blow have be strike at the very heart of spanish domination if the representative of the vice-regent of heaven and the messenger of the viceroy of philip ii be not inviolable then who be safe on palm Sunday the energetic toledo surround by he council determine to make war on the unfortunate young tupac amaru and give a reward to the soldier who would effect he capture the council be of the opinion that many insurrection might be raise in that empire by this young heir moreover it be alledged say garcilasso that by the imprisonment of the inca all that treasure might be discover which appertain to former king together with that chain of gold which huayna capac command to be make for himself to wear on the great and solemn day of they festival furthermore the chain of gold with the remain treasure belong would to he catholic majesty by right of conquest excuse be not want the inca must be exterminate the expedition be divide into two part one company be send by way of limatambo to curahuasus to head off the inca in case he should cross the apurimac and try to escape by one of the route which have formerly be use by he father manco in he maraud expedition the other company under general martin hurtado and captain garcium march from cuzco by way of yucay and ollantaytambo they be more fortunate than captain villadiego whose force thirty-five year before have be meet and destroy at the pass of panticallum that be in the day of the active inca manco now there be no force defend this important pass they descend the lucumayo to its junction with the urubamba and come to the bridge of chuquichaca the narrow suspension bridge build of native fiber sag deeply in the middle and sway so threateningly over the gorge of the urubamba that only one man could pass it at a time the rapid river be too deep to be ford there be no canoe it would have be a difficult matter to have construct raft for most of the tree that grow here be of hard wood and do not float on the other side of the urubamba be young tupac amaru surround by he councilor chief and soldier the first hostile force which in pizarro 's time have endeavor to fight they way into uilcapampa have never be allow by manco to get as far as this he youngest son tupac amaru have have no experience in these matter the chief and noble have fail to defend the pass and they now fail to destroy the chuquichaca bridge apparently rely on they ability to take care of one spanish soldier at a time and prevent the spaniard from cross the narrow sway structure general hurtado be not take any such chance he have bring with he one or two light mountain field piece with which the raw troops of the inca be little acquaint the side of the valley at this point rise steeply from the river and the reverberation cause by gun fire would be fairly terrifying to those who have never hear anything like it before a few volley from the gun and the arquebus and the indian flee pellmell in every direction leave the bridge undefended captain garcium who have marry the daughter of sayrus tupac be send in pursuit of the inca he man find the road narrow in the ascent with forest on the right and on the leave a ravine of great depth it be only a footpath barely wide enough for two man to pass garcium with customary spanish bravery march at the head of he company suddenly out of the thick forest a inca chieftain name hualpa endeavor to protect the flight of tupac amaru spring on garcium hold he so that he could not get at he sword and endeavor to hurl he over the cliff the captain 's life be save by a faithful indian servant who be follow immediately behind he carry he sword draw it from the scabbard with much dexterity and animation the indian kill hualpa and save he master 's life garcium fight several battle take some fort and succeed in capture many prisoner from they it be learn that the inca have go inland toward the valley of simaponte and that he be fly to the country of the mañaries indian a warlike tribe and he friend where balsa and canoe be post to save he and enable he to escape nothing daunt by the danger of the jungle nor the rapid of the river garcium finally manage to construct five raft on which he put some of he soldier accompany they himself he descend the rapid escape death many time by swimming and finally arrive at a place call momorus only to find that the inca learning of they approach have go farther into the wood garcium follow hard after although he and he man be by this time barefooted and suffering from want of food they finally capture the inca garcilasso say that tupac amaru consider that he have not people to make resistance and that he be not conscious to himself of any crime or disturbance he have do or raise suffer himself to be take choose rather to entrust himself in the hand of the spaniard than to perish in those mountain with famine or be drown in those great river the spaniard in this manner seize on the inca and on all the indian man and woman who be in company with he amongst which be he wife two son and a daughter return with they in triumph to cuzco to which place the vice-king go so soon as he be inform of the imprisonment of the poor prince a mock trial be hold the capture chief be tortured to death with fiendish brutality tupac amaru 's wife be mangled before he eye he own head be cut off and place on a pole in the cuzco plaza he little boy do not long survive so perish the

prescott call the remote fastness of the ande one look in vain for uitico on modern map of peru although several of the older map give it in 1625 vitico be mark on de laet 's map of peru as a mountainous province northeast of lima and three hundred and fifty mile northwest of vilcabamba this error be copy by some later cartographer include mercator until about 1740 when vitico disappear from all map of peru the map maker have learn that there be no such place in that vicinity its real location be lose about three hundred year ago a map publish at nuremberg in 1599 give pinco in the ande mountain a small range west of cusco this do not seem to have be adopt by other cartographer although a pall map of 1739 give pico in about the same place nearly all the cartographer of the eighteenth century who give vitico suppose it to be the name of a tribe eg los viticos or les viticos ------ figure part of the nuremberg map of 1599 show pinco and the ande mountain ------_VBP the largest official map of peru the work of that remarkable explorer raimondus who spend he life cross and recross peru do not contain the word uitico nor any of its numerous spelling vitico vitco pitco or bitico incidentally it may seem strange that uitico could ever be write bitico the quichua language have no sound of v the early spanish writer however write the capital letter u exactly like a capital v in official document and letter uitico become vitico the official reader who have never hear the word pronounce naturally use the v sound instead of the u sound both v and p easily become b so uiticos become bitico and uilcapampa become vilcabamba raimondus 's marvelous energy lead he to penetrate to more out-of-the-way peruvian village than any one have ever do before or be likely to do again he stop at nothing in the way of natural obstacle in 1865 he go deep into the heart of uilcapampa yet find no uitico he believe that the ruin of choqquequirau represent the residence of the last inca this view have be hold by the french explorer count de sartige in 1834 who believe that choqquequirau be abandon when sayri tupac manco 's oldest son go to live in yucay raimondus 's view be also hold by the lead peruvian geographer include paz soldan in 1877 and by prefect nuñez and he friend in 1909 at the time of my visit to choqquequirau -lrb- 7 -rrb- the only dissenter be the learn peruvian historian don carlo romero who insist that the last inca capital must be find elsewhere he urge the importance of search for uitico in the valley of the river now call vilcabamba and urubamba it be to be the work of the yale peruvian expedition of 1911 to collect the geographical evidence which would meet the requirement of the chronicle and establish the whereabouts of the long-lost inca capital that there be undescribed and unidentified ruin to be find in the urubamba valley be know to a few people in cuzco mostly wealthy planter who have large estate in the province of convencion one tell we that he go to santa ana every year and be acquaint with a muleteer who have tell he of some interesting ruin near the san miguel bridge know the propensity of he countryman to exaggerate however he place little confidence in the story and shrug he shoulder have cross the bridge a score of time without take the trouble to look into the matter another señor pancorbo whose plantation be in the vilcabamba valley say that he have hear vague rumor of ruin in the valley above he plantation particularly near pucyura if he story should prove to be correct then it be likely that this might be the very puquiura where friar marco have establish the first church in the province of uilcapampa but that be near uitico and near a village call chuquipalpa where should be find the ruin of a temple of the sun and in these ruin a white rock over a spring of water yet neither these friendly planter nor the friend among whom they inquire have ever hear of uitico or a place call chuquipalpa or of such a interesting rock nor have they themselves see the ruin of which they have hear one of señor lomellinus 's friend a talkative old fellow who have spend a large part of he life in prospect for mine in the department of cuzco say that he have see ruin finer than choqquequirau at a place call huayna picchu but he have never be to choqquequirau those who know he best shrug they shoulder and do not seem to place much confidence in he word too often he have be over-enthusiastic about mine which do not pan out yet he report resemble that of charle wiener a french explorer who about 1875 in the course of he wanderings in the ande visit ollantaytambo while there he be tell that there be fine ruin down the urubamba valley at a place call huaina-picchu or matcho-picchu he decide to go down the valley and look for these ruin accord to he text he cross the pass of panticallum descend the lucumayo river to the bridge of choqquechacca and visit the lower urubamba return by the same route he publish a detailed map of the valley to one of its peak he give the name huaynapicchu ele 1815 m and to another matchopicchu ele 1720 m he interest in inca ruin be very keen he devote page to ollantaytambo he fail to reach machu picchu or to find any ruin of importance in the urubamba or vilcabamba valley could we hope to be any more successful would the rumor that have reach we pan out as badly as those to which wiener have listen so eagerly since he day to be sure the peruvian government have actually finish a road which lead past machu picchu on the other hand a harvard anthropological expedition under the leadership of dr william c farrabee have recently be over this road without report any ruin of importance they be look for savage and not ruin nevertheless if machu picchu be finer than choqquequirau why have no one point it out to they ------ figure peruvian expedition of 1915 ------ to most of we friend in cuzco the idea that there could be anything finer than choqquequirau seem absurd they regard that cradle of gold as the most remarkable archeological discovery of recent time they assure we there be nothing half so good they even assume that we be secretly plan to return thither to dig for bury treasure denial be of no avail to a people whose ancestor make fortune out of lucky strike and who themselves have be bring up on story of enormous wealth still remain to be discover by some fortunate excavator the question of tesoro -- treasure wealth riches -- be a ever-present source of conversation even the prefect of cuzco be quite unable to conceive of my do anything for the love of discovery he be convince that i should find great riches at choqquequirau -- and that i be in receipt of a very large salary he refuse to believe that the member of the expedition receive no more than they expense he tell I confidentially that professor foote would sell he collection of insect for at least $ 10000 peruvian have not be accustom to see any one do scientific work except as he be pay by the government or employ by a railroad or mining company we have frequently find we work misunderstand and regard with suspicion even by the cuzco historical society the valley of the urubamba or uilcamayu as it use to be call may be reach from cuzco in several way the usual route for those go to yucay be northwest from the city over the great andean highway past the slope of mt sencca at ttica-ttica -lrb- 12000 ft -rrb- the road cross the lowest pass at the western end of the cuzco basin at the last point from which one can see the city of cuzco all true indian whether on they way out of the valley or into it pause turn toward the east face the city remove they hat and mutter a prayer i believe that the word they use now be those of the ave marium or some other familiar orison of the catholic church nevertheless the custom undoubtedly go far back of the advent of the first spanish missionary it be probably a relic of the ancient habit of worship the rise sun during the century immediately precede the conquest the city of cuzco be the residence of the inca himself that divine individual who be at once the head of church and state nothing would have be more natural than for person come in sight of he residence to perform a act of veneration this in turn might have lead those leave the city to fall into the same habit at the same point in the road i have watch hundred of traveler pass this point none of those whose european costume proclaim a white or mixed ancestry stop to pray or make obeisance on the other hand all those without exception who be clothe in a native costume which betoken that they consider themselves to be indian rather than whites pause for a moment gaze at the ancient city remove they hat and say a short prayer leave ttica-ttica we go northward for several league pass the town of chinchero with its old inca wall and come at length to the edge of the wonderful valley of yucay in its bottom be great level terrace rescue from the urubamba river by the untiring energy of the ancient folk on both side of the valley the steep slope bear many remains of narrow terrace some of which be still in use above they be temporale field of grain rest like a patch-work quilt on slope so steep it seem incredible they could be cultivate still higher up they head above the cloud be the jagged snow-capped peak the whole offer a marvelous picture rich in contrast majestic in proportion in yucay once dwell the inca manco 's oldest son sayrus tupac after he have accept the viceroy 's invitation to come under spanish protection here he live three year and here in 1560 he die a untimely death under circumstance which lead he brother titu cusus and tupac amaru to think that they would be safer in uitico we spend the night in urubamba the modern capital of the province much favor by peruvian of to-day because of its abundant water supply delightful climate and rich fruit cuzco 11000 foot be too high to have charming surroundings but two thousand foot lower in the urubamba valley there be everything to please the eye and delight the horticulturist speaking of horticulturist remind I of they enemy uru be the quichua word for caterpillar or grub pampa mean flat land urubamba be flat-land-where-there-are-grubs-or-caterpillar have it be name by people who come up from a warm region where insect abound it would hardly have be so denominate only people not accustom to land where caterpillar and grub flourish would have be strike by such a circumstance consequently the valley be probably name by plateau dweller who be work they way down into a warm region where butterfly and moth be more common notwithstanding its celebrated caterpillar urubamba 's garden of to-day be full of rose lily and other brilliant flower there be orchard of peach pear and apple there be field where luscious strawberry be raise for the cuzco market apparently the grub do not get everything the next day down the valley bring we to romantic ollantaytambo describe in glowing term by castelnau marcou wiener and squier many year ago it have lose none of its charm even though marcou 's drawing be imaginary and squier 's be exaggerate here as at urubamba there be flower garden and highly cultivate green field the brook be shaded by willow and poplar above they be magnificent precipice crown by snow-capped peak the village itself be once the capital of a ancient principality whose history be shroud in mystery there be ruin of curious gabled building storehouse prison or monastery perch here and there on well-nigh inaccessible crag above the village below be broad terrace of unbelievable extent where abundant crop be still harvest terrace which will stand for age to come as monument to the energy and skill of a bygone race the fortress be on a little hill surround by steep cliff high wall and hang garden so as to be difficult of access century ago when the tribe which cultivate the rich field in this valley live in fear and terror of they savage neighbor this hill offer a place of refuge to which they could retire it may have be fortify at that time as century pass in which the land come under the control of the inca whose chief interest be the peaceful promotion of agriculture it be likely that this fortress become a royal garden the six great ashlar of reddish granite weigh fifteen or twenty ton each and place in line on the summit of the hill be bring from a quarry several mile away with a immense amount of labor and pain they be probably intend to be a record of the magnificence of a able ruler not only could he command the service of a sufficient number of man to extract these rock from the quarry and carry they up a inclined plane from the bottom of the valley to the summit of the hill he have to supply the man with food the building of such a monument mean take five hundred indian away from they ordinary occupation as agriculturist he must have be a very good administrator to he people the magnificent megalith be doubtless a source of pride to he enemy they be a symbol of he power and might ------_VB figure mt veronica and salapunco the gateway to uilcapampa ------ a league below ollantaytambo the road fork the right branch ascend a steep valley and cross the pass of panticallum near snow-covered mt veronica near the pass be two group of ruin one of they extravagantly refer to by wiener as a granite palace whose appearance -lrb- appareil -rrb- resemble the more beautiful part of ollantaytambo be only a storehouse the other be probably a tampu or inn for the benefit of official traveler all traveler in inca time even the bearer of burden be act under official order commercial business be unknown the rights of personal property be not understand no one have anything to sell no one have any money to buy it with on the other hand the inca have a elaborate system of tax collect two third of the produce raise by they subject be claim by the civil and religious ruler it be a reasonable provision of the benevolent despotism of the inca that inhospitable region like the panticallum pass near mt veronica should be provide with suitable rest house and storehouse polo de ondegardo a able and accomplished statesman who be in office in cuzco in 1560 say that the food of the chasqui inca post runner be provide from official storehouse those who work for the inca 's service or for religion never eat at they own expense in manco 's day these building at havaspampa probably sheltered the outpost which defeat captain villadiego before the completion of the river road about 1895 traveler from cuzco to the lower urubamba have a choice of two route one by way of the pass of panticallum follow by captain garcium in 1571 by general miller in 1835 castelnau in 1842 and wiener in 1875 and one by way of the pass between mt salcantay and soray along the salcantay river to huadquiña follow by the count de sartige in 1834 and raimondus in 1865 both of these route avoid the highland between mt salcantay and mt veronica and the lowland between the village of pirus and huadquiña this region be in 1911 undescribed in the geographical literature of southern peru we decide not to use either pass but to go straight down the urubamba river road it lead we into a fascinating country two league beyond pirus at salapunco the road skirt the base of precipitous cliff the beginning of a wonderful mass of granite mountain which have make uilcapampa more difficult of access than the surround highland which be compose of schist conglomerate and limestone salapunco be the natural gateway to the ancient province but it be close for century by the combined effort of nature and man the urubamba river in cut its way through the granite range form rapid too dangerous to be passable and precipice which can be scale only with great effort and considerable peril at one time a footpath probably run near the river where the indian by crawl along the face of the cliff and sometimes swing from one ledge to another on hang vine be able to make they way to any of the alluvial terrace down the valley another path may have go over the cliff above the fortress where we notice in various inaccessible place the remains of wall build on narrow ledge they be too narrow and too irregular to have be intend to support agricultural terrace they may have be build to make the cliff more precipitous they probably represent the foundation of a old trail to defend these ancient path we find that prehistoric man have build at the foot of the precipice close to the river a small but powerful fortress whose ruin now pass by the name of salapunco salum = ruin punco = gateway fashion after famous sacsahuaman and resemble it in the irregular character of the large ashlar and also by reason of the salient and reëntrant angle which enable its defender to prevent the wall be successfully scale it present a interesting problem command as it do the entrance to the valley of torontoy salapunco may have be build by some ancient chief to enable he to levy tribute on all who pass my first impression be that the fortress be place here at the end of the temperate zone to defend the valley of urubamba and ollantaytambo against savage enemy come up from the forest of the amazon on the other hand it be possible that salapunco be build by the tribe occupy the fastness of uilcapampa as a outpost to defend they against enemy come down the valley from the direction of ollantaytambo they could easily have hold it against a considerable force for it be powerfully build and construct with skill supplies from the plantation of torontoy lower down the river might have reach it along the path which antedate the present government road salapunco may have be occupy by the troops of the inca manco when he establish himself in uitico and rule over uilcapampa he could hardly however have build a megalithic work of this kind it be more likely that he would have destroy the narrow trail than have attempt to hold the fort against the soldier of pizarro furthermore its style and character seem to date it with the well-known megalithic structure of cuzco and ollantaytambo this make it seem all the more extraordinary that salapunco could ever have be build as a defense against ollantaytambo unless it be build by folk who once occupy cuzco and who later find a retreat in the canyon below here ------ figure grosvenor glacier and mt salcantay ------ when we first visit salapunco no megalithic remains have be report as far down the valley as this it never occur to we that in hunting for the remains of such comparatively recent structure as the inca manco have the force and time to build we be to discover remains of a far more remote past yet we be soon to find ruin enough to explain why such a fortress as salapunco might possibly have be build so as to defend uilcapampa against ollantaytambo and cuzco and not those well-known inca city against the savage of the amazon jungle pass salapunco we skirt granite cliff and precipice and enter a most interesting region where we be surprised and charm by the extent of the ancient terrace they length and height the presence of many inca ruin the beauty of the deep narrow valley and the grandeur of the snow-clad mountain which tower above they across the river near qquente on top of a series of terrace we see the extensive ruin of patallacta -lrb- pa = height or terrace llacta = town or city -rrb- a inca town of great importance it be not know to raimondus or paz soldan but be indicate on wiener 's map although he do not appear to have visit it we have be unable to find any reference to it in the chronicle we spend several month here in 1915 excavate and determine the character of the ruin in another volume i hope to tell more of the antiquity of this region at present it must suffice to remark that we exploration near patallacta disclose no white rock over a spring of water none of the place name in this vicinity fit in with the account of uitico they identity remain a puzzle although the symmetry of the building they architectural idiosyncrasy such as niche stone roof-peg bar-hold and eye-bonder indicate a inca origin at what date these town and village flourish who build they why they be desert we do not yet know and the indian who live hereabouts be ignorant or silent as to they history at torontoy the end of the cultivate temperate valley we find another group of interesting ruin possibly once the residence of a inca chief in a cave near by we secure some mummy the ancient wrapping have be consume by the native in a effort to smoke out the vampire bat that live in the cave on the opposite side of the river be extensive terrace and above they on a hilltop other ruin first visit by messr tucker and hendriksen in 1911 one of they indian bearer attempt to ford the rapid here with a large survey instrument be carry off he foot sweep away by the strong current and drown before help could reach he near torontoy be a densely wooded valley call the pampa ccahua in 1915 rumor of andean or spectacled bear have be see here and of damage have be do by they to some of the higher crop lead we to go and investigate we find no bear but at a elevation of 12000 foot be some very old tree heavily cover with flowering moss not hitherto know to science above they i be so fortunate as to find a wild potato plant the source from which the early peruvian first develop many variety of what we incorrectly call the irish potato the tuber be as large as pea mr heller find here a strange little cousin of the kangaroo a near relative of the coenoleste it turn out to be new to science to find a new genus of mammalian quadruped be a event which delighted mr heller far more than shoot a dozen bear -lrb- 8 -rrb- torontoy be at the beginning of the grand canyon of the urubamba and such a canyon the river road run recklessly up and down rock stairway blast its way beneath overhang precipice span chasm on frail bridge prop on rustic bracket against granite cliff under dense forest wherever the encroach precipice permit it the land between they and the river be once terraced and cultivate we find ourselves unexpectedly in a veritable wonderland emotion come thick and fast we marvel at the exquisite pain with which the ancient folk have rescue incredibly narrow strip of arable land from the tumble rapid how could they ever have manage to build a retain wall of heavy stone along the very edge of the dangerous river which it be death to attempt to cross on one sightly bend near a foam waterfall some inca chief build a temple whose wall tantalize the traveler he must pass by within pistol shot of the interesting ruin unable to ford the intervene rapid high up on the side of the canyon five thousand foot above this temple be the ruin of corihuayrachina -lrb- korus = gold huayara = wind huayrachina = a threshing-floor where winnowing take place possibly this be a ancient gold mine of the inca half a mile above we on another steep slope some modern pioneer have recently clear the jungle from a fine series of ancient artificial terrace on the afternoon of July 23d we reach a hut call la maquina where traveler frequently stop for the night the name come from the presence here of some large iron wheel part of a machine destine never to overcome the difficulty of be transport all the way to a sugar estate in the lower valley and year ago leave here to rust in the jungle there be little fodder and there be no good place for we to pitch we camp so we push on over the very difficult road which have be carve out of the face of a great granite cliff part of the cliff have slide off into the river and the breach thus make in the road have be repair by means of a frail-looking rustic bridge build on a bracket compose of rough log branch and reed tie together and surmount by a few inch of earth and pebble to make it seem sufficiently safe to the cautious cargo mule who pick they way gingerly across it no wonder the machine rest where it do and give its name to that part of the valley dusk fall early in this deep canyon the side of which be considerably over a mile in height it be almost dark when we pass a little sandy plain two or three acre in extent which in this land of steep mountain be call a pampa be the dweller on the pampas of argentina -- where a railroad can go for 250 mile in a straight line except for the curvature of the earth -- to see this little bit of flood-plain call mandor pampa they would think some one have be joking or else grossly misuse a word which mean to they illimitable space with not a hill in sight however to the ancient dweller in this valley where level land be so scarce that it be worth while to build high stone-faced terrace so as to enable two row of corn to grow where none grow before any little natural breathing space in the bottom of the canyon be call a pampa ------ figure the road between maquina and mandor pampa near machu picchu ------ we pass a ill-kept grass-thatched hut turn off the road through a tiny clearing and make we camp at the edge of the river urubamba on a sandy beach opposite we beyond the huge granite boulder which interfere with the progress of the surge stream be a steep mountain clothe with thick jungle it be a ideal spot for a camp near the road and yet secluded we action however arouse the suspicion of the owner of the hut melchor arteaga who lease the land of mandor pampa he be anxious to know why we do not stay at he hut like respectable traveler we gendarme sergeant carrasco reassure he they have quite a long conversation when arteaga learn that we be interested in the architectural remains of the inca he say there be some very good ruin in this vicinity -- in fact some excellent one on top of the opposite mountain call huayna picchu and also on a ridge call machu picchu these be the very place charle wiener hear of at ollantaytambo in 1875 and have be unable to reach the story of my experience on the follow day will be find in a later chapter suffice it to say at this point that the ruin of huayna picchu turn out to be of very little importance while those of machu picchu familiar to reader of the national geographic magazine be as interesting as any ever find in the ande when i first see the remarkable citadel of machu picchu perch on a narrow ridge two thousand foot above the river i wonder if it could be the place to which that old soldier baltasar de ocampo a member of captain garcium 's expedition be refer when he say : the inca tupac amaru be there in the fortress of pitco -lrb- uitico -rrb- which be on a very high mountain whence the view command a great part of the province of uilcapampa here there be a extensive level space with very sumptuous and majestic building erect with great skill and art all the lintel of the door the principal as well as the ordinary one be of marble elaborately carve could it be that picchu be the modern variant of pitco to be sure the white granite of which the temple and palace of machu picchu be construct might easily pass for marble the difficulty about fitting ocampo 's description to machu picchu however be that there be no difference between the lintel of the door and the wall themselves furthermore there be no white rock over a spring of water which calancha say be near uitico there be no pucyura in this neighborhood in fact the canyon of the urubamba do not satisfy the geographical requirement of uitico although contain ruin of surpass interest machu picchu do not represent that last inca capital for which we be search we have not yet find manco 's palace chapter xi the search continue machu picchu be on the border-line between the temperate zone and the tropics camping near the bridge of san miguel below the ruin both mr heller and mr cook find interesting evidence of this fact in the flora and fauna from the point of view of historical geography mr cook 's most important discovery be the presence here of huilca a tree which do not grow in cold climate the quichua dictionary tell we huilca be a medicine a purgative a infusion make from the seed of the tree be use as a enema i be indebted to mr cook for call my attention to two article by mr w e safford in which it be also show that from seed of the huilca a powder be prepared sometimes call cohoba this powder say mr safford be a narcotic snuff inhale through the nostril by means of a bifurcated tube all writer unite in declare that it induce a kind of intoxication or hypnotic state accompany by vision which be regard by the native as supernatural while under its influence the necromancer or priest be suppose to hold communication with unseen power and they incoherent muttering be regard as prophecy or revelation of hidden thing in treat the sick the physician make use of it to discover the cause of the malady or the person or spirit by whom the patient be bewitch mr safford quote las casas as say : it be a interesting spectacle to witness how they take it and what they speak the chief begin the ceremony and while he be engage all remain silent when he have snuff up the powder through he nostril he remain silent for a while with he head incline to one side and he arm place on he knee then he raise he face heavenward utter certain word which must have be he prayer to the true god or to he whom he hold as god after which all respond almost as we do when we say aman and this they do with a loud voice or sound then they give thanks and say to he certain complimentary thing entreat he benevolence and beg he to reveal to they what he have see he describe to they he vision say that the cemus -lrb- spirit -rrb- have speak to he and have predict good time or the contrary or that child be to be bear or to die or that there be to be some dispute with they neighbor and other thing which might come to he imagination all disturb with that intoxication -lrb- 9 -rrb- clearly from the point of view of priest and soothsayer the place where huilca be first find and use in they incantation would be important it be not strange to find therefore that the inca name of this river be uilca-mayu : the huilca river the pampa on this river where the tree grow would likely receive the name uilca pampa if it become a important city then the surrounding region might be name uilcapampa after it this seem to I to be the most probable origin of the name of the province anyhow it be worth note the fact that denizen of cuzco and ollantaytambo come down the river in search of this highly prize narcotic must have find the first tree not far from machu picchu leave the ruin of machu picchu for later investigation we now push on down the urubamba valley cross the bridge of san miguel pass the house of señor lizarraga first of modern peruvian to write he name on the granite wall of machu picchu and come to the sugar-cane field of huadquiña we have now leave the temperate zone and enter the tropics at huadquiña we be so fortunate as to find that the proprietress of the plantation señora carman varga and she child be spend the season here during the rainy winter month they live in cuzco but when summer bring fine weather they come to huadquiña to enjoy the free-and-easy life of the country they make we welcome not only with that hospitality to pass traveler which be common to sugar estate all over the world but give we real assistance in we exploration señora carman 's estate cover more than two hundred square mile huadquiña be a splendid example of the ancient patriarchal system the indian who come from other part of peru to work on the plantation enjoy perquisite and wages unknown elsewhere those whose home be on the estate regard señora carman with a affectionate reverence which she well deserve all be welcome to bring she they trouble the system go back to the day when the spiritual moral and material welfare of the indian be entrust in encomienda to the lord of the repartimiento or allotted territory huadquiña once belong to the jesuit they plant the first sugar cane and establish the mill after they expulsion from the spanish colony at the end of the eighteenth century huadquiña be buy by a peruvian it be first describe in geographical literature by the count de sartige who stay here for several week in 1834 when on he way to choqquequirau he say that the owner of huadquiña be perhaps the only land proprietor in the entire world who possess on he estate all the product of the four part of the globe in the different region of he domain he have wool hide horsehair potato wheat corn sugar coffee chocolate coca many mine of silver-bearing lead and placer of gold truly a royal principality ------ figure huadquiña ------ incidentally it be interesting to note that although sartige be a enthusiastic explorer eager to visit undescribed inca ruin he make no mention whatever of machu picchu yet from huadquiña one can reach machu picchu on foot in half a day without cross the urubamba river apparently the ruin be unknown to he host in 1834 they be equally unknown to we kind host in 1911 they scarcely believe the story i tell they of the beauty and extent of the inca edifice -lrb- 10 -rrb- when my photograph be develop however and they see with they own eye the marvelous stonework of the principal temple señora carman and she family be strike dumb with wonder and astonishment they could not understand how it be possible that they should have pass so close to machu picchu every year of they life since the river road be open without know what be there they have see a single little building on the crest of the ridge but suppose that it be a isolate tower of no great interest or importance they neighbor lizarraga near the bridge of san miguel have report the presence of the ruin which he first visit in 1904 but like we friend in cuzco they have pay little attention to he story we be soon to have a demonstration of the cause of such skepticism we new friend read with interest my copy of those paragraph of calaucha 's chronicle which refer to the location of the last inca capital learning that we be anxious to discover uitico a place of which they have never hear they order the most intelligent tenant on the estate to come in and be question the best inform of all be a sturdy mestizo a trust foreman who say that in a little valley call ccllumayu a few hour ' journey down the urubamba there be important ruin which have be see by some of señora carman 's indian even more interesting and thrilling be he statement that on a ridge up the salcantay valley be a place call yurak rumus -lrb- yurak = white rumus = stone -rrb- where some very interesting ruin have be find by he workman when cut tree for firewood we all become excite over this for among the paragraph which i have copy from calancha 's chronicle be the statement that close to uitico be the white stone of the aforesaid house of the sun which be call yurak rumus we host assure we that this must be the place since no one hereabouts have ever hear of any other yurak rumus the foreman on be closely question say that he have see the ruin once or twice that he have also be up the urubamba valley and see the great ruin at ollantaytambo and that those which he have see at yurak rumus be as good as those at ollantaytambo here be a definite statement make by a eyewitness apparently we be about to see that interesting rock where the last inca worship however the foreman say that the trail thither be at present impassable although a small gang of indian could open it in less than a week we host excite by the picture we have show they of machu picchu and now believe that even finer ruin might be find on they own property immediately give order to have the path to yurak rumus clear for we benefit while this be be do señora carman 's son the manager of the plantation offer to accompany we himself to ccllumayu where other important ruin have be find which could be reach in a few hour without cut any new trail act on he assurance that we should not need tent or cot we leave we camping outfit behind and follow he to a small valley on the south side of the urubamba we find ccllumayu to consist of two hut in a small clearing densely wood slope rise on all side the manager request two of the indian tenant to act as guide with they we plunge into the thick jungle and spend a long and fatiguing day search in vain for ruin that night the manager return to huadquiña but professor foote and i prefer to remain in ccllumayu and prosecute a more vigorous search on the next day we share a little thatched hut with we indian host and a score of fat cuy -lrb- guinea pig -rrb- the chief source of the ccllumayu meat supply the hut be build of rough wattle which admit plenty of fresh air and give we comfortable ventilation primitive little sleeping-platform also of wattle construct for the need of short stocky indian keep we from be overrun by inquisitive cuy but could hardly be call as comfortable as we own folding cot which we have leave at huadquiña the next day we guide be able to point out in the wood a few pile of stone the foundation of oval or circular hut which probably be build by some primitive savage tribe in prehistoric time nothing further could be find here of ruin important or otherwise although we spend three day at ccllumayu such be we first disillusionment on we return to huadquiña we learn that the trail to yurak rumus would be ready in a day or two in the meantime we host become much interested in professor foote 's collection of insect they bring a unnamed scorpion and inform we that a orange orchard surround by high wall in a secluded place back of the house be a great place for spider we find that they statement be not exaggerated and immediately engage in a enthusiastic spider hunt when these huadquiña spider be study at the harvard museum of comparative zoölogy dr chamberlain find among they the representative of four new genus and nineteen species hitherto unknown to science as a reward of merit he give professor foote 's name to the scorpion ------ figure ruin of yurak rumus near huadquiña probably a inca storehouse well ventilate and well drain draw by a h bumstead from measurement and photograph by hiram bingham and h w foote ------ finally the trail to yurak rumus be report finish it be with feeling of keen anticipation that i start out with the foreman to see those ruin which he have just revisit and now declare be better than those of ollantaytambo it be to be presume that in the pride of discovery he might have exaggerate they importance still it never enter my head what i be actually to find after several hour spend in clear away the dense forest growth which surround the wall i learn that this yurak rumus consist of the ruin of a single little rectangular inca storehouse no effort have be make at beauty of construction the wall be of rough unfashioned stone lay in clay the building be without a doorway although it have several small window and a series of ventilate shaft under the house the lintel of the window and of the small aperture lead into the subterranean shaft be of stone there be no window on the sunny north side or on the end but there be four on the south side through which it would have be possible to secure access to the store of maize potato or other provision place here for safe-keep it will be recall that the inca maintain a extensive system of public storehouse not only in the center of population but also at strategic point on the principal trail yurak rumus be on top of the ridge between the salcantay and huadquiña valley probably on a ancient road which cross the province of uilcapampa as such it be interesting but to compare it with ollantaytambo as the foreman have do be to liken a cottage to a palace or a mouse to a elephant it seem incredible that anybody have actually see both place could have think for a moment that one be as good as the other to be sure the foreman be not a trained observer and he interest in inca building be probably of the slightest yet the ruin of ollantaytambo be so well know and so impressive that even the most casual traveler be strike by they and the native themselves be enormously proud of they the real cause of the foreman 's inaccuracy be probably he desire to please to give a answer which will satisfy the questioner be a common trait in peru as well as in many other part of the world anyhow the lesson of the past few day be not lose on we we now understand the skepticism which have prevail regard lizarraga 's discovery it be small wonder that the occasional story about machu picchu which have drift into cuzco have never elicit any enthusiasm nor even provoke investigation on the part of those professor and student in the university of cuzco who be interested in visit the remains of inca civilization they know only too well the fondness of they countryman for exaggeration and they inability to report fact accurately obviously we have not yet find uitico so bidding farewell to señora carman we cross the urubamba on the bridge of colpanus and proceed down the valley past the mouth of the lucumayo and the road from panticallum to the hamlet of chauillay where the urubamba be join by the vilcabamba river -lrb- 11 -rrb- both river be restrict here to narrow gorge through which they water rush and roar on they way to the lower valley a few rod from chauillay be a fine bridge the native call it chuquichaca steel and iron have supersede the old suspension bridge of huge cable make of vegetable fiber with its narrow roadway of wattle support by a network of vine yet here it be that in 1572 the military force send by the viceroy francisco de toledo under the command of general martin hurtado and captain garcium find the force of the young inca draw up to defend uitico it will be remember that after a brief preliminary fire the force of tupac amaru be route without have destroy the bridge and thus captain garcium be enable to accomplish that which have prove too much for the famous gonzalo pizarro we inspection of the surroundings show that captain garcium 's companion baltasar de ocampo be correct when he say that the occupation of the bridge of chuquichaca be a measure of no small importance for the royal force it certainly would have cause the spaniard great trouble if they have have to rebuild it we might now have proceed to follow garcia 's track up the vilcabamba have we not be anxious to see the proprietor of the plantation of santa ana don pedro duque repute to be the wisest and ablest man in this whole province we feel he would be able to offer we advice of prime importance in we search so leave the bridge of chuquichaca we continue down the urubamba river which here meander through a broad fertile valley green with tropical plantation we pass grove of banana and orange wave field of green sugar cane the hospitable dwelling of prosperous planter and the hut of indian fortunate enough to dwell in this tropical garden of eden the day be hot and thirst-provoking so i stop near some large orange tree load with ripe fruit and ask the indian proprietress to sell I ten cent ' worth in exchange for the tiny silver real she drag out a sack contain more than fifty orange i be fain to request she to permit we to take only as many as we pocket could hold but she seem so surprised and pained we have to fill we saddle-bag as well at the end of the day we cross the urubamba river on a fine steel bridge and find ourselves in the prosperous little town of quillabamba the provincial capital its main street be line with well-filled shop evidence of the fact that this be one of the principal gateway to the peruvian rubber country which with the high price of rubber then prevail 1911 be the scene of unusual activity pass through quillabamba and up a slight hill beyond it we come to the long colonnade of the celebrated sugar estate of santa ana found by the jesuit where all explorer who have pass this way since the day of charle wiener have be entertain he say that he be receive here with a thousand sign of friendship -lrb- mille témoignages d'amitié -rrb- we be receive the same way even in a region where we have repeatedly receive valuable assistance from government official and generous hospitality from private individual we reception at santa ana stand out as particularly delightful don pedro duque take great interest in enable we to get all possible information about the little-known region into which we propose to penetrate bear in colombium but long resident in peru he be a gentleman of the old school keenly interested not only in the administration and economic progress of he plantation but also in the intellectual movement of the outside world he enter with zest into we historical-geographical study the name uitico be new to he but after read over with we we extract from the spanish chronicle he be sure that he could help we find it and help we he do santa ana be less than thirteen degree south of the equator the elevation be barely 2000 foot the winter night be cool but the heat in the middle of the day be intense nevertheless we host be so energetic that as a result of he effort a number of the best-informed resident be bring to the conference at the great plantation house they tell all they know of the town and valley where the last four inca have find a refuge but that be not much they all agree that if only señor lopez torre be alive he could have be of great service to we as he have prospect for mine and rubber in those part more than any one else and have once see some inca ruin in the forest of uitico and chuquipalpa and most of the place mention in the chronicle none of don pedro 's friend have ever hear it be all rather discourage until one day by the greatest good fortune there arrive at santa ana another friend of don pedro 's the teniente gobernador of the village of lucma in the valley of vilcabamba -- a crusty old fellow name evaristo mogrovejo he brother pio mogrovejo have be a member of the party of energetic peruvian who in 1884 have search for bury treasure at choqquequirau and have leave they name on its wall evaristo mogrovejo could understand search for bury treasure but he be totally unable otherwise to comprehend we desire to find the ruin of the place mention by father calancha and the contemporary of captain garcium have we first meet mogrovejo in lucma he would undoubtedly have receive we with suspicion and do nothing to further we quest fortunately for we he official superior be the sub-prefect of the province of convención live at quillabamba near santa ana and be a friend of don pedro 's the sub-prefect have receive order from he own official superior the prefect of cuzco to take a personal interest in we undertaking and accordingly give particular order to mogrovejo to see to it that we be give every facility for find the ancient ruin and identify the place of historic interest although mogrovejo decline to risk he skin in the savage wilderness of conservidayoc he carry out he order faithfully and be ultimately of great assistance to we extremely gratify with the result of we conference in santa ana yet reluctant to leave the delightful hospitality and charming conversation of we gracious host we decide to go at once to lucma take the road on the southwest side of the urubamba and use the route follow by the pack animal which carry the precious cargo of coca and aguardiente from santa ana to ollantaytambo and cuzco thanks to don pedro 's energy we make a excellent start not one of those meant-to-be-early but really late-in-the-morning departure so customary in the ande we pass through a region which originally have be heavily forest have long since be clear and be now cover with bush and second growth near the roadside i notice a considerable number of land shell group on the under-side of overhang rock as a boy in the hawaiian island i have spend too many saturday collect those beautiful and fascinating mollusk which usually prefer the tree of upland valley to enable I to resist the temptation of gather a large number of such as could easily be secure none of the snail be move the dry season appear to be they rest period some week later professor foote and i pass through mara and be interested to notice thousand of land shell mostly white in color on small bush where they seem to be quietly sleep they be fairly glue to they rest place cluster so closely in some case as to give the stem of the bush a ghostly appearance we present objective be the valley of the river vilcabamba so far as we have be able to learn only one other explorer have precede we -- the distinguished scientist raimondus he map of the vilcabamba be fairly accurate he report the presence here of mine and mineral but with the exception of a abandon tampu at maracnyoc -lrb- the place which possess a millstone -rrb- he make no mention of any ruin accordingly although it seem from the story of baltasar de ocampo and captain garcium 's other contemporary that we be now enter the valley of uitico it be with feel-hag of considerable uncertainty that we proceed on we quest it may seem strange that we should have be in any doubt yet before we visit nearly all the peruvian historian and geographer except don carlo romero still believe that when the inca manco flee from pizarro he take up he residence at choqquequirau in the apurimac valley the word choqquequirau mean cradle of gold and this lend color to the legend that manco have carry off with he from cuzco great quantity of gold utensil and much treasure which he deposit in he new capital raimondus know that manco have retire to uilcapampa visit both the present village of vilcabamba and pucyura and see nothing of any ruin he be satisfy that choqquequirau be manco 's refuge because it be far enough from pucyura to answer the requirement of calancha that it be two or three day ' journey from uilcapampa to puquiura a new road have recently be build along the river bank by the owner of the sugar estate at paltaybamba to enable he pack animal to travel more rapidly much of it have to be carve out of the face of a solid rock precipice and in place it pierce the cliff in a series of little tunnel my gendarme miss this road and take the steep old trail over the cliff as ocampo say in he story of captain garcium 's expedition the road be narrow in the ascent with forest on the fight and on the leave a ravine of great depth we reach paltaybamba about dusk the owner señor josé s pancorbo be absent attend to the affair of a rubber estate in the jungle of the river san miguel the plantation of paltaybamba occupy the best land in the lower vilcabamba valley but lie as it do well off the main highway visitor be rare and we arrival be the occasion for considerable excitement we be not unexpected however it be señor pancorbo who have assure we in cuzco that we should find ruin near pucyura and he have tell he major-domo to be on the look-out for we we have a long talk with the manager of the plantation and he friend that evening they have hear little of any ruin in this vicinity but repeat one of the story we have hear in santa ana that way off somewhere in the montaña there be a inca city all agree that it be a very difficult place to reach and none of they have ever be there in the morning the manager give we a guide to the next house up the valley with order that the man at that house should relay we to the next and so on these people all tenant of the plantation obligingly carry out they order although at considerable inconvenience to themselves the vilcabamba valley above paltaybamba be very picturesque there be high mountain on either side cover with dense jungle and dark green foliage in please contrast to the light green of the field of wave sugar cane the valley be steep the road be very wind and the torrent of the vilcabamba roar loudly even in July what it must be like in February the rainy season we could only surmise about two league above paltaybamba at or near the spot call by raimondus maracnyoc a abandon tampu we come to some old stone wall the ruin of a place now call huayara or hoyara i believe they to be the ruin of the first spanish settlement in this region a place refer to by ocampo who say that the fugitive of tupac amaru 's army be bring back to the valley of hoyara where they be settle in a large village and a city of spaniard be found this city be found on a extensive plain near a river with a admirable climate from the river channel of water be take for the service of the city the water be very good the water here be excellent far better than any in the cuzco basin on the plain near the river be some of the last cane field of the plantation of paltaybamba hoyara be abandon after the discovery of gold mine several league farther up the valley and the spanish city be move to the village now call vilcabamba we next stop be at lucma the home of teniente gobernador mogrovejo the village of lucma be a irregular cluster of about thirty thatched-roofed hut it enjoy a moderate amount of prosperity due to the fact of its be located near one of the gateway to the interior the pass to the rubber estate in the san miguel valley here be house of refreshment and two shop the only one in the region one can buy cotton cloth sugar can goods and candle a picturesque belfry and a small church old and somewhat out of repair crown the small hill back of the village there be little level land but the slope be gentle and permit a considerable amount of agriculture there be no evidence of extensive terracing maize and alfalfa seem to be the principal crop evaristo mogrovejo live on the little plaza around which the house of the more important people be group he have just return from santa ana by the way of idma use a much worse trail than that over which we have come but one which enable he to avoid pass through paltaybamba with whose proprietor he be not on good term he tell we story of misadventure which have happen to traveler at the gate of paltaybamba story highly reminiscent of feudal day in europe when provincial baron be accustom to lay tribute on all who pass we offer to pay mogrovejo a gratificación of a sol or peruvian silver dollar for every ruin to which he would take we and double that amount if the locality should prove to contain particularly interesting ruin this arouse all he business instinct he summon he alcalde and other well-informed indian to appear and be interview they tell we there be many ruin hereabouts be a practical man himself mogrovejo have never take any interest in ruin now he see the chance not only to make money out of the ancient site but also to gain official favor by carry out with unexampled vigor the order of he superior the sub-prefect of quillabamba so he exert himself to the utmost in we behalf the next day we be guide up a ravine to the top of the ridge back of lucma this ridge divide the upper from the lower vilcabamba on all side the hill rise several thousand foot above we in place they be cover with forest growth chiefly above the cloud line where daily moisture encourage vegetation in some of the forest on the more gentle slope recent clearing give evidence of enterprise on the part of the present inhabitant of the valley after a hour 's climb we reach what be unquestionably the ruin of inca structure on a artificial terrace which command a magnificent view far down toward paltaybamba and the bridge of chuquichaca as well as in the opposite direction the contemporary of captain garcium speak of a number of fort or pucarás which have to be storm and capture before tupac amaru could be take prisoner this be probably one of those fortress its strategic position and the ease with which it could be defend point to such a interpretation nevertheless this ruin do not fit the fortress of pitco nor the house of the sun near the white rock over the spring it be call incahuaracana the place where the inca shoot with a sling incahuaracana consist of two typical inca edifice -- one of two room about 70 by 20 foot and the other very long and narrow 150 by 11 foot the wall of unhewn stone lay in clay be not particularly well build and resemble in many respects the ruin at choqquequirau the room of the principal house be without window although each have three front door and be line with niche four or five on a side the long narrow building be divide into three room and have several front door a force of two hundred indian soldier could have sleep in these house without unusual crowding we leave lucma the next day ford the vilcabamba river and soon have a uninterrupted view up the valley to a high truncate hill its top partly cover with a scrubby growth of tree and bush its side steep and rocky we be tell that the name of the hill be rosaspa a word of modern hybrid origin -- pa be quichua for hill while rosa be the spanish word for rose mogrovejo say he indian tell he that on the hill of rose there be more ruin at the foot of the hill and across the river be the village of pucyura when raimondus be here in 1865 it be but a wretched hamlet with a paltry chapel to-day it be more prosperous there be a large public school here to which child come from village many mile away so crowded be the school that in fine weather the child sit on bench out of door the boy all go barefooted the girl wear high boot i once see they recite a geography lesson but i doubt if even the teacher know whether or not this be the site of the first school in this whole region for it be to puquiura that friar marco come in 1566 perhaps he build the mezquina capillum which raimondus scorn if this be the puquiura of friar marco then uitico must be near by for he and friar diego walk with they famous procession of convert from puquiura to the house of the sun and the white rock which be close to uitico cross the vilcabamba on a footbridge that afternoon we come immediately upon some old ruin that be not incaic examination show that they be apparently the remains of a very crude spanish crush mill obviously intend to pulverize gold-bearing quartz on a considerable scale perhaps this be the place refer to by ocampo who say that the inca titu cusus attend mass say by he friend friar diego in a chapel which be near my house and on my own land in the mining district of puquiura close to the ore-crushing mill of don christoval de albornoz precentor that be of the cuzco cathedral ------ figure pucyura and the hill of rosaspa in the vilcabamba valley ------ one of the millstone be five foot in diameter and more than a foot thick it lay near a huge flat rock of white granite hollow out so as to enable the millstone to be roll slowly around in a hollow trough there be also a very large indian mortar and pestle heavy enough to need the service of four man to work it the mortar be merely the hollowed-out top of a large boulder which project a few inch above the surface of the ground the pestle four foot in diameter be of the characteristic rocking-stone shape use from time immemorial by the indian of the highland for crush maize or potato since no other ruin of a spanish quartz-crushing plant have be find in this vicinity it be probable that this once belong to don christoval de albornoz near the mill the tincochaca river join the vilcabamba from the southeast cross this on a footbridge i follow mogrovejo to a old and very dilapidated structure in the saddle of the hill on the south side of rosaspa they call the place uncapampa or inca pampa it be probably one of the fort storm by captain garcium and he man in 1571 the ruin represent a single house 166 foot long by 33 foot wide if the house have partition they long since disappear there be six doorway in front none on the end or in the rear wall the ruin resemble those of incahuaracana near lucma the wall have originally be build of rough stone lay in clay the general finish be extremely rough the few niche all at one end of the structure be irregular about two foot in width and a little more than this in height the one corner of the building which be still stand have a height of about ten foot two hundred inca soldier could have sleep here also leave uncapampa and follow my guide i climb up the ridge and follow a path along its west side to the top of rosaspa pass some ruin much overgrown and of a primitive character i soon find myself on a pleasant pampa near the top of the mountain the view from here command a great part of the province of uilcapampa it be remarkably extensive on all side to the north and south be snow-capped mountain to the east and west deep verdure-clad valley furthermore on the north side of the pampa be a extensive level space with a very sumptuous and majestic building erect with great skill and art all the lintel of the door the principal as well as the ordinary one be of white granite elaborately cut at last we have find a place which seem to meet most of the requirement of ocampo 's description of the fortress of pitco to be sure it be not of marble and the lintel of the door be not carve in we sense of the word they be however beautifully finish as may be see from the illustration and the white granite might easily pass for marble if only we could find in this vicinity that temple of the sun which calancha say be near uitico all doubt would be at a end that night we stay at tincochaca in the hut of a indian friend of mogrovejo as usual we make inquiry imagine we feeling when in response to the oft-repeated question he say that in a neighbor valley there be a great white rock over a spring of water if he story should prove to be true we quest for uitico be over it behoove we to make a very careful study of what we have find chapter xii the fortress of uitico and the house of the sun when the viceroy toledo determine to conquer that last stronghold of the inca where for thirty-five year they have defy the supreme power of spain he offer a thousand dollar a year as a pension to the soldier who would capture tupac amaru captain garcium earn the pension but fail to receive it the mañana habit be already strong in the day of philip ii so the doughty captain file a collection of testimonial with philip 's royal council of the indy among these be he own statement of what happen on the campaign against tupac amaru in this he say : and have arrive at the principal fortress guay-napucará -lrb- the young fortress -rrb- which the inca have fortify we find it defend by the prince philipe quispetutio a son of the inca titu cusus with he captain and soldier it be on a high eminence surround with rugged crag and jungle very dangerous to ascend and almost impregnable nevertheless with my aforesaid company of soldier i go up and gain the fortress but only with the greatest possible labor and danger thus we gain the province of uilcapampa the viceroy himself say this important victory be due to captain garcium 's skill and courage in storm the height of guaynapucará on saint john the baptist 's day in 1572 the hill of rose be indeed a high eminence surround with rugged crag the side of easiest approach be protect by a splendid long wall build so carefully as not to leave a single toe-hold for active besieger the barracks at uncapampa could have furnish a contingent to make a attack on that side very dangerous the hill be steep on all side and it would have be extremely easy for a small force to have defend it it be undoubtedly almost impregnable this be the feature captain garcium be most likely to remember on the very summit of the hill be the ruin of a partly enclosed compound consist of thirteen or fourteen house arrange so as to form a rough square with one large and several small courtyard the outside dimension of the compound be about 160 foot by 145 foot the builder show the familiar inca sense of symmetry in arrange the house due to the wanton destruction of many building by the native in they effort at treasure-hunting the wall have be so pull down that it be impossible to get the exact dimension of the building in only one of they could we be sure that there have be any niche ------ figure principal doorway of the long palace at rosaspa ------ ------ figure another doorway in the ruin of rosaspa ------ most interesting of all be the structure which catch the attention of ocampo and remain fix in he memory enough remain of this building to give a good idea of its former grandeur it be indeed a fit residence for a royal inca a exile from cuzco it be 245 foot by 43 foot there be no window but it be light by thirty doorway fifteen in front and the same in back it contain ten large room besides three hallway run from front to rear the wall be build rather hastily and be not noteworthy but the principal entrance namely those lead to each hall be particularly well make not to be sure of marble as ocampo say -- there be no marble in the province -- but of finely cut ashlar of white granite the lintel of the principal doorway as well as of the ordinary one be also of solid block of white granite the largest be as much as eight foot in length the doorway be better than any other ruin in uilcapampa except those of machu picchu thus justify the mention of they make by ocampo who live near here and have time to become thoroughly familiar with they appearance unfortunately a very small portion of the edifice be still stand most of the rear door have be fill up with ashlar in order to make a continuous fence other wall have be build from the ruin to keep cattle out of the cultivate pampa rosaspa be at a elevation which place it on the borderland between the cold grazing country with its root crop and sublimate pigweed and the temperate zone where maize flourish on the south side of the hilltop opposite the long palace be the ruin of a single structure 78 foot long and 35 foot wide contain door on both side no niche and no evidence of careful workmanship it be probably a barracks for a company of soldier the intervene pampa might have be the scene of those game of bowl and quoit which be play by the spanish refugee who flee from the wrath of gonzalo pizarro and find refuge with the inca manco here may have occur that fatal game when one of the player lose he temper and kill he royal host we excavation in 1915 yield a mass of rough potsherd a few inca whirl-bob and bronze shawl pin and also a number of iron article of european origin heavily rust -- horseshoe nail a buckle a pair of scissors several bridle or saddle ornament and three jew 's - harp my first thought be that modern peruvian must have live here at one time although the necessity of carry all water supply up the hill would make this unlikely furthermore the presence here of artifact of european origin do not of itself point to such a conclusion in the first place we know that manco be accustom to make raid on spanish traveler between cuzco and lima he might very easily have bring back with he a spanish bridle in the second place the musical instrument may have belong to the refugee who might have enjoy while away they exile with melancholy twanging in the third place the retainer of the inca probably visit the spanish market in cuzco where there would have be display at time a considerable assortment of goods of european manufacture finally rodriguez de figueroa speak expressly of two pair of scissors he bring as a present to titu cusus that no such array of european artifact have be turn up in the excavation of other important site in the province of uilcapampa would seem to indicate that they be abandon before the spanish conquest or else be occupy by native who have no means of accumulate such treasure thanks to ocampo 's description of the fortress which tupac amaru be occupy in 1572 there be no doubt that this be the palace of the last inca be it also the capital of he brother titu cusus and sayrus tupac and he father manco it be astonishing how few detail we have by which the uitico of manco may be identify he contemporary be strangely silent when he leave cuzco and seek refuge in the remote fastness of the ande there be a spanish soldier cieza de leon in the army of pizarro who have a genius for see and hear interesting thing and write they down and who try to interview as many member of the royal family as he could -- manco have thirteen brother ciezo de leon say he be much disappointed not to be able to talk with manco himself and he son but they have retire into the province of uitico which be in the most retired part of those region beyond the great cordillera of the ande -lrb- 12 -rrb- the spanish refugee who die as the result of the murder of manco may not have know how to write anyhow so far as we can learn they leave no account from which any one could identify he residence titu cusus give no definite clue but the activity of friar marco and friar diego who come to be he spiritual adviser be fully describe by calancha it will be remember that calancha remark that close to uitico in a village call chuquipalpa be a house of the sun and in it a white stone over a spring of water we guide have tell we there be such a place close to the hill of rosaspa on the day after make the first study of the hill of rose i follow the impatient mogrovejo -- whose object be not to study ruin but to earn dollar for find they -- and go over the hill on its northeast side to the valley of lo andene -lrb- the terrace -rrb- here sure enough be a large white granite boulder flatten on top which have a carve seat or platform on its northern side its west side cover a cave in which be several niche this cave have be wall in on one side when mogrovejo and the indian guide say there be a manantial de agua -lrb- spring of water -rrb- near by i become greatly interested on investigation however the spring turn out to be nothing but part of a small irrigate ditch -lrb- manantial means spring it also mean run water -rrb- but the rock be not over the water although this be undoubtedly one of those huaca or sacred boulder select by the inca as the visible representation of the founder of a tribe and thus be a important accessory to ancestor worship it be not the yurak rumus for which we be look ------ figure northeast face of yurak rumus ------ leave the boulder and the ruin of what possibly have be the house of its attendant priest we follow the little water course past a large number of very handsomely build agricultural terrace the first we have see since leave machu picchu and the most important one in the valley so scarce be andene in this region and so noteworthy be these in particular that this vale have be name after they they be probably build under the direction of manco near they be a number of carve boulder huaca one have a intihuatana or sundial nubbin on it another be carve in the shape of a saddle continue we follow a trickle stream through thick wood until we suddenly arrive at a open place call ñusta isppana here before we be a great white rock over a spring we guide have not mislead we beneath the tree be the ruin of a inca temple flanking and partly enclose the gigantic granite boulder one end of which overhang a small pool of run water when we learn that the present name of this immediate vicinity be chuquipalta we happiness be complete it be late on the afternoon of August 9 1911 when i first saw this remarkable shrine densely wood hill rise on every side there be not a hut to be see scarcely a sound to be hear it be a ideal place for practice the mystic ceremony of a ancient cult the remarkable aspect of this great boulder and the dark pool beneath its shadow have cause this to become a place of worship here without doubt be the principal mochadero of those forested mountain it be still venerate by the indian of the vicinity at last we have find the place where in the day of titu cusi the inca priest face the east greet the rise sun extend they hand toward it and throw kiss to it a ceremony of the most profound resignation and reverence we may imagine the sun priest clothe in they resplendent robe of office standing on the top of the rock at the edge of its steepest side they face light up with the rosy light of the early morning await the moment when the great divinity should appear above the eastern hill and receive they adoration as it rise they salute it and cry : o sun thou who art in peace and safety shine upon we keep we from sickness and keep we in health and safety o sun thou who hast say let there be cuzco and tampu grant that these child may conquer all other people we beseech thee that thy child the inca may be always conqueror since it be for this that thou hast create they ------ figure plan of the ruin of the temple of the sun at ñusta isppana formerly yurak rumus in chuquipalpa near uitico ------ it be during titu cusus 's reign that friar marco and diego march over here with they convert from puquiura each carry a stick of firewood calancha say the indian worship the water as a divine thing that the devil have at time show himself in the water since the surface of the little pool as one gaze at it do not reflect the sky but only the overhang dark mossy rock the water look black and forbid even to unsuperstitious yankee it be easy to believe that simple-minded indian worshiper in this secluded spot could readily believe that they actually see the devil appear as a visible manifestation in the water indian come from the most sequestered village of the dense forest to worship here and to offer gift and sacrifice nevertheless the augustinian monk here raise the standard of the cross recite they orison and pile firewood all about the rock and temple exorcise the devil and call he by all the vile name they could think of the friar command he never to return set fire to the pile they burn up the temple scorch the rock make a powerful impression on the indian and cause the poor devil to flee roaring in a fury the cruel devil never more return to the rock nor to this district whether the roaring which they hear be that of the devil or of the flame we can only conjecture whether the conflagration temporarily dry up the swamp or interfere with the arrangement of the water supply so that the pool disappear for the time be and give the devil no chance to appear in the water where he have formerly be accustom to show himself be also a matter for speculation the building of the house of the sun be in a very ruinous state but the rock itself with its curious carving be well preserved notwithstanding the great conflagration of 1570 its length be fifty-two foot its width thirty foot and its height above the present level of the water twenty-five foot on the west side of the rock be seat and large step or platform it be customary to kill llama at these holy huaca on top of the rock be a flatten place which may have be use for such sacrifice from it run a little crack in the boulder which have be artificially enlarged and may have be intend to carry off the blood of the victim kill on top of the rock it be still use for occult ceremony of obscure origin which be quietly practice here by the more superstitious indian woman of the valley possibly in memory of the ñusta or inca princess for whom the shrine be name on the south side of the monolith be several large platform and four or five small seat which have be cut in the rock great care be exercise in cut out the platform the edge be very nearly square level and straight the east side of the rock project over the spring two seat have be carve immediately above the water on the north side there be no seat near the water step have be carve there be one flight of three and another of seven step above they the rock have be flatten artificially and carve into a very bold relief there be ten project square stone like those usually call intihuatana or place to which the sun be tie in one line be seven one be slightly apart from the six other the other three be arrange in a triangular position above the seven it be significant that these stone be on the northeast face of the rock where they be expose to the rise sun and cause striking shadow at sunrise ------ figure carve seat and platform of ñusta isppana ------ ------ figure two of the seven seat near the spring under the great white rock ------ we excavation yield no artifact whatever and only a handful of very rough old potsherd of uncertain origin the run water under the rock be clear and appear to be a spring but when we drain the swamp which adjoin the great rock on its northeastern side we find that the spring be a little higher up the hill and that the water run through the dark pool we also find that what look like a stone culvert on the border of the little pool prove to be the top of the back of a row of seven or eight very fine stone seat the platform on which the seat rest and the seat themselves be part of three or four large rock nicely fit together some of the seat be under the black shadow of the overhang rock since the pool be a object of fear and mystery the seat be probably use only by priest or sorcerer it would have be a splendid place to practice divination no doubt the devil roar all we expedition in the ancient province of uilcapampa have fail to disclose the presence of any other white rock over a spring of water surround by the ruin of a possible house of the sun consequently it seem reasonable to adopt the follow conclusion : first ñusta isppana be the yurak rumus of father calancha the chuquipalta of to-day be the place to which he refer as chuquipalpa second uitico close to this shrine be once the name of the present valley of vilcabamba between tincochaca and lucma this be the vitico of cieza de leon a contemporary of manco who say that it be to the province of vitico that manco determine to retire when he rebel against pizarro and that have reach vitico with a great quantity of treasure collect from various part together with he woman and retinue the king manco inca establish himself in the strongest place he could find whence he sally forth many time and in many direction and disturb those part which be quiet to do what harm he could to the spaniard whom he consider as cruel enemy third the strongest place of cieza the guaynapucará of garcium be rosaspata refer to by ocampo as the fortress of pitco where he say there be a level space with majestic building the most noteworthy feature of which be that they have two kind of door and both kind have white stone lintel fourth the modern village of pucyura in the valley of the river vilcabamba be the puquiura of father calancha the site of the first mission church in this region as assume by raimondus although he be disappoint in the insignificance of the wretched little village the remains of the old quartz-crushing plant in tincochaca which have already be note the distance from the house of the sun not too great for the religious procession and the location of pucyura near the fortress all point to the correctness of this conclusion finally calancha say that friar ortiz after he have secure permission from titu cusi to establish the second missionary station in uilcapampa select the town of huarancallum which be populous and well located in the midst of a number of other little town and village there be a distance of two or three day ' journey from one convent to the other leave friar marco in puquiura friar diego go to he new establishment and in a short time build a church there be no huarancallum to-day nor any tradition of any but in mapillo a pleasant valley at a elevation of about 10000 foot in the temperate zone where the crop with which the inca be familiar might have be raise near pasture where llama and alpaca could have flourish be a place call huarancalque the valley be populous and contain a number of little town and village furthermore huarancalque be two or three day ' journey from pucyura and be on the road which the indian of this region now use in go to ayacucho this be undoubtedly the route use by manco in he raid on spanish caravan the mapillo flow into the apurimac near the mouth of the river pampa not far up the pampas be the important bridge between bom-bon and ocro which mr hay and i cross in 1909 on we way from cuzco to lima the city of ayacucho be found by pizarro a day 's journey from this bridge the necessity for the spanish caravan to cross the river pampas at this point make it easy for manco 's forage expedition to reach they by sudden march from uitico down the mapillo river by way of huarancalque which be probably the huarancallum of calancha 's chronicle he must have have raft or canoe on which to cross the apurimac which be here very wide and deep in the valley between huarancalque and lucma manco be cut off from central peru by the apurimac and its magnificent canyon which in many place have a depth of over two mile he be cut off from cuzco by the inhospitable snow field and glacier of salcantay soray and the adjacent ridge even though they be only fifty mile from cuzco frequently all the pass be completely snow-blocked fatality have be know even in recent year in this mountainous province manco could be sure of find not only security from he spanish enemy but any climate that he desire and a abundance of food for he follower there seem to be no reason to doubt that the retired region around the modern town of pucyura in the upper vilcabamba valley be once call uiticos chapter xiii vilcabamba although the refuge of manco be frequently speak of as uitico by the contemporary writer the word vilcabamba or uilcapampa be use even more often in fact garcilasso the chief historian of the inca himself the son of a inca princess do not mention uitico vilcabamba be the common name of the province father calancha say it be a very large area cover fourteen degree of longitude about seven hundred mile wide it include many savage tribe of the far interior who acknowledge the supremacy of the inca and bring tribute to manco and he son the mañaries and the pilcosone come a hundred and two hundred league to visit the inca in uitico the name vilcabamba be also apply repeatedly to a town titu cusus say he live there many year during he youth calancha say it be two day ' journey from puquiura raimondus think it must be choqquequirau captain garcium 's soldier however speak of it as be down in the warm valley of the montaña the present rubber country on the other hand the only place which bear this name on the map of peru be near the source of the vilcabamba river not more than three or four league from pucyura we determine to visit it we find the town to lie on the edge of bleak upland pasture 11750 foot above the sea instead of inca wall or ruin vilcabamba have threescore solidly build spanish house at the time of we visit they be mostly empty although they roof of unusually heavy thatch seem to be in good repair we stay at the house of the gobernador manuel condoré the night be bitterly cold and we should have be most uncomfortable in a tent the gobernador say that the reason the town be desert be that most of the people be now attend to they chacra or little farm and look after they herd of sheep and cattle in the neighbor valley he say that only at special festival time such as the annual visit of the priest who celebrate mass in the church here once a year be the building fully occupy in the latter part of the sixteenth century gold mine be discover in the adjacent mountain and the capital of the spanish province of vilcabamba be transfer from hoyara to this place its official name condoré say be still san francisco de la victoria de vilcabamba and as such it occur on most of the early map of peru the solidity of the stone house be due to the prosperity of the gold digger the present air of desolation and absence of population be probably due to the decay of that industry ------ figure ñusta isppana ------ the church be large near it and slightly apart from the building be a picturesque stone belfry with three old spanish bell condoré say that the church be build at least three hundred year ago it be probably the very structure whose construction be carefully supervise by ocampo in the negotiation for permission to move the municipality of san francisco de la victoria from hoyara to the neighborhood of the mine ocampo then one of the chief settler go to cuzco as agent of the interested party to take the matter up with the viceroy ocampo 's story be in part as follow : the change of site appear convenient for the service of god we lord and of he majesty and for the increase of he royal fifth as well as beneficial to the inhabitant of the say city have examine the capitulation and reason the say don luis de velasco -lrb- the viceroy -rrb- grant the licence to move the city to where it be now found order that it should have the title and name of the city of san francisco of the victory of uilcapampa which be its first name by this change of site i the say baltasar de ocampo perform a great service to god we lord and he majesty through my care industry and solicitude a very good church be build with its principal chapel and great door we find the wall to be heavy massive and well buttress the door to be unusually large and the whole to show considerable industry and solicitude the site be call onccoy where the spaniard who first discover this land find the flock and herd modern vilcabamba be on grassy slope well suit for flock and herd on the steeper slope potato be still raise although the valley itself be give up to-day almost entirely to pasture land we see horse cattle and sheep in abundance where the inca must have pasture they llama and alpaca in the rocky cliff near by be remains of the mine begin in ocampo 's day there be little doubt that this be onccoy although that name be now no longer use here we meet at the gobernador 's a old indian who admit that a inca have once live on rosaspa hill of all the score of person whom we interview through the courtesy of the intelligent planter of the region or through the customary assistance of government official this indian be the only one to make such a admission even he deny have hear of uitico or any of its variation if we be indeed in the country of manco and he son why should no one be familiar with that name perhaps after all it be not surprising the indian of the highland have now for so many generation be neglect by they ruler and brutalize by be allow to drink all the alcohol they can purchase and to assimilate all the cocaine they can secure through the constant chew of coca leave that they have lose much if not all of they racial self-respect it be the educate mestizo of the principal modern city of peru who trace they descent not only from the spanish soldier of the conquest but also from the blood of the race which be conquer take pride in the achievement of the inca and be endeavor to preserve the remains of the wonderful civilization of they native ancestor until quite recently vilcabamba be a unknown land to most of the peruvian even those who live in the city of cuzco have the capital of the last four inca be in a region whose climate appeal to european whose natural resource be sufficient to support a large population and whose road make transportation no more difficult than in most part of the ande it would have be occupy from the day of captain garcium to the present by spanish-speaking mestizo who might have be interested in preserve the name of the ancient inca capital and the tradition connect with it after the mine which attract ocampo and he friend peter out or else with the primitive tool of the sixteenth century cease to yield adequate return the spaniard lose interest in that remote region the rude trail which connected pucyura with cuzco and civilization be at best dangerous and difficult they be veritably impassable during a large part of the year even to people accustom to andean road the possibility of raise sugar cane and coca between huadquiña and santa ana attract a few spanish-speaking people to live in the lower urubamba valley notwithstanding the difficult transportation over the pass near mt salcantay and veronica but there be nothing to lead any one to visit the upper vilcabamba valley or to desire to make it a place of residence and until señor pancorbo open the road to lucma pucyura be extremely difficult of access nine generation of indian live and die in the province of uilcapampa between the time of tupac amaru and the arrival of the first modern explorer the great stone building construct on the hill of rose in the day of manco and he son be allow to fall into ruin they roof decay and disappear the name of those who once live here be know to fewer and fewer of the native the indian themselves have no desire to relate the story of the various fort and palace to they spanish landlord nor have the latter any interest in hear such tale it be not until the renaissance of historical and geographical curiosity in the nineteenth century that it occur to any one to look for manco 's capital when raimondus the first scientist to penetrate vilcabamba reach pucyura no one think to tell he that on the hilltop opposite the village once live the last of the inca and that the ruin of they palace be still there hide underneath a thick growth of tree and vine a spanish document of 1598 say the first town of san francisco de la victoria de vilcabamba be in the valley of vitico the town 's long name become shorten to vilcabamba then the river which flow past be call the vilcabamba and be so marked on raimondus 's map uitico have long since pass from the memory of man furthermore the fact that we see no llama or alpaca in the upland pasture but only domestic animal of european origin would also seem to indicate that for some reason or other this region have be abandon by the indian themselves it be difficult to believe that if the indian have inhabit these valley continuously from inca time to the present we should not have find at least a few of the indigenous american camel here by itself such a occurrence would hardly seem worth a remark but take in connection with the loss of tradition regard uitico it would seem to indicate that there must have be quite a long period of time in which no person of consequence live in this vicinity we be tell by the historian of the colonial period that the mining operation of the first spanish settler be fatal to at least a million indian it be quite probable that the introduction of ordinary european contagious disease such as measles chicken pox and smallpox may have have a great deal to do with the destruction of a large proportion of those unfortunate whose untimely death be attribute by historian to the very cruel practice of the early spanish miner and treasure seeker both cause undoubtedly contribute to the result there seem to be no question that the population diminish enormously in early colonial day if this be true the remain population would naturally have seek region where the condition of existence and human intercourse be less severe and rigorous than in the valley of uitico and uilcapampa the student and traveler of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century include such a careful observer as bandelier be of the opinion that the present-day population in the ande of peru and bolivium be about as great as that at the time of the conquest in other word with the decay of early colonial mining and the consequent disappearance of bad living condition and force labor at the mine also with the rise of partial immunity to european disease and the more comfortable condition of existence which have follow the come of peruvian independence it be reasonable to suppose that the number of highland indian have increase with this increase have come a consequent crowding in certain locality there would be a natural tendency to seek less crowded region even at the expense of use difficult mountain trail this would lead to they occupy as remote and inaccessible a region as the ancient province of uilcapampa it be probable that after the gold mine cease to pay and before the demand for rubber cause the san miguel valley to be appropriate by the white man there be a period of nearly three hundred year when no one of education or of intelligence superior to the ordinary indian shepherd live anywhere near pucyura or lucma the adobe house of these modern village look fairly modern they may have be build in the nineteenth century such a theory would account for the very small amount of information prevail in peru regard the region where we have be privileged to find so many ruin this ignorance lead the peruvian geographer raimondus and paz soldan to conclude that choqquequirau the only ruin report between the apurimac and the urubamba must have be the capital of the inca who take refuge there it also make it seem more reasonable that the existence of rosaspa and ñusta isppana should not have be know to peruvian geographer and historian or even to the government official who live in the adjacent village we feel sure we have find uitico nevertheless it be quite apparent that we have not yet find all the place which be call vilcabamba examination of the writer of the sixteenth century show that there may have be three place bear that name one speak of by calancha as vilcabamba viejo -lrb- the old -rrb- another also so call by ocampo and a third found by the spaniard namely the town we be now in the story of the first be give in calancha 's account of the trial and tribulation of friar marco and the martyrdom of friar diego ortiz the chronicler tell with considerable detail of they visit to vilcabamba viejo it be after the monk have already found they religious establishment at puquiura that they learn of the existence of this important religious center they urge titu cusus to permit they to visit it for a long time he refuse its whereabouts remain unknown to they but its strategic position as a religious stronghold lead they to continue they demand finally either to rid himself of they importunity or because he imagine the undertaking might be make amusing he yield to they request and bid they prepare for the journey calancha say that the inca himself accompany the two friar with a number of he captain and chieftain take they from puquiura over a very rough and rugged road the inca however do not suffer from the character of the trail because like the roman general of old he be bear comfortably along in a litter by servant accustom to this duty the unfortunate missionary be oblige to go on foot the wet rocky trail soon demoralize they footgear when they come to a particularly bad place in the road ungacacha the trail go for some distance through water the monk be force to wade the water be very cold the inca and he chieftain be amuse to see how the friar be hamper by they monastic garment while pass through the water however the monk persevere greatly desire to reach they goal on account of its be the largest city in which be the university of idolatry where live the teacher who be wizard and master of abomination if one may judge by the name of the place uilcapampa the wizard and sorcerer be probably aid by the powerful effect of the ancient snuff make from huilca seed after a three day ' journey over very rough country the monk arrive at they destination yet even then titu cusi be unwilling that they should live in the city but order that the monk be give a dwelling outside so that they might not witness the ceremony and ancient rite which be practice by the inca and he captain and priest nothing be say about the appearance of vilcabamba viejo and it be doubtful whether the monk be ever allow to see the city although they reach its vicinity here they stay for three week and keep up they preach and teach during they stay titu cusi who have not wish to bring they here get he revenge by annoy they in various way he be particularly anxious to make they break they vow of celibacy calancha say that after consultation with he priest and soothsayer titu cusus select as tempter the most beautiful indian woman include some individual of the yunga who be unusually attractive it be possible that these woman who live at the university of idolatry in vilcabamba viejo be virgin of the sun who be under the order of the inca and he high priest and be select from the fairest daughter of the empire it be also evident that vilcabamba viejo be so construct that the monk could be keep for three week in its vicinity without be able to see what be go on in the city or to describe the kind of abomination which be practice there as they do those at the white rock of chuquipalta as will be show later it be possible that this vilcabamba refer to in calancha 's story as vilcabamba viejo be on the slope of the mountain now call machu picchu in the meantime it be necessary to pursue the hunt for the ruin of vilcabamba call the old by ocampo to distinguish it from the spanish town of that name which he have help to find after the capture of tupac amaru and refer to merely as vilcabamba by captain garcium and he companion in they account of the campaign chapter xiv conservidayoc when don pedro duque of santa aria be help we to identify place mention in calancha and ocampo the reference to vilcabamba viejo or old uilcapampa be suppose by two of he informant to point to a place call conservidayoc don pedro tell we that in 1902 lopez torre who have travel much in the montaña look for rubber tree report the discovery there of the ruin of a inca city all of don pedro 's friend assure we that conservidayoc be a terrible place to reach no one now live have be there it be inhabit by savage indian who would not let stranger enter they village when we reach paltaybamba señor pancorbo 's manager confirm what we have hear he say further that a individual name saavedra live at conservidayoc and undoubtedly know all about the ruin but be very averse to receive visitor saavedra 's house be extremely difficult to find no one have be there recently and return alive opinion differ as to how far away it be several day later while professor foote and i be study the ruin near rosaspa señor pancorbo return from he rubber estate in the san miguel valley and learning at lucma of we presence near by take great pain to find we and see how we be progress when he learn of we intention to search for the ruin of conservidayoc he ask we to desist from the attempt he say saavedra be a very powerful man have many indian under he control and living in grand state with fifty servant and not at all desirous of be visit by anybody the indian be of the campa tribe very wild and extremely savage they use poison arrow and be very hostile to stranger admit that he have hear there be inca ruin near saavedra 's station señor pancorbo still beg we not to risk we life by go to look for they by this time we curiosity be thoroughly arouse we be familiar with the current story regard the habit of savage tribe who live in the montaña and whose service be in great demand as rubber gatherer we have even hear that indian do not particularly like to work for señor pancorbo who be a energetic ambitious man anxious to achieve many thing result which require more laborer than could easily be obtain we could readily believe there might possibly be indian at conservidayoc who have escape from the rubber estate of san miguel undoubtedly señor pancorbo 's own life would have be at the mercy of they poison arrow all over the amazon basin the exigency of rubber gatherer have cause tribe visit with impunity by the explorer of the nineteenth century to become so savage and revengeful as to lead they to kill all white man at sight professor foote and i consider the matter in all its aspect we finally come to the conclusion that in view of the specific report regard the presence of inca ruin at conservidayoc we could not afford to follow the advice of the friendly planter we must at least make a effort to reach they meanwhile take every precaution to avoid arouse the enmity of the powerful saavedra and he savage retainer ------ figure quispus cusus testify about inca ruin ------ ------ figure one of we bearer cross the pampacona river ------ on the day follow we arrival at the town of vilcabamba the gobernador condoré take counsel with he chief assistant have summon the wisest indian live in the vicinity include a very picturesque old fellow whose name quispi cusi be strongly reminiscent of the day of titu cusi it be explain to he that this be a very solemn occasion and that a official inquiry be in progress he take off he hat -- but not he knit cap -- and endeavor to the best of he ability to answer we question about the surrounding country it be he who say that the inca tupac amaru once live at rosaspa he have never hear of uilcapampa viejo but he admit that there be ruin in the montaña near conservidayoc other indian be question by condoré several have hear of the ruin of conservidayoc but apparently none of they nor any one in the village have actually see the ruin or visit they immediate vicinity they all agree that saavedra 's place be at least four day ' hard journey on foot in the montaña beyond pampacona no village of that name appear on any map of peru although it be frequently mention in the document of the sixteenth century rodriguez de figueroa who come to seek a audience with titu cusus about 1565 say that he meet titu cusi at a place call banbacona he say further that the inca come there from somewhere down in the dense forest of the montaña and present he with a macaw and two hamper of peanut -- product of a warm region we have bring with we the large sheet of raimondus 's invaluable map which cover this locality we also have the new map of south peru and north bolivium which have just be publish by the royal geographical society and give a summary of all available information the indian say that conservidayoc lay in a westerly direction from vilcabamba yet on raimondus 's map all of the river which rise in the mountain west of the town be short affluent of the apurimac and flow southwest we wonder whether the story about ruin at conservidayoc would turn out to be as barren of foundation as those we have hear from the trustworthy foreman at huadquiña one of we informant say the inca city be call espiritu pampa or the pampa of ghost would the ruin turn out to be ghost would they vanish on the arrival of white man with camera and steel measuring tape no one at vilcabamba have see the ruin but they say that at the village of pampacona about five league from here there be indian who have actually be to conservidayoc we supplies be get low there be no shop nearer than lucma no food be obtainable from the native accordingly notwithstanding the protestation of the hospitable gobernador we decide to start immediately for conservidayoc at the end of a long day 's march up the vilcabamba valley professor foote with he accustomed skill be prepare the evening meal and we be both look forward with satisfaction to enjoy large cup of we favorite beverage several year ago when travel on muleback across the great plateau of southern bolivium i have learn the value of sweet hot tea as a stimulant and bracer in the high ande at first astonished to see how much tea the indian arriero drink i learn from sad experience that it be far better than cold water which often bring on mountain-sickness this particular evening one swallow of the hot tea cause consternation it be the most horrible stuff imaginable examination show small oily particle float on the surface further investigation lead to the discovery that one of we arriero have that day place we can of kerosene on top of one of the load the tin become leaky and the kerosene have drip down into a food box a cloth bag of granulated sugar have eagerly absorb all the oil it could there be no remedy but to throw away half of we supply as i have say the longer one work in the ande the more desirable do sugar become and the more one seem to crave it yet we be unable to procure any here after the usual delay cause in part by the difficulty of catch we mule which have take advantage of we historical investigation to stray far up the mountain pasture we finally set out from the boundary of known topography head for conservidayoc a vague place surround with mystery a land of hostile savage albeit say to possess the ruin of a inca town we first day 's journey be to pampacona here and in its vicinity the gobernador tell we he could procure guide and the half-dozen carrier whose service we should require for the jungle trail where mule could not be use as the indian hereabouts be averse to penetrate the wild of conservidayoc and be also likely to be extremely alarm at the sight of man in uniform the two gendarme who be now accompany we be instruct to delay they departure for a few hour and not to reach pampacona with we pack train until dusk the gobernador say that if the indian of pampacona catch sight of any brass button come over the hill they would hide so effectively that it would be impossible to secure any carrier apparently this be due in part to that love of freedom which have lead they to abandon the more comfortable town for a frontier village where landlord could not call on they for force labor consequently before the arrival of any such striking manifestation of official authority as we gendarme the gobernador and he friend mogrovejo propose to put in the day craftily commandeer the service of a half-dozen sturdy indian they method will be describe presently leave modern vilcabamba we cross the flat marshy bottom of a old glaciated valley in which one of we mule get thoroughly mire while search for the succulent grass which cover the treacherous bog ford the vilcabamba river which here be only a tiny brook we climb out of the valley and turn westward on the mountain above we be vestige of several abandon mine it be they discovery in 1572 or thereabout which bring ocampo and the first spanish settler to this valley raimondus say that he find here cobalt nickel silver-bearing copper ore and lead sulphide he do not mention any gold-bearing quartz it may have be exhaust long before he day as to the other mineral the difficulty of transportation be so great that it be not likely that mining will be renew here for many year to come at the top of the pass we turn to look back and see a long chain of snow-capped mountain tower above and behind the town of vilcabamba we search in vain for they on we map raimondus follow by the royal geographical society do not leave room enough for such a range to exist between the river apurimac and urubamba mr hendriksen determine we longitude to be 73 ° west and we latitude to be 13 ° 8 ' south yet accord to the latest map of this region publish in the preceding year this be the very position of the river apurimac itself near its junction with the river pampas we ought to have be swim the great speaker actually we be on top of a lofty mountain pass surround by high peak and glacier the mystery be finally solve by mr bumstead in 1912 when he determine the apurimac and the urubamba to be thirty mile farther apart than any one have suppose he survey open a unexplored region 1500 square mile in extent whose very existence have not be guess before 1911 it prove to be one of the largest undescribed glaciated area in south america yet it be less than a hundred mile from cuzco the chief city in the peruvian ande and the site of a university for more than three century that uilcapampa could so long defy investigation and exploration show better than anything else how wisely manco have select he refuge it be indeed a veritable labyrinth of snow-clad peak unknown glacier and trackless canyon look west we see in front of we a great wilderness of deep green valley and forest-clad slope we suppose from we map that we be now look down into the basin of the apurimac as a matter of fact we be on the rim of the valley of the hitherto uncharted pampacona a branch of the cosirenus one of the affluent of the urubamba instead of be the apurimac basin what we see be another unexplored region which drain into the urubamba at the time however we do not know where we be but understand from condoré that somewhere far down in the montaña below we be conservidayoc the sequestered domain of saavedra and he savage indian it seem less likely than ever that the inca could have build a town so far away from the climate and food to which they be accustom the road be now so bad that only with the greatest difficulty could we coax we sure-footed mule to follow it once we have to dismount as the path lead down a long steep rocky stairway of ancient origin at last round a hill we come in sight of a lonesome little hut perch on a shoulder of the mountain in front of it seat in the sun on mat be two woman shell corn as soon as they see the gobernador approach they stop they work and begin to prepare lunch it be about eleven o'clock and they do not need to be tell that señor condoré and he friend have not have anything but a cup of coffee since the night before in order to meet the emergency of unexpected guest they kill four or five squeal cuy -lrb- guinea pig -rrb- usually to be find scurry about the mud floor of the hut of mountain indian before long the savory odor of roast cuy well baste and cooked-to-a-turn on primitive spit whet we appetite in the eastern united state one see guinea pig only as pet or laboratory victim never as a article of food in spite of the celebrated dogma that pig be pig this form of pork have never find its way to we kitchen even though these pig live on a very clean vegetable diet incidentally guinea pig do not come from guinea and be in no way related to pig -- mr elli parker butler to the contrary notwithstanding they belong rather to the same family as rabbit and belgian hare and have long be a highly prize article of food in the ande of peru the wild species be of a grayish brown color which enable they to escape observation in they natural habitat the domestic variety which one see in the hut of the indian be piebald black white and tawny vary from one another in color as much as do the llama which be also domesticate by the same race of people thousand of year ago although anglo-saxon folkway as professor sumner would say permit we to eat and enjoy long-eared rabbit we draw the line at short-eared rabbit yet they be breed to be eat i be willing to admit that this be the first time that i have ever knowingly taste they delicate flesh although once in the capital of bolivium i think the hotel kitchen have a diminish supply have i not be very hungry i might never have know how delicious a roast guinea pig can be the meat be not unlike squab to the indian whose supply of animal food be small whose fowl be treasured for they egg and whose thin sheep be more valuable as wool bearer than as mutton the succulent guinea pig most prolific of mammal as be discover by mr butler 's hero be a highly value article of food reserve for special occasion the north american housewife keep a few tin of sardine and can of preserve on hand for emergency she sister in the ande similarly rely on fat little cuy after lunch condoré and mogrovejo divide the extensive roll countryside between they and each ride quietly from one lonesome farm to another look for man to engage as bearer when they be so fortunate as to find the man of the house at home or work in he little chacra they greet he pleasantly when he come forward to shake hand in the usual indian manner a silver dollar be un-suspectingly slip into the palm of he right hand and he be inform that he have accept pay for service which must now be perform it seem hard but this be the only way in which it be possible to secure carrier during inca time the indian never receive pay for they labor a paternal government see to it that they be properly feed and clothe and either give abundant opportunity to provide for they own necessity or else permit to draw on official store in colonial day a more greedy and less paternal government take advantage of the ancient system and enforce it without take pain to see that it should not cause suffer then for generation thoughtless landlord back by local authority force the indian to work without suitably recompense they at the end of they labor or even pretend to carry out promise and wage agreement the peon learn that it be unwise to perform any labor without first have receive a considerable portion of they pay when once they accept money however they own custom and the law of the land provide that they must carry out they obligation failure to do so mean legal punishment consequently when a unfortunate pampacona indian find he have a dollar in he hand he bemoan he fate but realize that service be inevitable in vain do he plead that he be busy that he crop need attention that he family could not spare he that he lack food for a journey condoré and mogrovejo be accustom to all variety of excuse they succeed in engage half a dozen carrier before dark we reach the village of pampacona a few small hut scatter over grassy hillside at a elevation of 10000 foot in the note of one of the military adviser of viceroy francisco de toledo be a reference to pampacona as a high cold place this be correct nevertheless i doubt if the present village be the pampacona mention in the document of garcium 's day as be a important town of the inca there be no ruin hereabouts the hut of pampacona be newly build of stone and mud and thatched with grass they be occupy by a group of sturdy mountain indian who enjoy unusual freedom from official or other interference and a good place in which to raise sheep and cultivate potato on the very edge of the dense forest we find that there be some excitement in the village because on the previous night a jaguar or possibly a cougar have come out of the forest attack kill and drag off one of the village pony we be conduct to the dwelling of a stocky well-built indian name guzman the most reliable man in the village who have be select to be the head of the party of carrier that be to accompany we to conservidayoc guzman have some spanish blood in he vein although he do not boast of it with he wife and six child he occupy one of the best hut a fire in one corner frequently fill it with acrid smoke it be very small and have no window at one end be a loft where family treasure could be keep dry and reasonably safe from molestation pile of sheep skin be arrange for visitor to sit upon three or four rude niche in the wall serve in lieu of shelf and table the floor of well-trodden clay be damp three mongrel dog and a flea-bitten cat be welcome to share the narrow space with the family and they visitor a dozen hog enter stealthily and try to avoid attention by put a muffler on involuntary grunt they do not succeed and be violently eject by a boy with a whip only to return again and again each time to be drive out as before squeal loudly notwithstanding these interruption we carry on a most interesting conversation with guzman he have be to conservidayoc and have himself actually see ruin at espiritu pampa at last the mythical pampa of ghost begin to take on in we mind a aspect of reality even though we be careful to remind ourselves that another very trustworthy man have say he have see ruin finer than ollantaytambo near huadquiña guzman do not seem to dread conservidayoc as much as the other indian only one of whom have ever be there to cheer they up we purchase a fat sheep for which we pay fifty cent guzman immediately butcher it in preparation for the journey although it be August and the middle of the dry season rain begin to fall early in the afternoon sergeant carrasco arrive after dark with we pack animal but miss the trail as he near guzman 's place one of the mule step into a bog and be extract only with considerable difficulty we decide to pitch we small pyramidal tent on a fairly well-drained bit of turf not far from guzman 's little hut in the evening after we have have a long talk with the indian we come back through the rain to we comfortable little tent only to hear various and sundry grunt emerge therefrom we find that during we absence a large sow and six fat young pig unable to settle down comfortably at the guzman hearth have decide that we tent be much the driest available place on the mountain side and that we blanket make a particularly attractive bed they have considerable difficulty in get out of the small door as fast as they wish nevertheless the pour rain and the memory of comfortable blanket cause the pig to return at interval as we be start to enjoy we first nap guzman with hospitable intent send we two bowl of steam soup which at first glance seem to contain various size of white macaroni -- a dish of which one of we be particularly fond the white hollow cylinder prove to be extraordinarily tough not the usual kind of macaroni as a matter of fact we learn that the evening meal which guzman 's wife have prepare for she guest be make chiefly of sheep 's entrails rain continue without intermission during the whole of a very cold and dreary night we tent which have never be wet before leak badly the only part which seem to be thoroughly waterproof be the floor as day dawn we find ourselves to be lie in puddle of water everything be soak furthermore rain be still fail while we be discuss the situation and wonder what we should cook for breakfast the faithful guzman hear we voice and immediately send we two more bowl of hot soup which be this time more welcome even though among the bountiful corn bean and potato we come unexpectedly upon fragment of the tooth and jaw of the sheep evidently in pampacona nothing be waste we be anxious to make a early start for conservidayoc but it be first necessary for we indian to prepare food for the ten day ' journey ahead of they guzman 's wife and i suppose the wife of we other carrier spend the morning grind chuño -lrb- frozen potato -rrb- with a rock stone pestle on a flat stone mortar and parching or toast large quantity of sweet corn in a terra-cotta ollum with chuño and tostado the body of the sheep and a small quantity of coca leave the indian profess themselves to be perfectly contented of we own provision we have so small a quantity that we be unable to spare any however it be doubtful whether the indian would have like they as much as the food to which they have long be accustom toward noon all the indian carrier but one have arrive and the rain have partly subside we start for conservidayoc we be tell that it would be possible to use the mule for this day 's journey san fernando we first stop be seven league away far down in the densely wooded pampacona valley leave the village we climb up the mountain back of guzman 's hut and follow a faint trail by a dangerous and precarious route along the crest of the ridge the rain have not improve the path we saddle mule be of little use we have to go nearly all the way on foot owe to cold rain and mist we could see but little of the deep canyon which open below we and into which we now begin to descend through the cloud by a very steep zigzag path four thousand foot to a hot tropical valley below the cloud we find ourselves near a small abandon clearing pass this and ford little stream we go along a very narrow path across steep slope on which maize have be plant finally we come to another little clearing and two extremely primitive little shanty mere shelter not deserving to be call hut and this be san fernando the end of the mule trail there be scarcely room enough in they for we six carrier it be with great difficulty we find and clear a place for we tent although its floor be only seven foot square there be no really flat land at all at 8:30 pm August 13 1911 while lie on the ground in we tent i notice a earthquake it be feel also by the indian in the near-by shelter who from force of habit rush out of they frail structure and make a great disturbance cry out that there be a temblor even have they little thatched roof fall upon they as it might have do during the stormy night which follow they be in no danger but be accustom to the stone wall and red tiled roof of mountain village where earthquake sometimes do very serious harm they be greatly excite the motion seem to I to be like a slight shuffle from west to east lasting three or four seconds a gentle rock back and forth with eight or ten vibration several week later near huadquiña we happen to stop at the colpanus telegraph office the operator say he have feel two shock on August 13th -- one at five o'clock which have shake the book off he table and knock over a box of insulator stand along a wall which run north and south he say the shock which i have feel be the lighter of the two during the night it rain hard but we tent be now adjust itself to the dry season and we be more comfortable furthermore camp out at 10000 foot above sea level be very different from camp at 6000 foot this elevation similar to that of the bridge of san miguel below machu picchu be on the lower edge of the temperate zone and the beginning of the torrid tropics sugar cane pepper banana and grenadilla grow here as well as maize squash and sweet potato none of these thing will grow at pampacona the indian who raise sheep and white potato in that cold region come to san fernando to make chacra or small clearing the three or four native whom we find here be so alarm by the sight of brass button that they disappear during the night rather than take the chance of have a silver dollar press into they hand in the morning from san fernando we send one of we gendarme back to pampacona with the mule we carrier be good for about fifty pound apiece half a hour 's walk bring we to vista alegre another little clearing on a alluvial fan in the bend of the river the soil here seem to be very rich in the chacra we see corn stalk eighteen foot in height near a gigantic tree almost completely envelop in the embrace of a mato-palo or parasitic fig tree this clearing certainly deserve its name for it command a charming view of the green pampacona valley opposite we rise abruptly a heavily forested mountain whose summit be lose in the cloud a mile above to circumvent this mountain the river have be flow in a westerly direction now it gradually turn to the northward again we be mystify for by raimondus 's map it should have go southward we enter a dense jungle where the narrow path become more and more difficult for we carrier crawl over rock under branch along slippery little cliff on step which have be cut in earth or rock over a trail which not even dog could follow unassisted slowly we make we way down the valley owe to the heat humidity and the frequent shower it be mid-afternoon before we reach another little clearing call pacaypa here on a hillside nearly a thousand foot above the river we man decide to spend the night in a tiny little shelter six foot long and five foot wide professor foote and i have to dig a shelf out of the steep hillside in order to pitch we tent the next morning not be detain by the vagary of a mule train we make a early start as we follow the faint little trail across the gulch tributary to the river pampacona we have to negotiate several unusually steep descent and ascent the bearer suffer from the heat they find it more and more difficult to carry they load twice we have to cross the rapid of the river on primitive bridge which consist only of a few little log lash together and rest on slippery boulder by one o'clock we find ourselves on a small plain -lrb- ele 4500 ft -rrb- in dense wood surround by tree fern vine and tangled thicket through which it be impossible to see for more than a few foot here guzman tell we we must stop and rest a while as we be now in the territory of lo salvaje the savage indian who acknowledge only the rule of saavedra and resent all intrusion guzman do not seem to be particularly afraid but say that we ought to send ahead one of we carrier to warn the savage that we be come on a friendly mission and be not in search of rubber gatherer otherwise they might attack we or run away and disappear into the jungle he say we should never be able to find the ruin without they help the carrier who be select to go ahead do not relish he task leave he pack behind he proceed very quietly and cautiously along the trail and be lose to view almost immediately there follow a exciting half-hour while we wait wonder what attitude the savage would take toward we and try to picture to ourselves the mighty potentate saavedra who have be describe as sit in the midst of savage luxury surround by fifty servant and direct he myrmidon to checkmate we desire to visit the inca city on the pampa of ghost suddenly we be startle by the crackling of twig and the sound of a man run we instinctively hold we rifle a little tighter in readiness for whatever might befall -- when there burst out of the wood a pleasant-faced young peruvian quite conventionally clothe who have come in haste from saavedra he father to extend to we a most cordial welcome it seem scarcely credible but a glance at he face show that there be no ambush in store for we it be with a sigh of relief that we realize there be to be no shower of poison arrow from the impenetrable thicket gather up we pack we continue along the jungle trail through wood which gradually become higher deeper and darker until presently we see sunlight ahead and to we intense astonishment the bright green of wave sugar cane a few moment of walk through the cane field find we at a large comfortable hut welcome very simply and modestly by saavedra himself a more pleasant and peaceable little man it be never my good fortune to meet we look furtively around for he fifty savage servant but all we see be he good-natured indian wife three or four small child and a wild-eyed maid-of-all-work evidently the only savage present saavedra say some call this place jesús marium because they be so surprised when they see it it be difficult to describe we feeling as we accept saavedra 's invitation to make ourselves at home and sit down to a abundant meal of boil chicken rice and sweet cassava -lrb- manioc -rrb- saavedra give we to understand that we be not only most welcome to anything he have but that he would do everything to enable we to see the ruin which be it seem at espiritu pampa some distance farther down the valley to be reach only by a hard trail passable for barefooted savage but scarcely available for we unless we choose to go a good part of the distance on hand and knee the next day while we carrier be engage in clear this trail professor foote collect a large number of insect include eight new species of moth and butterfly i inspect saavedra 's plantation the soil have lain fallow for century and be rich in humus have produce more sugar cane than he could grind in addition to this he have banana coffee tree sweet potato tobacco and peanut instead of be a very powerful chief have many indian under he control -- a kind of pooh-bah -- he be merely a pioneer in the utter wilderness far from any neighbor surround by dense forest and a few savage he have establish he home he be not a indian potentate but only a frontiersman soft-spoken and energetic a ingenious carpenter and mechanic a modest peruvian of the best type owe to the scarcity of arable land he be oblige to cultivate such pampas as he could find -- one a alluvial fan near he house another a natural terrace near the river back of the house be a thatched shelter under which he have construct a little sugar mill it have a pair of hardwood roller each capable of be turn with much creaking and crack by a large rustic wheel make of roughly hew timber fasten together with wooden pin and lash with thong work by hand and foot power since saavedra have be unable to coax any pack animal over the trail to conservidayoc he be oblige to depend entirely on he own limited strength and that of he active son aid by the uncertain and irregular service of such savage as wish to work for sugar trinket or other trade article sometimes the savage seem to enjoy the fun of climb on the great creaking treadwheel as though it be a game at other time they would disappear in the wood near the mill be some interesting large pot which saavedra be use in the process of boil the juice and make crude sugar he say he have find the pot in the jungle not far away they have be make by the inca four of they be of the familiar aryballus type another be of a closely related form have a wide mouth point base single incise conventionalize animal-head nubbin attach to the shoulder and band-shaped handle attach vertically below the median line although capable of hold more than ten gallon this huge pot be intend to be carry on the back and shoulder by means of a rope pass through the handle and around the nubbin saavedra say that he have find near he house several bottle-shaped cist line with stone with a flat stone on top -- evidently ancient grave the bone have entirely disappear the cover of one of the grave have be pierce the hole cover with a thin sheet of beaten silver he have also find a few stone implement and two or three small bronze inca axis on the pampa below he house saavedra have construct with infinite labor another sugar mill it seem strange that he should have take the trouble to make two mill but when one remember that he have no pack animal and be usually oblige to bring the cane to the mill on he own back and the back of he son one realize that it be easier while the cane be grow to construct a new mill near the cane field than to have to carry the heavy bundle of ripe cane up the hill he say he hardest task be to get money with which to send he child to school in cuzco and to pay he tax the only way in which he could get any cash be by make chancaca crude brown sugar and carry it on he back fifty pound at a time three hard day ' journey on foot up the mountain to pampacona or vilcabamba six or seven thousand foot above he little plantation he say he could usually sell such a load for five sole equivalent to two dollar and a half he be certainly a hard lot but he do not complain although he smilingly admit that it be very difficult to keep the trail open since the jungle grow so fast and the flood in the river continually wash away he little rustic bridge he chief regret be that as the result of a recent revolution with which he have have nothing to do the government have decree that all firearm should be turn in and so he have lose the one thing he need to enable he to get fresh meat in the forest ------ figure saavedra and he inca pottery ------ ------ figure inca gable at espiritu pampa ------ in the clearing near the house we be interested to see a large turkey-like bird the pava de la montaña glossy black its most striking feature a high coral red comb although completely at liberty it seem to be thoroughly domesticate it would make a attractive bird for introduction into we southern state saavedra give we some very black leaf of native tobacco which he have cure a inveterate smoker who try it in he pipe say it be without exception the strongest stuff he ever have encounter so interested do i become in talk with saavedra see he plantation and marveling that he should be worry about tax and have to obey regulation in regard to firearm i have almost forget about the wild indian suddenly we carrier run toward the house in a great flurry of excitement shout that there be a savage in the bush near by the wild man be very timid but curiosity finally get the better of fear and he summon up sufficient courage to accept saavedra 's urgent invitation that he come out and meet we he prove to be a miserable specimen suffering from a very bad cold in he head it have be my good fortune at one time or another to meet primitive folk in various part of america and the pacific but this man be by far the dirtiest and most wretched savage that i have ever see he be dress in a long filthy tunic which come nearly to he ankle it be make of a large square of coarsely weave cotton cloth with a hole in the middle for he head the side be stitch up leave hole for the arm he hair be long unkempt and mat he have small deep-set eye cadaverous cheek thick lip and a large mouth he big toe be unusually long and prehensile slung over one shoulder he carry a small knapsack make of coarse fiber net around he neck hang what at first sight seem to be a necklace compose of a dozen stout cord securely knot together although i do not see it in use i be give to understand that when climb tree he use this stout loop to fasten he ankle together and thus secure a tighter grip for he foot by evening two other savage have come in a young married man and he little sister both have bad cold saavedra tell we that these indian be pichanguerras a subdivision of the campa tribe saavedra and he son speak a little of they language which sound to we unaccustomed ear like a succession of low grunt breathing and guttural it be piece out by sign the long tunic worn by the man indicate that they have one or more wife before marry they wear very scanty attire -- nothing more than a few rag hang over one shoulder and tie about the waist the long tunic a comfortable enough garment to wear during the cold night and they only cover must impede they progress in the jungle yet they live partly by hunting use bow and arrow we learn that these pichanguerra have run away from the rubber country in the lower valley that they find it uncomfortably cold at this altitude 4500 foot but preferred freedom in the higher valley to serfdom on a rubber estate saavedra say that he have name he plantation conservidayoc because it be in truth a spot where one may be preserve from harm such be the home of the potentate from whose abode no one have be know to return alive chapter xv the pampa of ghost two day later we leave conservidayoc for espiritu pampa by the trail which saavedra 's son and we pampacona indian have be clear we emerge from the thicket near a promontory where there be a fine view down the valley and particularly of a heavily wooded alluvial fan just below we in it be two or three small clearing and the little oval hut of the savage of espiritu pampa the pampa of ghost on top of the promontory be the ruin of a small rectangular building of rough stone once probably a inca watch-tower from here to espiritu pampa we trail follow a ancient stone stairway about four foot in width and nearly a third of a mile long it be build of uncut stone possibly it be the work of those soldier whose chief duty it be to watch from the top of the promontory and who use they spare time make road we arrive at the principal clear just as a heavy thunder-shower begin the hut be empty obviously they occupant have see we come and have disappear in the jungle we hesitate to enter the home of a savage without a invitation but the terrific downpour overcome we scruple if not we nervousness the hut have a steeply pitch roof its side be make of small log drive endwise into the ground and fasten together with vine a small fire have be burn on the ground near the ember be two old black olla of inca origin in the little chacra cassava coca and sweet potato be grow in haphazard fashion among char and fall tree trunk a typical milpa farm in the clearing be the ruin of eighteen or twenty circular house arrange in a irregular group we wonder if this could be the inca city which lopez torre have report among the ruin we pick up several fragment of inca pottery there be nothing incaic about the building one be rectangular and one be spade-shaped but all the rest be round the building vary in diameter from fifteen to twenty foot each have but a single open the wall have tumble down but give no evidence of careful construction not far away in wood which have not yet be clear by the savage we find other circular wall they be still stand to a height of about four foot if the savage have extend they milpa clearing since we visit the fall tree have probably spoil these wall by now the ancient village probably belong to a tribe which acknowledge allegiance to the inca but the architecture of the building give no indication of they have be construct by the inca themselves we begin to wonder whether the pampa of ghost really have anything important in store for we undoubtedly this alluvial fan have be highly prize in this country of terribly steep hill it must have be inhabit off and on for many century yet this be not a inca city while we be wonder whether the inca themselves ever live here there suddenly appear the naked figure of a sturdy young savage arm with a stout bow and long arrow and wear a fillet of bamboo he have be hunting and show we a bird he have shoot soon afterwards there come the two adult savage we have meet at saavedra 's accompany by a cross-eyed friend all wear long tunic they offer to guide we to other ruin it be very difficult for we to follow they rapid pace half a hour 's scramble through the jungle bring we to a pampa or natural terrace on the bank of a little tributary of the pampacona they call it erombonus here we find several old artificial terrace and the rough foundation of a long rectangular building 192 foot by 24 foot it might have have twenty-four door twelve in front and twelve in back each three and a half foot wide no lintel be in evidence the wall be only a foot high there be very little building material in sight apparently the structure have never be complete near by be a typical inca fountain with three stone spout or conduit two hundred yard beyond the water-carrier 's rendezvous hide behind a curtain of hang vine and thicket so dense we could not see more than a few foot in any direction the savage show we the ruin of a group of stone house whose wall be still stand in fine condition ------ figure ruin in the jungle of espiritu pampa ------ one of the building be round at one end another standing by itself at the south end of a little pampa have neither door nor window it be rectangular its four or five niche be arrange with unique irregularity furthermore they be two foot deep a unusual dimension probably this be a storehouse on the east side of the pampa be a structure 120 foot long by 21 foot wide divide into five room of unequal size the wall be of rough stone lay in adobe like some of the inca building at ollantaytambo the lintel of the door be make of three or four narrow uncut ashlar some room have niche on the north side of the pampa be another rectangular building on the west side be the edge of a stone-faced terrace below it be a partly enclose fountain or bathhouse with a stone spout and a stone-lined basin the shape of the house they general arrangement the niche stone roof-peg and lintel all point to inca builder in the building we pick up several fragment of inca pottery equally interesting and very puzzling be half a dozen crude spanish roofing tile baked red all the piece and fragment we could find would not have cover four square foot they be of widely different size as though some one have be experiment perhaps a inca who have see the new red tiled roof of cuzco have try to reproduce they here in the jungle but without success at dusk we all return to espiritu pampa we face hand and clothes have be tear by the jungle we foot be weary and sore nevertheless the day 's work have be very satisfactory and we prepare to enjoy a good night 's rest alas we be doom to disappointment during the day some one have bring to the hut eight tame but noisy macaw furthermore we savage helper determine to make the night hideous with cry tom-tom and drum either to discourage the visit of hostile indian or jaguar or for the purpose of exorcise the demon bring by the white man or else to cheer up they family who be undoubtedly hide in the jungle near by the next day the savage and we carrier continue to clear away as much as possible of the tangled growth near the best ruin in this process to the intense surprise not only of ourselves but also of the savage they discover just below the bathhouse where we have stand the day before the well-preserved ruin of two building of superior construction well fit with stone-peg and numerous niche very symmetrically arrange these house stand by themselves on a little artificial terrace fragment of characteristic inca pottery be find on the floor include piece of a large aryballus nothing give a better idea of the density of the jungle than the fact that the savage themselves have often be within five foot of these fine wall without be aware of they existence encourage by this important discovery of the most characteristic inca ruin find in the valley we continue the search but all that any one be able to find be a carefully build stone bridge over a brook saavedra 's son question the savage carefully they say they know of no other antiquity who build the stone building of espiritu pampa and eromboni pampa be this the vilcabamba viejo of father calancha that university of idolatry where live the teacher who be wizard and master of abomination the place to which friar marco and friar diego go with so much suffering be there formerly on this trail a place call ungacacha where the monk have to wade and amuse titu cusus by the way they handle they monastic robe in the water they call it a three day ' journey over rough country another reference in father calancha speak of puquiura as be two long day ' journey from vilcabamba it take we five day to go from espiritu pampa to pucyura although indian unencumbered by burden and spur on by necessity might do it in three it be possible to fit some other detail of the story into this locality although there be no place on the road call ungacacha nevertheless it do not seem to I reasonable to suppose that the priest and virgin of the sun -lrb- the personnel of the university of idolatry -rrb- who flee from cold cuzco with manco and be establish by he somewhere in the fastness of uilcapampa would have care to live in the hot valley of espiritu pampa the difference in climate be as great as that between scotland and egypt or new york and havana they would not have find in espiritu pampa the food which they like furthermore they could have find the seclusion and safety which they crave just as well in several other part of the province particularly at machu picchu together with a cool brace climate and food-stuff more nearly resemble those to which they be accustomed finally calancha say vilcabamba the old be the largest city in the province a term far more applicable to machu picchu or even to choqquequirau than to espiritu pampa on the other hand there seem to be no doubt that espiritu pampa in the montaña do meet the requirement of the place call vilcabamba by the companion of captain garcium they speak of it as the town and valley to which tupac amaru the last inca escape after he force lose the young fortress of uitico ocampo doubtless wish to emphasize the difference between it and he own metropolis the spanish town of vilcabamba call the refuge of tupac vilcabamba the old ocampo 's new vilcabamba be not in existence when friar marco and friar diego live in this province if calancha write he chronicle from they note the term old would not apply to espiritu pampa but to a older vilcabamba than either of the place know to ocampo the ruin be of late inca pattern not of a kind which would have require a long period to build the unfinished building may have be under construction during the latter part of the reign of titu cusi it be titu cusi 's desire that rodriguez de figueroa should meet he at pampacona the inca evidently come from a vilcabamba down in the montaña and as have be say bring rodriguez a present of a macaw and two hamper of peanut article of trade still common at conservidayoc there appear to I every reason to believe that the ruin of espiritu pampa be those of one of the favorite residence of this inca -- the very vilcabamba in fact where he spend he boyhood and from which he journey to meet rodriguez in 1565 -lrb- 13 -rrb- in 1572 when captain garcium take up the pursuit of tupac amaru after the victory of vilcabamba the inca flee inland toward the valley of sima-ponte to the country of the mañaries indian a warlike tribe and he friend where balsa and canoe be post to save he and enable he to escape there be now no valley in this vicinity call simaponte so far as we have be able to discover the mañaries indian be say to have live on the bank of the lower urubamba in order to reach they country tupac amaru probably go down the pampacona from espiritu pampa from the pampa of ghost to canoe navigation would have be but a short journey evidently he friend who help he to escape be canoe-men captain garcium give a account of the pursuit of tupac amaru in which he say that not deter by the danger of the jungle or the river he construct five raft on which he put some of he soldier and accompany they himself go down the rapid escape death many time by swim until he arrive at a place call momorus only to find that the inca learning of he approach have go farther into the wood nothing daunt garcium follow he although he and he man now have to go on foot and barefoot with hardly anything to eat most of they provision have be lose in the river until they finally catch tupac and he friend a tragic end to a terrible chase hard on the white man and fatal for the inca it be with great regret that i be now unable to follow the pampacona river to its junction with the urubamba it seem possible that the pampacona might be know as the sirialo or the cori-benus both of which be believe by dr bowman 's canoe-man to rise in the mountain of vilcabamba it be not however until the summer of 1915 that we be able definitely to learn that the pampacona be really a branch of the cosirenus it seem likely that the cosirenus be once call the sima-ponte whether the comberciato be the momorus be hard to say to be the next to follow in the footstep of tupac amaru and captain garcium be the privilege of messr heller ford and maynard they find that the unpleasant feature have not be exaggerate they be torment by insect and great quantity of ant -- a small red ant find on tree trunk and a large black one about a inch in length frequently see among the leaf on the ground the bite of the red ant cause a stinging and burn for about fifteen minute one of they carrier who be bite in the foot by a black ant suffer intense pain for a number of hour not only he foot but also he leg and hip be affect the savage be both fisherman and hunter the fish be take with net the game kill with bow and arrow peccary be shoot from a blind make of palm leave a few foot from a runway fishing bring rather meager result three indian fish all night and catch only one fish a perch weigh about four pound the temperature be so high that candle could easily be tie in knot excessive humidity cause all leather article to become blue with mould cloud of fly and mosquito increase the likelihood of spread communicable jungle fever the river comberciato be reach by mr heller at a point not more than a league from its junction with the urubamba the lower course of the comberciato be not consider dangerous to canoe navigation but the valley be much narrower than the cosirenus the width of the river be about 150 foot and its volume be twice that of the cosirenus the climate be very try the night be hot insect pest be numerous mr heller find that the forest be fill with annoying though sting-less bee which persist in attempt to roost on the countenance of any human be available on the bank of the comberciato he find several family of savage all the man be keen hunter and fisherman they weapon consist of powerful bow make from the wood of a small palm and long arrow make of reed and finish with feather arrange in a spiral monkey be abundant specimen of six distinct genus be find include the large red howler inert and easily locate by its deep roar bellow which can be hear for a distance of several mile the giant black spider monkey very alert and when frightened fairly fly through the branch at astonishing speed and a woolly monkey black in color and very intelligent in expression frequently tame by the savage who enjoy have they as pet but be not averse to eat they when food be scarce the flesh of monkey be greatly appreciate by these indian who preserve what they do not require for immediate need by dry it over the smoke of a wood fire on the cosirenus mr maynard notice that one of he indian guide carry a package wrap in leaf which on be open prove to contain forty or fifty large hairless grub or caterpillar the man finally bite they head off and throw the body into a small bag say that the grub be consider a great delicacy by the savage the indian we meet at espiritu pampa closely resemble those see in the lower valley all we savage be barehead and barefoot they live so much in the shelter of the jungle that hat be not necessary sandal or shoe would only make it harder to use the slippery little trail they have see no stranger penetrate this valley for about ten year and at first keep they wife and child well secluded later when messr hendriksen and tucker be send here to determine the astronomical position of espiritu pampa the savage permit mr tucker to take photograph of they family perhaps it be doubtful whether they know just what he be do at all event they do not run away and hide ------ figure campa man at espiritu pampa ------ ------ figure campa woman and child at espiritu pampa ------ all the man and older boy wear white fillet of bamboo the married man have smear paint on they face and one of they be wear the characteristic lip ornament of the campas some of the child wear no clothing at all two of the wife wear long tunic like the man one of they have a truly savage face daub with paint she wear no fillet have the best tunic and wear a handsome necklace make of seed and the skin of small bird of brilliant plumage a work of art which must have cost infinite pain and the loss of not a few arrow all the woman carry baby in little hammock sling over the shoulder one little girl not more than six year old be carry on she back a child of two in a hammock support from she head by a tump-line it will be remember that forest indian nearly always use tump-line so as to allow they hand free play one of the wife be fairer than the other and look as though she might have have a spanish ancestor the most savage-looking of the woman be very scantily clad wear a necklace of seed a white lip ornament and a few rag tie around she waist all she child be naked the child of the woman with the handsome necklace be clothe in piece of old tunic and one of they evidently she mother 's favorite be decorate with bird skin and a necklace make from the tooth of monkey such be the people among whom tupac amaru take refuge when he flee from vilcabamba whether he partake of such a delicacy as monkey meat which all amazonian indian relish but which be not eat by the highlander may be doubt garcilasso speak of tupac amaru 's prefer to entrust himself to the hand of the spaniard rather than to perish of famine he indian ally live perfectly well in a region where monkey abound it be doubtful whether they would ever have permit captain garcium to capture the inca have they be able to furnish tupac with such food as he be accustom to at all event we investigation seem to point to the probability of this valley have be a important part of the domain of the last inca it would have be pleasant to prolong we study but the carrier be anxious to return to pampacona although they do not have to eat monkey meat they be afraid of the savage and nervous as to what use the latter might some day make of the powerful bow and long arrow at conservidayoc saavedra kindly take the trouble to make some sugar for we he pour the syrup in oblong mould cut in a row along the side of a big log of hard wood in some of the mould he son place handful of nicely roasted peanut the result be a confection or emergency ration which we greatly enjoy on we return journey at san fernando we meet the pack mule the next day in the midst of continue torrential tropical downpour we climb out of the hot valley to the cold height of pampacona we be soak with perspiration and drench with rain snow have be fall above the village we tooth chatter like castanets professor foote immediately commandeer mr guzman 's fire and fill we tea kettle it may be doubt whether a more wretched cold wet and bedraggled party ever arrive at guzman 's hut certainly nothing ever taste better than that steam hot sweet tea chapter xvi the story of tampu-tocco a lose city of the first inca it will be remember that while on the search for the capital of the last inca we have find several group of ruin which we could not fit entirely into the story of manco and he son the most important of these be machu picchu many of its building be far older than the ruin of rosaspa and espiritu pampa to understand just what we may have find at machu picchu it be now necessary to tell the story of a celebrated city whose name tampu-tocco be not use even at the time of the spanish conquest as the cognomen of any of the inca town then in existence i must draw the reader 's attention far away from the period when pizarro and manco toledo and tupac amaru be the protagonist back to event which occur nearly seven hundred year before they day the last inca rule in uitico between 1536 and 1572 the last amauta flourish about 800 ad ------ figure puma urco near paccaritampu ------ the amauta have be rule the peruvian highland for about sixty generation when as have be tell in chapter vi invader come from the south and east the amauta have build up a wonderful civilization many of the agricultural and engineering feat which we ordinarily assign to the inca be really achievement of the amauta the last of the amauta be pachacuti vi who be kill by a arrow on the battle-field of la raya the historian montesino whose work on the antiquity of peru have recently be translate for the hakluyt society by mr p a means of harvard university tell we that the follower of pachacutus vi flee with he body to tampu-tocco this say the historian be a healthy place where there be a cave in which they hide the amauta 's body cuzco the finest and most important of all they city be sack general anarchy prevail throughout the ancient empire the good old day of peace and plenty disappear before the invader the glory of the old empire be destroy not to return for several century in these dark age resemble those of european medieval time which follow the germanic migration and the fall of the roman empire peru be split up into a large number of small independent unit each district choose its own ruler and carry on depredation against its neighbor the effect of this may still be see in the ruin of small fortress find guard the way into isolate andean valley montesino say that those who be most loyal to the amauta be few in number and not strong enough to oppose they enemy successfully some of they probably the principal priest wise man and chief of the ancient régime build a new city at tampu-tocco here they keep alive the memory of the amauta and live in such a relatively civilized manner as to draw to they little by little those who wish to be safe from the prevail chaos and disorder and the tyranny of the independent chief or robber baron in they new capital they elect a king titus truaman quicho the survivor of the old régime enjoy live at tampu-tocco because there never have be any earthquake plague or trembling there furthermore if fortune should turn against they new young king titus truaman and he should be kill they could bury he in a very sacred place namely the cave where they hide the body of pachacutus vi fortune be kind to the founder of the new kingdom they have choose a excellent place of refuge where they be not disturb to they ruler the king of tampu-tocco and to he successor nothing worth record happen for century during this period several of the king wish to establish themselves in ancient cuzco where the great amauta have reign but for one reason or another be oblige to forego they ambition one of the most enlighten ruler of tampu-tocco be a king call tupac caurus or pachacutus vii in he day people begin to write on the leaf of tree he send messenger to the various part of the highland ask the tribe to stop worship idol and animal to cease practice evil custom which have grow up since the fall of the amauta and to return to the way of they ancestor he meet with little encouragement on the contrary he ambassador be kill and little or no change take place discourage by the failure of he attempt at reformation and desirous of learn its cause tupac caurus be tell by he soothsayer that the matter which most displeased the god be the invention of write thereupon he forbid anybody to practice write under penalty of death this mandate be observe with such strictness that the ancient folk never again use letter instead they use quipus string and knot it be suppose that the god be appease and every one breathe easier no one realize how near the peruvian as a race have come to take a most momentous step this curious and interesting tradition relate to a event suppose to have occur many century before the spanish conquest we have no ocular evidence to support it the skeptic may brush it aside as a story intend to appeal to the vanity of person with inca blood in they vein yet it be not tell by the half-caste garcilasso who want european to admire he maternal ancestor and write he book accordingly but be in the page of that careful investigator montesino a pure-blooded spaniard as a matter of fact to student of sumner 's folkway the story ring true some young fellow brighter than the rest develop a system of ideograph which he scratch on broad smooth leave it work people be begin to adopt it the conservative priest of tampu-tocco do not like it there be danger lest some of the precious secret heretofore hand down orally to the neophyte might become public property nevertheless the invention be so useful that it begin to spread there follow some extremely unlucky event -- the ambassador be kill the king 's plan miscarry what more natural than that the newly discover ideograph should be blame for it as a result the king of tampu-tocco instigate thereto by the priest determine to abolish this new thing its usefulness have not yet be firmly establish in fact it be inconvenient the leaf wither dry and crack or blow away and the writings be lose have the new invention be permit to exist a little longer some one would have commence to scratch ideograph on rock then it would have persist the ruler and priest however find that the important record of tribute and tax could be keep perfectly well by means of the quipus and the job of those whose duty it be to remember what each string stand for be assure after all there be nothing unusual about montesino ' story one have only to look at the history of spain itself to realize that royal bigotry and priestly intolerance have often crushed new idea and keep great nation from make important advance montesino say further that tupac caurus establish in tampu-tocco a kind of university where boy be teach the use of quipus the method of counting and the significance of the different color string while they father and older brother be train in military exercise -- in other word practice with the sling the bola and the war-club perhaps also with bow and arrow around the name of tupac caurus or pachacutus vii as he wish to be call be gather the story of various intellectual movement which take place in tampu-tocco finally there come a time when the skill and military efficiency of the little kingdom rise to a high plane the ruler and he councilor bear in mind the tradition of they ancestor who century before have dwell in cuzco again determine to make the attempt to reestablish themselves there a earthquake which ruin many building in cuzco cause river to change they course destroy town and be follow by the outbreak of a disastrous epidemic the chief be oblige to give up they plan although in healthy tampu-tocco there be no pestilence they kingdom become more and more crowded every available square yard of arable land be terraced and cultivate the man be intelligent well organize and accustom to discipline but they could not raise enough food for they family so about 1300 ad they be force to secure arable land by conquest under the leadership of the energetic ruler of the day he name be manco ccapac generally call the first inca the ruler for whom the manco of 1536 be name there be many story of the rise of the first inca when he have grow to man 's estate he assemble he people to see how he could secure new land for they after consultation with he brother he determine to set out with they toward the hill over which the sun rise as we be inform by pachacutus yamquus salcamayhua a indian who be a descendant of a long line of inca whose great-grandparent live in the time of the spanish conquest and who write a account of the antiquity of peru in 1620 he give the history of the inca as it be hand down to the descendant of the former ruler of peru in it we read that manco ccapac and he brother finally succeed in reach cuzco and settle there with the return of the descendant of the amauta to cuzco there end the glory of tampu-tocco manco marry he own sister in order that he might not lose caste and that no other family be elevate by this marriage to be on a equality with he he make good law conquer many province and be regard as the founder of the inca dynasty the highlanders come under he sway and bring he rich present the inca as manco ccapac now come to be know be recognize as the most powerful chief the most valiant fighter and the most lucky warrior in the ande he captain and soldier be brave well discipline and well arm all he affair prosper greatly afterward he order work to be execute at the place of he birth consist of a masonry wall with three window which be emblem of the house of he father whence he descend the first window be call tampu-tocco i quote from sir clement markham 's translation ------ figure the best inca wall at maucallacta near paccaritampu ------ ------ figure the cave of puma urco near paccaritampu ------ the spaniard who ask about tampu-tocco be tell that it be at or near paccaritampu a small town eight or ten mile south of cuzco i learn that ruin be very scarce in its vicinity there be none in the town the most important be the ruin of maucallacta a inca village a few mile away near it i find a rocky hill consist of several crag and large rock the surface of one of which be carve into platform and two sleep puma it be call puma urco beneath the rock be some cave i be tell they have recently be use by political refugee there be enough about the cave and the characteristic of the ruin near paccaritampu to lend color to the story tell to the early spaniard nevertheless it would seem as if tampu-tocco must have be a place more remote from cuzco and better defend by nature from any attack on that side how else would it have be possible for the disorganized remnant of pachacutus vi 's army to have take refuge there and set up a independent kingdom in the face of the warlike invader from the south a few man might have hide in the cave of puma urco but paccaritampu be not a natural citadel the surrounding region be not difficult of access there be no precipice between here and the cuzco basin there be no natural defens against such a invade force as capture the capital of the amauta furthermore tampu mean a place of temporary abode or a tavern or a improve piece of ground or farm far from a town tocco mean window there be a old tavern at maucallacta near paccaritampu but there be no window in the building to justify the name of window tavern or place of temporary abode -lrb- or farm far from a town -rrb- note for its window there be nothing of a masonry wall with three window correspond to salcamayhua 's description of manco ccapac 's memorial at he birthplace the word tampu-tocco do not occur on any map i have be able to consult nor be it in the exhaustive gazetteer of peru compile by paz soldan chapter xvii machu picchu it be in July 1911 that we first enter that marvelous canyon of the urubamba where the river escape from the cold region near cuzco by tear its way through gigantic mountain of granite from torontoy to colpani the road run through a land of matchless charm it have the majestic grandeur of the canadian rocky as well as the startling beauty of the nuuanu pali near honolulu and the enchanting vista of the koolau ditch trail on maul in the variety of its charm and the power of its spell i know of no place in the world which can compare with it not only have it great snow peak loom above the cloud more than two mile overhead gigantic precipice of many-colored granite rise sheer for thousand of foot above the foam glisten roar rapid it have also in striking contrast orchid and tree fern the delectable beauty of luxurious vegetation and the mysterious witchery of the jungle one be draw irresistibly onward by ever-recurring surprise through a deep wind gorge turning and twist past overhang cliff of incredible height above all there be the fascination of finding here and there under the sway vine or perch on top of a beetle crag the rugged masonry of a bygone race and of try to understand the bewildering romance of the ancient builder who age ago seek refuge in a region which appear to have be expressly design by nature as a sanctuary for the oppress a place where they might fearlessly and patiently give expression to they passion for wall of endure beauty space forbid any attempt to describe in detail the constantly change panorama the rank tropical foliage the countless terrace the towering cliff the glacier peep out between the cloud we have camp at a place near the river call mandor pampa melchor arteaga proprietor of the neighbor farm have tell we of ruin at machu picchu as be relate in chapter x the morning of July 24th dawn in a cold drizzle arteaga shiver and seem incline to stay in he hut i offer to pay he well if he would show I the ruin he demur and say it be too hard a climb for such a wet day when he find that we be willing to pay he a sol three or four time the ordinary daily wage in this vicinity he finally agree to guide we to the ruin no one suppose that they would be particularly interesting accompany by sergeant carrasco i leave camp at ten o'clock and go some distance upstream on the road we pass a venomous snake which recently have be kill this region have a unpleasant notoriety for be the favorite haunt of viper the lance-headed or yellow viper commonly know as the fer-de-lance a very venomous serpent capable of make considerable spring when in pursuit of its prey be common hereabouts later two of we mule die from snake-bite after a walk of three quarter of a hour the guide leave the main road and plunge down through the jungle to the bank of the river here there be a primitive bridge which cross the roar rapid at its narrowest part where the stream be force to flow between two great boulder the bridge be make of half a dozen very slender log some of which be not long enough to span the distance between the boulder they have be splice and lash together with vine arteaga and carrasco take off they shoe and creep gingerly across use they somewhat prehensile toe to keep from slip it be obvious that no one could have live for a instant in the rapid but would immediately have be dash to piece against granite boulder i be frank to confess that i get down on hand and knee and crawl across six inch at a time even after we reach the other side i could not help wonder what would happen to the bridge if a particularly heavy shower should fall in the valley above a light rain have fall during the night the river have rise so that the bridge be already threaten by the foam rapid it would not take much more rain to wash away the bridge entirely if this should happen during the day it might be very awkward as a matter of fact it do happen a few day later and the next explorer to attempt to cross the river at this point find only one slender log remain leave the stream we struggle up the bank through a dense jungle and in a few minute reach the bottom of a precipitous slope for a hour and twenty minute we have a hard climb a good part of the distance we go on all fours sometimes hang on by the tip of we finger here and there a primitive ladder make from the roughly hew trunk of a small tree be place in such a way as to help one over what might otherwise have prove to be a impassable cliff in another place the slope be cover with slippery grass where it be hard to find either handhold or foothold the guide say that there be lot of snake here the humidity be great the heat be excessive and we be not in training shortly after noon we reach a little grass-covered hut where several good-natured indian pleasantly surprise at we unexpected arrival welcome we with drip gourd full of cool delicious water then they set before we a few cook sweet potato call here cumara a quichua word identical with the polynesian kumalum as have be point out by mr cook apart from the wonderful view of the canyon all we could see from we cool shelter be a couple of small grass hut and a few ancient stone-faced terrace two pleasant indian farmer richarte and alvarez have choose this eagle 's nest for they home they say they have find plenty of terrace here on which to grow they crop and they be usually free from undesirable visitor they do not speak spanish but through sergeant carrasco i learn that there be more ruin a little farther along in this country one never can tell whether such a report be worthy of credence he may have be lie be a good footnote to affix to all hearsay evidence accordingly i be not unduly excite nor in a great hurry to move the heat be still great the water from the indian 's spring be cool and delicious and the rustic wooden bench hospitably cover immediately after my arrival with a soft woolen poncho seem most comfortable furthermore the view be simply enchanting tremendous green precipice fall away to the white rapid of the urubamba below immediately in front on the north side of the valley be a great granite cliff rise 2000 foot sheer to the left be the solitary peak of huayna picchu surround by seemingly inaccessible precipice on all side be rocky cliff beyond they cloud-capped mountain rise thousand of foot above we the indian say there be two path to the outside world of one we have already have a taste the other they say be more difficult -- a perilous path down the face of a rocky precipice on the other side of the ridge it be they only means of egress in the wet season when the bridge over which we have come could not be maintain i be not surprise to learn that they go away from home only about once a month richarte tell we that they have be live here four year it seem probable that owe to its inaccessibility the canyon have be unoccupied for several century but with the completion of the new government road settler begin once more to occupy this region in time somebody clamber up the precipice and find on the slope of machu picchu at a elevation of 9000 foot above the sea a abundance of rich soil conveniently situate on artificial terrace in a fine climate here the indian have finally clear off some ruin burn over a few terrace and plant crop of maize sweet and white potato sugar cane bean pepper tree tomato and gooseberry at first they appropriate some of the ancient house and replace the roof of wood and thatch they find however that there be neither spring nor well near the ancient building a ancient aqueduct which have once bring a tiny stream to the citadel have long since disappear beneath the forest fill with earth wash from the upper terrace so abandon the shelter of the ruin the indian be now enjoy the convenience of living near some spring in roughly build thatched hut of they own design without the slightest expectation of find anything more interesting than the stone-faced terrace of which i already have a glimpse and the ruin of two or three stone house such as we have encounter at various place on the road between ollantaytambo and torontoy i finally leave the cool shade of the pleasant little hut and climb farther up the ridge and around a slight promontory arteaga have be here once before and decide to rest and gossip with richarte and alvarez in the hut they send a small boy with I as a guide hardly have we round the promontory when the character of the stonework begin to improve a flight of beautifully construct terrace each two hundred yard long and ten foot high have then recently rescue from the jungle by the indian a forest of large tree have be chop down and burn over to make a clearing for agricultural purpose cross these terrace i enter the untouched forest beyond and suddenly find myself in a maze of beautiful granite house they be cover with tree and moss and the growth of century but in the dense shadow hiding in bamboo thicket and tangled vine could be see here and there wall of white granite ashlar most carefully cut and exquisitely fit together building with window be frequent here at least be a place far from town and conspicuous for its window ------ figure flashlight view of interior of cave machu picchu ------ ------ figure temple over cave at machu picchu suggest by the author as the probable site of tampu-tocco ------ under a carve rock the little boy show I a cave beautifully line with the finest cut stone it be evidently intend to be a royal mausoleum on top of this particular boulder a semicircular building have be construct the wall follow the natural curvature of the rock and be key to it by one of the finest example of masonry i have ever see this beautiful wall make of carefully match ashlar of pure white granite especially select for its fine grain be the work of a master artist the interior surface of the wall be break by niche and square stone-peg the exterior surface be perfectly simple and unadorned the lower course of particularly large ashlar give it a look of solidity the upper course diminish in size toward the top lend grace and delicacy to the structure the flow line the symmetrical arrangement of the ashlar and the gradual gradation of the course combine to produce a wonderful effect softer and more pleasing than that of the marble temple of the old world owe to the absence of mortar there be no ugly space between the rock they might have grow together the elusive beauty of this chaste undecorated surface seem to I to be due to the fact that the wall be build under the eye of a master mason who know not the straight edge the plumb rule or the square he have no instrument of precision so he have to depend on he eye he have a good eye a artistic eye a eye for symmetry and beauty of form he product receive none of the harshness of mechanical and mathematical accuracy the apparently rectangular block be not really rectangular the apparently straight line of the course be not actually straight in the exact sense of that term to my astonishment i see that this wall and its adjoining semicircular temple over the cave be as fine as the finest stonework in the far-famed temple of the sun in cuzco surprise follow surprise in bewildering succession i climb a marvelous great stairway of large granite block walk along a pampa where the indian have a small vegetable garden and come into a little clearing here be the ruin of two of the finest structure i have ever see in peru not only be they make of select block of beautifully grain white granite they wall contain ashlar of cyclopean size ten foot in length and higher than a man the sight hold I spellbound each building have only three wall and be entirely open on the side toward the clear the principal temple be line with exquisitely make niche five high up at each end and seven on the back wall there be seven course of ashlar in the end wall under the seven rear niche be a rectangular block fourteen foot long probably a sacrificial altar the building do not look as though it have ever have a roof the top course of beautifully smooth ashlar be not intend to be cover the other temple be on the east side of the pampa i call it the temple of the three window like its neighbor it be unique among inca ruin its eastern wall overlook the citadel be a massive stone framework for three conspicuously large window obviously too large to serve any useful purpose yet most beautifully make with the greatest care and solidity this be clearly a ceremonial edifice of peculiar significance nowhere else in peru so far as i know be there a similar structure conspicuous as a masonry wall with three window these ruin have no other name than that of the mountain on the slope of which they be located have this place be occupy uninterruptedly like cuzco and ollantaytambo machu picchu would have retain its ancient name but during the century when it be abandon its name be lose examination show that it be essentially a fortify place a remote fastness protect by natural bulwark of which man take advantage to create the most impregnable stronghold in the ande we subsequent excavation and the clearing make in 1912 to be describe in a subsequent volume have show that this be the chief place in uilcapampa it do not take a expert to realize from the glimpse of machu picchu on that rainy day in July 1911 when sergeant carrasco and i first see it that here be most extraordinary and interesting ruin although the ridge have be partly clear by the indian for they field of maize so much of it be still underneath a thick jungle growth -- some wall be actually support tree ten and twelve inch in diameter -- that it be impossible to determine just what would be find here as soon as i could get hold of mr tucker who be assist mr hendriksen and mr lanius who have go down the urubamba with dr bowman i ask they to make a map of the ruin i know it would be a difficult undertaking and that it be essential for mr tucker to join I in arequipa not later than the first of October for the ascent of coropuna with the hearty aid of richarte and alvarez the surveyor do better than i expect in the ten day while they be at the ruin they be able to secure datum from which mr tucker afterwards prepare a map which tell better than could any word of mine the importance of this site and the necessity for further investigation with the possible exception of one mining prospector no one in cuzco have see the ruin of machu picchu or appreciate they importance no one have any realization of what a extraordinary place lay on top of the ridge it have never be visit by any of the planter of the lower urubamba valley who annually pass over the road which wind through the canyon two thousand foot below it seem incredible that this citadel less than three day ' journey from cuzco should have remain so long undescribed by traveler and comparatively unknown even to the peruvian themselves if the conquistador ever see this wonderful place some reference to it surely would have be make yet nothing can be find which clearly refer to the ruin of machu picchu just when it be first see by a spanish-speaking person be uncertain when the count de sartige be at huadquiña in 1834 he be look for ruin yet although so near he hear of none here from a crude scrawl on the wall of one of the finest building we learn that the ruin be visit in 1902 by lizarraga lessee of the land immediately below the bridge of san miguel this be the earliest local record yet some one must have visit machu picchu long before that because in 1875 as have be say the french explorer charle wiener hear in ollantaytambo of there be ruin at huaina-picchu or matcho-picchu he try to find they that he fail be due to there be no road through the canyon of torontoy and the necessity of make a wide detour through the pass of panticallum and the lucumayo valley a route which bring he to the urubamba river at the bridge of chuquichaca twenty-five mile below machu picchu ------ figure detail of exterior of temple of the three window machu picchu ------ ------ figure detail of principal temple machu picchu ------ it be not until 1890 that the peruvian government recognize the need of the enterprising planter who be open up the lower valley of the urubamba decide to construct a mule trail along the bank of the river through the grand canyon to enable the much-desired coca and aguardiente to be ship from huadquiña maranura and santa ann to cuzco more quickly and cheaply than formerly this road avoid the necessity of carry the precious cargo over the dangerous snowy pass of mt veronica and mt salcantay so vividly describe by raimondus de sartige and other the road however be very expensive take year to build and still require frequent repair in fact even to-day travel over it be often suspend for several day or week at a time follow some tremendous avalanche yet it be this new road which have lead melchor arteaga to build he hut near the arable land at mandor pampa where he could raise food for he family and offer rough shelter to pass traveler it be this new road which bring richarte alvarez and they enterprising friend into this little-known region give they the opportunity of occupy the ancient terrace of machu picchu which have lie fallow for century encourage they to keep open a passable trail over the precipice and make it feasible for we to reach the ruin it be this new road which offer we in 1911 a virgin field between ollantaytambo and huadquiña and enable we to learn that the inca or they predecessor have once live here in the remote fastness of the ande and have leave stone witness of the magnificence and beauty of they ancient civilization more interesting and extensive than any which have be find since the day of the spanish conquest of peru chapter xviii the origin of machu picchu some other day i hope to tell of the work of clearing and excavate machu picchu of the life live by its citizen and of the ancient town of which it be the most important at present i must rest content with a discussion of its probable identity here be a powerful citadel tenable against all odds a stronghold where a mere handful of defender could prevent a great army from take the place by assault why should any one have desire to be so secure from capture as to have build a fortress in such a inaccessible place the builder be not in search of field there be so little arable land here that every square yard of earth have to be terrace in order to provide food for the inhabitant they be not look for comfort or convenience safety be they primary consideration they be sufficiently civilized to practice intensive agriculture sufficiently skillful to equal the best masonry the world have ever see sufficiently ingenious to make delicate bronze and sufficiently advance in art to realize the beauty of simplicity what could have induce such a people to select this remote fastness of the ande with all its disadvantage as the site for they capital unless they be flee from powerful enemy the thought will already have occur to the reader that the temple of the three window at machu picchu fit the word of that native writer who have hear from a child the most ancient tradition and history include the story already quote from sir clement markham 's translation that manco ccapac the first inca order work to be execute at the place of he birth consist of a masonry wall with three window which be emblem of the house of he father whence he descend the first window be call ` tampu-tocco ' although none of the other chronicler give the story of the first inca order a memorial wall to be build at the place of he birth they nearly all tell of he have come from a place call tampu-tocco a inn or country place remarkable for its window sir clement markham in he inca of peru refer to tampu-tocco as the hill with the three opening or window the place assign by all the chronicler as the location of the traditional tampu-tocco as have be say be paccaritampu about nine mile southwest of cuzco paccaritampu have some interesting ruin and cave but careful examination show that while there be more than three opening to its cave there be no window in its building the building of machu picchu on the other hand have far more window than any other important ruin in peru the climate of paccaritampu like that of most place in the highland be too severe to invite or encourage the use of window the climate of machu picchu be mild consequently the use of window be natural and agreeable so far as i know there be no place in peru where the ruin consist of anything like a masonry wall with three window of such a ceremonial character as be here refer to except at machu picchu it would certainly seem as though the temple of the three window the most significant structure within the citadel be the building refer to by pachacutus yamquus saleamayhua ------ figure the masonry wall with three window machu picchu ------ the principal difficulty with this theory be that while the first meaning of tocco in holguin 's standard quichua dictionary be ventana or window and while window be the only meaning give this important word in markham 's revise quichua dictionary -lrb- 1908 -rrb- a dictionary compile from many source the second meaning of tocco give by holguin be alacena a cupboard set in a wall undoubtedly this mean what we call in the ruin of the house of the inca a niche now the drawing crude as they be in sir clement markham 's translation of the salcamayhua manuscript do give the impression of niche rather than of window do tampu-tocco mean a tampu remarkable for its niche at paccaritampu there do not appear to be any particularly fine niche while at machu picchu on the other hand there be many very beautiful niche especially in the cave which have be refer to as a royal mausoleum as a matter of fact nearly all the finest ruin of the inca have excellent niche since niche be so common a feature of inca architecture the chance be that sir clement be right in translate salcamayhua as he do and in call tampu-tocco the hill with the three opening or window in any case machu picchu fit the story far better than do paccaritampu however in view of the fact that the early writer all repeat the story that tampu-tocco be at paccaritampu it would be absurd to say that they do not know what they be talk about even though the actual remains at or near paccaritampu do not fit the requirement it would be easier to adopt paccaritampu as the site of tampu-tocco be it not for the legal record of a inquiry make by toledo at the time when he put the last inca to death fifteen indian descend from those who use to live near las salinas the important salt work near cuzco on be question agree that they have hear they father and grandfather repeat the tradition that when the first inca manco ccapac capture they land he come from tampu-tocco they do not say that the first inca come from paccaritampu which it seem to I would have be a most natural thing for they to have say if this be the general belief of the native in addition there be the still older testimony of some indian bear before the arrival of the first spaniard who be examine at a legal investigation in 1570 a chief aged ninety-two testify that manco ccapac come out of a cave call tocco and that he be lord of the town near that cave not one of the witness state that manco ccapac come from paccaritampu although it be difficult to imagine why they should not have do so if as the contemporary historian believe this be really the original tampu-tocco the chronicler be willing enough to accept the interesting cave near paccaritampu as the place where manco ccapac be bear and from which he come to conquer cuzco why be the swear witness so reticent it seem hardly possible that they should have forget where tampu-tocco be suppose to have be be they reticence due to the fact that its actual whereabouts have be successfully keep secret manco ccapac 's home be that tampu-tocco to which the follower of pachacutus vi flee with he body after the overthrow of the old régime a very secluded and holy place do they know it be in the same fastness of the ande to which in the day of pizarro the young inca manco have flee from cuzco be this the cause of they reticence certainly the requirement of tampu-tocco be meet at machu picchu the splendid natural defens of the grand canyon of the urubamba make it a ideal refuge for the descendant of the amauta during the century of lawlessness and confusion which succeed the barbarian invasion from the plain to the east and south the scarcity of violent earthquake and also its healthfulness both marked characteristic of tampu-tocco be meet at machu picchu it be worth note that the existence of machu picchu might easily have be conceal from the common people at the time of the spanish conquest its location might have be know only to the inca and he priest so notwithstanding the belief of the historian i feel it be reasonable to conclude that the first name of the ruin at machu picchu be tampu-tocco here pachacuti vi be bury here be the capital of the little kingdom where during the century between the amauta and the inca there be keep alive the wisdom skill and best tradition of the ancient folk who have develop the civilization of peru it be well to remember that the defens of cuzco be of little avail before the onslaught of the warlike invader the great organization of farmer and mason so successful in its ability to perform mighty feat of engineering with primitive tool of wood stone and bronze have crumble away before the attack of savage horde who know little of the art of peace the defeat leader have to choose a region where they might live in safety from they fierce enemy furthermore in the environs of machu picchu they find every variety of climate -- valley so low as to produce the precious coca yucca and plantain the fruit and vegetable of the tropics slope high enough to be suitable for many variety of maize quinoa and other cereal as well as they favorite root crop include both sweet and white potato oca añu and ullucu here within a few hour ' journey they could find day warm enough to dry and cure the coca leave night cold enough to freeze potato in the approve aboriginal fashion although the amount of arable land which could be make available with the most careful terracing be not large enough to support a very great population machu picchu offer a impregnable citadel to the chief and priest and they handful of follower who be oblige to flee from the rich plain near cuzco and the broad pleasant valley of yucay only dire necessity and terror could have force a people which have reach such a stage in engineering architecture and agriculture to leave hospitable valley and tableland for rugged canyon certainly there be no part of the ande less fit by nature to meet the requirement of a agricultural folk unless they chief need be a safe refuge and retreat here the wise remnant of the amauta ultimately develop great ability in the face of tremendous natural obstacle they utilize they ancient craft to wrest a living from the soil hem in between the savage of the amazon jungle below and they enemy on the plateau above they must have carry on border warfare for generation aid by the temperate climate in which they live and the ability to secure a wide variety of food within a few hour ' climb up or down from they town and city they become a hardy vigorous tribe which in the course of time burst its boundary fight its way back to the rich cuzco valley overthrow the descendant of the ancient invader and establish with cuzco as a capital the empire of the inca after the first inca manco ccapac have establish himself in cuzco what more natural than that he should have build a fine temple in honor of he ancestor ancestor worship be common to the inca and nothing would have be more reasonable than the construction of the temple of the three window as the inca grow in power and extend they rule over the ancient empire of the cuzco amauta from whom they trace they descent superstitious regard would have lead they to establish they chief temple and palace in the city of cuzco itself there be no longer any necessity to maintain the citadel of tampu-tocco it be probably desert while cuzco grow and the inca empire flourish as the inca increase in power they invent various myth to account for they origin one of these trace they ancestry to the island of lake titicaca finally the very location of manco ccapac 's birthplace be forget by the common people -- although undoubtedly know to the priest and those who preserve the most sacred secret of the inca then come pizarro and the bigoted conquistador the native chief face the necessity of save whatever be possible of the ancient religion the spaniard coveted gold and silver the most precious possession of the inca however be not image and utensil but the sacred virgin of the sun who like the vestal virgin of rome be from they earliest childhood train to the service of the great sun god look at from the standpoint of a agricultural people who need the sun to bring they food crop to fruition and keep they from hunger it be of the utmost importance to placate he with sacrifice and secure the good effect of he smile face if he delay he come or keep himself hide behind the cloud the maize would mildew and the ear would not properly ripen if he do not shine with he accustomed brightness after the harvest the ear of corn could not be properly dry and keep over to the next year in short any unusual behavior on the part of the sun mean hunger and famine consequently they most beautiful daughter be consecrate to he service as virgin who live in the temple and minister to the want of priest and ruler human sacrifice have long since be give up in peru and its place take by the consecration of these damsel some of the virgin of the sun in cuzco be capture other escape and accompany manco into the inaccessible canyon of uilcapampa it will be remember that father calancha relate the trial of the first two missionary in this region who at the peril of they life urge the inca to let they visit the university of idolatry at vilcabamba viejo the largest city in the province machu picchu admirably answer its requirement here it would have be very easy for the inca titu cusus to have keep the monk in the vicinity of the sacred city for three week without they catch a single glimpse of its unique temple and remarkable palace it would have be possible for titu cusus to bring friar marco and friar diego to the village of intihuatana near san miguel at the foot of the machu picchu cliff the sugar planter of the lower urubamba valley cross the bridge of san miguel annually for twenty year in blissful ignorance of what lay on top of the ridge above they so the friar might easily have be lodge in hut at the foot of the mountain without they be aware of the extent and importance of the inca university apparently they return to puquiura with so little knowledge of the architectural character of vilcabamba viejo that no description of it could be give they friend eventually to be report by calancha furthermore the difficult journey across country from puquiura might easily have take three day finally it appear from dr eaton 's study that the last resident of machu picchu itself be mostly woman in the burial cave which we have find in the region roundabout machu picchu the proportion of skull belong to man be very large there be many so-called trepanned skull some of they seem to belong to soldier injure in war by have they skull crush in either with club or the favorite sling-stone of the inca in no case have we find more than twenty-five skull without encounter some trepan specimen among they in striking contrast be the result of the excavation at machu picchu where one hundred sixty-four skull be find in the burial cave yet not one have be trepan of the one hundred thirty-five skeleton whose sex could be accurately determine by dr eaton one hundred nine be female furthermore it be in the grave of the female that the finest artifact be find show that they be person of no little importance not a single representative of the robust male of the warrior type be find in the burial cave of machu picchu another striking fact bring out by dr eaton be that some of the female skeleton represent individual from the seacoast this fit in with calancha 's statement that titu cusus tempt the monk not only with beautiful woman of the highland but also with those who come from the tribe of the yunga or warm valley the warm valley may be those of the rubber country but sir clement markham think the oasis of the coast be mean furthermore as mr safford have point out among the artifact discover at machu picchu be a snuff tube intend for use with the narcotic snuff which be employ by the priest and necromancer to induce a hypnotic state this powder be make from the seed of the tree which the inca call huilca or uilca which as have be point out in chapter xi grow near these ruin this seem to I to furnish additional evidence of the identity of machu picchu with calancha 's vilcabamba it can not be deny that the ruin of machu picchu satisfy the requirement of the largest city in which be the university of idolatry until some one can find the ruin of another important place within three day ' journey of pucyura which be a important religious center and whose skeletal remains be chiefly those of woman i be incline to believe that this be the vilcabamba viejo of calancha just as espiritu pampa be the vilcabamba viejo of ocampo in the interesting account of the last inca purport to be by titu cusi but actually write in excellent spanish by friar marco he say that he father manco flee from cuzco go first to vilcabamba the head of all that province in the anale del peru montesino say that francisco pizarro think that the inca manco wish to make peace with he try to please the inca by send he a present of a very fine pony and a mulatto to take care of it in place of reward the messenger the inca kill both man and beast when pizarro be inform of this he take revenge on manco by cruelly abuse the inca 's favorite wife and put she to death she beg of she attendant that when she should be dead they would put she remains in a basket and let it float down the yucay -lrb- or urubamba -rrb- river that the current might take it to she husband the inca she must have believe that at that time manco be near this river machu picchu be on its bank espiritu pampa be not we have already see how manco finally establish himself at uitico where he restore in some degree the fortune of he house surround by fertile valley not too far remove from the great highway which the spaniard be oblige to use in pass from lima to cuzco he could readily attack they at machu picchu he would not have be so conveniently located for rob the spanish caravan nor for supply he follower with arable land there be abundant archeological evidence that the citadel of machu picchu be at one time occupy by the inca and partly build by they on the ruin of a far older city much of the pottery be unquestionably of the so-called cuzco style use by the last inca the more recent building resemble those structure on the island of titicaca say to have be build by the later inca they also resemble the fortress of uitico at rosaspa build by manco about 1537 furthermore they be by far the largest and finest ruin in the mountain of the old province of uilcapampa and represent the place which would naturally be speak of by titu cusus as the head of the province espiritu pampa do not satisfy the demand of a place which be so important as to give its name to the entire province to be refer to as the largest city it seem quite possible that the inaccessible forget citadel of machu picchu be the place choose by manco as the safest refuge for those virgin of the sun who have successfully escape from cuzco in the day of pizarro for they and they attendant manco probably build many of the newer building and repair some of the older one here they live out they day secure in the knowledge that no indian would ever breathe to the conquistador the secret of they sacred refuge ------ figure the gorge open wide apart reveal uilcapampa 's granite citadel the crown of inca land : machu picchu ------ when the worship of the sun actually cease on the height of machu picchu no one can tell that the secret of its existence be so well keep be one of the marvel of andean history unless one accept the theory of its identity with tampu-tocco and vilcabamba viejo there be no clear reference to machu picchu until 1875 when charle wiener hear about it some day we may be able to find a reference in one of the document of the sixteenth or seventeenth century which will indicate that the energetic viceroy toledo or a contemporary of he know of this marvelous citadel and visit it writer like cieza de leon and polo de ondegardo who be assiduous in collect information about all the holy place of the inca give the name of many place which as yet we have not be able to identify among they we may finally recognize the temple of machu picchu on the other hand it seem likely that if any of the spanish soldier priest or other chronicler have see this citadel they would have describe its chief edifice in unmistakable term until further light can be throw on this fascinating problem it seem reasonable to conclude that at machu picchu we have the ruin of tampu-tocco the birthplace of the first inca manco ccapac and also the ruin of a sacred city of the last inca surely this granite citadel which have make such a strong appeal to we on account of its striking beauty and the indescribable charm of its surroundings appear to have have a most interesting history select about 800 ad as the safest place of refuge for the last remnant of the old régime flee from southern invader it become the site of the capital of a new kingdom and give birth to the most remarkable family which south america have ever see abandon about 1300 when cuzco once more flash into glory as the capital of the peruvian empire it seem to have be again seek out in time of trouble when in 1534 another foreign invader arrive -- this time from europe -- with a burning desire to extinguish all vestige of the ancient religion in its last state it become the home and refuge of the virgin of the sun priestess of the most humane cult of aboriginal america here conceal in a canyon of remarkable grandeur protect by art and nature these consecrate woman gradually pass away leave no known descendant nor any record other than the masonry wall and artifact to be describe in another volume whoever they be whatever name be finally assign to this site by future historian of this i feel sure
