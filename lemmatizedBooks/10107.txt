final and decisive phase of the war against austrium something more should soon be write concern the doings of the british troops in italy for they deserve to stand out clearly in the history of the war this little book of mine be only a account more or less in the form of a diary of what one british soldier saw and feel who serve for eighteen month on the italian front as a subaltern officer in a siege battery but it be my luck to see a good deal during that time mine have be the first british battery to come into action and open fire on the italian front and as my story will show it be

brenta and the asiago plateau \* \* \* \* \* with british gun in italy part i introductory chapter i the anglo-italian tradition and italy 's part in the war anglo-italian friendship have be one of the few unchanging fact in modern international relation since the french revolution in the bellicose whirligig of history and of the old diplomacy 's reckless dance with death british troops have fight in turn against frenchman and german against russian and austrian against bulgarian turk and chinaman against boer and even against american but never except for a handful of napoleonic conscript against italian british and italian troops on the other hand fight side by side in the crimea and in the war which have just end have renew and extend they comradeship in arm in austrium and italy in france and in the balkan during the nineteenth century italy in she war of liberation gain in a degree which this generation can hardly realize the enthusiastic sympathy and the moral and sometimes material support of all the best element in the british nation there be poet -- byron and shelley the browning swinburne and meredith -- who be fill with a passionate devotion to the italian cause -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be statesman -- palmerston lord john russell and gladstone -- who do good work for italian freedom and italian still remember that in 1861 the british government be the first to recognize the new kingdom of unite italy while the government of other power be intriguing to harass and destroy it there be individual adventurous englishman such as forbe the comrade of garibaldus who put they life and they wealth at the disposal of italian patriot but beyond all these it be the great mass of the british people which stand steadily behind the italian people in its long struggle for unity and freedom -lrb- footnote 1 : even tennyson who be not very susceptible to foreign influence invite garibaldus to plant a tree in he garden -rrb- mazzinus garibaldus and cavor the soul the sword and the brain which together create modern italy all have close personal relation with this country mazzinus drive from he own land by foreign oppressor live a great part of he life in exile among we and here dream those dream which still inspire generous youth throughout the world when garibaldus visit we in 1864 he be enthusiastically acclaimed by all section of the nation by the prince of wale the peerage and the poet laureate no less than by the work class it be record that use as he be as a soldier to the roar of battle and as a sailor to the roar of the storm garibaldus almost quail before the tumultuous roar of welcome which greet he as he come out of the railway station at nine elm cavor be a deep student and a great admirer of british institution both political and economic and in a large measure found italian institution upon they and the first public speech he ever make be make in london in the english tongue these great man pass in time from the stage of italian public life and other take they place but amid all the shift complexity of recent international politics no shadow have ever fall across the path of anglo-italian friendship and indeed during the boer war italy be the only friend we have leave in europe italy 's membership of the triple alliance be always subject to two condition first that the alliance be to be purely defensive and second that italy would never support either of she partner in war against england thus under the first condition when austrium propose in 1913 that the triple alliance should combine to crush serbium victorious but exhaust after the balkan war italy at once reject the proposal and under the second condition as german naval expansion become more and more provocative and threatening to britain we be able to transfer nearly all we mediterranean fleet to the north sea secure in the knowledge that whatever might befall we should never find italy among we enemy \* \* \* \* \* the part which italy have play during the war just end the great value of she contribution to the ally cause and the great sacrifice which that contribution have involve for she have be often and admirably state but i doubt whether even yet these thing be fully realize outside italy and i will therefore very shortly state they again when war break out in August 1914 italy declare she neutrality on the ground that the war be aggressive on the part of the central power and that therefore the triple alliance no longer bind she by she declaration of neutrality she liberate the whole french army to fight in belgium and north-eastern france and render we sea communication with the east substantially secure bismarck use to say that under the triple alliance a italian bugler and drummer boy post on the franco-italian frontier would immobilise four french army corps the alliance disappoint the expectation of bismarck 's successor but if italy have come in at this time on the german side she might well have tilted swiftly and irremediably against we that awful equipoise of force which once establish last for more than four year there would have be small hope that france support only by we small expeditionary force and face with a italian invasion in the south-east in addition to a german invasion in the north-east could have prevent the fall of pari and the channel port while austrium free from all fear on the italian frontier perhaps even reinforce by part of the italian army could have turn all she force against russium or alternatively part of the italian army might have attack serbium through austrian territory with the probable result that rumanium and greece as well as bulgarium and turkey would have be bring in against we in the first month of the war at sea we naval supremacy would have be strain to break point by the many heavy task impose upon it simultaneously in widely-separated sea we communication through the mediterranean would indeed have be almost impossible to maintain many bribe be offer to italy at this time by the central power in the hope of induce she to join they -- corsica savoy and nice tuni malta and probably even larger reward but italy remain neutral in may 1915 she enter the war on we side in the first place to free those man of italian race who still live outside she frontier under grievous oppression and whom austria refuse to give up to they mother country and in the second place because already many italian realize as american also realize later that the defeat of the central power be a necessary first step towards the liberation of oppressed people everywhere and the building of a better world italy enter the war at a time when thing be go badly for we in russium and look very menacing in france and when she herself be still ill-prepared for a long expensive and exhausting struggle the first effect of she entry be to pin down along the alp and the isonzo large austrian force which would otherwise have be available for use elsewhere she enter the war nine month after the british empire but she loss when the war end have be proportionately heavier than ours accord to the latest publish information the total of italian dead be 460000 out of a population of 35 million the total of british dead for the whole british empire include dominion colonial and indian troops be 670000 and for the unite kingdom alone 500000 the white population of the british empire be 62 million and of the unite kingdom 46 million thus the italian dead amount to more than 13 for every thousand of the population and the british whether calculate for the unite kingdom alone or for the whole white population of the empire to less than 11 for every thousand of the population the long series of battle of the isonzo -- the journalist count up to twelve of they in the first twenty-seven month in which italy be at war -- the succession of offensive from tolmino to the sea which be only dimly realize in england and france cost italy the flower of she youth the italian army be continually on the offensive during those month against the strongest natural defence to be find in any of the theater of war on countless occasion italian hero go forth on forlorn hope to scale and capture impossible precipice and sometimes they succeed through that bloody series of offensive the italian slowly but steadily gain ground and draw ever nearer to trento and trieste only those who go out to the italian front before caporetto and see with they own eye what the italian army have accomplish on the carso and among the julian alp can fully realize the greatness of the italian effort it must never be forget that italy be both the youngest and the poorest of the great power of europe barely half a century have pass since unite italy be bear and the political and economic difficulty of she national childhood be enormous for many year as one of she own historian say she be not a state but only the outward appearance of a state she natural resource be poor and limited she possess neither coal nor iron and be still partially dependent on import food and foreign shipping she be still very poor in accumulate capital and the burden of she taxation be very heavy from the moment of she entry into the war she economic problem become very difficult especially that of the provision of gun and munitions in sufficient quantity and the extent to which she solve this last problem be deserving of the greatest admiration she position grow even more difficult in 1917 after the military collapse of russium she have to face practically the whole austrian army instead of only a part of it and a greatly increase weight of gun the austrian have 53 million of population to draw from the italian only 35 moreover just before caporetto a number of german division with a powerful mass of artillery and aircraft be throw into the austrian scale while from the italian be withdraw the majority of that tiny handful of french and british battery which be all the armed support which up to that time she ally have ever lend she only five british battery and a few french be leave on the italian front by the defeat of caporetto she lose a great quantity of gun and store and practically the whole of she second army while half of venetium fall into the hand of the enemy and remain in he possession for a year the inferiority of the italian army to its enemy both in number and in material be thus sharply increase but the italian hold grimly on they turn at bay on the piave and in the mountain and check the onrush of austrian and german then support by french and british reinforcement but still inferior in number they continue for a year longer to hold up almost the whole strength of austrium that winter the poor be very near starvation in the city of italy and the peasant have to cut down they olive grove for fuel the follow spring part of the french and british reinforcement be withdraw to france together with a italian contingent which numerically balance the french and british who remain in italy the austrian also lose they german support and send some of they own troops to france but they retain they numerical superiority on the italian front in June they launch a great attack on a seventy-mile front which be to have make a end of italy but the italian beat they back then four month later after a intense effort of preparation italy still inferior in number and material strike for the last time and utterly destroy the austrian army in the great battle which will be know to history as vittorio veneto the austrians lose twice as many prisoner and four time as many gun at vittorio veneto as they have take at caporetto the war on the italian front be over the austrian army be break beyond recovery the austrian state be dissolve into its national element which only tradition corruption and brute force have for so long hold together italy heroic and constant have endure to the end and with she last great gesture have both complete she own freedom and give they freedom to those who have be the instrument of she enemy part ii some early impression chapter ii from folkestone to venice on the 6th July 1917 i arrive at folkestone arm with a war office letter order my passage to france for reinforcement for siege artillery battery in italy i have a millpond cross in the afternoon and that evening leave boulogne for modane next morning at 2 be i be awaken from frowsy sleep by a french soldier laden with baggage who stumble headlong into the railway carriage which i be share with three other british officer we be at amien i be last here ten month before when my division be come back from rest to fight a second time upon the somme i do not sleep again but watch the sunrise behind a avenue of poplar as we pass through creil and the wood of chantilly shine wonderfully in the early morning light i spend that day in pari and leave again in the evening next morning the 8th i awake at bourg in high savoy here too the poplar dominate in the valley we run along the shore of lake bourget and up the beautiful valley of the arc in misty rain we arrive at modane at 10 be and i be book through to palmanova a new name to I at that time the train leave a hour later and as we lunch we pass through the mont ceni tunnel and slide rapidly downwards through alpine valley charming enough but less beautiful than those on the french side of the frontier very soon it become perceptibly warmer electric fan be set in motion and ice be serve with the wine i find that i have six hour to wait at turin before the train leave for milan my fleeting impression of turin be of a very well-planned city its corsus spacious and well shaded with tree its tram multitudinous its many distant vista of wooded hill and of the superga palace beyond the po a delight to the eye but i find less animation there than i have expect except in a church where a priest be ferociously declaim and gesticulate at a perspire crowd mostly woman who be patiently fan themselves in the stifle unventilated heat i be a object of interest in the street where the british uniform be not yet well know some take I for a russian and some little boy run after I and ask for a rouble a group of woman agree that i be spanish the train for milan go right through to venice so be momentarily independent of the british military authority i decide to spend a few hour there on my way to the front the carriage be full of italian officer chiefly cavalry fly corps and infantry it be they custom on meet a unknown officer of they own or of a ally army to stand stiffly upright to shake hand and introduce themselves by name this little ceremony break the ice i see many of they also on the platform and in the corridor of the train the majority especially of they mount officer be very elegant and many very handsome and they have those charming easy manners which be everywhere characteristic of the latin people nearly all italian officer speak french in they regular army french and either english or german be compulsory study and a good standard of fluent conversation be require in these early day my italian be rather break so we talk mostly french at milan all my companion except one get out and a new lot get in but i be grow sleepy and after the formal introduction i begin to drowse \* \* \* \* \* i wake several time in the night and early morning and half asleep look out through the carriage window upon wonderful sight a railway platform like a terrace in a typical italian garden ornate with a row of carve stone vase of perfect form and vine in festoon from vase to vase and dark tree behind and then a downward slope and little white house asleep in the distance this i think be close to brescium then desenzano and what i take to be the distant glimmer of lake garda under the star verona i pass in my sleep have now cross the boundary of lombardy into venetium and vicenza and padua be nothing from the train at mestre the junction for the front all the italian officer get out and i go on to venice except for three british naval officer i be i think the only foreigner there and a priest whom i meet take I for a american everything of value in venice that could be be sandbag now for fear of bomb and much that be movable have be take away i spend three hour in a gondola on the grand canal and up and down the rius fill with a dreamy amazement at the superb harmony of form and color of thing both far away and close at hand and even as see in war-time with all the accustomed life of venice broken and spoil the spaciousness of the piazza s marco and the beauty of the building that stand around it and at night the summer lightning and a rainstorm and a café under the colonnade where music be be play will linger always in my memory all the big hotel be close now or take over by the government as office or hospital and the gondola lay moor in solitary line along the grand canal and even the motor boat be few and as a waiter say to I no one have be here for three year but the people be very quiet and no one complain chapter iii from venice to the isonzo front i leave venice next morning by the 555 train and reach palmanova at half-past ten as one go eastward by this railway there be a grand panorama of hill circle the whole horizon to the north and north-east the carnic alp and cadore they highest summit crown with snow even in the full heat of summer eastward the julian alp beyond the isonzo stretch from a point north of tolmino down behind the carso almost to fiume in the south-east and yet further round the circle to the southward the mountain of istrium run behind trieste and its wide blue gulf whose water be invisible from this railway across the plain of palmanova i will write again this be the railhead and the ammunition dump for the british battery i stay there that day scarcely a hour and then go on by motor lorry to gradisca the headquarters of british heavy artillery italy here i lunch and be well receive by the staff who be expect no reinforcement and be astonish at my come it be decide after some discussion to attach I temporarily to a battery which have one officer in hospital slightly wound by shrapnel i continue my journey in another motor lorry after lunch gradisca lie on the western bank of the isonzo which be cross close by at peteano by a magnificent broad wooden bridge the work of italian engineer gradisca have not be badly damage the austrian have make no great resistance here against the italian advance in may 1915 but peteano have be lay absolutely flat by austrian twelve-inch gun it have be utterly destroy in half a hour 's intense bombardment some month before and many italian hutment in the neighborhood have be destroy at the same time within sight of this bridge at a distance of a quarter of a mile be the confluence of the vippacco with the isonzo from this point the road follow the vippacco to rubbia the headquarters of colonel raven who command the northern group of british battery which i be now join the five battery of this group know as b2 be all in position on or near the vippacco firing on the northern edge of the carso and eastward along the river valley the southern group b1 be on the carso itself and operate chiefly against the famous hermada a position of tremendous natural strength directly cover trieste b2 have the more comfortable and better-shaded position but b1 though they gun be among the rock and in the full heat of the sun be in easy reach of the sea and have a rest camp at grado among the lagoon raven 's group b2 form part of a italian raggruppamento or collection of group under the command of a certain sicilian colonel name canale a dapper little man who generally wear white glove even in the front line he be a fearless and capable officer and do all in he power for the comfort of we battery from rubbia i drive in a car to the battery as i leave the group headquarters a number of wooden hut at the foot of the wooded slope of monte san michele which rise upward from the road i go under the railway which in peace-time connect gorizium with trieste it be useless now be within easy range of the austrian gun which have moreover break down the high stone bridge on which the line cross the vippacco a young sicilian sergeant accompany I as a guide and point out gorizium some six mile away to the north a widely-scattered town very white in the sunlight lie at the foot of high hill famous in the history of the war on this front monte sabotino monte santo monte san gabriele of which there will be more for I to say hereafter the gun position of my new battery be situate just outside the little village of pec inhabit mostly by slovene peasantry before the war now all vanish the village have be much shell first by italian and then by austrian gun and there be not a house remain undamaged though several have be patch up as billet and cookhouse by british troops another of we battery have they gun actually in the ruin of the village but ours be alongside a sunken road lead down to the vippacco the gun themselves be conceal in thick bower of acacia the branch of which have be clip here and there within we arc of fire i doubt if anywhere on any front a british battery occupy a position of greater natural beauty the officer ' mess and sleep hut be a few hundred yard from the gun right on the bank of the vippacco likewise hide from view and shaded from the sun by a great mass of acacia a luxuriant soft roof of fresh green leave we mess indeed have no other roof than this for there be seldom any rain and as we sit at meal we face a broad waterfall a curving wall of white foam stretch right across the stream which be at this point about seventy or eighty yard wide innumerable blue dragon-fly flit backwards and forwards in the sunlight though the weather be warm it be less hot than usual at this time of year and the surroundings of we mess remind I vividly of kerry in the first day that follow i could often imagine myself back in beautiful and familiar place in the south-west corner of ireland only italian gunner come and go for several of they battery position be close to ours and the castello di rubbia across the water slightly but not greatly damage break this occasional illusion these italian take we quite for grant now and that evening i begin to learn about they front thing be pretty quiet at present on both side but greater activity be expect soon i make the acquaintance of venosta a italian artillery officer attach to the battery he be from milan a member of a well-known lombard family and have a soft and quiet way with he and a certain supple charm at ordinary time he prefer to take thing easily and be imperturbable by anything which he think unimportant but in crisis as i learn later on he could show much calm resource and energy \* \* \* \* \* i wake next morning to the sound of the vippacco waterfall and the follow day i get my first real impression of this part of the italian front the battery be do a registration shoot and i go up in the afternoon with we second-in-command to a op on the top of the nad logem to observe and correct we fire it be a great climb up a stony watercourse now dry and then through old austrian trench elaborately blast in the carso rock and capture a year ago the nad logem be part of the northern edge of the carso and from we op a great panorama spread out north east and west with the sinuous vippacco in the foreground fringe with tree from here i have point out to I the various feature of the country the play of light and shade in the distance be very wonderful we target that afternoon be a point in the austrian front line on a long low brown hill lie right below we know officially as hill 126 the austrian some day before have send we a ironical wireless message we have evacuate hill 94 and hill 126 for a week so that the british battery may register on they they evidently know something of we whereabouts and we plan come back we stop at the foot of a hill on which stand the shell-wrecked monastery of san grado di merna a white ruin gaunt against the darker background of the nad logem here a new battery position be be prepare for we only three hundred yard behind the austrian front line but admirably protect by the configuration of the ground from enemy fire a italian drilling machine be at work here operate by compress air drilling hole in the rock for the insertion of dynamite charge and by means of gradual blast gun pit and cartridge recess and dug-out be be create in the stubborn rock here a heavy thunderstorm break and we sheltered in the headquarters of a italian field artillery brigade likewise blast out of the mountain side i return with venosta i ask he to show I the famous bersagliere trot and by way of illustration we double along the road for about half a mile on the british front the spectacle of two officer thus disport themselves for no apparent reason would have cause much remark and amusement but the italian whom we pass seem to see nothing remarkable in we behavior they be perhaps more tolerant of eccentricity than we be it may be of interest at this point to say a few word about some of the special characteristic of the italian army every modern army have adopt a distinctive color for its war-time uniform choose with a view to minimize visibility thus we wear khaki the french horizon-blue the german field-grey the italian have adopt a olive color commonly speak of as grigio-verde or grey-green the various italian corps regiment and brigade wear distinctively color collar on they tunic which except in the case of the arditus fit closely round the neck for example the granatierus or grenadier who both in they high physical standard and military prestige resemble we own guard battalion wear a collar of crimson and white the color of the artillery be black with a yellow border that of the engineer black with a red border of the infantry the alpinus collar be green and the bersaglierus crimson the band of color be shape in each case like sharp-pointed flame turn outwards for this reason the alpinus be often call the fiamme verdus or green flame and the bersaglierus fiamme rosse or red flame the infantry brigade of the line who bear local name -- the avellino brigade the como brigade the lecce brigade and so forth -- have each they distinctively color collar these local name mean very little for as a matter of policy man from all part of italy be mixed indiscriminately together in each brigade the parma brigade for example will contain only a few man from parma and they by chance one of the object of this policy be to help to break down those regional barrier which still linger owe to historical cause between different district of italy it be often remark that man from many part of italy know more of foreign country than of other part of they own country and most of the numerous local dialect be hardly intelligible to man who live far from the district where they be speak ordinary italian which be in fact the local dialect of rome be as it be the _ lingua franca _ of the whole country but the great majority of italian speak not only italian but one or sometimes several local dialect and the latter be use by all class in they own home some of these dialect differ widely from italian in many remote district some of the peasant can not speak italian at all the alpinus and the two sardinian brigade cagliarus and sassarus be exception to the rule mention above the alpinus be in peace-time recruit entirely from the man who dwell in the alp though i believe that during the present war a certain number of man from the apennine have also be include in alpini battalion the alpinus be specially use for warfare in the mountain they wear in they hat a single long feather closely attach to the alpinus be the mountain artillery arm with light gun of about the same calibre as we own twelve-pounder they too be recruit from the mountaineer and wear the alpino hat and single feather the alpinus have a magnificent regimental spirit and in my judgment be the equal of any troops in the world the cagliarus and sassarus brigade two of the best in the italian army be compose entirely of sardinian when in the front line they use the sardinian dialect on the telephone even if the austrian succeed by means of listen set in overhear they it hardly matter for it be not likely that anyone in the austrian front line will understand the bersaglierus another famous italian regiment be recruit from all part of italy but only from man of high physical fitness they correspond roughly to the light infantry of other army and always drill and march to a very quick step even when carry machine gun on they shoulder they hat deck with a mass of green cock ' feather be familiar in illustration the bersagliere cyclist company use for scout purpose form part of the regiment the bersagliere undress cap be a red fez with a blue tassel the arditus or assault detachment correspond to the german sturmtruppen they be institute in the italian army in 1917 they also consist of pick man and undergo a special training to accustom they to bomb-throwing at close quarter and to other incident of the assault in the course of this training casualty often occur only young unmarried man of exceptionally good physique can become arditus they be only use in actual attack and never for the purpose of merely hold trench they therefore spend a large part of they time behind the line and receive i believe extra pay and ration they be arm with rifle and _ pugnalus _ or small dagger and wear a low-cut tunic with a black knottie and a black fez on each lapel of they tunic they wear two black flame similar to the crimson flame on the collar of the bersaglierus they be therefore know as fiamme nere or black flame a large proportion of arditus be sicilian and they fight quality be very high certain detachment of bersaglierus be also classify as assault detachment and wear low-cut tunic like the arditus the italian mountain and field artillery be excellent they heavy artillery be handicap in comparison with ours by its smaller ammunition supply and fewer opportunity for prolonged practice but its method be scientific and its personnel very keen and capable the italian engineer have do much wonderful work to which i shall refer later chapter iv the war on the isonzo front from monte nero to the adriatic the distance be in a straight line some 35 mile allow for the curve of the actual line the length of front be between 40 and 50 mile this portion of the italian and austrian line be commonly speak of as the isonzo front it be not like the front in the higher alp where as on the adamello trench be cut in the solid ice where the firing of a single gun may precipitate a avalanche where more italian be kill by avalanche than by austrian where gun have to be drag up precipice and perch on ledge fit only one might think for a eagle 's nest where food ammunition reinforcement wound and sick have all to travel in small cage attach to wire rope sling from peak to peak above sheer drop of many thousand foot where sentry have to stand rigidly stationary so as to remain invisible and have to be change every ten minute owe to the intense cold where battalion of alpinus charge down snow slope on ski at the rate of thirty mile a hour where refraction and the deceive glare of the snow make accurate rifle fire impossible even for crack shot -- the isonzo front be not so astounding and impossible a front as this but it be yet a very different front from any on which british troops be elsewhere fight in this war it be a country with a strange beauty of its own it be in its own measure rough and mountainous and it be within sight of other and loftier mountain to the north-west at my first view of it i remember a speech of carlo the hero of meredith 's _ vittorium _ concern lombard city away on the other side of the trentino brescium under the big eastern hill which throw a cloak on it at sunrise brescium be always the eagle 's nest that look over lombardy and bergamo you know the terrace of bergamo be not they like a morning sky die there be not death it be fly into the dawn you roman envy we you have no alp no crimson hill nothing but old wall to look on while you fight farewell merthyr powy to I those word be always recur on the italian front die here be not death it be fly into the dawn i would have like to have they engrave on my tombstone if fate have set one up for I in this land whose beauty cast a spell on all one 's sens \* \* \* \* \* the isonzo front be divide into two part by the vippacco river which flow roughly from east to west and join the isonzo at peteano of these two part the northern be three time as long as the southern the northern part be hold by the italian second army under general capello the southern by the italian third army under the duke of aosta in the north the isonzo run through a deep ravine with monte nero rise on its eastern side monte nero be some 6800 foot high the alpinus take it by a marvellous feat of mountain warfare in the first year of the war south of monte nero also on the east bank of the river lie the town of tolmino the object of many fierce italian assault but not yet take here the isonzo bend south-westward and continue to flow through a deep ravine past canale and plava with the bainsizza plateau rise on its eastern bank this plateau be of a general height of about 2400 foot and be continue south-eastward by the ternova plateau rise to a general height of about 2200 foot bend again towards the south-east the isonzo flow out into the plain of gorizium here stand monte sabotino and monte santo the western and eastern pillar of this gateway lead into the lower land east of monte santo along the southern edge of the plateau stand monte san gabriele and monte san daniele here the plateau fall precipitously down to the vippacco valley only the long brown foothill of san marco break the drop gorizium have scatter suburb : salcano to the north in the very mouth of the gorge the fashionable suburb in day before the war podgora to the west on the other side of the isonzo industrial the isonzo front be the only possible field for a italian offensive on a great scale and the possession of the carso of the bainsizza and ternova plateau and of monte nero be as essential to the future security of the venetian plain as the possession of the trentino itself the frontier of northern and north-eastern italy be draw accord to the method of the old diplomacy after the war of 1866 when bismarck seek to keep austrium neutral in the next war on he schedule that with france willingly sacrifice the interest of he italian ally for half a century lombardy and venetium have live under the continual threat of a austrian descent from the mountain both from the trentino thrust like a wedge into the heart of northern italy and across the isonzo from the east nor have this threat be remote when italy be plunge in grief at the time of the messina earthquake the austrian general staff almost persuade they government that the moment have come to strike she down into the dust and recover lombardy and venetium for franci joseph and rome for the pope and so to-day a italian army fight on the isonzo front fight in continual danger of have its line of communication cut by a austrian offensive from the trentino the population of the trentino be indisputably italian east of the isonzo the people be mainly italian in the town and mainly slovene in the country district it have be the deliberate policy of the austrian government to plant new slovene colony here from time to time and to render life intolerable for italian but even so the population be still sparse and all the country be infertile except for the vippacco valley which though wretchedly cultivate hitherto would richly repay the application of capital and modern method here i think be a clear case where strategic consideration which be definite must prevail over racial consideration which be dubious these land must be italian after the war if with even the dimmest possibility of war remain italian be to have peace of mind nor do a strong defensive frontier for italy here imply a weak defensive frontier for she eastern neighbor for the tangle of mountain continue for many mile further east \* \* \* \* \* venosta tell I that when they take san michele in July 1916 the italian lose 7000 in kill alone seasoned soldier of they old army whom it have be hard to replace but when san michele fall they sweep on and take gorizium and all the surround plain at one bind and in the same offensive monte sabotino this victory have a special significance in modern italian history for it be the first time that a army compose of man from all part of unite italy fight a pitched battle against a great army of austrium italy 's secular enemy and oppressor monte cucco and monte vodice be take in the offensive of may 1917 and here as at monte nero the alpinus perform feat of arm which to soldier accustom to fight on the flat must seem all but incredible in one case twenty alpinus climb up a sheer rock face at night by means of rope and leap upon the austrian sentry kill and throw they over the cliff without a sound so that when the main body of alpinus climb by hardly less difficult path reach the summit they take the austrian garrison in the rear and by surprise and the height be theirs monte santo be still austrian when i come though the italian hold trench half-way up on the summit the white ruin of a famous convent be clearly visible here some of the bloodiest infantry fighting of the whole war take place in may 1917 the italian be on the top once in the full flood of that offensive but could not hold it four gallant battalion charge up those steep slope only to find that the artillery preparation have be insufficient and that the convent wall have not be destroy austrian pour out from deep cavern in the rock where they have take refuge during the bombardment and throw down bomb from the top of the wall upon the italian below for these there be no way round and no question of retreat so they all die where they stand struggle to climb a wall thirty foot high clamber upon one another 's shoulder south of the vippacco we hold the volconiac and dosso faitus but not hill 464 though this have be take and lose again nor yet the hill further east nor any of the northern foothill of the carso except hill 123 to the south again the hermada have prove a great and bloody obstacle \* \* \* \* \* three striking characteristic of the warfare on this front impressed themselves upon my mind -- first the shortage of ammunition second the enormous natural strength of all the austrian position third the work of the italian engineer judge by the standard of warfare in france and flander both italian and austrian be very short of ammunition for italy a young and poor country possess neither coal nor iron and throw largely on she own resource for manufacture munitions of war this be no matter of surprise it be astonishing that the italian artillery be so well supply as it be but to bring out the contrast one may note that whereas in italy fuoco normale for siege artillery be six round per gun per hour in france at this time a british siege battery 's ordinary be thirty round per gun per hour and one may note further that the number of siege battery on a give length of front in france be even at this time more than four time as great as the corresponding number on the italian front the austrian to some extent make up for they small quantity of gun and shell by a high proportion of gun of large calibre they twelve-inch howitzer be disagreeably numerous it result however that neither italian nor austrian could afford to indulge in continuous heavy bombardment such as be the rule in france there be here on neither side a surplus of shell to fire away at target of secondary importance and therefore there be less destruction than in france of town and village near the line ammunition have to be accumulate for important occasion and important target thus battle be still separate and distinct in italy with perceptible interval of lull less apt than in france to become one blur series of gigantic action so too counter-battery work on a great scale be not practice on either side out here partly for reason of ammunition supply and partly for technical reason connect with the nature of the ground for in a good _ caverna _ one be perfectly safe though outside high explosive produce not only its own natural effect but also a shower of piece of rock thus combine the unpleasant characteristic of high explosive and shrapnel one of we gunner have he rib break by a blow from a large piece of rock though stand three hundred yard away from where the shell burst but often after a heavy bombardment it be find that the enemy have be sit quietly in _ caverne _ ready to emerge with he machine gun when the attack infantry advance aeroplane also be less numerous than in france and when i arrive gas be not much employ on either side in the second place i be deeply impressed with the natural strength of the austrian ' position almost everywhere they hold high ground on no other front in this war have stronger position be carry by assault than san michele sabotino cucco vodice monte nero and in the end monte santo no one who have not see with he own eye the height which italian infantry have conquer back by no great artillery support can realize the astounding thing which the italian have perform the italian infantry have die in mass with high heart and in the exaltation of delirium crumple rent and agonised achieve the impossible and in the third place i would say something of the work of they engineer italian engineer be famous all the world over but they have do nothing more magnificent than they swift building of innumerable road broad and well-laid and with marvellously easy gradient both in these inhospitable and undeveloped border land beside the isonzo and along the whole mountain front they have make possible troop movement and a regular system of supply under the most difficult condition it be a work worthy of the descendant of the old roman who by they road building lay the foundation of civilisation throughout western europe and only second to they road make i would place the work of the italian engineer in blast _ caverne _ and gun position and trench in the rock a invaluable and unending labor we british gunner spend we first italian summer in khaki drill tunic and shorts -lrb- 1 -rrb- and australian smasher hat when these hat be first issue one battery commander declare they to be unsoldierly in appearance and ask for permission to return they to the ordnance but this be not allow the man stand the heat well though at the beginning before they have get accustom to the change of climate there be some dysentery i myself a few day after my arrival and before i have a smasher hat have a touch of the sun and lay about all day cursing the fly but next day i be all right again -lrb- footnote 1 : next summer the introduction of mustard gas make it unsafe to leave we knee uncover -rrb- we ration at this time be a special anglo-italian blend less meat bacon cheese and tea than in the british ration but macaroni rice coffee wine and lemon from the italian it be a good ration and no one suffer from eat a little less meat than at home in order to check the spread of dysentery it be order by the medical authority that no meat be to be eat at midday we be not do a great deal of firing when i come though we have always to be prepare to come suddenly and quickly into action especially at night most of we prearranged daylight shoot be observe from a op in a ruin house at s andrea on the plain just outside gorizium where one have a fine view southward of the tamburo and of the whole boundary ridge of the carso from dosso faitus to the stoll observation be beautifully easy on these high hill and in this clear air what world away be this country with its wonderful cloudless sunshine from the dismal flat land of the western front say one enthusiast of ours this be a gunner 's heaven the austrian fancy i think that we have we op in vertoiba which be north of s andrea for they shell this frequently but s andrea seldom they shell vertoiba heavily i remember all one afternoon while i be on duty at s andrea and while the italian staff be present in large number for two hour to watch we shooting i remember think what a fine bag they would have get if they have lift about four hundred yard the italian staff be always most complimentary and enthusiastic over the work of we battery we have take part in the italian may offensive the result of which have be claim by the _ daily mail _ with characteristic good taste and sense of proportion as a great anglo-italian victory we part have be more justly describe by general cadorna who in a special order of the day have say that amid the roar of battle be clearly hear the voice of british gun and in he summary of the result of this offensive which last from may 12th to may 30th after remark that the number of austrian take prisoner be 23681 man and 604 officer and that in addition at least 100000 austrian have be put out of action continue as follow we brave infantry fight indefatigably for eighteen day without pause and without proper food supplies on difficult ground in almost mid-summer heat impetuous in attack and tenacious in defense most effective at all time be the fraternal co-operation of the artillery siege field or mountain one field battery not hesitate to push right up to the firing line excellent help too be lend by ten battery of medium calibre of the british army and by the gun of the italian navy cadorna have inspect we battery soon after they arrival in italy and we have be visit and officially welcome on behalf of the italian government by the minister bissolatus perhaps the most vivid and vital personality in italian politics and a wise counsellor whose advice have more than once be disastrously ignore -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : from the outbreak of war in August 1914 bissolatus strongly advocate italian intervention on the side of the ally when italy declare war he enlist in the rank of the alpinus although over military age be decorate for valor and seriously wound he then become minister for military supplies and act as a connect link between the cabinet at rome and the high command -rrb- address at pec detachment from a number of british battery on the 29th of may bissolatus have say : officer and man of the british force i bring you the greeting of the italian government and the thanks of the italian people i greet you not only as a italian minister but as a comrade in arm for i consider it the greatest privilege of my life to have be in this war a soldier like yourselve we heart beat with joy to see you here because there be no italian however humble he station who do not know how great be the debt of italy to britain for the brotherly help afford she during the tragic vicissitude of the glorious story of she resurrection we all remember how you father help to create the italian nation to-day we find ourselves fight side by side in the same campaign we to redeem this territory from the austrian yoke you to maintain the liberty of you national existence from the german menace both of we moreover to set the whole world free from the peril of fall under the dominion of that race hard in temper as a granite rock which find in the austro-hungarian empire a willing ally in its rape and aggression i be here then to thank you not only as a italian but as a man and i be fill with joy at the thought that the british even as the italian be show themselves to be now as always the champion of justice and the defender of liberty and right the sacrifice which we be make together the mingling of we blood upon the battlefield will render even stronger the agelong traditional friendship between we two nation viva l'inghilterra viva l'italia chapter v palmanova during my first month in italy i live a nomadic life i be only attach to a battery and really nobody 's child July 17th to 22nd i spend at palmanova in charge of a artillery fatigue party which be help the ordnance to load and unload ammunition and from August 2nd to 10th i be in charge of another work party of gunner at versa a fly-bitten dusty little village which we medical authority have stupidly select as a site for a hospital though there be many suitable villa in more accessible and agreeable place not far away but in this first month i be lucky in be able to multiply and vary my impression of the eastern veneto \* \* \* \* \* i ride down to palmanova from gradisca on a motor lorry what a country the white house the white road the mass of fresh green foliage chiefly acacia the tall dark cypress the cool blue water of the isonzo the blue-grey mountain in the distance and on they summit the sunshine on the snow which be hardly distinguishable from the low-lying cloud bank in a otherwise cloudless sky italian troops dusty column march along the road throw up at I a occasional greet as the lorry go by long line of transport pass continually sempre avanti savoia sempre avanti italia i find my eye wet with tear for the beauty and the glory and the insidious danger of that intoxicate war-cry for the blindness and the wickedness and the selfish greed that lurk behind it exploit the generous emotion of the young and brave for the irony and bitter fatuity of _ any _ war-cry in a world that should be purge of war \* \* \* \* \* and so i come to palmanova to supervise the loading of shell in the company of captain shield and another ordnance officer shield have travel much and mix with italian on the border of abyssinium he tell I that with no other european race be we relation in remote frontier land more harmonious they and we have he say a perfect code of write and unwritten rule to prevent all friction he tell I too of a young englishman out there quite a unimportant person who have a bad attack of sun-stroke and whose life be in great danger the only hope be to get he through quickly to the coast and the shortest road lay through italian territory so application be make to the italian authority for a right of passage which they not only grant but map out he route for he for it be difficult country and unfamiliar to we people and send a guide and have a mule with a load of ice wait for he at every halting-place along the road and so save he life treat he with as much consideration and tenderness as they could have be expect to show to a member of they own royal family \* \* \* \* \* palmanova lie just within the old italian frontier a little white town surround by a moat which in summer be quite dry and by grassy rampart shape like a star it be first fortify by the venetian republic four hundred year ago and again by napoleon it can be enter only through one of three gate approach by bridge across the moat from the north south-east and south -- the udine gate the gradisca gate and the maritime gate each gate be double so that you pass through a small square court almost like a well and at each gate you can see the remains of a old portcullis and drawbridge each be top by two slender tower and be wide enough to allow only one vehicle to pass at a time and at each there be a guard of carabinierus in they gray lantern-hat to stop and examine all questionable traffic from the rampart you can see the carnic and the julian alp sweeping round the venetian plain in a great half circle to the north the mountain seem to rise sheer out of green orchard and maize field but to the east there be a gradual slope of less fertile upland where the austrian in the first day of war on this front would not face the onrush of the italian in the open but fall back hurriedly to the more difficult country behind at night all the inhabitant sit out on the rampart talk of the hot weather and the war and watch the searchlight wink on the hill in the center of the town be a large piazza plant round with myrtle which smell strong and sweet in the sun and at midday a old woman set up a stall here and sell the newspaper of rome and milan bologna and venetium in one corner of this piazza be a restaurant where one can play billiards and dine well and cheaply a youth serve here who have be reject for the army because of defective eyesight he speak a little french and a little german and a very little english and in moment of excitement word from all these language come tumble out together mix up with italian he have i be sure a italian-english phrase book which he consult hurriedly in the kitchen for whenever he set a new course before one he shoot out some carefully prepared and usually quite irrelevant sentence and watch eagerly to see if one understand in another corner of the piazza stand a campanile with a peal of those absurd little jangling bell which be among the most characteristic charm of italy down a side street be the albergo rosa d'oro where for a week i be billet the padrone a little round man be always smile he think the war will last three year more and seem pleased at the prospect for the town and the district round be full of soldier and he must be make great profit but he wife when one speak of the war say it _ must _ end soon we must go on hope that it will end soon the station where my fatigue party work lie outside the town when the austrian provoke war in 1914 they have special train wait here to carry away the italian troops who they hope would go and fight for they against the russian -- a poor fool 's dream in normal time it must be a quiet place with little traffic but now there be continual movement infantry go up to the front line and often wait for hour at the station and other infantry come back to rest goods train of enormous length pass through motor lorry load and discharge drive very skilfully though sometimes very recklessly horse and mule transport in great variety both military and civilian some of the horse wear straw hat with two hole for the ear and cart draw by stolid slow-moving ox with all this come and go and with a temperature of over a hundred degree in the shade the albergo della stazione do a great trade in iced drink i make the acquaintance of two family in this town at signor lazzarus 's any british officer be always welcome after dinner for music and talk and light refreshment a italian general be billet there and two or three italian officer of junior rank a corporal with a magnificent voice a operatic singer before the war come in to sing one night and a private from he battalion play he accompaniment in italy as in france the art of conversation and a keen joy in it be still alive perhaps because bridge be still almost unknown signor lazzarus 's handsome and charming daughter be a admirable hostess at signor burinus 's i be also most hospitably receive and drink some very excellent champagne i use to talk to he three little girl in the evening on the rampart signor burinus 's mother remember garibaldus 's visit to palmanova in 1867 the year after venetium be liberate from the austrian yoke and add to unite italy she be speak of this one evening to shield and he say it rain very heavily that day do not it whereat the old lady much astonished and evidently suspect he of some uncanny gift of second sight reply that indeed it do but the truth be that he have be read a account of this historic occasion in a local guide book which relate that just as garibaldus come out on a balcony to address the crowd a heavy thunderstorm break and the hero of the two world only say you have all better go home out of the rain \* \* \* \* \* it can still rain at palmanova one day while i be there the temperature rise to 105 degree in the shade but in the evening a cool breeze stir the dust and i sit outside the albergo rosa d'oro talk with various passer-by about nine o'clock bright lightning begin to fill the sky but as yet no rain and then about eleven just after i have go to bed come a tremendous drenching thunderstorm and a great whirlwind and then very suddenly all become quiet again save for the rain-water pour off the roof into the street below chapter vi aquileium and grado on July 22nd the day before i return from palmanova to my battery shield and i and two lorryload of man make a expedition in the afternoon to aquileium and grado aquileium at the height of the old roman power be a great and important city on the main road eastward from the north italian plain it be destroy and sack by attilum and he hun in the year 452 and again in 568 by alboin and he lombard it be the fugitive from aquileium and the neighbouring town who take refuge in the lagoon along the coast found upon certain mudbank in the fifth century the city which be destine to be venice and it be at grado in the year 466 that the foundation of venetian constitutional history be lay by the election of tribune to govern the affair of the community inhabit the lagoon the two chief feature of aquileium to-day be a museum of roman antiquity which i have not time to visit and a large church with a bare interior but with a magnificent eleventh century mosaic floor one of the best example of its kind in italy the interior of the church be decorate with flower in shell case to signify its reconquest by the italian who intend to make here a great national memorial when the war be over beside the church at its eastern end stand a glorious group of very tall cypress one of the best group i have ever see and opposite the western entrance be a charming little avenue of young cypress plant since the reconquest we stay for half a hour at aquileium and then go on to grado \* \* \* \* \* on the way shield tell I the story of how the british battery come to italy we own war office as the habit of the tribe be have wrap the whole thing up in mystery and the battery be christen the british mission to a destination secret and unnamed pass through the south of france and up the arc valley to the frontier with the gunner sit on they gun in open truck in the sunshine the train be loudly cheer by the french who in that part of the country have see few of the sight of war once in italy the official attempt at mystification mystified nobody the engine-driver at modane hoist union jack on they engine and keep they fly all the way everyone know who we be and where we be go and at every station where the train stop there be official welcome and immense crowd cheer like mad at turin we gun be wreathe in flower and at verona the station staff present a bouquet to the general on whose behalf shield make a suitable reply in italian \* \* \* \* \* grado lie on several island in its own lagoon the austrian be develop it in a haphazard way as a watering-place before the war and there be several large hotel and the beginning of a sea front the canal be fill with fishing boat with brown sail which seldom put to sea now for fear of mine one approach grado by a steamer which start from a little cluster of house on the mainland know as belvedere and take one down a long channel through a maze of ` wooded island one of which be now the headquarters of a italian seaplane squadron the island be thickly clothe with tamarisk and pollarded acacia and stone pine and be repute to be somewhat malarial there be a long beach at grado where all the world bathe and the water be deliciously warm with a bottom of hard sand lie in the water i could see right round the gulf of trieste as far as capodistrium and straight opposite to I lay trieste the unredeemed city of italy 's desire very clear against a background of hill through glass i could even distinguish the tram run in she street i could easily fancy she scarcely a mile away across that sheet of blue sunlit sea thus must she often have appear to italian fight and die by sea and land to reach she who remain ever just out of reach chapter vii a gramophone and a chaplain on the carso the battery move up to its new position on the edge of the carso on the night of July 25th the gun be draw by italian tractor it be a long business get the gun out of they gun pit as we have not much room for turn and a still longer one get they into the new pit after unhook the tractor down a steep slope and round two right-angle turn owe to we nearness to the front line no light could be use and the night be darker than usual for hour the gun detachment be at work with drag rope lower guide and haul and the monotonous cry that every siege gunner know so well on the rope -- together -- heave go echo round those rock till 2 be next morning \* \* \* \* \* this new position of ours be only three hundred yard from the austrian though we have between we and they the river vippacco and a high hill a spur of that on which the ruin monastery of s grado di merna stand the trench here run on either side of the vippacco a italian trench mortar battery have be here before we and it be say have be shell out but we gun pit blast out of the hillside be almost completely protect against hostile fire except perhaps from gun on s marco which might with a combination of good luck and good shooting have get we in enfilade only howitzer capable of employ high-angle fire could usefully occupy such a position and as it be we shell could not clear the crest except at pretty large elevation it result that we could not hit any target within a considerable distance of the austrian front line but this we be tell do not matter we be here we be inform for a special purpose and for action against distant target only there be a orchard on the flat just behind we gun a little oasis of fertility in that barren land and wooden cross mark the grave of some of the italian trench mortar gunner who have precede we italian field artillery be in position all around we and be firing a good deal by night for the first few night with they gun pop off all round and with blast operation in full swing a almost continuous echo travel round and round the stony hillside and make I dream that i be sleep beside a stormy sea breaking in endless wave on a rocky coast blast be go on all day and all night in this neighborhood one of we officer be walk one morning on the back of the carso out of view of the enemy and anticipate no danger save the stray shell which be always and everywhere a possibility in the war zone when suddenly the face of a italian bob up from behind a rock with the warning in english now shoot the mine and disappear again the englishman run for he life and take shelter behind the same rock and a few seconds later there be a heavy explosion fill the air with fly fragment unpleasantly jag we officer ' mess and sleep hut be about two hundred yard from the gun and a little higher up the hill just above one of the magnificent newly-made italian war road along which supply go up to hill 123 and 126 and the volconiac and dosso faitus just outside we hut and open on to the road be a broad natural terrace with a fine view backwards over the plain several time during we first week in this position the austrian shell a british battery at rupa about a mile in rear of we and a italian battery alongside it it be very hot and dry and they have be give away by the huge cloud of dust raise by the blast of they gun firing the austrian shell they with twelve-inch and nine-four-fives get magnificent shell burst which some of we photograph great column of brown-black smoke rise mountain high in the shape of prince of wale ' feather and hang for about ten minute in the still air but very little damage be do and after a short interval both battery open fire again from this terrace of ours we have fine view of fight in the air on August 2nd we see a austrian plane bring down by two italian who dive down upon he from above firing at he with machine gun as they sweep past he the austrian who be fly high gradually seem to lose he head and hesitate in what direction to fly then he begin to turn over and over recover for a moment but finally lose all control and come down nose first into he own trench just across the river another evening about ten o'clock a whole squadron of austrian plane come over fly in regular formation and signalling to one another with morse lamp they be go it appear to bomb gradisca they be heavily shell by the archy as they come over we and several fragment of shell fall on we terrace the night sky be full of starry shell-burst and a dozen of we searchlight fussily get busy then suddenly all we artillery as it seem begin to go off and for about five minute there be a deafening burst of fire from gun of all calibre and then all grow suddenly quiet again perhaps it be a raid perhaps only the fear of one one day a italian plane drop some booklet into the austrian trench and some be blow back into we own line they contain photograph of austrian prisoner of war in italian camp very contented apparently and explanation in german magyar and various slav tongue show man who yesterday be live from hour to hour in peril of death now wait happily and calmly in perfect safety for the war to end when they shall return to they home to embrace once more they wife and little child here you will be able to recognize many of you friend a good propaganda to induce desertion and surrender the italian generally have the mastery over the austrian in the air they machine and especially they caproni could always be distinguish from the austrian ' by the deeper hum of they engine venosta have a gramophone which play most evening after dinner on the terrace chiefly march and martial music and italian opera italy 's libyan war whatever else may be say of it have produce one magnificent march song a tripolus which deserve to live for ever fine too even on the gramophone be the march of the alpinus the march of the bersaglierus and the famous garibaldus 's hymn i meet a english doctor once who have hear this last play in rome on some great occasion with some of the old garibaldian veteran in they red shirt march in front of the band he have feel a lump in he throat that day he say when venosta 's gramophone play the italian encamp near by cluster round the edge of the terrace in obvious enjoyment and sometimes one or two would dash indignantly down the road to stop limber and cart which be make a rattle on the stone \* \* \* \* \* we mess be a great center for visitor both english and italian we be at this time the british battery in the most advanced and interesting position among we visitor especially on sunday be a chaplain whom i will call littleton who use to conduct we church parade in the british army and i believe in most other the principle of compulsory religious observance be still intermittently enforce when it do not interfere with the still more important business of fight i like littleton very much in many way but sometimes he infuriate I he be lunch with we one day and describe how for some month in france during some murderous fighting he be attach to a infantry battalion i have never in my life enjoy myself more he say than during those month i could not help ask what do you enjoy see the poor devil get hit i tell he afterwards that i know he do not really delight in spectacles of agony and bloodshed but that enjoy seem to I a unfortunate word to use on another occasion i attend in the capacity of orderly officer for the day one of littleton 's church parade and hear he preach it be clear that he be trouble by a suspicion that the war and the detail of its development have discredit in some mind some of the idea of which he be the professional exponent he make a brave struggle however against this tide of unreason god do not make thing too easy for we he explain he give we the opportunity and if we choose not to use they that be we fault a loving father set up a tremendously high standard for he son and judge he severely not in spite of but because of he love for he in god 's sight three or four year of war may be tremendously worth while then we sing a hymn i feel inclined to sing instead a song write by a soldier who be wound in france : -- the bishop tell we ` when the boy come back they will not be the same for they 'll have fight in a just cause : they lead the last attack on anti-christ they comrade ' blood have buy new right to breed a honorable race they have challenge death and dare he face to face ' ` we be none of we the same ' the boy reply for george lose both he leg and bill 's stone blind poor jim 's shot through the lung and like to die and bert 's go syphilitic you 'll not find a chap who serve there have not find _ some _ change ' and the bishop say ` the way of god be strange it be hard for such a limited intelligence as mine especially in this unending italian sunshine to imagine that it could seriously be worth while to burn down a whole real world in order to roast a probably imaginary pig i find it very hard to believe with the chaplain that the war be purify everyone 's character and i be particularly sceptical as regard some of the elderly non-combatant who be unable to realize at first hand the glory of the great adventure chapter viii a front line reconnaissance every day in we group some officer carry out a front line reconnaissance this officer be choose in rotation from the group headquarters and the various battery colonel raven we group commander often carry out these reconnaissance himself of all british officer at this time serve in italy he have i think the greatest understanding of the italian he have travel in italy in peace-time and have study italian history he fully appreciate the difficulty against which the italian army have to contend and its military achievement in spite of they he enjoy social intercourse with italian and he invariable and slightly elaborate courtesy be in a englishman remarkable for as mazzinus once say a englishman 's friendship when once secure hold very firm but it be manifest more by deed than by word but colonel raven have the gift of sympathetic imagination and he have also in full measure the ally spirit the purpose of these reconnaissance be twofold : first to report on matter of military importance any notable activity by the enemy the direction and nature of hostile fire upon we trench the effect of we own fire when not otherwise ascertainable the precise position on the map especially after any action of we own and of the enemy 's line include sap advance post and the like second to maintain a real contact and spirit of comradeship with the italian infantry and to seek to give they confidence in the efficiency and promptitude of british artillery support under the first head valuable information be frequently bring back and under the second i believe that so far at least as we group be concern the personal relation between the artillery and the infantry be exceptionally good hardly ever do we receive complaint that we gun be firing short though such complaint be often make and often quite groundlessly when the infantry lack confidence in the artillery behind they at one time thin-skinned person among we use to complain that italian who pass they on the road use to call out imboscato imboscato be a term very frankly use in the italian army generally though not necessarily as a term of reproach it correspond with the french embusqué one who shelter in a wood for which we in english have no precise equivalent it be use by a italian to indicate one who run or be think to run less risk of death than the speaker it be chiefly use of man in the non-combatant service or in post well behind the fight front include the higher staff and especially the junior rank attendant on they it be use also in jest by italian patrol go out at night into no man 's land of they comrade whom they leave behind in the front line trench personally i be never call a imboscato nor be any of my brother gunner except once or twice when ride in side-car or motor mile in rear of we gun and to infantry march along dusty road under a italian sun there be something very irritating in a motor car dash past with its occupant recline in easy position its siren hideously shriek and blind dust-cloud rise in its wake german propaganda be insidiously active in italy throughout the war and spread many lie story with the object of discrediting the british among these be one the detail of which do not matter now concern the fact that only british artillery and no british infantry have at that time be send to italy we reconnaissance involve we visible and daily presence among the gallant succession of italian brigade who hold the blood-stained line on the carso and across the valley of the vippacco be the most fitting reply which we could make to german propaganda \* \* \* \* \* i make my first front line reconnaissance on July 27th two day after we have move forward to we new battery position that day i visit the trench on the volconiac start in the early afternoon and get back at nightfall i take with I as a guide a young italian gunner a neapolitan by birth who have be a waiter in a italian restaurant in new york before the war he have be in the austrian offensive of 1916 in the trentino where all the gun of he battery have be lose and nearly all he comrade kill or capture from the battery position we follow the road behind hill 123 up a glorious valley whose side be thickly wood with pine gradually thin under the destruction work by austrian shell fire and the italian military need for timber the only other vegetation here be a little coarse grass on the lee side of hill 123 sheltered from austrian fire be a whole village of wooden hut admirably construct capable of housing several battalion at the head of the valley the road a good example of the war work of the italian engineer turn sharply up the hillside secure tolerable gradient by means of constant zigzag -- tolerable that be to say for man on foot and for pack mule for wheel transport could not proceed beyond this point it be a steep climb and i perspire most visibly right through my thin tunic three-quarter of the way up we stop and get a drink of water from the infantryman in charge of the water barrel there be no spring or stream on the volconiac or on dosso faitus all water have to be pump up from below through pipe and at the point where we rest water barrel be be continually fill from the pipe and then haul on by hand on sleigh for the remainder of the ascent water be also carry up from this point by individual soldier in the fiaschus or glass bottle encase in plaited straw in which italian wine be sell just below the crest we enter the trench which be hold at this time by the florence brigade the construction of these trench be very interesting they be all blast in the rock and many drilling machine be at work as i pass along they increase the number of _ caverne _ or dug-out and deepen those already in existence here and there where the trench be rather shallow they be build up with loose rock and sandbag fill with stone one of my object be to get a view of the austrian trench and barb wire on the tamburo in order to observe from closer quarter than be possible from any of we op 's the effect of we recent bombardment and to verify or disprove a report that certain new defensive work be be construct by the enemy at night we own trench here be on a higher level than the enemy 's and the bottom of the valley between the tamburo and this part of the volconiac be in no man 's land as be a relatively short slope on the tamburo and a relatively long slope on the volconiac the latter slope be very steep but thickly clothe with pine most of which be now shatter by shell fire into mere dead stump even these stump however make it difficult to get a uninterrupted view of the tamburo and i have to go some mile along the trench gaze through numerous peephole before i reach a point from which i could satisfy myself that we bombardment have be effective and that the report new work be indeed real have get this information i smoked a pipe and talk with a italian company commander in a rocky dug-out and then start to return thing be quiet on this sector of the front that afternoon though italian field gun be burst shrapnel from time to time over the tamburo as i go along the trench i be several time greet by italian who have be in america hullo john how be you how d'you like this dam country this type bring back with it across the atlantic the frank almost brutal familiarity of a new and democratic civilisation it contrast oddly with the quieter way of those italian who have live all they life in italy amid one of the oldest and most mature civilisation of the world on we way down the hill we pass a seemingly endless string of pack mule come up laden with food and ammunition always at evening this wonderful system of supply be visibly work triumph over tremendous natural difficulty we pass too a party of about fifty man haul up on long rope a heavy drilling engine the sort of labor of which british fatigue party have luckily for themselves no experience mist come down from the mountain as we descend and rainstorm threaten but do not break chapter ix a evening at gorizium on the first day in August i have be do some observation at s andrea in the afternoon and this duty over i get permission to walk into gorizium and visit the section of the british red cross station there several of whose member i know it be a longer walk than one would think for s andrea be practically a southern suburb of gorizium which however straggle over a large area of country the railway bridge across the isonzo be break down by shell fire and so be two other bridge -- all three of stone -- but these could be soon repair if we make a big advance it would be waste labor to repair they now for the austrian would only break they down again the italian have run up a low broad wooden bridge sheltered from austrian view behind one of the broken stone bridge from time to time the austrian hit this bridge and then the italian quickly make it good again to be able to cross the isonzo at this point be a convenience but not a military necessity for all movement of troops and supplies into gorizium can be carry out on the left bank of the river and across bridge some mile further down-stream the suburb of the town be badly knock about but the center be not at this time much damaged gorizium lie in a salient of the hill with the austrian look down upon it from the top of most of they but still hope to win it back they do not shell it heavily or often there be special reason too for they forbearance for gorizium be a sort of austrian cheltenham whither austrian officer retire in large number to pass they last year in villa which they take over from one another 's widow so the austrian officer class have a sort of vested interest in the preservation of the place so also have certain hebrew bank in vienna which hold mortgage on a great part of the land in and around the city which just before the war be be rapidly develop as a fashionable spa it be a well lay out town with large public garden and good building architecturally very like the larger italian town on the other side of the old frontier udine for example but with a certain element of a heavier and more _ rococo _ style the viennese there be still a fairly large civilian population in the town and one restaurant still keep open i find the british red cross in the via ponte isonzo in what have once be a big boarding-house with a large untidy garden behind most of those station there be motor ambulance driver about twenty in number some too old to fight some reject for health some quaker unwilling to kill but willing to risk they own life on behalf of the wounded other again boy under military age who go as soon as they can to the navy or the fly corps it be brave and nervous work they do drive ambulance in the dark without light and under fire after dinner i sit out in the garden in the twilight and talk with a old acquaintance of mine who have have a large share in the organization and daily work of the british red cross in italy the italian he say be really begin to feel they foot as a united nation in this war man of all class from all part of italy be meeting and mix with one another as they have never do before and the old _ regionalismo _ be be rapidly undermine he himself have almost cease to think critically of the past or speculatively of the future but just live and work in the present as to the state of the world after the war he be very confident provide we go on fight long enough nothing that happen at home be of great importance all the pressure be on the front everything be look now in the direction of democracy even russia in the long run unconquerable have get she good out of the war already whatever misery and transitory anarchy she may have yet to undergo in england and elsewhere many of the present political leader be vile but we shall all know what we want the world to look like and to _ be _ like after the war and new leader will arise and lead we when the survivor of we smitten generation have grow old there must be a peace of heart as well as a peace of arm between the young of all land but we generation can never make personal friendship again with german see that they have kill nearly all those who matter most to we and that we have to spend the rest of we life without they \* \* \* \* \* he motor I back to the vippacco bridge at rubbium when next i hear of he it be a month later at the height of the italian offensive he have be severely wound on the bainsizza plateau the british red cross do splendid work in italy and make a big contribution to anglo-italian friendship and understand they begin they operation in italy in September 1915 and be thus the first englishman to show the flag on the italian front thousand of italian will gratefully and affectionately remember they till the end of they life more even than the british fighting troops who come after they the british red cross will remain a historic legend in italy in the day to come chapter x a cemetery at versa i be at versa as i have already say from the 2nd to the 10th of August to supervise a party work on the hospital i walk one evening down the village street where in the light of the sunset a italian military band be play to a mixed crowd of soldier and civilian just outside the village i come to the gate of a cemetery where six tall cypress stand like sentinel on guard over the grave of many hundred of italian dead this be at first a civilian graveyard but all the dead have italian name except one kirschner and even he be call giuseppe and have a italian inscription on he tombstone for this be italia redenta in this one little corner of which a great company of italian youth have already lay down they life and now the grave in long straight row have fill one newly add field and begin to flow across a second and soon from the field hospital in the village more dead will come here as in we war graveyard in france no religious dogma or supernatural hope intrude upon the little wooden cross on these for the most part you can read only the bare conventional attribute of each little handful of dust which have pass through its quiver agony into the still sleep of decay -- its name and regiment its civilian home the place and date of its death a few have more than this here lie the two brother bellina in one grave with a cross at they head and another rougher and larger at they foot announce simply i due fratellus the two brother and here be a tombstone engrave with a anchor for one who very early in the war be hit while ford the isonzo in face of the enemy 's fire al pontiere guazzaro giuseppe che valorosamente sfidando le infide acque dell ' isonzo cadeva colpito dal piombo nemico 25 giugno 1915 -lrb- 1 -rrb- and here be another inscription typical of that latin sense of comradeship which be more articulate though not necessarily more profound than ours sottotenente arcangelus antonio con commossa memorium the officer of he battery il loro orgoglio infinite quì eternano in deeply move remembrance they here place upon eternal record they infinite pride in he it be poor stuff in english but a vivid and quite natural tribute in italian -lrb- footnote 1 : to the sapper giuseppe guazzaro who fall while bravely defy the treacherous water of the isonzo strike down by a enemy bullet 25th June 1915 -rrb- where the sun go down the sky be a sea of rise red and golden green stud with little long island of dark cloud and on the edge of this sea the evening star twinkle like a tiny illumined boat dance a blaze of light upon the wave to left and right the cloudbank be a deep purple blue fast fading into the dim warm gray of a italian night east and north the mountain that bind the plain silent witness of italy 's great struggle be hide in the dusk and the cypress sentinel stand up sharp and black against the darken sky the band have cease to play and one hear only the chirp of grasshopper and across a orchard the soft sound of italian speech and the distant song of two soldier in the village street but the warm air which just now be throb with a military march seem to be throb still with a ache longing that happier day may come swiftly to this land of beauty and pain so that the sacrifice of all these dead shall not be wholly waste \* \* \* \* \* not many mile away as the sun be set a austrian shell burst in a british battery and three hour later through the dark under faint star a ambulance lorry bring to we the body of four british gunner whose dust will mingle with italian dust under italian sky for ever chapter xi udine i first saw udine on the 5th of August i be still on duty at versa but the conversation in the ramc mess bore I particularly at meal it be all sputum and latrine gas gangrene and the relative seniority of the doctor one to another there be nothing to keep I at versa for my gunner fatigue party do not in truth need any supervision so i determine to go to udine i start walk about 10 be it be not too hot i walk about three mile and then pick up a lorry one can generally get a ride on a italian lorry if there be any room by wave one 's stick at the driver shout out one 's destination and look agreeable this one take I to mogaredo and then stop i then walk another three mile to a point near trevignano here i be within ten mile of udine and pick up another lorry which take I the rest of the way it be drive by a triestino who see what be come have leave the unredeemed city just before italy declare war he face be very sad and he make a gesture of weep draw he finger downward from he eye across he cheek though he eye be dry how long he ask how long before trieste will be free we approach udine through a long avenue of plane tree plant under napoleon it be a gay little town with arcaded street cluster round a hill on the top of which stand a castello with a memorial tower to the martyr of 1848 and on the hill slope public garden full of cypress udine be at this time a nest of british newspaper correspondent i begin to make they acquaintance in the afternoon first a anglo-italian lady from rome whom i meet sit out behind the hotel grande d'italia under the shade of tree she be evidently something of a figure here and receive several caller all lady of udine as we sit drinking coffee one of these on learn that i be a gunner take out a locket and hand it to I it contain a picture of a marvellously handsome boy it be she eldest son kill three month before in cadore a lieutenant in a mountain battery he be only nineteen he mother begin to weep as she hand I the locket and it be the lady from rome who tell I these thing then the mother cry between she sob e troppo crudele la guerra and as i hand the locket back i thought of the unmarried childless parson in khaki who consider that three or four year of war may be tremendously worth while \* \* \* \* \* later i meet and dine with two of the male correspondent of the london press conversation in the sense of a mere flow of talk be never difficult with newspaper man they be among the most articulate of the british although much that they articulate be only patter these two have plenty of miscellaneous information much of which i receive in a sceptical spirit but i learn some interesting fact which i verify from other source later on chief of these be the effect produce upon young italy by the personal gallantry of the poet d'annunzio who when he be not fly at the head of the italian bombing plane against polum be make fiery oration to the infantry in the front line and distributing among they little tricolor flag bear he own autograph have talk till midnight i find a bedroom at the croce malta where i sleep for four hour then i get up and dress and walk to the railway station where i drink coffee and eat biscuit a train be due to leave for palmanova the nearest station to versa at 530 be as i wait for it on the platform i look out at the station light a dull orange under they dark shades and at the red signal beyond four in a vertical line and beyond again at the dim outline of house and dark tree against a sky at first a very deep dark blue but slowly light up with the beginning of the dawn the train do not start till nearly seven by this time it be quite light and the sun have turn the distant cadore into a ridge of pink gray marble very sharply outline against the morning sky and in the middle distance just across the maize field which run beside the railway track rise the _ campanile _ of some little village of friulus like a stick of shine alabaster chapter xii the british and the italian soldier the send of ten british battery to italy have something more than a military significance otherwise the thing be hardly worth do it be evident that here be a international gesture a effort be be make to promote a real anglo-italian understanding to substitute for those misty and unreal personification -- england to a italian italy to a englishman -- real personal knowledge and a sense of individual comradeship in a great cause we task in short be not only to fight but also to fraternise but would we fraternise successfully for it have be say not without some truth that england be a island and every englishman be a island and in the early day i be doubtful what sort of personal effect we should produce and what sort of personal impression we man would bring away when i get back to the battery from versa i begin to take stock of my own impression so far and to notice in the letter which i have to censor the drift of general opinion it be surprisingly satisfactory some of these italian write one gunner be the finest fellow you could wish to meet we man get on very well with they the italian write another be very good soldier and nice chap we get on well together the other night write a third i be out lay telephone wire in a graveyard we see some italian soldier carry a tombstone for they lieutenant who have recently be kill the italian look after they grave very well a sergeant who have spend most of he life in england ask we in and give we some coffee and cognac which be jolly acceptable he ask if we have any old english papers as he be forget all he english as he have be away from england for five year and a fourth write the great majority of these italian have be in different part of america -lrb- this of course be a wild exaggeration -rrb- they be very delighted to have a chat in fact i think the italian people be very sociable nearly all the boy can begin to make themselves understand these tribute be obviously sincere they occur in the midst of good-natured grumble about the heat and the monotony of macaroni and rice and stew and of request for more fag and of hope that this business will soon be over the fact that so many italian have live in england and america can speak english and know something of we and we way account for much for a foreign language be the great barrier reef against the voyage of ordinary people towards international understanding and the country count for something too its natural obstacle compel admiration for a army which have achieve so much in spite of they and i be sure that no british gunner however inarticulate who have serve in italy and especially those young fellow who when war break out stand only on the threshold of they manhood with they mind still wide open for new impression have not feel some sort of secret thrill at the astounding and incomparable beauty of this country the very contemplation of which sometimes bring one near to weep i recall for instance a tough old sergeant major with twenty-seven year ' service with we artillery all over the world a utterly unromantic person he and i be bring back my work party on the 10th of August from versa to rubbia in a lorry the man be sing loudly and greet a italian sentry on peteano bridge with cheerful cry of buona serum johnny and the sergeant major suddenly observe to I that this must be a fine country in peace-time and go on to praise the mountain and the river and the tree especially the cypress and the surface of the road and some town behind the line udine i think which be very pretty and quite all right the italian too be all right which from he be most high praise and then as though half ashamed of have say so much he add rather hastily but there be nothing to touch the old country after all i think i shall settle down there when this war 's over i have have about enough of foreign part and what do the italian think of we i wonder i only know that they treat we always with great friendliness and show great interest in we gun and all we doings so the international gesture have i think begin already to succeed and its success will grow for those british grave which we shall leave behind we -- some be dig and fill already -- will tell they own story to the future they will be fact if only tiny fact both in british and italian history and far on in summer that we shall not see bath in the warm brilliance of italian sunshine they will bear witness to anglo-italian comradeship across the year chapter xiii i join the first british battery in italy on the 15th of August arrive a operation order indicate we target in the first and second phase of the great italian offensive which have be long expect and also the objective of the infantry the day on which the offensive be to begin be not yet announce six more british siege battery give we now three british heavy artillery group have arrive on the carso and in the monfalcone sector about a fortnight before the french too have send a number of heavy battery which be in position on monte sabotino and elsewhere north of the vippacco but the counsel of wise man have be disregard and no french or british infantry no complete ally army corps have be send to the italian front where a big military success could have be more easily obtain and would have have greater military and political result at this time than anywhere else on this day i walk to and from s andrea return to the battery in the evening greatly perspire but with a enormous appetite large number of infantry be go up the vallone and the volconiac in the dusk italian infantry march in two on either side of a road not in fours on one side as ours do the austrian shell a good deal this evening and put a lot of gas shell into merna \* \* \* \* \* on the 17th i be transfer to another battery it be the eve of the offensive and my new battery be a officer short while my old battery be again at full strength the officer who have be in hospital wound when i arrive in italy have now return i join my new battery about midday they be in position on the vippacco close to the former position of my old battery i be destine to stay with they for seventeen month till after the war be win and i come to identify myself very completely with they and to be proud to be one of they this have be the first of all the british battery to come into action in italy and have fire the first british shell against austrium the major in command have the reputation of be the most efficient british battery commander in italy and so far as my experience of other go he deserve it he be a regular soldier and have serve with a mountain battery in indium a service which require and breed a power of quick decision by no means universal among garrison gunner of the regular army personally he be a most delightful man at he best a very amusing talker a pleasant companion and a excellent commanding officer few officer whom i have meet take as much thought and trouble as he for the material welfare of he man from he junior officer he combine a demand for high efficiency with a sometimes wonderful solicitude for they comfort health and peace of mind he never ask any of we to do more or even as much as he do willingly himself and if anything go wrong in the battery which it seldom do he never hesitate in deal with higher authority to take all the blame he have be twice wound already once on the somme and again in the italian may offensive later on he be wound a third time captain jeune the second-in-command be also a regular but very young in mind and manner he be older than he year and he know he work as a military professional extremely well some find he truculent but he never display any truculence to I on my arrival i become senior subaltern of the battery the three junior subaltern darrell leary and winterton provide a variety of companionship darrell be a man of business a most capable officer a good mess secretary and very easy to get on with leary be a dark-haired irishman who have originate in the county limerick he be a good mathematician but in conversation be apt to be long-winded and have a wonderful capacity for make a simple matter appear complex he have be by turn a civil engineer and a actor and have a fine singing voice as a officer he be infinitely laborious and conscientious but with a queer disconcerting streak of irish unaccountability one never quite know what he would do if leave alone in charge of anything winterton be a good-looking boy who would have go up to cambridge in 1915 if there have be no war instead he enlist in the horse artillery become a corporal and go to the dardanelle as a despatch rider have spend several month in hospital at malta and nearly die of dysentery he come back to england and be give a artillery commission he be a gallant youth but just a little casual with rather a music-hall mind but good company if one be not leave alone with he too long there be also attach to the battery at this time a italian artillery officer whom i will call manzonus a southerner small and very dark he have teach himself to speak excellent english though he have never be in england he be a intelligent observer and a amusing companion and we become great friend the personnel of the battery be splendid and i do not believe that in any other battery the spirit of the man be better nor the personal relation between officer and man on a sounder and healthier footing than with we some battery commander proceed on the principle that even the most experienced nco can not be trust to perform the simplest duty except under the eye of a officer however junior the battery in this case become helplessly dependent on the officer if they go out of action so do the whole battery other battery commander of whom my new major be one proceed on the principle that as many nco 's as possible should be able to do a officer 's work so that the battery should be able to continue in action without any officer at all if necessary and also be able to adapt itself readily to a sudden change from stagnant to open warfare this principle be universally apply in the french artillery where apart from its evident wisdom it have be necessitate by the great shortage of officer my own major use to train all we best nco 's with this object in view and when satisfy of they competence use to give they in normal time considerable responsibility in the working of the battery in action the result be that we have as capable and reliable a set of number one and bca 's as could be find anywhere -lrb- 1 -rrb- the man thoroughly appreciate the amount of trust repose in they and never fail we furthermore when i join the battery there be hardly a man who be not a trained specialist either as a signaller gunlayer or bca -lrb- footnote 1 : a number one be the sergeant or other nco in charge of a gun and its detachment when in action a bca -lrb- or battery commander 's assistant -rrb- assist the officer on duty in the command post in locate point on the map in make numerical calculation and in other miscellaneous duty -rrb- seventeen month later only the major leary and myself out of the officer in the battery when i join still remain with it and death wound sickness promotion and commission from the rank have take from we many of we best nco 's and man but through all the varied experience of those long month there have be a continuity of tradition and a unchanging spirit we be still for I and for many the first british battery in italy part iii the italian summer offensive 1917 chapter xiv the offensive open on the 18th of August i get up at half-past four in the morning there be a mist in the air which clear away as the day grow warmer the big bombardment in what the journalist call the twelfth battle of the isonzo begin at six o'clock and go on continuously all day once the thing be start i have little to do except to change occasionally the rate of fire -- _ lento _ _ normale _ _ vivace _ _ celere _ and _ double vivace _ by turn the first part of the day i be in charge of the right section of the battery and sit most of the time on a wooden bench at a table under a tarpaulin among the acacia by my side sit a telephonist in communication with the battery command post some four hundred yard away to the leave beyond the left section my only other apparatus be a megaphone a notebook and pencil and a pipe occasionally i would go and stand by one of the gun to check the gun-laying and to see that the gun be recoil and come up again without undue violence one have also to guard against a dust cloud be raise by the blast of the gun thus give away we position to the enemy to prevent this we form a chain of man every half hour to pass water-bucket from hand to hand from the river just behind we down the sunken road to lay the dust in and around the gun pit but under a italian August sun the ground soon grow parched and dusty again the austrian do not shell much till the evening when they nearly hit we mess and shell-shock a man of another battery in the road close by but the italian bombardment all day be very heavy and we gun and theirs be to go on firing all night just before midnight i relieve the major in the command post and he and the rest of the officer go to bed so i sit there wakefully among the acacia await any sudden order from the group to switch or lift to new target or to vary the rate of fire every now and then i take a walk round the battery to see that all be work correctly and every hour the nco 's in charge of each gun bring in they fire tube to the command post and report how many round have be fire in the precede hour and how many tube misfire \* \* \* \* \* it be a clear starlight night up above the multitudinous flash of british and italian gun at close quarter these flash be blindingly bright and fling up shower of red spark in the interval of a few seconds between flash if one stand with one 's eye fix on the gun the star seem blot out in a utterly black darkness a long bombardment be one of the most boring thing in the world by reason of its intense monotony and because in a queer half-unconscious way it begin after many hour very slightly to fray the nerve listen and watch in the small hour and from time to time direct i find myself able with almost discreditable elastic-mindedness to call up at will any of the aspect of modern war -- its utter and inherent wickedness its artistic and scientific majesty its occasional moral justification against the oppressor its ultimate blank insanity but i would not have like to be a austrian yesterday or this morning the italian infantry attack on we sector at 530 be there be a tremendous crescendo of gunfire at this time the major relieved I in the command post at 5 o'clock and urge I to go to bed but i do not feel inclined to sleep instead i go up about 6 o'clock through pec village to a op on a hillside beyond to see what could be see but all the front be hide in a thick mist make thicker by the smoke shot through with innumerable momentary flash all round we thousand of gun be go off fill the air with a deafening and continuous roar a telephonist be with I who have be through a good deal of the somme fighting and have find the italian front in time of lull a little uneventful but this morning he be full of appreciation this be something like it be not it sir he say be able to see nothing i go back to bed for some hour and spend the afternoon at a battery op which have be specially arrange for this offensive in a italian reserve trench just off the pec-merna road \* \* \* \* \* the bombardment continue through the 19th and 20th and 21st of August now with gun firing independently now with salvo or round of battery fire now with individual gun be range afresh from some op with hardly a hour 's interval of silence how little the individual soldier know of what be happen at these time conflict rumor of vary credibility come in to we during those three day rumor of big advance both to the north and to the south but on we own sector we know that no permanent advance have be make for we be still firing a good deal on old zone 15 one of we first day 's target and on that damned hill 464 the most important of the first objective of the infantry before this offensive begin i have sleep in a hut above ground but the major have now insist that i should sleep in a small dug-out half-way up a steep bank at the bottom of which we mess hut stand in a orchard stretch down to the river bank the austrian shell we intermittently but without do any damage in the small hour of the 21st i be doze in my dug-out where i have be read lowe dickinson 's _ choice before we _ a congenial book at such a time with nine-tenth of which i be in complete agreement i then hear a series of austrian 42 's come sailing over my dug-out and burst just at the foot of the bank they make miserable burst in the soft earth so small as to make I suspect gas shell for a moment but this suspicion do not worry I for no one be sleep at the bottom and gas can not run uphill next morning i find a shell hole fifteen yard from the mess hut another on the path and several other among the tree they be double event with a shrapnel and time fuse head and a high explosive and percussion fuse tail but neither head nor tail have be of much effect there be very heavy firing that morning but less in the afternoon great gloom prevail on we sector where we be back again in most of we first position the infantry be report to be unable to make headway against machine gun on hill 464 and the tamburo to the south on the carso the ruin of the village of selo have be take but not much else but though we do not know it then the italian army in those first three day have win magnificent success to the north of we chapter xv we switch we gun northward on the 22nd of August we get for the first time definite news of the italian advance on the bainsizza plateau the day be rather hotter than usual and on we own sector there be still no appreciable progress hill 464 have be win and lose three time since yesterday morning and to the south of it hill 368 also have be win and lose again up there it must be a vain and shocking shambles it be claim for cadorna 's communiqués i think justly that at this time no other be more moderate and truthful no point be claim as win until it be not merely win but securely hold the italian battery beside we be move north that night to the tolmino sector and next day we left section be to move out into a position in the open in order to switch north and shell s marco which we could not reach from we present gun pit s marco be north of the vippacco be in the area of the italian second army command by capello which have be perform the great feat of these last day it be clear that for the moment the main italian effort be be make to the north indeed by the 24th all the british gun of we group be point north-eastward firing at s marco and neighbouring target british casualty and those of the italian heavy artillery have be very light the austrian have concentrate practically all he artillery fire in addition to he machine gun on the italian infantry amongst whom there have be hideous slaughter but in the early morning of the 23rd a austrian shell kill a sergeant and two man in one of we battery the sergeant be tear into several piece one of which land on the top of the officer ' mess and another in a gun pit 150 yard away one of he leg could not be find so they have to bury what they could a incomplete set of tear fragment but three or four day later the smell of the lose limb come drift down a ravine above they gun and follow the scent they find it black with fly among the stone in my old battery too four hundred cartridge go up with a direct hit and the austrian then shell the smoke with unpleasant effect a twelve-inch shell also burst very close to the battery 's mess kill a number of italian telephonist next door throughout these day period of very heavy firing alternate with period of comparative quiet \* \* \* \* \* on the 25th a party of nearly thirty british officer and man a procession of two car three side-car and twelve motor bicycle go up podgora hill the italian second army to whom we be stranger watch we with interest as we go past in a cloud of dust on the top of podgora hill be a series of op 's known collectively as marium op hollow out of the rock approach through rock passage and in front a wide rocky platform command a splendid panorama at we foot be a precipitous descent clothe with acacia at the bottom podgora with its gut factory then the broad stream of the isonzo and gorizium on the further side to the left we could see the isonzo wind down out of the mountain between monte sabotino and monte santo the latter hiding from we sight the bainsizza plateau in the center of we view rise the great mass of san gabriele italian patrol be out on its southern slope clearly visible through field-glass then santa catarina and the long low brown hillside of san marco away to the right the flat land of the isonzo and vippacco valley and beyond these again the northern ridge of the carso from dosso faitus to the stoll beautifully visible on the right everything seem quiet but there be tremendous ally shell of san gabriele santa catarina and san marco french gunner also be here with fifteen-inch gun firing on san marco and two of they officer be at marium op that day it be symbolic that from this height for the first time on the italian front gunner of the three western ally be look out eastward together toward the promised land the enemy trench on san marco lay out of view behind the crest and we registration point a white house on the top of the ridge be almost completely blow away by a big french shell while we be watch and wait we turn to fire we see another shell burst in the isonzo just above gorizium cause a huge waterspout colonel canale arrive while we be firing he white glove be a little soil and he seem rather worried and more serious than usual he be disappoint at the stoppage of the offensive on the carso chapter xvi the fall of monte santo even when we gun be turn against san marco we continue to man sant ' andrea op for one could get good general observation to the northward from the other side of the ruin house which be the old op and most of the trench on san marco be invisible except from aeroplane i spend the night there several time during the August offensive watch by turn with one of we bombardier to whom i explain that war be make by small group of wicked man generally also rich sit and plan in secret i propose to he the need to shell such group while they be yet form with the shrapnel of public opinion it be also at sant ' andrea that i meet a young lieutenant of italian field artillery a sardinian from cagliari he have still the face of a child and he have too that perfect self-possession and that wonderful soft charm which be so often find together in the italian youth i think of he often with affection and with a eager hope that he pass unharmed through all the vicissitude which be to follow he and i spend many hour together watch those bloody memorable hill i meet he first on the 24th of August and we drink a bottle of vermouth together and discuss with enthusiasm many subject we even work out in detail a scheme for the interchange of student for period of a year at a time between italian and british university after the war we then turn to modern history and i notice that he do not respond as much as i have expect to the name of garibaldus he hold the historical theory that broadly speak there be no really great man but only lucky one he put forward in support of this view the distribution of death wound and decoration in this war this theory of history have in it larger element of wholesomeness and truth than have for instance the pernicious bombast of carlyle i tell my sardinian friend that i have once hear it say by a most learn man that if rousseau have never live the world would not look very different to-day except that probably there would be no negro republic in the island of haitus this say pleased he and he be incline to think it plausible he tell I that day that monte santo be report take but the news be not yet sure \* \* \* \* \* i see he again three day later and by then all the world know that monte santo have fall for cadorna in he communiqué of the 25th have cry : since yesterday we tricolor have be wave from the summit of monte santo already we could see the flash of italian field gun in action near the summit all day i be buoyant exhilarated and as absorb in the war as any journalist victory have a intoxicating quality in this bright clear atmosphere and among these mountain which it have perhaps nowhere else all day there seem to be in the air a strange thrill which at evening seem to grow into a great throbbing triumph song of the hero -- incomparable italian live and dead the emotion of it become almost unbearable we tricolor be wave from the summit of monte santo here on the night of the 26th there occur a scene wonderfully almost incredibly dramatic the moon be rise shell pass whistle overhead some come from beyond the isonzo toward the ternova plateau other in the opposite direction from ternova rifle shot ring out from beneath monte santo along the slope of san gabriele where the italian and austrian line be very close together where no word on either side might be speak above a whisper suddenly there crash out from the gloom the opening bar of the marcium reale play with tremendous _ élan _ by a military band the music come from monte santo on the summit of the conquer mountain the night after its conquest a italian band be play amid the broken ruin of the convent stand around the firmly plant italian flag it be the divisional band of the four regiment which have storm these height on the flank of the mountain along the new line in the valley beneath along the trench half-way up san gabriele italian soldier raise a cry of startled joy below the peak a italian regiment hold the line within forty yard of the enemy crouch low in the shallow trench they colonel leap to he foot and he voice ring out soldier to you foot attention all along the trench the soldier with a swift thrill of emotion spring to they foot then again the colonel cry my soldier let we cry aloud in the face of the enemy ` long live italy long live the king long live the infantry ' loud and long come the cheer echo and re-echo from the rock take up and repeat by other who hear they first near at hand then far away echo and spread through the night like the swell wave of a great sea the austrian open fire on monte santo but the music still go on the marcium reale be finish but now in turn the hymn of garibaldus and the hymn of mameli historic battle song of italian liberty peal forth to the star loud above the bursting of the shell and many italian eye from which the atrocious suffering of this war have never yet draw tear weep with a proud triumphant joy and as the last note die away upon the night air a great storm of cheer break forth afresh from the italian line the moon be now ride high in the heaven and every mountain top see from below be outline with a sharp-cut edge against the sky four day after not far from this same spot general capello the commander of the italian second army decorate with the silver medal for valor some of the hero of the great victory among these be a civilian a man over military age it be toscanini italy 's most famous musical conductor it be he who charge with the organization of concert for the troops have find himself in this sector of the front when monte santo fall and hear the news have demand and obtain permission to climb the conquer mountain he reach the summit on the evening of the 26th and by a strange chance find he way among the rock and the ruin of the convent to the place where the band be play he presence have upon the musician the same effect which the presence of a great general have upon faithful troops they crowd round he fire with a wild enthusiasm then toscaninus take command of what surely be one of the strangest concert in the world play in the moonlight in a hour of glory on a mountain top which to the italian have become a almost legendary name to a audience of two contend army amid the rattle of machine gun the rumble of cannon and the crash of explode shell \* \* \* \* \* we tricolor be wave from the summit of monte santo if the soul of poet be immortal and know what still pass in this world be sure that the soul of swinburne sing again to-day from hell or heaven the song of the standard this be thy banner thy gonfalon fair in the front of thy fight red from the heart that be pierce for thee white as thy mountain be white green as the spring of thy soul everlasting whose life-blood be light take to thy bosom thy banner a fair bird fit for the nest feathered for flight into sunrise or sunset for eastward or west fledge for the flight everlasting but hold yet warm to thy breast gather it close to thee song-bird or storm-bearer eagle or dive lift it to sunward a beacon beneath to the beacon above green as we hope in it white as we faith in it red as we love chapter xvii the conquest of the bainsizza plateau the italian advance on the middle isonzo in the early day of the August offensive reach a depth of six mile on a front of eleven mile the italian have sweep across the bainsizza plateau and have gain observation and command though not possession of the valley of chiapovano the main austrian line of communication and supply in this sector this advance and the resumption of the war of movement raise for the moment tremendous expectation which be destine alas to die away without fulfilment the passage of the isonzo here a deep cleft in the mountain from plava to above canale have be accomplish by the combined skill and valor of infantry artillery and engineer the preliminary work of the engineer in roadmaking on the western side of the river have be as always worthy of the highest praise a great mass of bridge material have have to be accumulate in the valley alongside camouflage road the austrian must have be on they guard but it seem probable that they do not expect a big attack to be make here for they be fully conscious of the natural strength of they position first to cross the river on the night of the attack be boat carry engineer and detachment of arditus as they cross the river gorge be full of mist and they be not detect but when the work of bridge begin and sound of hammer and the drag of plank into position could be clearly hear suddenly all along the further bank the austrian machine gun begin to spit fire and red rocket go up call for the artillery barrage many boat be hit and sink and the bridge detachment suffer severe casualty one bridge half build be set on fire and one could see dark shadow light up by the glare amid the darkness dart forward to extinguish the flame fourteen bridge be throw across under heavy fire and as the infantry begin to cross platoon after platoon the austrian machine gunner fire at the sound of they footstep and many italian fall especially officer lead they man but the cross go on and when dawn break the attacker have a firm footing on the left bank of the river they sweep round the flank of those machine gun which have not yet be put out of action and make use of the subterranean passage which the enemy have pierce in the cliff for sheltered communication between the higher and the lower level of the mountain begin to pour forth upon the crest of the ridge which overlook the river then as the advance continue the austrian right wing above canale give way in confusion and the italian press forward on to the bainsizza plateau but they difficulty be tremendous when they leave the valley of the isonzo behind they they enter a waterless land without spring for some four mile in the early stage of the battle all water for the troops have to be bring up by mule and likewise all food ammunition and medical supplies until the engineer could get to work with road-building on the left bank of the river the bainsizza plateau itself lie amid a mass of barren mountain contain wood pasture spring small village a few road and many track the italian sweep over it on the 21st and 22nd of August but soon find themselves once more in difficult country in the day that follow the advance be slower and more spasmodic but it still continue by the 27th 25000 austrian prisoner have be take together with a great quantity of material and several whole austrian division have cease to exist it have be a wonderful feat of arm finely conceive by the staff magnificently execute by the rank and file it open out a great vista of new possibility but for the moment it be over before any further advance be practicable the position win have to be consolidated road have to be build dump and store of every kind to be move forward \* \* \* \* \* in a village on the bainsizza plateau half wreck by shell fire two old peasant be sit outside they house austrian shell whistle through the air and burst a few hundred yard away these be not for we say one of the old man to a italian soldier the shell and the war be for the soldier not the civilian chapter xviii the fight die down on the 28th of August the offensive be really begin again we be firing on san marco at a slow rate from six be for a hour then vivace from seven till noon and at noon we lift and continue vivace san marco be not rocky and the trench there should be bombardable into pulp in the early morning from sant ' andrea the hill all round be clearly outline except where some long belt of motionless white low-lying cloud partly hide the faiti-stoll range later with the sun up a warm haze hide everything firing continue heavy till six pm and then slow down the attack on san marco have fail next day there be a good deal of shell and some torrential shower we set fire to some wood on the lower slope of san daniele with a high wind blow \* \* \* \* \* the battery 's good luck continue on the 30th while my gun detachment be at breakfast a 59 burst in they shelter trench at the moment unoccupied and covered every one with shower of loose earth all the breakfast vanish and we shell be throw about like driftwood in a storm but no ammunition be explode and no one be hurt raven who have be up sabotino that day tell we that san gabriele be totter we offensive seem to have completely come to a end on the carso and in the vippacco valley but we be still hammer away at san marco and san gabriele at interval of a few day at a time on the 2nd of September san gabriele be still totter on the morning of the 4th it be report take on the 6th we hear that it have be take lose and retake the arno brigade have distinguish themselves by some wonderful bombing cadorna 's objective now it be say be lubiana and not trieste the major and i both agree that the entente ought to put every available man and tank on to this front and go for vienna on the 8th raven tell we that the top of san gabriele be hold but not the lower slope nor santa catarina which be still precariously supply from behind san marco a few day later we lose the top of san gabriele and the attack upon it be not renew then follow quiet time except for activity by austrian trench mortar against we trench on hill 126 we establish direct telephonic communication from the battery to the infantry brigade headquarters in order to provide rapid retaliation and we make several reconnaissance to try to locate trench mortar in the tangle of broken ground through which the enemy line run on the 17th we be warn to be ready to move at short notice to the neighborhood of monfalcone for a big push against the hermada in three week ' time battery position be choose but we never go instead a rumor begin to spread that all british battery be leave italy and go east it be say that the war office have the wind up about the turk a international tug of war be go on behind the scene on the afternoon of the 28th we be tell on high authority that we movement be still undecided but the battery be inspect that day by general capello the victor of bainsizza who look like a eastern potentate and be hear to say that he want as many british battery as he could get to increase the gun power of the second army that evening however we fate be say to be unofficially decide we with the rest of raven 's group five battery in all be to stay in italy the other two group be to go away it be not till the 3rd of October that we receive definite order on the subject the other group go to egypt and a couple of battery after three month of do nothing in cairo come back to italy again they have at any rate find a little employment for some of we surplus shipping and they have miss some queer experience in italy meantime it be also announce that we be not move down to monfalcone but be probably remain in we present position for the winter we therefore begin systematically to prepare winter quarter the italian corps commander in a special order of the day express he satisfaction that we group be remain under he command \* \* \* \* \* on the 5th i get up at four o'clock in the morning and carry out a front line reconnaissance with sergeant cote the no 1 of my gun and avoglia a italian sergeant major attach to we battery rather a sleek person who have be a _ maître-d'hôtel _ at brighton before the war we go along the front line trench on hill 126 recently capture these trench run beside the river and be now in fine condition great repair and reconstruction have be carry out during the past three week it be here that austrian trench mortar be active they be firing when we arrive and cause some casualty as it grow light a strong austrian patrol be see move about in no man 's land and it be think that a raid might be come the order stand to be give and the infantry come swarm out of they dug-out a crowd of youth some very handsome with almost classical roman feature and older man sturdy and bearded they densely man the parapet with fix bayonet and hand grenade the machine gun post be also man but nothing happen a little later a austrian be see to emerge from cover in no man 's land about a hundred yard away from we and run towards we trench throw away he rifle and shout some unintelligible word he be sick of the war and want to surrender but a young italian recruit in the trench for the first time quiver with excitement and eagerness to distinguish himself not realize the man 's motive fire at he through a peephole he miss but the austrian turn and double back like a rabbit to he own line where i suppose he be shoot poor brute by he own people i be stand quite close to the young recruit when he fire no one rebuke he but a corporal patiently explain thing to he we smile at one another and i wish he auguri and go on up the hill the austrian sniper be busy and another italian standing close to I look out slantwise through a peephole be shoot through the jaw he be bandage up profusely bleed and go stoically down the hill support by a companion leave a red trail along the wooden duck-board that pave the trench i go down two sap which the italian have push out one to within twenty yard the other to within ten yard of the austrian front line here every one speak in a low whisper or by sign they warn I to keep well down as the austrian hate khaki worse even than grigio-verde as one be always apt to hate third party who butt in against one in what one conceive to be a purely private quarrel but i go back arm with some useful information regard the position of those austrian trench mortar chapter xix a lull between two storm from the beginning of October the battery be hard at work on they winter quarter we have two large dining and recreation hut for the man one for the right section and one for the left fit up with long wooden table and bench these hut be dig into the bank one on either side of the road lead up from the battery position to pec village the dug-out be improve and make watertight and the officer ' mess and sleep hut be move up from the river bank into the battery position itself everything be very comfortable and handy we maintain close relation with a italian battery next door command by a certain captain romano he man help we in put up we hut which be of italian design and we have frequent exchange of hospitality romano be a regular officer about 28 year old with twinkle brown eye and a voice like a foghorn even when speak from a short distance away but a fine singer he have a wonderful collection of photograph be a good gunner and popular with he man \* \* \* \* \* on the 9th i spend the night in lecce op on hill 123 overlook hill 126 and 94 it be name after the lecce brigade who make it one of the best brigade in the italian army when they be in front of we we see a good deal of they now the parma brigade be hold the line and the british officer in the op use to take he meal at the brigade headquarters thing be rather active that evening at half-past five in the afternoon the enemy open a heavy bombardment increase to a pitch of great fury on we front and support trench we own line down below I be blot out from sight by dense cloud of crash flash smoke just before six the italian brigadier ask I for a heavy barrage from all the british battery a big counter-bombardment be now work up from we side i speak on the telephone to raven who tell I that all we battery be firing _ double vivace _ at a quarter past six the austrian attack there be a terrific rattle of italian machine gun fire almost drown the sound of the heavier explosion and a stream of rocket go up from we front line call for more barrage the attack be beat off by machine gun and hand grenade a few austrian reach we parapet but none get into we trench firing die down about a quarter to seven and the brigadier come up to the op very pleased with the support we have render and ask that a slow rate of fire might be keep up later on a austrian telephone message be overhear which suggest that the attack be to be renew just before dawn after a gas attack we keep on the alert but nothing happen two of we battery go on firing at a slow rate all night when dawn break it be evident that we bombardment have be very destructive the enemy 's trench be knock to piece uproot tree plank sandbag and dead body lay about in confusion it be think that owe to we fire some austrian unit which be to have take part in the attack could not and other would not do so in spite of a special issue of rum and other spirit i saw also motionless amid the austrian wire a figure in italian uniform one of a patrol who have go out four night before and have not return on the 12th i go out with a sergeant a signaller and corporal savogna a canadian italian on a front line reconnaissance on the northern side of the vippacco in the second army area the day be wonderfully clear and we could see the everlasting snow beyond cadore we go through rupa to merna and be evidently spotted be shell with 42 's and force to proceed along a muddy communication trench knee deep in water at raccogliano mill we visit the headquarters of the bergamo brigade which be hold the line a guide take we along the front line which have be considerably advance here in August and September and again by a successful local attack a few day before we go down one _ caverna _ in which on the occasion of this last attack a magyar officer and 25 man surrender the austrian sentry also a magyar have be fasten by the leg to the doorpost outside the entrance to the dug-out in the italian bombardment one of he foot be blow away but he own people have do nothing for he now he dead body lay out in the open behind the new italian front line \* \* \* \* \* on the 14th jeune go on leave to england no one have any expectation that anything of importance be likely to happen in the near future in he absence i act as second-in-command of the battery on the 19th we hear that the italian high command be prepare another big offensive from the bainsizza against the ternova plateau and the same day the intelligence report contain the information that a series of german division have be see detrain at lubiana since the beginning of October and that owe to the russian collapse a thousand austrian gun have be move across from the russian to the isonzo front since the middle of September we have notice a perceptible increase in the enemy 's artillery activity for some time but this we think at the time be purely defensive there have also be a week of heavy rain but the vippacco after rise rapidly and threaten to flood we all out fall eighteen inch in one night it sweep away a number of italian bridge however from merna and raccogliano further up stream and we see piece of these rush past in the swift current on the 21st the major and i motor to palmanova and buy some winter clothing at the ordnance a austrian twelve-inch howitzer whom we have christen mr pongo be shell all day at interval chiefly in the back area a unpleasant beast we agree who want smother on the 22nd it be evident from the austrian shell that quite a number of fresh heavy howitzer both twelve - and fifteen-inch have appear behind the austrian line a few no doubt of those thousand gun from russium listen to they shell whistle over one 's head like express train and to they -lrb- happily distant -rrb- deep crash on percussion one realize very vividly the immediate military effect of the russian collapse we hear that the italian offensive be not come off after all on the 23rd we hear that a big austrian attack be expect last night and might come that night instead we receive order to clean up and prepare in case of necessity the old position at boschinus on san michele which the battery have occupy when they first arrive in italy this i think seem rather panic-stricken romano 's battery have similar order it would be annoying to leave we present position after all the work put into it to make it habitable for the winter but i note that the atmosphere be tinge with apprehension part iv the italian retreat and recovery chapter xx the beginning of the enemy offensive on the morning of October 24th soon after nine o'clock the enemy launch a big attack against the third army front especially violent between faitus and the vippacco and renew it in the afternoon but he gain no ground all through the previous night and all that day till evening the bombardment on both side be heavy we have not fire during the night but begin at seven in the morning and go on throughout the day a message come in that the enemy would probably shell battery for four hour with gas shell start with irritant gas and go on to poison he have already employ these tactic up north as we learn later gas alert be on all night and we be listen strainedly for soft burst heavy rain come down steadily all day and everything be drench and drip the space between we hut fill with water and need continual bale out but when gas be expect one welcome heavy rain -lrb- 1 -rrb- and high wind and loud explosion from burst shell -lrb- footnote 1 : it be not till a later date that gas be employ the effect of which be increase by rain -rrb- between nine and ten pm i hear a series of soft burst just across the river and arrange with romano 's battery for mutual alarm if any gas should come too near a hour later i be relieve in the command post and turn in as i be undress i hear the wind rise again and the telephonist next door bale out they dug-out we be keep up a desultory fire all night to harass any further attack that might be attempt the major who have be out on a front line reconnaissance that morning in the neighborhood of merna have come in for some very heavy shell and return very weary \* \* \* \* \* the next day the 25th be at least fine it be even rather sunny we do a little firing but not much between seven be and two pm enemy plane come over continually fly very low about thirty in the course of the morning they attack one of we observation balloon which descend rapidly as they approach and i think get down safely italian anti-aircraft gun bring down one of they whenever we shell mandrium a little village up the valley a plane come over evidently they have something there as to which they be sensitive perhaps a general 's billet at half past ten the italian ditch a lorry full of ammunition just at the top of the road from the battery position to pec village in full view of the enemy on hill 464 at this time the village be be heavily shell by 59 's and we cookhouse on the outskirts be all but hit shell burst all round it in a circle shower of brick and lump of earth and masonry rise high in the air one shell hit the artillery group headquarters of major borghese and i see all he office papers go up a cloud of shred shine in the sun i laugh and say to myself there go a lot of red tape i see borghese himself later in the day limp along with a stick a chunk of one of he office wall have fall on he foot the enemy meanwhile have begin to shell the lorry methodically as they idiotic habit be with one shell every five minute it be too near we to be pleasant so the major take out a party and haul it out of they view under cover of a bank but this take some time leary stand by with a stopwatch call out the minute at the end of every fourth minute the party run for cover then a few seconds later we hear the next shell come the major be hit on the hand once by a shell splinter which draw blood but nothing more serious than this happen about two o'clock a big bombardment work up again and the volconiac and faitus become a sea of smoke and flame this go on till dusk we firing hard all the time more enemy plane come over one even after dark a most unusual thing fly very low indeed under a heavy fire of anti-aircraft battery and machine gun from the ground we plane have be very scarce all day they have nearly all go north for the time be we have quite lose the command of the air in this sector the two british battery who be furthest forward have order to move back that night to reserve position on san michele the italian be go to horse they gun for it be say that the majority of the tractor have go north too this move look rather panicky i think many red rocket go up in the early evening from volconiac and faitus the enemy be make another attack then a little later tricolor rocket red white and green go up this be the signal that the attack have be beat off and that the situation be quiet again the firing die down about seven we feed and put up for the night a italian officer whose battery use to be here but have move north yesterday he have just come back from a gas course at palmanova from a newspaper which he have i see that a strong offensive have begin on the afternoon of the 23rd to the north of the bainsizza plateau either the attack here be only hold attack or the attack to the north be a feint and the real thing be to be here anyhow i think it be they last despairing great cry i turn in just after midnight the night be still and there be a bright moon and star a thick mist lay along the vippacco just behind the tree the air be damp and cold it seem pretty quiet for the moment all along the front \* \* \* \* \* i have a troubled night in the early morning we be bombard with gas shell and have to wear respirator from a quarter to three till four o'clock we be firing from five till six and again steadily from a quarter past seven onward we get order to move back that night to boschinus on san michele i think this a great mistake later in the day we move be cancel as the two forward battery which pull out last night would not be in action on san michele till to-morrow they have be last hear of stuck fast in a crush of traffic at the bottom of the hill at peteano a strong team of horse be strain they gut out in vain attempt to pull a italian twelve-inch mortar up the hill it be this which have cause the block those two forward battery _ might _ have lose they gun in a quick retreat i thought but hardly we it seem to be fear however that the two bridge across the vippacco might go that day we be shell heavily with every kind of weapon from fifteen-inch downward especially the left section in the afternoon we have as usual marvellously good luck and only have one casualty and that a slight wound the spirit and endurance of the man be wonderful enemy plane be over all day we count twenty-two between daybreak and four pm some hover overhead and range they gun on we several time we put we detachment under cover and cease fire owe to the shell my own gun be half bury by a great shower of earth kick up by a 945 which pitch right on top of the bank in front of we but cote my sergeant and myself crouch under cover of the girdle be quite unhurt the rest of the detachment have be order down into they dug-out another time the enemy neatly bracket we command post with twelve-inch and several of we within be uncomfortably await the next round but luckily for we he switch away to the right we have to fire hard most of the day especially in the afternoon and evening it have be exhausting and almost sleepless work for the detachment for several day past for darrell and a work party of forty be away prepare the reserve position on san michele and we have hardly any relief for the gun the major too look very tired and fray but whenever we eye meet he give I a smile of encouragement and leadership that evening during a short break in the firing he ask I since he himself could not leave the command post to go round and buck the man up and thank they on he behalf for the way in which they have behave so long as the major 's pleased we be satisfy say one man another a bombardier who afterwards get a commission and have be with darrell on a reconnaissance on faitus a few day before and have nearly be kill on the journey say well sir we be think of the boy in the front line today and well he might for it have be a hellish bombardment up there after deliver my message to the man i walk up and down the road in front of the gun for a few moment in the short silence realize how the alliance of britain and italy be burn itself more deeply than ever into we heart in these day of trial that night the enemy attack again and we lose faitus and hill 393 and have to fire on they i hear afterwards from the group that colonel canale when he give the order to fire on 393 be almost weep on the telephone next day we counter-attack and retake faitus but 393 remain in austrian hand rumor and denial of rumor come in from the north it be say that we have lose monte nero and caporetto and that german battery have keep up a high concentration of gas for four hour on we line in the cadore and we know that the italian gas mask be only guarantee to last for a hour and a half in such condition and that each man only carry one chapter xxi from the vippacco to san giorgio di nogara on the 27th the rumor become bad the german advance to the north be say to be considerable and rapid order come that all the british battery be to pull out and park that night at villa viola behind gradisca for duty on another part of the front probably we think we be go north the gun concentration up there must be awful say the major i tell cote that we be probably go into the thick of it and he eye shine with pride he be a fine fellow that day the sun be shine and the italian plane in this sector seem to have regain command of the air for the moment there be a little lull in the firing but we feel that some big fate be loom over we i go away to my hut for five minute and write in my diary i here put it on record once more that i be proud to fight in and for italy i repeat that die here be not death it be fly into the dawn if i die in and for italy i would like to think that my death would do something for anglo-italian sympathy and understanding in the early afternoon the major go down to headquarters he ring I up from there to say that two gun be to be pull out at once and the other two to double they rate of fire no 4 gun be now engaging two different target with alternate round and different charge when the major come back he call all the man together and say i be not go to conceal anything from you the situation be serious the italian have have a bad reverse up north but there be no need for anyone to get panicky we shall pull out and go back to-night that be all i know at present when i know more i will tell you more one gun will remain in action till the last no 2 be the easiest to get out so i have choose she for the post of honor as the man scatter i hear several say good old no 2 the major tell I that the austrian be almost in cividale staggering news tractor and lorry be to come and take away we gun and store in the evening but the number of tractor be very limited and raven be doubtful if enough would come in time the whole third army be retreat and three british battery ourselves the battery in pec village and the battery at rupa would be the last three battery of medium or heavy calibre leave on this part of the front all through the afternoon and evening italian infantry and artillery be retreat through pec some look stolid other depress other merely puzzle but a little later a battalion come along the road the other way go up to be sacrifice on nad logem they halt to rest by the roadside full of gaiety and courage they cheer we man on no 2 gun who be pump out shell as fast as they could bravi inglesus cry the italian and some of we man reply good luck johnny unknown italian be always johnny as the dark come on ammunition dump begin to go up everywhere the italian be deliberately explode they and great flash of light brighter than even a italian noonday light up the whole sky for minute at a time romano 's battery next door to we throw the remains of they ammunition into the river and pull out and away about 630 they be horse-drawn and do not need to wait for tractor we wish each other good-bye and hope we might meet again some better day we too get order to destroy all ammunition we could not fire as there would be no transport to take it away so we give no 2 a generous ration and heave the rest into the water of the vippacco no 2 go on firing ceaselessly so do one gun of the battery in the village and one gun at rupa that battery be the furthest forward be in the greatest danger of the three about 7 o'clock we first tractor arrive and take away no 1 gun with winterton and manzonus enemy bombing plane come over frequently one come right over we and then turn down the vallone and there be a series of heavy explosion and great cloud of brownish smoke leap up beneath she track why i keep ask myself do not the fool shell pec village where a crowd of man and gun be wait for transport why do not they put over gas shell why do not they bomb we evidently there be no german _ here _ about a quarter to nine no 2 finish she ammunition and we pull she out the other three gun have go now and the other two british battery be clear all but two lorry just after nine o'clock we last tractor come along and take off no 2 with darrell in charge of she how the italian have manage to get all these lorry and tractor for we i do not know for in the third army as a whole they be terribly short of transport many make the criticism that we should have keep out in italy we own transport but the italian certainly do we very handsomely at the cost of lose some bigger gun of they own after the last british gun have cease to fire there be for about five minute a eerie stillness as though all we artillery have go and theirs be hold its fire and then a italian field battery open again on the right of pec for over a hour now i have be expect minute by minute to see the enemy infantry come swarm along the nad logem in the dusk cut off we retreat for i know we have nothing but rear-guard leave up there but they do not come only the major and i and about forty man be leave now and we have be tell that there would be no more transport so we destroy everything that we have be unable to get away and the major informed headquarters of the situation and then disconnect the telephone and the man fall in and we march away we be just in time to see a italian field battery come into pec at the gallop the gunner all cheer unlimber they gun take up position and open fire it be a smart piece of work do with a real latin gesture how enfuriate it be to be leave these wooden hut of ours and these good position on which have be spend so many hour of labor where we could have pass such a comfortable winter go forth now none know whither old natale one of the italian attach to we chalk up in german on the entrance to one of the hut you german pig we shall soon be back again but at that moment i do not feel so sure natale be afterwards lose in the retreat and be report by we as miss but one of we man see he again six month later with a italian battery and say he look several year younger we pass campbell the medical officer standing outside he dug-out on the road he be wait for the last of the other battery ' party to get away he tell I afterwards that we be out only just in time within half a hour of we go the austrian fairly plaster the position with shell of all calibre they shell the road a little as we go along but not too much as we pass the railway embankment at rubbium we see and speak to some italian machine-gunner in position whose order be to hold up the enemy till the last possible moment they be quite calm and determine those boy know perfectly well that by the time the enemy come the isonzo bridge would have be blow up behind they i drag myself on with a ache heart one who retreat cut a poor figure beside a rear-guard that stay behind and fight we cross the isonzo at peteano and take a short cut across the field to farra in the crowd and the dark we be jostle by some italian infantry we hail they and find that they be we old friend the lecce brigade the major make we man stand back pass lecce he say good luck to you we march on through farra to gradisca both blaze in the night the town and village everywhere in this sector have be deliberately fire by the retreat italian in addition to the ammunition dump the whole countryside be blaze and explode i thought of russium in 1812 and the russian retreat before napoleon and tchaikovsky 's music it begin to rain but that make no difference to the burning in gradisca burning petrol be run about the street earlier in the evening there have be a queer scene here the headquarters of the british staff have be at gradisca and the camp commandant have make a hobby of fattening rabbit for the general 's mess when the time have come that day to pack up and go it be find that the lorry provide be fully load with office store staff officer ' bulky kit and 20000 cigarette which the general be specially proud of have save from he canteen there be no room for the camp commandant 's rabbit hutch so these be open and the fat inmate release to the delight of the civilian and italian soldiery in gradisca who knock they over or shoot they as they run i hear this from a gunner who be officer 's servant to one of the staff and witness the scene a few mile away at the ordnance depôt at villa freifeldt thousand of pound ' worth of gun store stand ready pack in crate to be remove but no transport come for they and they be abandon and fall into austrian hand for lack of they we battery be afterwards keep out of action for several week whoever order these thing seem to have think it more important to save the staff 's kit and the general 's cigarette just before we enter gradisca we pass a battalion of the granatierus the italian grenadier all six foot tall with collar badge of crimson and white come up from reserve to fight a rear-guard action i have see they a few day before in rest billet and admire they appearance and in they march that night and in they face be scorn for fugitive and contempt for death the major say to I as they swing past we that _ that _ battalion could be trust to fight to the end and they do some of we man meet a few of they survivor at mestre a week later nearly the whole battalion have be kill or wound but they have hold up the austrian advance for several hour on the further side of gradisca we pass a great platform which have be erect a few week before for the duke of aosta 's presentation of medal for the carso offensive it be here that the major have receive the italian silver medal for valor the platform look ironical that night still deck with bunt limp and drench now by the rain and light up by the flame of the burning town we reach villa viola about 1130 pm it be to have be a rendezvous but there be no one there only the rain still fall about midnight we enter a empty house and throw ourselves down upon the floor to sleep \* \* \* \* \* we have sleep for less than a hour when we be hurriedly awaken the italian have order to set fire to the house meanwhile savogna we canadian italian corporal have just return from scout for we and report that party from the other battery be in a house half a mile away we march off again through pour rain we path light up by the flame which in place thrust they long tongue right across the road the wind blow cloud of smoke in we face the air be full of the roaring of the fire the crackle of blaze woodwork the crash of house fall in the loud explosion of ammunition dump and petrol store which now and again for a few seconds light up the whole night sky for mile around with a terrific glare and then die down again far as the eye could reach the night be stud with red and golden fire everywhere behind the front of the retreat third army a systematic destruction be be carry out the third army be retreat in good order unbroken and undefeated retreat only because its northern flank be in danger of be turn the third army be prove to the enemy that its movement be deliberate and govern by a cool purpose the enemy should advance into a wilderness again i seem to hear in the air the music of 1812 and the bell of burn moscow ring out loud and clear above the triumph song of the invader \* \* \* \* \* we man march doggedly on some look puzzle and full of wonder other tired but cheerful other with expressionless uncomprehending face but in the face of a few i read a consciousness of the tremendous tragedy of which we form a tiny part we find the other battery in a house not yet mark down for burn the house be crowd out already and all the best place take such as they be there be pool of water everywhere on the floor officer of the group be there know nothing await the appearance of colonel raven all we party get in somehow and lay down to sleep but half a hour later we be rouse again raven have come and order that all should push on to palmanova some of we man be sleep very heavily and be hard to waken when we start it be still rain the road be crowd with traffic include many gun we own go by with the rest winterton darrell leary and manzonus with they each battery party march independently the easier to get through block in the traffic the square at palmanova have be fix as the next rendezvous the stream of refugee with they slow-moving wagon draw by ox or they little donkey cart or trudge on foot carry bundle become gradually thicker and more painful for we be back now in country that yesterday or the day before have fancy itself remote from the battle zone i remember one elderly peasant woman tall and erect as a young girl with white hair and a face like dante calm beautiful and stern she be alone tramp along through the mud and she have the walk of a queen at versa we halt for a few minute at the hospital all the wound have be evacuate -lrb- 1 -rrb- campbell be lie on a bed in one of the empty ward snatch a little rest he have see the last british troops away from pec and have then follow on a motor-bicycle i go into the old ramc mess to see if any food or drink be leave the question of food be begin to be serious for the whole retreat army italian troops be clear out everything i find a wine bottle half full and take a deep drink it be vinegar but it buck one up i hand the bottle to a italian and tell he it be good english wine he drink a little see the joke smile and pass it on to a unsuspecting companion i get a little milk which i share with the major and some of we man then we resume the march -lrb- footnote 1 : one wounded british soldier who have be in a italian field hospital which be not evacuate in time be take prisoner by the austrian he tell I when he be release a year later that the austrian bayonet the italian wounded whom they find in this hospital but spare the british and on the whole treat they well -rrb- we reach palmanova about 7 be it be now the 28th of October we meet raven in the square where be also collect a british general and he staff officer they be stand about with a half lose look on they face there be no evidence of decision or any plan the general be smile as he habit be the staff captain be tell someone in a hopeless voice that he have hear that the italian be go back to the tagliamento just as we arrive the italian begin to set fire to the town dense cloud of black smoke fan by a strong wind begin to pour over we head flame be soon roar round house where three month ago i have be a guest but the inmate have all go now food and drink be be sell in the shop at knock-down price the italian military authority be requisition all bread and issue some to we the major order it to be keep in reserve i go round the town and into the railway station look for we gun but there be no sign of they i come back and sleep for a hour amid some rubble under the archway inside one of the town gate the town be burn furiously we man wet to the skin sheltered themselves from the smoke and the cold wind in the dry moat outside the wall then the order come to move on we form up and start with the rest nobody know whither some say latisana but no one know how far off this be the man have no ration except the bread obtain at palmanova and no prospect apparently of get any the supply officer of the asc might as well have go to heaven for all the use they be to we during those day of retreat it be rain again and the road be block we proceed slowly for a mile or two and be then turn off the road into a damp open field which someone say be a strategic point here a number of different battery party collect we be to wait for the gun the downpour steadily increase the field rapidly become a marsh and there be no shelter anywhere raven walk up and down puff at this pipe take the situation with admirable calm it be at this time that i personally touch my bedrock of misery both mental and physical for there seem to be nothing to be do and what most irk I there be so many senior officer present that i myself could take no decision then some of we gun arrive and be halt at the side of the road to wait for the rest but this make the traffic block worse and they have to move forward again and the idea of get they all together be abandon raven then give the order to the rest of we to move on there be some vacant place in various car and lorry at this point and some footsore man be put in the major insist in spite of my protest that i prefer to walk that i should get into one of the car which i share with littleton the chaplain who have think that war might be tremendously worth while and three junior officer from raven 's headquarters i be in truth pretty do at this stage chiefly through want of sleep compare to which i always find want of food a trifling inconvenience it be now about 4 pm and we could only make very slow progress a rendezvous have be fix by raven at foglie where ration be to have be distribute but there be no one and no ration there and it seem that raven have take the wrong road the enemy be say to be advance from the north at right angle to we only possible line of retreat and the chance seem strongly in favor of we all be cut off a italian doctor run out into the road and stop we car almost beside himself with despair he have be leave in charge of a number of severely wound case without any food medical necessity or transport but we have no food and could do nothing to help he except promise to try to have transport send back to he from san giorgio di nogara chapter xxii from san giorgio to the tagliamento we reach san giorgio about 9 pm and here i get out of the car which two of raven 's staff take on to try and arrange for transport to be send back for the italian wounded have sleep for a hour or two in the car i feel quite a different being and fit for anything straggler be come in from the various battery ' dismounted party and i collect nearly a hundred of these man into a hall on the ground floor of a italian field hospital they lay about on the stone floor sleep like log upstairs a panic have spread among the wound that they would be abandon man be cry with terror and struggle to get out of bed campbell who have now join we go up and help the italian medical personnel soon afterwards ambulance of both the italian and british red cross begin to arrive and the hospital be quickly clear from one british red cross driver i get a large box of cabin biscuit which i distribute among we man some of whom be ravenously hungry i also find a tap of good drinking water in the main street and here we refill all available water bottle include those of several man who be too fast asleep to waken the question then arise what to do with these straggler i go to the station but find that no more train be run latisana be say to be only a few kilometre away it be in fact more than twenty i discover that it be on the tagliamento and i suppose that once across the river we should be momentarily safe from risk of capture and if ammunition be forthcoming we battery might once more come into action meanwhile we should push on as soon as possible on the other hand the man be very tired have be march for twenty-four hour with only a few short break a few hour ' sleep now might be worth a lot to they later on several civilian come up to I and ask when the german would be here this be my house one old man explain point to a small house near the hospital and i shall have to leave everything if i go away but i can not stay and he begin to cry in the early hour of the 29th i put some of we most footsore straggler on to lorry go in the direction of latisana the rest march off under henderson one of the officer from raven 's headquarters who have come with I in the car to san giorgio meanwhile i be keep a look-out for we gun in the dense column of traffic slowly crawl past i see gun belong to other battery and be tell that some of ours be further behind it be just get light when a tractor appear draw two of we gun and one belong to another british battery which we have pick up on the road a long way back with only three gunner in charge of it and which would certainly have be lose if we have not take it in tow but as the result of this additional load we tractor have be break down all the way along and have fall almost to the rear of the retreat column it have a damnable and useless accumulator but there be no means of change this with the tractor and gun be winterton darrell and leary also the battery quartermaster sergeant and two of we lorry they tell I manzonus be well on ahead with the other two gun and i tell they that the major and the bulk of the dismount party must also be a good distance ahead as straggler from this party have appear here many hour before we be now the last british gun on the road a post of honor which we continue to hold i be delighted to find that i be now entitle by reason of seniority to take command i send on the two lorry with winterton and darrell to get in touch as soon as possible with the two gun in front and the major 's party leary and i remain behind with the tractor and its load we have about thirty man with we and a small quantity of ration include a little tea we move on slowly and get stick in a bad block of traffic at san giorgio cross road here we have to remain stationary for several hour the dawn be break and we make some tea about 5 be i get tire of sit still and walk about half a mile down the road to find out the cause of the block i begin to control and jerrymander the traffic and at first annoy a italian officer who be there with the same object as myself but i persuasively point out to he the benefit to both of we if we could only succeed in get a move on and he then calm down and begin to help I in the end we both manoeuvre we own transport into a move stream and go forward smile we go along at a fine pace for several mile and then we tractor stop and would not start up again whereupon there come to we assistance a young man name rinaldo rinaldi a skilled and resourceful mechanic who be drive a tractor in rear of we he patch up we engine and get we go again but we keep on break down after interval never very long time after time rinaldo rinaldus come run up smile and eager to help he patch we up and get we go six time but at last he have to pass we and go on for he too be draw gun i shall never forget rinaldo rinaldus and the cheerful help he give we in the end he leave we a accumulator but it be not much better than we own enemy plane now begin to appear in the sky some scout only other drop bomb they do more damage to the wretched refugee than to the military what chance they miss that day once or twice when we be stationary i give the order to scatter in the field to left and right of the road but they never come very near to hit we they fly very high and they markmanship be atrocious atrocious also be we tractor finally when it break down and we have no fresh accumulator we have to unlimber the front gun attach drag rope to the tractor haul vigorously on the rope until the engine start up then back the tractor and front limber back to the gun limber up cast off the rope and go ahead again we do this three or four time in the course of a hour and enjoy the sense of triumph over obstacle but it be very laborious and the interval between successive breakdown grow ominously shorter and shorter and the last time the trick do not work though we have all heave and heave till we be very near exhaustion we be fairly stick now half block the road great excitement as be only natural develop among those behind we i send forward a orderly with a message to the major describe we plight and ask that if possible another tractor might be send back from latisana to pull we this message never reach the major but be open by another field officer who send back this flatulent reply if you be with major blink you have better ask he whether you may use you own discretion and if necessary remove breech block and abandon gun i be not with major blink and i neither know nor care where he might be nor have i any intention of abandon the gun i determine without ask anyone 's permission to use my discretion in a different way i see a little distance in front a italian field artillery colonel in a state of wild excitement he be rush about with a unopened bottle of red wine in he hand wave it ferociously at the head of refugee and drive they and they cart off the road down a side track a queer pathetic freight some of these cart carry marble clock and blanket big wine flask and canary in cage the colonel have drive off the road also a certain captain medolum of whom i shall have more to say in a moment and who be sit sulkily on he horse among the civilian cart the colonel 's object it appear be to get a number of field battery through he have clear a gap in the block traffic and he field gun be now streaming past at a sharp trot but he be a extraordinary spectacle and make I want to laugh tread very delicately i approach this enfuriated man and explain the helpless situation of we gun point out that we be also unwillingly impede the movement of he own i ask if he could order any transport to be provide for we he wave he bottle at I show no sign of either civility or comprehension only scream at the top of he voice va via va via -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : away with you away with you -rrb- i give he up as hopeless and go back to my gun intend to wait till he have disappear and thing have quiet down again and then to look for help elsewhere but the latin mind often follow a thread of order through what a anglo-saxon be apt to mistake for a mere hurricane of confused commotion within five minute captain medolum come up to I and say that the colonel have order he to drag we tractor and gun medolum be in command of a battery of long gun and have one of these attach to a powerful tractor on the road in front of we to this long gun therefore we now attach we tractor useless as a tractor but contain valuable gun store and we three gun it be a tremendous strain for one tractor however strong to pull and we decide a little later to abandon we own tractor and most of its contents medola have hand over he horse to a orderly who be to ride on ahead and arrange for a fresh supply of petrol for he tractor of which there be three mount the front of the lead tractor and i get up beside he he render we most invaluable help in a most willing spirit and at considerable risk to himself for he undoubtedly have to go much more slowly with we in tow than he could have go if he have be alone we see another battery of italian heavy gun go along the road heavier than either ours or medolum 's they be a ancient type which we have see sometimes on the carso and not of very high military value but they gunner take a regimental and affectionate pride in those old gun they have neither tractor nor horse but they have drag they beloved piece for thirty mile from the rocky height of the carso along good road and bad up and down hill through impossible traffic block down on to the plain as far as palmanova with nothing but long rope and they own strong arm they have forty man haul on each gun at palmanova new haul party have be put on who drag the gun another thirty mile to the far side of the tagliamento at latisana and as they haul they sing until they be too tired to go on singing and could only raise from time to time they rhythmical periodic cry of sforza sforza -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : heave heave -rrb- as we pass through muzzano the town and road be heavily bomb the bell in the campanile jangle wildly and weep woman crowd into the church as though think to find sanctuary there other stand gaze helplessly up into the sky here i see some italian infantry mostly young who be delighted to be retreat forward you militarist they cry to we as we pass this be you punishment how much longer do you think the war be go to last what about trieste now they speak with joyful irony as though the conquest of trieste have be a slave ' task impose upon unwilling italy by foreign imperialist they be the only italian troops i see during the retreat who show any sign of be under the influence of defeatist or german propaganda the stream of refugee steadily thicken on the road more than once i get down and run on ahead call out with monotonous refrain to the driver of civilian cart to keep well over to the right of the road so as to let the gun pass they all do they best to obey poor brute and we gain some useful ground in that endless column at nightfall we be still eight or nine kilometre from latisana the traffic block grow worse and worse and there be too few carabinierus to exercise proper control we stick for hour at a time with nothing move for mile three motionless line of traffic abreast on the road all point in the same direction tire man sleep and wakeful man wait and watch and curse at the delay behind we far off we could hear the booming of the gun which seem from hour to hour to come a little nearer and flash of distant gunfire flicker in the night sky back there the rear-guard be still fight and brave man be die to give we time to get away it seem just then that they sacrifice might be in vain what a haul the austrian would have here and behind and around we burn village be still flame in the dark and throw up the sharp black outline of the tree \* \* \* \* \* afterwards i hear of some of the deed that have be do back there i hear of the charge of the italian cavalry of the novara lancer and the genoa dragoon crack regiment full of the best horseman in italy who have be wait wait all the war through for they chance to come they chance have come at last the chance to die charge against overwhelming odds in order that italy or at least the glory of she name might live for ever one command officer call all he officer around he and say the common people of italy have betray we country 's honor and now we the gentleman of italy be go to save it and then he lead the charge and fall lead it it be a fine aristocratic gesture though the prejudice of he class partly blind he near cervignano italian cavalry charge the mass machine gun of the enemy and when the horse go down the man go on and then the man go down all but a few and those few for a moment break the line and hold up the advance and give to the mass of the retreat troops just that little space of extra time which span the gulf between escape and destruction and away up north on monte nero leave behind when the rest of the army retire alpinus and bersaglierus resist for many day and aeroplane fly back and drop food and ammunition from the sky for they and when they ammunition be all shoot away that garrison come down into the plain and a few survivor fight they way through with bomb and bayonet back to the italian line and many other such deed be surely do that will never be know because the man that do they die out of sight of any of they comrade who survive \* \* \* \* \* in the small hour of the 30th of October i leave we gun in leary 's charge and determine to walk on to latisana to see if i could not find some person in authority and get something do to move thing on i have only go a little way when i meet bixio a captain of mountain artillery attach to raven 's headquarters he have come back to see how far behind we rearmost gun be i see he several time during the retreat he do fine work more than once in create order out of confusion he look a magnificent almost a mephistophelian figure with he dark feature he flash angry eye he air of decision he sharp gesture he tall body envelop in a loose cloak he alpino hat with its long single feather he tell I that all traffic along this road into latisana have be stop for the past three hour in order to let traffic from the north get on for it be from that direction that the advance of the enemy be most threatening i walk on and find a british red cross ambulance stick in the block i talk for a few moment to the driver who give I a piece of cake and some wine when i reach latisana i find traffic pour through along the road from the north i cross the bridge over the tagliamento and look down at the broad swift current glisten beneath hope leap again within I at the sight here at last i say to myself be a fine natural obstacle we shall turn here and stand at bay and the invader will come no further i have be tell that there be some hut on the right hand side just over the bridge where we man would be where the asc would have deliver ration and the staff have fix a rendezvous i therefore expect to find the major and we dismounted party or at least someone from another battery or some of either raven 's or the general 's staff but there be nothing there no british troops no ration and no staff only the never end rain and a confused stream of italian troops chiefly field gun hurry across the bridge there be nothing to do but to go back the sentry on the bridge try to stop I but i insist that i must see some artillery officer in authority they direct I to the square where i find colonel canale control the movement of battery look straight before he out of uncomprehending heavy eye like one crush under a weight of bitter humiliation he ask where we gun be i tell he they be get near now but stick fast in the traffic he say it be forbid to let through traffic on that road at present but he would do what he could i ask if there be any new order no he say only forward across the bridge and then push on as fast as possible to portogruaro i leave he and find three of we straggler from the major 's party asleep on the floor of a forge i tell they to cross the river and wait on the portogruaro road for myself and the gun i ask a italian corporal if there be anywhere in latisana where one could get a drink he say he think not but give I a bottle full of cold coffee brandy and sugar in about equal proportion it be a splendid drink but a little too sweet i walk back along the road towards the gun some house on the outskirts of the town be burn furiously the traffic be begin to move forward along we road very slowly and with frequent halt i have two overcoat with I when we start from pec both be long ago wet through and i be wear over my shoulder at this time a blanket lend to I by medolum this too be thoroughly drench by now in the field on either side of the road infantry be lie out in the rain asleep dream perhaps of rome or sicily or the bay of naple the dawn of another day be break cold damp and miserable symbolic of this great weary tragedy \* \* \* \* \* i have not go far when i meet four of we man carry on a stretcher the dead body of the battery staff sergeant artificer he have drop asleep on one of the gun and as the tractor move on he have fall forward head downward beneath the gun wheel which have pass over he along the whole length of he body crush he to death they say he die before they could get he out he be a good man and a very skilled worker full of pluck and spirit the last thing he have do for I be to get everything ready for render the gun unserviceable in case we should have to abandon they there be no chance of decent burial for he here but i have he body place upon a empty trench cart which be be tow by a lorry of another battery and put two of we man in charge of it they bury he the next day or the day after in a cemetery near portogruaro about 7 be as i be still make my way back through the traffic towards we gun it be report that enemy cavalry patrol have be see to the north of the road and that shot have be exchange for a moment there be some panic and confusion but a scheme of defense be quickly organise no one have suppose that they could yet be so near i find bixio rally some infantryman with eloquent word and great gesture and a italian infantry major calm and smile be put out a screen of machine gunner and rifleman across the road itself and along a hedge five hundred yard to the north of it all be in readiness for put we gun completely out of action there would be nothing else to do if the enemy appear for we have no gun ammunition and it be impossible to get on until the whole traffic block in front of we have be shift forward but i tell bixio that i should do nothing to the gun unless there be some evidence that the enemy be really approach with a superiority of force over we own the enemy however do not at that time reappear and the best bit of hustle traffic management that i have yet witness during the retreat now take place the northern road be at last clear at latisana and the authority turn they attention to we a breakdown gang appear and a number of new tractor and lorry with refill of petrol civilian cart whose driver remain be order to drive on those which have be abandon be overturn to one side into the ditch and dead horse and wreckage due to bombing or the brief moment of panic be likewise thrust off the road relay of fresh driver take over all the lorry and tractor which would still go the rest go into the ditch on top of the dead horse and derelict cart the heavier load which single tractor have be pull be split up between two or more in a surprisingly short time the whole mass begin to move here i part from medolum who have be a very good friend to we we three gun get a new tractor to themselves and i get up beside the driver and so at last we enter latisana we new driver be immensely enthusiastic but very excited he tell I that he have have two brother kill in the war and have apply when the retreat begin to be transfer from mechanical transport to the infantry that morning he say he have hear general pettitus who be we army corps commander give the order that all the british battery must first be get across the river and only then the italian i say that i see no good reason for this preference but that anyhow he be drive the last three british gun this pleased he tremendously by now i be wrap up in a new and dry italian blanket which i have take from a abandon cart by the roadside we tractor less enthusiastic than its driver break down continually it be rumor that the bridge have be blow up already and there be wild scream of despair from a crowd of woman who come run past we at last we turn the last corner and come in sight of the tagliamento the bridge be still intact italian general be rush to and fro gesticulate give order general pettitus send a special orderly to ask I if mine be the last british gun i tell he yes we tractor break down three time on the bridge itself but at last we be over one of we party have a italian flag and wave it and cry viva l'italia not long after the bridge go up with a explosion that could be hear for mile around chapter xxiii from the tagliamento to treviso i hear later that the major and he party have reach latisana the previous day winterton have join they near muzzano they have march for forty-eight hour practically without food and with only some three hour ' rest in stray halt they have be magnificent but they be utterly do and the major who have be most do of all tell I afterwards that it have make he cry to watch they hobble along -- some of they man too old or of too low a medical category to have pass for the infantry -- and to hear they sing what be the use of worry it never be worth while so pack up you sorrow in you old kit bag and smile smile smile the spirit of the man in the retreat from mon be not finer than the spirit of those man of ours at latisana they get on board a train for treviso it be about the last train that be run \* \* \* \* \* my party though they be longer on the road be at least able to ride a great part of the way on the tractor and gun once across the tagliamento we tractor not only continue to break down every few hundred yard but also develop the unpleasant habit of catch fire twice we put the fire out with the squirt and chemical provide for the purpose and a third time with mud i determine not to risk a fourth time and so pull on to the side of the road and halt i send on the battery sergeant major on a pass lorry to portogruaro with a note to the major ask that another tractor might be send back and i also send avoglium to the nearest italian headquarters to see if he could raise a tractor there we be halt at the top of a hill on the road run along the western bank of the river we be indeed literally across but we should have provide a splendid target for enemy artillery advance on the further side a good system of trench run alongside the road and these be now man in force by italian infantry field gun also have come into position behind they we man take advantage of the enforced halt to collect fuel light fire and make tea we be still halt here at nightfall soon after dark some italian come up and tell we that we be block the road which be not true as we be well to the side however as neither avoglium nor the sergeant major have yet return with a new tractor and as the italian say that they would pull we on i cordially agree to the attempt be make they attach a tractor with a heavy lorry in tow to we inflammatory tractor and we three gun they ask that a attempt should be make to start up we tractor also but i succeed in persuade they that this be inexpedient they then start up they own tractor only to my great surprise we begin to move it be a magnificent machine and forge ahead splendidly contrary to all the law limit its capacity rumble and backfire under the unwonted strain for mile through the gloom then the moon begin to rise the night for the first time since the retreat begin be fine and clear we could only go slowly and break down now and then but all go pretty well until we swing we long train a little too sharply round a corner in the road and the last two gun get ditch while we be try to get they out a british major whom i will call star appear on the scene he come from portogruaro with the news that five new tractor be on they way back and that some other british gun be ditch further ahead i therefore thank the officer in charge of the italian tractor and lorry for all he have do for we and advise he now to go on and leave we as we position be tiresome but no longer critical this he do the moonlight be now bright as day and one of star 's promise tractor arrive and finally succeed in get out we ditch gun \* \* \* \* \* star have paint a bright picture of portogruaro all the british gun he say be park together in the piazza and there be a large granary close by full of happy man with plenty of ration and straw so it seem some imaginative person have tell he we reach portogruaro in the small hour of the 31st of October the moon have set and it be very dark several of we make a most careful search in the piazza but there be no british gun there no granary no straw no ration i halt the gun just outside the gate of the town and tell the man to turn in and sleep soon after daybreak we all wake feeling very hungry i issue practically all that remain of we ration a little bully a little biscuit and a very little tea want a wash and still more urgently a shave i go into a house and ask for the loan of some soap and a towel a number of terrify old woman gather round I in doubt whether to fly or to stay i advise they to stay for i take for grant at this time that the tagliamento line would hold they press upon I coffee and bread and i hear they repeat over and over again to one another my assurance that the enemy be still far away and would never get as far as portogruaro it be hard not to cry star arrive during the morning and take charge there be no need he say to hurry on we have better rest here for a day he arrange for we all to draw ration from the italian comando di tappa treviso be to be we next stop place we be disturb a little during the morning by enemy plane drop bomb on the town but none fall very near we in the afternoon we move on and park we gun near the station along with those of the other british battery which have arrive before we bombing raid continue and be more serious that afternoon than in the morning one bomb fall on a house which be full of man from one of the other battery and cause a number of casualty it be only by good luck that a number of my own man be not in that house at the time fortunately i have have word as two tired man will with one of the officer of the other battery about the joint use of the kitchen and my man when i ask they have decide that they prefer as always to run they own show and not pig in with other battery to that attitude of independence some of they probably owe they life in the afternoon raven turn up and say that he have arrange for we to go on to treviso by train we load we gun on to truck and wait several hour in the station yard for the promise train it be cold and wet and more bomber come over we they have bomb the station for the last three night i hear but nothing hit it while we be there the train leave at 930 pm leary and another officer and i try to share one wet blanket we be too wet and cold to sleep i walk up and down the carriage try to get warm they bomb the railway several time during we journey and once when a bomb fall near we train there be a rumor that the engine driver have go away and leave we stand but it be quite untrue we crawl along with many stop it seem a quite interminable journey but at 8 o'clock next morning the 1st of November we come to treviso chapter xxiv thought after the disaster we hang about for a while in the station nobody know what be to happen next then leary and i go off to try to find some food we have be live just lately on ration biscuit and a tin of australian peach jam there be not much leave at the buffet where we find bixio but we get a little salami and some eel and wine and coffee meanwhile we train have go on to mestre owe to a mistake between two railway official and have to return next day leary 's foot be so bad that he could hardly walk i get they dress for he by the italian red cross but he could walk no better afterwards the villa passus the british headquarters be several mile off a enemy plane come over and bomb treviso when we be in the station square try in vain to find a conveyance but none of the bomb fall very close to we at last we hail a british lorry which take we to villa passus and then on to carbonera where odds and end of battery have be turn up for several day past the major be very delighted to see we a rumor have get about that we and the last gun have be leave on the wrong side of the tagliamento when the bridge go up he have almost give up hope of see we again then i go to bed and sleep for hour and hour next morning from my window i could see the alp lie very low on the horizon like a ball of fluffy snow the sun be shine and a fountain be play in the garden i could hardly realize that we have reach for a moment at least a place of peace where there be no more fighting or retreat we man be wear out most of they and sleep like log they have be sorely try they pluck and endurance have be splendid but they get no message of thanks or praise from the british general who at that time nominally command we this distinguished man i have last see in the square at palmanova amid the smoke and flame with he car stand close at hand ready to push off and he have arrive at treviso in good time he be now comfortably install at the villa passus and the day some of we footsore man limp into treviso he be lunch with he staff all bright and polished and sleek in the hotel stellum d'oro we all expect for day that he would call a parade and address the man who have save what he use to call he gun or at least that he would send some message but he make no sign except to open a canteen for the sale of the 20000 cigarette which some intelligent subordinate have save in preference to valuable gun store now in austrian hand \* \* \* \* \* the day after my arrival i read a newspaper for the first time for over a week but the news be very bad and the retreat still continue the austrian be across the tagliamento in strong force at several point i try to reason and make distinction but my brain be still too tired to answer the helm so i leave it we eat hot polenta and drink wonderful coffee have establish we battery mess in the porter 's lodge at the entrance to the villa lebreton and persuade the porter 's wife to cook for we all the battery have discover the polenta at the porter 's lodge and we man crowd the kitchen at all hour of the day we all appreciate good food after the short ration of the retreat conversation be intensely depressing when not utterly trivial i remember walk round and round the vegetable garden at the back of the villa with a italian friend of mine try both to face the fact and to draw some comfort from they it be a impossible task my friend be full of despair and bitterness the fruit of thirty month of war all lose in two day he say and much more lose besides what will all the mother think who have lose son on san michele and monte santo it be a common thing in italy now for family to have lose four or five son what will the mother of italy think of this would not any of they be justify in shooting cadorna the third army should not have be order to retire they should have counter-attack instead but now would it not be better to make peace at once be there no man who will rise up and say ` stop stop stop this bloody business now before it get any worse ' some of we soldier look quite pleased to be retreat poor child they think the war be over and they be go home there be a frightful danger that the leader -- the general and the politician at rome -- will say ` fight on ' but the rank and file will go on break ` we be fight for trento and trieste ' they use to say and now they say ` we be organise the defense of the piave line ' the regular soldier never want the war to end and soon they will be distribute medal for the retreat medal i could find no word worth say to he in reply what will they be say about we now in london and paris he go on they will be say i reply that help must be send to you but my answer i know sound flat and empty yes he say bitterly perhaps _ now _ you will send some of you general and you troops to italy and so you will put we under order and under obligation to you and we shall become you slave italian be use to be look upon as the slave of other nation no i say all that be over those of we who know the fact know what italy have do and suffer for the alliance in this war it will not be forget moment of supreme crisis such as this test the value and the depth of a alliance and ours will stand the test but that day he be inconsolable for italy be wound and bleeding and the dramatic swiftness and horror of the disaster have bent she pride and almost break it but though the future seem black as a night without star the hope of a come daybreak remain strong in the heart of a few but the struggle ahead would be cruelly hard what have italy leave to offer those who would still fight in she defense still as of old only she bosom to die on only she heart for a home and a name with she child to be from calabrian to adrian sea mother of city make free yet this be a rich reward when a year later the dawn break in all its glory \* \* \* \* \* i turn over and over in my mind in the week and month that follow as fresh evidence accumulate the meaning and the cause of the disaster of caporetto and gradually i come to definite and clear cut conclusion it be the second army that have be break and in the course of the retreat have almost disappear it be a common thing to hear the second army speak of as a whole army of coward and defeatist many foreign critic with mind blankly ignorant of nearly all the fact seem to think that the whole business could be account for by a few glib phrase about german and socialist propaganda or the suppose lack of fight quality in the italian race yet it be this same second army which in those now distant day in August have conquer the bainsizza plateau amid the acclamation of all the ally world whole army do not change they nature in a night even when wear out with fighting and heavy casualty the thing be not so simple as that \* \* \* \* \* in fix responsibility for caporetto one must draw a sharp distinction between responsibility for the original break in a narrow sector of the line and responsibility for not make good that break before the situation have get hopelessly out of hand in the former case the responsibility must rest partly upon the troops and subordinate staff charge with hold that narrow sector and partly upon the high command in the latter case the chief responsibility and a far graver one must rest upon the disposition of the high command this be the view apparently take by the commission appoint by the italian government to investigate the whole question for the three chief general concern be not only remove from they command but give no further employment and place upon half-pay the original break be due to many cause the great mass of german division and artillery be concentrate in the caporetto sector this fact should have be know to the high command and if the italian troops hold the line at this point be for various reason of poor quality this also should have be know to the high command whose duty it be to know the comparative fighting power of different unit the high command when the battle start claim that they have know beforehand when and where the blow be come that all preparation have be make and that they be fully confident of the result such boast have be make by other high command on other front on the eve of other disaster and even after they they greatly deepen the responsibility of those who make they the german battery on the italian front have a much larger supply of ammunition than the austrian include a large quantity of special gas shell many italian troops both infantry and artillery subject to prolonged gas bombardment find the gas mask provide by the high command quite inadequate it be leave for general diaz some month later to order the equipment of the whole italian army with the british box respirator the number of gun lose by the second army be very great i be tell that one reason for this be the fact that the high command have for some week be prepare a further big offensive against the plateau of ternova have concentrate a abnormal number of battery on the second army front and have push the majority of the gun much further up than would have be justified if a enemy offensive have be expect then have make these preparation the high command hesitate and begin to change its mind but the disposition of the forward battery thoroughly unsound for defensive purpose be not appreciably altered and a quite small enemy advance suffice to make enormous capture of gun when the attack develop some of the troops in the caporetto sector unquestionably turn and run as troops of every great army in this war have at time turn and run under condition of greater or less provocation then the high command apparently lose its head and attempt to issue to the world a communiqué of a character unparalleled in the history of this war naming and cursing as traitor to they country certain particular infantry brigade this document be very properly suppress by the italian government but where be the reserve which the high command should have have ready to repair the broken line and where be the plan for retreat to prepared position only a short distance behind it be well know and indeed it use to be another boast of the high command that a local reverse would be of no great importance see that there be no less than twelve prepared line between the front as it then run and udine i have see some of those line with my own eye i know what great and patient labor go to the making of they and i know how strong they be but when the moment come to make use of they no one outside the charm circle of the high command be in possession of the plan for they defense and for fall back upon they in a orderly and systematic manner it have be say that these plan could not have be make known beforehand to the subordinate command for fear they should fall into the hand of spy that would have be a small misfortune compare to what actually befall -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : in fairness to general capello the second army commander who have be highly and deservedly praise for the bainsizza victory in August and who be one of the general remove from he command after caporetto it should be state that on the latter occasion he be away from the front on leave -rrb- when owe to the omission of the high command the break in the line be swiftly widen and the whole defensive scheme of the second army collapse it be true that confusion and panic begin to spread through the second army like fire through dry grass but it be not within the power of common soldier and especially of simple unlettered peasantry such as most of these soldier be to repair the blunder of bad staff work and to make for themselves on the spur of the moment and in face of deadly peril plan which train brain should have elaborate long before at leisure and in safe secluded place when leadership fail the best troops fail too but let one who come of a nation none of whose troops have ever act as those troops of the italian second army act in those dreadful day throw the first stone at italy that nation will be hard to find it be not of this world those who know the italian soldier know that no soldier in the world respond more readily to loyal trust to common kindliness and to efficient and inspiring leadership british and french officer who have have opportunity of judge know this as well as italian but the italian high command deny these thing to the italian soldier -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be due to he and to the good name of italy which have be damnably traduce by prejudiced and ignorant man that the truth should be speak -lrb- footnote 1 : among other charge which may be bring against the high command at this time be first they failure to make adequate provision for the amusement and relaxation of the troops when in rest such as the ymca and various concert party provide for british troops to combat inevitable war-weariness second failure to increase the most inadequate scale of ration and third the attempt to apply with strange disregard of the very different spirit of the italian people some of the worst and most brutal tradition of german discipline all this be alter later by general diaz and the orlando ministry -rrb- the dark and tragic story of the italian retreat be light up by many deed of heroism wherein the italian soldier show all he accustomed valor and it be only by the valor of the italian soldier that the retreat be stay on the piave line which the high command pronounce to be untenable and wish to abandon but which the cabinet at rome pin they faith to the quality of the italian soldier rather than to the opinion of the high command order to be hold at all hazard and the cabinet at rome be right the italian line stiffen and stand upon the piave while the ally reinforcement be still on the further side of the alp if only lloyd george and bissolatus have have they way and these reinforcement have be send a few month earlier if only we have be able to put a british army corps with its full complement of aircraft gun and shell against the hermada if only we have have half a dozen tank to send down the vippacco valley what a different story there would have be to tell \* \* \* \* \* we ourselves be out of the first stage of that great defense we have no ammunition and we be terribly short of gun store though the bare gun have all be save and we man be very short of steel helmet and box respirator and the boot and clothing of many be in a pitiful condition but a small supply of ammunition come through from france and it be decide to send one section of the battery into action on the piave and the remainder back to ferrara to refit all gun store and man 's equipment be to be pool and those go back be to be strip for the benefit of those go forward i remember very vividly we battery parade on the morning of the 4th of November when we have to take from some man they greatcoat and even they cap tunic and boot in order to make up some sort of equipment for the right section which be go forward with the major i be put in command of the left section strip bare for its journey to ferrara the evening before we departure i walk up and down the avenue outside we villa and talk with venosta who have do splendid work in the retreat he have hear from the survivor of a cavalry regiment who have pass back along the road a hour before that a turkish division be in udine and turkish cavalry in palmanova bulgarian also be say to be on this front rape after serb greek and rumanian italian also it be say that turk have be on faitus and volconiac at the end i have no sure evidence of this but if it be true the turk ' notorious incapacity for a offensive would help to explain we surprising escape what we have need all through the day of the retreat be enough rain to swell the river and make heavy the road what we have get after the first three day be brilliant sunshine the star in they course seem to be fight against italy dio uno ed unno say one italian bitterly chapter xxv ferrara arqua and the cornice road we reach ferrara at 5 be and drive in lorry from the railway station past the castello of the d'este to the palestro barrack the depôt of the 14th regiment of italian field artillery here we be to be lodge by the italian military authority we be receive with every consideration and great hospitality we man have excellent quarter in the barracks we officer be invite to have they meal in the italian artillery officer ' mess which be a large and comfortable place and where the food be not only good but very much cheaper than could have be get outside the colonel also offer to put ride horse at the disposal of any of we who should care to ride i be much strike by the sensible lack of ceremony of this italian mess by comparison with similar depôt mess in we own army there be no wait in the anteroom for senior officer who be late no ask permission of senior officer to leave the table early within the hour fix for meal everyone come in and out as they please there be no special table for the staff no rule against bring evening papers into dinner no aloofness no pomposity the only un-english formality be the habit of turn and bow as one leave the mess if a number of officer be still present and the universal italian custom by which a newcomer at he first appearance would walk round and shake hand in turn with all those whom he do not know and introduce himself to they by name we be also invite to become member during we stay of the circolo negoziantus or merchant ' club of ferrara this club have spacious premise in a old palazzo and be the warmest place in the town have a most efficient system of central heating ferrara be spread over a large area relatively to its population it have broad street and very few slum but it have come down in the world since the renaissance degenerate descendant of the d'este of that time strip many of the palazzo of they artistic beauty and sell they to help pay they debt ferrara be a city of old palazzo street after street of they inhabit mainly now by well-to-do peasant who take a pride in keep up they exterior one of the most interesting sight in the city be the palazzo schifanoium now use as a museum and contain fresco by cossa and cosimo tura but what most appeal to I be the superb western façade of the cathedral in peace time ferrara be prosperous though a little isolate from the main current of italian life it be the chief center of food distribution for this part of the country and be well know for its bakery it be also a important center for the hemp export trade after two day at ferrara i be choose to go to arquata scrivium a little town on the main line north of genoa this have be select as the base for the british force in italy and i be to get in touch with the ordnance people there to give they a list of we really urgent requirement and try to hasten they delivery so as to get we back into action as soon as possible siramo a italian artillery officer who be attach to we for _ liaison _ accompany I the ordinary passenger train for bologna be three and a half hour late special train be come through every ten minute from treviso and venice pack with refugee go southwards the organization of the italian railway at this time for clear the refugee from the right zone be exceedingly good siramo think that if venice have to be abandon the german and austrian would not damage it i feel no such security that night we stop at milan wild story of tradimento be in the air it be be say for instance that two general of the second army have be march through they troops in handcuffs under a guard of carabinierus it be also officially announce that diaz have replace cadorna in command of the italian army next day we reach arqua amid the tumble of the ligurian hill whose side be clothe with chestnut and oak and vine terrace we find british staff sanitary section and ordnance already in possession the ordnance be occupy a large villa just outside the town my old friend shield whom i have know at palmanova be there but most of the other be new arrival from france they be surprisingly full of cheerfulness as _ imboscatus _ be often apt to be even when thing be go badly at the front the italian disaster evidently mean very little to they they hardly realize it at all they be the first cheerful people i have see since the retreat begin and it be no doubt good for siramo and myself to be cheer up but it grate on both of we a little at my first interview i get the impression that the ordnance be surprisingly efficient and would be very prompt in give we what we want but i gradually discover that they really possess very little of what they first promise I and that nothing be know for certain as to when further store would arrive i telephone to ferrara that the immediate prospects be poor and be tell in reply to wait three or four day and see how much turn up have pester various ordnance officer to the limit of they endurance i therefore decide to go away for two day siramo go for two day to he family at turin and i take the train to genoa arrive in the early afternoon after lunch i set out to walk eastward along the cornice road it be a relief to my thought and feeling to be quite alone the day be windy and sunless and rather cold but the warm and audacious coloring of the villa and the little fishing village seem almost to draw sunshine out of the dull sky i stop at sturlum and drink two cup of coffee and eat some biscuit and decide to walk on to nervi it be now near the hour of sunset and the sun have keep invisible all day half break through the cloud turn they first red and then golden so the sky be when i come to quarto dei mille with its monument look out to sea that historic place whence garibaldus and the thousand set sail for they great adventure the liberation of sicily and naple and the unification of italy with british warship follow they some say by chance so that the enemy of italy dare not interrupt they passage then say i to myself stand all alone at quarto italy will not be defeat nor even mainly save from defeat by foreign aid the strongest and best of she child will pull she through even though they be not all the nation but the rest will do they share also and will follow when the bravest lead how young and how uncertain of herself as yet be italy and yet how lovable how well worth serve the german with they special gas and with other factor in they favor count on break not only the line of the second army but the morale of the italian people for a moment they seem to have succeed in the darkest day i talk with many whose stuffing seem all go but then with the promise of ally help with the sight of even a handful of new french and british uniform and under the spell of the oratory of they statesman and they journalist thing begin to change and italian heart grow brave again the italian be a mercurial people if they be more easily cast down by defeat than we british they be more easily encourage by even the distant prospect of victory and they react to influence that would leave we unmoved the coarse insult of the enemy press be everywhere angrily quote and the national spirit rise to a red glow of passion the socialist turatus and treve -- the latter the author of the famous phrase nessuno in trincee quest ' inverno -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- who before caporetto have criticise the war as aggressive imperialist and unnecessary say now that all italian must unite and fight on to drive back the invader from italian soil and cool brain such as nittus and einaudus reinforce all this with logical demonstration of the economic impossibility of a separate peace with the enemy power strain to the utmost by the blockade and italy dependent on the ally for ship food and coal the german would have do far more wisely if instead of attack they have aim only at hold the italian army along its old line -lrb- footnote 1 : no one in the trench this winter -rrb- i walk on from quarto to nervus and as it be get dark i decide to take a tram for the last few kilometre but all the tram be stand still the current have be switch off for several hour so i stand on the step of a tram and talk to the conductor about the war and try to cheer he up by tell he that the german be on they last leg and be make they last great effort and that the ally have only to hold together a little longer and throw sufficient force against the enemy here in italy in order to see a far bigger and more precipitate and disastrous retreat than caporetto and next time in the other direction all this i not only say but firmly believe -lrb- and it all come true within a year -rrb- at first he be very despondent but he warm up as i proceed and begin to gesticulate again and regain animation and compliment I on my italian and then the current also be restore and the tram move on and we come to nervi where i dine well and sleep at the albergo cristoforo colombo i be not in general a admirer of palm tree but they be sometimes impressive in the dusk towering over one 's head as they do at nervus in the long mixed avenue of palm and orange tree which lead down to the station from the town next morning i get up early and walk back towards genoa along the via marina the sun be shine on the sea and the dark rock the stone pine and the great aloe and the brightly color villa there be a exhilaration in the air and i be in the midst of beauty and for the first time for many day i be for a little while really happy later on i take a tram back to genoa and walk up to the tall lighthouse on the further side of the town and look westward at the great curve of the shore beyond the breakwater and the sand in some of the station along the line be placard long live great old england welcome to the valiant british army vive la france vive la victorieuse armée de verdun the first of the ally reinforcement be arrive at arqua station i meet a advance party of the northumberland fusilier they tell I that they have be quite move by they wonderful welcome on the way through italy and by all the hospitality show to they officer and man at the station where they have stop it give I a queer thrill to see british infantryman again after many month and this time on italian soil \* \* \* \* \* after various order and counter-order i leave arqua for ferrara on the 16th with two truckload of store but this be only a very small proportion of the minimum which we require chapter xxvi refit at ferrara i get back to ferrara on the evening of November 17th and share a bedroom with jeune who have return from leave in england have miss all we most unpleasant experience we brother officer of the italian field artillery be very hospitable and courteous to we through those week of wait we could do nothing till the ordnance send we gun store from arqua and these dribble in very slowly a few odds and end at a time i often go out ride on the piazza d'arme and along the rampart and in the country round ferrara with italian officer day be still very anxious and the news from the front not always good and one rather avoid talk about the war but one evening at dinner i succeed in pierce the polite reserve of a little captain who be sit next to I italy should have make it a condition of she intervention he say that the other ally should have send troops to the italian front also more gun and war material italy at the beginning of she war have many hero but few gun the other ally equally with italy be without statesman you lloyd george be energetic but -- the british be not really at war with austrium they have soft sentiment towards she and do not want she to lose too much the jugo-slav propaganda be at its height and be be encourage in pari and london at the very moment when italy be be press by the french and british to enter the war we have make too many offensive on we own unaided cadorna should have refuse but he go on and on he sacrifice thousand of life uselessly he demand too much of he troops he do not understand they this last disaster be cause by croat and bulgarian who speak italian perfectly have live among we and take degree at we university get through we line in the first confusion dress in italian uniform and send false telephone message and signal in we own cipher order a general retreat -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be man from -- -lrb- 2 -rrb- who first run away at rombon and tolmino it have be often prove in the history of we country that those man have no courage italian have too little unity -lrb- footnote 1 : i hear this story many time and i believe this be one of the cause of the rapid increase of the first confusion the austrian have try this trick without success against the third army on the carso as have the german against we in france there must obviously be a certain amount of confusion already exist if the trick be to have any chance of succeed -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : a certain province in italy not he own -rrb- he go on to speak of economic difficulty italy be poor he say and the ally be rich yet coal cost four time as much in italy as in france and shipping be hardly to be have we government have never drive hard enough bargain with the other ally after all italy come into the war as a volunteer and not under the conscription of old treaty but the ally give she no credit for this the french since the war begin have recover all they old ` blague ' they talk incessantly of what they have do and despise everyone else but look how unstable they be politically they change they ministry as often as some man change they mistress the pope too be a enemy of italy and a friend of austrium he aim at the restoration of he temporal power many of the priest go about both before and after caporetto try to betray they country some tell the soldier that god have send the disaster of caporetto to show they the folly and the sinfulness of love they corruptible country here below in poor earthly italy better than the incorruptible country of all good catholic god 's eternal kingdom in the sky he speak bitterly as be not unnatural i make the acquaintance also in the mess of a medical officer name rossus in peace time a university professor of nervous pathology who be now in charge of a hospital for nervosus or shell-shock case four mile outside the town one afternoon jeune and i accept a invitation to visit this hospital we drive out to it in a carrozza accompany by rossus and a young woman who go there daily to teach some of the illiterate patient to read and write no one can begin to understand what modern war mean without some personal acquaintance with shell-shock case they be especially for non-combatant the most instructive of all the fruit of war much more instructive than dead body or man without limb and then have watch and talk or try to talk with a variety of these still live creature let any man even a profiteer or a theologian look into he heart and ask himself whether he really agree with the chaplain whom i have already quote that three or four year of war may be tremendously worth while it need a greater pen than mine to do justice to all we see that afternoon for we go through all the ward and see all the sight there be to see we see a young lieutenant with large stare eye sit up in bed when we approach he he jump round in he bed very violently as though he body have be shoot out of a gun and go on stare at we speechless and with eye full of wild terror we see two soldier in the corner of a ward they head wobble in perfect rhythm ceaselessly from side to side like the pendulum of a clock with dead expressionless face we see man cower beneath they bed clothes tremble with a endless terror we see a man who for month have quite lose he speech and be now just able to whisper almost inaudibly papa and mama a middle-aged man with a beard we see a man with frightened eye like a child in a nightmare with many of the outward sign of have be gas struggle for breath gesticulate feebly try to ward off some imaginary blow he have not be gas but wound in the head he be alone in a blue ward where all we face look yellow we see a youth lie asleep white as a sheet and with hardly any flesh leave on he bone he have be asleep for two month without ever wake we see a splendid tall bearded man a cavalry captain with a deep voice and a firm handgrip who could realize the present but have forget all the past we see a multitude of minor trembler and man undergo electrical treatment for paralysis and stiffness of various limb one little man another university professor who be almost paralyse in both leg try to advance to meet we and nearly fall forward on the ground at we foot i speak also to a young man with a paralyse back and leave arm i say i hope he would soon be better yes he say i hope soon to go back to the front for a moment i think this be irony address to a countryman of mr lloyd george but it be not he really mean it we go into the convalescent ' mess there be about twenty present smile and very gentle and quiet like man who be not yet quite sure of the world one elderly man a medical captain say to I very softly that it be a great pleasure to see visitor from the outside especially we ally at that moment i could easily have weep such sight as i have see do not physically sicken nor even much horrify I they just tauten all my nerve and make I feel that all my question be impertinent and all my good wish flat and empty and that i resemble a visitor to a zoo on the way back to ferrara we talk of literature and rossus base himself chiefly on well and kipling say that the english judge by they modern writer seem to be a race logical but a little isolated two day later the major and the right section of the battery come to ferrara be replace on the piave by a section of another battery on the 1st of December british infantry belong to the xivth corps move into the line for the first time take over the montello sector to the south of the italian fourth army this sector be to be hold by british troops for four month but it be worth while again to emphasise the fact that nearly a month have now elapse since the great retreat have be bring to a end by the unaided effort of italian troops the situation now seem well in hand and a further break not at all likely there have be a striking scene in the italian chamber about this time when the prime minister orlando announce that high military opinion have be oppose to the holding of the piave line recommend a further retreat to the line of the mincio or the adige or even the po which would have involve the surrender of venice padua vicenza and verona but the cabinet at rome have reject these recommendation and order that the piave line should be hold at all cost and the valor of the italian common soldier have triumph over the foreboding of the general on the 8th we re-equipment be at last complete we be warn to join the xith british corps on the arrival of we transport the end of we stay at ferrara be now in sight and we last day be full of parting the major tell I how one morning a little old man apparently a artisan run after he down the road and speak excellent french say how fine the british soldier look and how splendid the news of the capture of jerusalem be and then insist on he go into a café and drink a glass of vermouth with he and on parting hold he hand for several moment gaze into he eye with a look of affection and pride on the 9th a little ceremony take place in the artillery mess where the british officer present a silver cup suitably inscribe to they brother officer of the italian artillery there be a large gathering my own major who be in command of british troops at ferrara make the presentation and the italian commandant make a eloquent reply on the 10th i tell the page boy at the circolo that the future of the world be in the hand of himself and the rest of the young and that they must see to it that there be no more war this speech make he open he big brown eye a bit wider i have often talk to this boy before and he be i think rather interested in I think I no doubt a queer and unusual sort of person he use to steal moment to come and enter into conversation with I when none of the older club servant be in sight if any of they appear in the distance he use to pretend that i have call he for the purpose of order a drink and bolt to the bar on the 11th another presentation ceremony take place this time at the circolo those of we who have enjoy honorary membership here present to the club two small silver clock the major again make a short speech and the president of the club reply express the hope that the hour might be short which these clock would record before the hour of final victory the cordiality of all the member of the club at this meeting be very memorable one old gentleman of 76 year of age tell I that i be the very image of he son who be serve at the front in the artillery and with tear in he eye kiss I on both cheek permit this sign of affection he say see that here we be in the midst of friend that afternoon a few of we have tea for the last time at finzus 's a favorite haunt of mine between the castello and the cathedral after i have say a few word of farewell signor finzus say to I in one of those perfectly turn compliment which italian always pay to foreigner endeavor to speak they language lei parla la lingua di dante -lrb- 1 -rrb- and signora finzus give to each of we a small italian flag -lrb- footnote 1 : you speak the language of dante -rrb- that night we transport arrive and we departure be fix for the follow morning the 12th of December be a day that i shall vividly remember for the rest of my life we leave ferrara about 1 pm after one of the most enthusiastic demonstration i have ever see that morning the town have be placard far and wide with the follow poster : -- _ comitato di preparazione civile _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- cittadinus stamane alle ore undicus e trenta -lrb- 1130 -rrb- gli artiglieri inglesi muoveranno dal quartiere palestro diretti alia stazione ferroviaria essi partono verso il fronte per difendere coglus eroicus soldatus d'italium e di

rampart which be form by the breast of the soldier of three nation fellow citizen we invite you to be present and to salute we brave and faithful ally they should be make to feel that you heart in unison with theirs throb with hope and faith -rrb- by eleven o'clock a large crowd be already gather outside the barracks at half-past we march out into the street in front of we go the municipal brass band gay with cock ' feather and school-child carry four banner on long flagstaff there be tumultuous cheer and clap from a dense crowd flower be shower upon we and a very handsome girl give I a bouquet of red rose the band play impossible march music so that we be not able to keep much of a step but the enthusiasm be intense spectator throng all the window overlook we route and the cheer crowd stretch thick and unbroken along both side of the street all the way i notice a specially enthusiastic group on the step of the castello and several busy photographer in between the effort of the band we man sing outside the station we march past the italian general command the district then we be halt and the general make a speech i happen to look round and find standing beside I look up at I wide-eyed and wonder the page boy from the circolo whom i have harangue on the destiny of the world 's youth and afterwards tip the band be play over and over again at short interval god save the king the marcium reale the marseillaise the brabançonne and the marcium deglus alpinus whenever any of these national anthem be play all the troops stand at attention and we officer at the salute then a little man with a black beard and a eager manner step forward and mount a chair and on behalf of the association of italian teacher wish we good luck he speak in english he tell we that he wife be a

such a little piece of ribbon as a talisman cut off the same roll and that it have always keep he safe and that it would keep the british soldier safe too the note be sign tua madrina -lrb- you god-mother -rrb- at last it seem that everyone be aboard and the train start but it be then discover that the major jeune and manzonus have be leave behind not expect the train to start so soon they have chase it for a hundred yard down the line but fail to catch it up so the stationmaster telephone to rovigo to stop the train there till the three miss one arrive which they ultimately do ride on a engine specially place at they disposal so end we stay at ferrara in a blaze of wild enthusiasm and i believe that collectively we leave a very good impression behind we part v a year of resistance and of preparation chapter xxvii in strategic reserve we train reach cittadellum shortly after dusk we interview a british rto who have only take up he duty five minute ' before we arrival and so not unnaturally know nothing about we the major propose that the train should be put into a siding and that we should spend the night in it this be do we go into cittadellum but find everything in complete darkness most of the house sandbag and all shop cafés and inn close at dusk by order of the military we succeed however in get a meal of sort and then go back to the train and turn in early we be wake up a little after midnight by two british staff officer who be very vague and ignorant but tell we to go next morning to san martino di lupari a little village midway between cittadellum and castelfranco this we do and find pretty good billet monte grappa loom over we to the north deep in snow i do not go into cittadellum by daylight but only see its battlemented outer wall then for a few day nothing happen except that everyone seem to have catch a cold we be now part of the xith british corps who be concentrate in the surround district and form for the moment a strategic reserve which might be send anywhere accord to the development of the situation if nothing particular happen we should probably go into the line south of the xivth british corps on the piave if on the other hand the italian be drive back in the mountain to the north of we or be force to retire down the brenta valley -- and this danger have not yet quite pass -- we should move up the mountain and take over part of the italian line with the french probably on we right we receive tracing of several possible line of defense on the plain itself and on the near side of the mountain crest describe as the blue line the green line etc which we be require to reconnoitre with a view to find battery position and op 's they be all very awkward line to defend as the enemy would have splendid observation and we practically none at all on the 15th the major go out in the car reconnoitring to the east he meet some alpinus on the road to whom he say fa bel tempo -lrb- 1 -rrb- and they reply le montagne sono sempre belle -lrb- 2 -rrb- also a old man who have never see british soldier before and be tremendously excited and pleased and shout with joy -lrb- footnote 1 : it be beautiful weather -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the mountain be always beautiful -rrb- on the 16th the major go out again with jeune and myself to look for battery position for the defense of the line at the foot of the mountain we go through cittadellum and bassano then southwards along the brenta to nove and then back through marostica and bassano bassano be a delightful old town with many fresco remain on the outer wall of the house and a beautiful covered-in wooden bridge over the brenta marostica charm I even more its battlemented wall be like those of cittadellum and castelfranco but in a better state of preservation and more picturesque run up a rocky foothill behind the town and come down again -- a most curious effect these alpine foothill for shape and vegetation be very like the ligurian hill north of genoa and round arqua at san trinità just outside bassano on the road to marostica be a very fine cypress avenue there be a possible battery position here i notice also a row of cypress stand at interval of about fifty yard along a hillside dark and tall amid a mass of grass and rock and brown fall leave the weather be clear and cold but the snow have shrink to subnormal on the foothill the weather god be still favor the enemy it be very still though occasionally shell burst over the grappa but the hill muffle the sound beyond they on the way back we pass a battalion of alpinus march up many of they very young i thought of the duke of aosta 's latest message to the undefeated third army : a voi veterani del carso ed a vous giovanus soldati fioritura della perenne primavera italica -lrb- 1 -rrb- splendid alpinus they be never false to they regimental motto di quì non si passa -lrb- 2 -rrb- they never fail but nearly all the first alpinus who go forth to battle in may 1915 be dead now -lrb- footnote 1 : to you veteran of the carso and to you young soldier flower of the eternal italian spring -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : no one pass here -rrb- on the 20th i go out in a side-car with winterton to look for position in the hill above marostica reconnaissance of the back line be now to be discontinue a sign we hope of diminish apprehension and a improve military situation at san trinità on the way back we collide with a italian wagon and have to stop for repair a number of italian gather round one of whom i discover to be a priest conscribe to serve with the medical corps i bantered this man in a friendly way about secret drinking and the confessional and woman and paradise cause uproarious delight among the bystander and the priest take it all in excellent part on the 22nd we hear that irrespective of the movement of the rest of the corps a special group of heavy artillery be to be form include ourselves to be lend to the italian fourth army in the mountain there begin to be rumor of a offensive on we part on the 23rd we make a reconnaissance up the mountain to look for position we start through bassano which the austrian have begin to shell the day before with long range gun start a trickle pitiful exodus of terrify civilian just before reach marostica we strike up a valley run northwards past vallonara the road soon begin to rise more steeply it be a war road broad and of splendid surface one of those many achievement of the italian engineer which entitle they to rank easily first among the engineer of the great european army -lrb- 1 -rrb- before the war this road have be in part a mere mule track in part non-existent we go through a number of little alpine village crosara tortima fontanellus rubbio we have soon rise more than three thousand foot above the plain which lay far beneath spread out gloriously like a richly color carpet green white and brown through which run two broad twist silver thread the river brenta and astico there have be more than a hundred bend in the road up to this point but the gradient be never uncomfortably steep snow lay thick on the higher level and the pine and fir tree be all snow-crowned sometimes the road run along the edge of rocky gorge drop sheer for hundred of foot below with a great mountain wall on the other hand rise sheer above we the air grow perceptibly colder as we mount higher -lrb- footnote 1 : i have see it state by a impartial authority that there have be no roadmaking in war time to compare with that of the italian on the alpine and the isonzo front and in albanium since the napoleonic war a distinguished british engineer with great experience of roadmaking in many country have also tell I that in he opinion the swede be the best roadmaker in the world the italian a close second and the rest of the world some way behind -rrb- we turn out of view of the plain over undulating snow field and down a long valley and come out on a small plateau screen by a gradual ridge from the eye of the enemy here we provisionally choose a battery position close to a small solitary house know as casa girardi on the edge of a pine wood all round italian gun be firing in the snow we go on to col d'astiago which would be we probable op the summit command a wonderful view of the high mountain to the northward longara and fior columbara and meletta di gallio and the sheer rock face of the brenta gorge and the stream far below and the great mass of the grappa rise beyond as we come down lorry load of italian troops pass we go up alpinus bersaglieri arditus and man of the 152nd infantry regiment they cheer we wildly as they pass wave they cap and cry avanti avantus viva l'inghilterra viva gli alleatus and as the string of lorry turn round and round the spiral curve of the road now high above we they be cheer and wave still until they disappear from view \* \* \* \* \* the battery eat they christmas dinner at san martino though the air have be thick with talk of a immediate move on this as on other occasion the major make a excellent speech in the course of which he say : you will be go very soon into a place where before this war no one would have dream that siege artillery could go you be the first british battery to be in action in italy and you will probably be the first british battery to be in action in the alp we shall be very uncomfortable at any rate for a time but we shall pull through all right as we always have before it will be a honor to be proud of and a experience to remember for the rest of we life and i know that whatever happen to we in this coming year you will all behave as splendidly in the future as you have always do in the past the enemy be do a good deal of night bombing at this period treviso and padua be attack with great persistency so much so that the british ghq decide to move from the latter city to some smaller and more peaceful place we use to hear the bombing plane come over nearly every night and explosion more or less distant they bomb bassano cittadellum and castelfranco the latter especially because the french have they headquarters there but luckily they leave san martino alone think it too small to worry about there seem to be no anti-aircraft defence anywhere but we air force soon mitigate the nuisance by raiding they aerodrome and bring down a number of hostile plane in air fight we staff again bring themselves into notice at christmas by alter we official address from bef italy to italian expeditionary force i hear that the distinguished general who introduce this reform estimate that it would hasten victory by several month but the stupid soldier and they stupid relative at home have get into the habit of use the abbreviation bef shorten the new address to ief and the stupid postal people begin to send the letter to indium and then the distinguished general have to issue another order point out that this abbreviation be unauthorised and that this practice must cease in the midst of such excitement the new year begin and the major be award the dso for work on the carso he be as delighted as a child and i too be very glad this decoration even more than most other have be much too freely dish out during this war among quite undeserving people who have simply make a art of play up to they official superior the major however have always be something of a thorn in the side of various headquarters and seldom hesitate to speak he mind both to and of colonel and general and staff officer generally for this reason and also for other i consider that he deserve a dso a great deal more than many who receive one chapter xxviii the first british battery up the mountain the major 's word be soon to come true after many of those delay and conflict order of which the victim of war time staff work have profuse experience on the 7th of January we move up the mountain into the position previously select near casa girardi we be the first british battery to go up two other and a brigade headquarters be to follow when it have be see how we get on when in doubt try it on the dog it begin to snow as we come into marostica and we have great difficulty with the lorry even on gentle gradient the road be frozen hard and in place very slippery we manage however to reach casa girardi before nightfall and find that we advance party have put up some wooden hut and cut some tree for fuel all that night the snow come down in cloud but the next day and the next few follow be very fine the sun shine all day long from a cold cloudless sky upon a waste of flash snow with here and there tree stick out of it and strange red morning light in the sky behind it and sweeping wind across it and in the sunset the white hillside slowly change to a mauve pink it be a scene of wonderful beauty but the temperature be ten degree below zero one day at noon and the next day twenty-four below zero at 9 be and nine above zero at noon these condition be disconcert to good shooting the lower temperature not have be contemplate by those who compile we range table in england but we get all four gun satisfactorily register by the second day to the evident pleasure of the italian colonel under whose command we be temporarily place this man have a somewhat ferocious appearance and a reputation for great rudeness both to he superior and he subordinate in the military hierarchy it be say that but for this he would long ago have be a general to we however he show he politer side pat the major on the back and repeat several time buon sistema buon sistema the physical discomfort of those early day be great but we be full of buoyancy and health everything freeze hard during the night one 's boot one 's clothing if damp when take off the ink in one 's fountain pen in the morning water pour into a basin freeze hard in a couple of minute and the lather freeze on one 's face before one have time to shave the major breaking through one of the most fundamental tradition of the british army announce that no one need shave more than once in three day the morning after we arrival we have a discouraging breakfast no fire could be get to burn and no tea have be make there be nothing to eat except a few very hard ration biscuit and some egg boil hard the night before and now freeze through and through one crack the shell and find icicle beneath and miserably hold fragment of egg in one 's mouth until they thaw but gradually by patient work and organization these early trouble be surmount the whole battery have be provide with italian greatcoat and other italian mountain equipment -- white alpine boot line with fur alpenstock spike snow grip which could be fasten on to one 's boot like skate and white clothing to put on over the top of everything else to render we invisible against a snowy background i use to hear some amusing comment in the battery on we alpine situation this be the sort of thing you see picture of in book but i suppose folk would pay quid in peace time to see this why it be like a bloom cook 's tour be the first of the british who have be see in these part we be object of great interest to the italian who use to collect in crowd to watch we gun firing we become great friend with the member of a mixed mess not far away consist of two anti-aircraft battery and the personnel in charge of a large ammunition dump between this mess and we own there be frequent exchange of hospitality one day a italian general 's car skid into a ditch close to we position we supply a party of man to get it out again and the general thank we ask if there be anything we want the major tell he that we should like two or three more hut and two good stove for cook a few day later these be deliver by the italian authority we own brigade commander who have now follow we up the mountain with he two other battery notice these thing and ask how we have come by they when we tell he he seem displeased and next day we get a official letter to inform we that it have come to notice that british unit have in some case recently be approach the italian authority direct this practice be irregular and must cease indent must be submit through the proper channel we smile and obey but we keep we hut and stove which be better than any which we should have be likely to get through the proper channel we be very short of water except snow water there be only one waterpoint for all troops within several mile here there be a long queue wait most of the day it be probably not generally know that it take ten dixie full of snow when melt down to make one dixie full of water for this and for hygienic reason snow water be not much use to we we be not at this time require to fire very much but we be warn to get acquaint with the surrounding country as a action of some importance might be come off before long this provide the occasion for several reconnaissance on January 15th the major and i go up monte costahmga a few mile to the west it be a ziz-zag scramble track and it be thaw enough to make everything rather unpleasant but we gain some useful new knowledge on the 24th jeune together with a italian officer a telephonist and myself make a long day of it start early we be on the top of costalunga about 9 o'clock be give a guide by a italian field battery on the summit and go on along a mountain road command a magnificent view to cima echar here be a good op from which i get my first sight of monte sisemol and asiago of which part of the _ campanile _ be at that time still stand but it be bring down by italian shell fire very soon afterwards i remember think that the whole asiago plateau should be easy to retake if we only bring up enough gun later on i begin to realize that it would not be as easy as it look it be impossible to get telephonic communication with the battery from cima echar so we could not as we have hope do from there some registration on wire and trench junction on sisemol which be among we allotted target we therefore go back to costalunga where the italian field and mountain battery along the crest be firing away with great vigor and after a excellent lunch which have be hospitably prepare for we go down again into the valley and walk several mile further west to monte tondo i notice at lunch as on several other occasion lately a change in the italian attitude to good weather they no longer hope that it would break and so prevent further austrian offensive they hope it would continue and so permit offensive of they own they morale be rapidly rise we have indeed receive the previous day the artillery portion of a elaborate offensive plan but no date have yet be fix for it we climb up monte tondo and down the other side and make we way to a op in a front line trench for fifty yard of the way there be a break in the trench line and we have to run across the open through knee-deep snow but the austrian do not fire from this op we have again a fine view of asiago and the country round it after delay connect with the telephone we succeed in register two target while we be firing all the wood and house grow rosy in the sunset it be dark when we finish we go back with a major of the pisa brigade a quiet spare little man of great energy and exhausting speed of movement he give we coffee and show we map at he brigade headquarters and then send we on to the regimental headquarters further down the hill where they give we rum punch believe as all italian do that a englishman be never happy unless he be drink alcohol we get back to the battery in the moonlight on January 27th the long expect action begin and we brigade lose one of its best officer who be hit in the head in the front line op on monte tondo he steel helmet and the skill of italian doctor just save he life but he be permanently out of the war the italians put they best doctor right forward in the advanced dress station all that day we bombard enemy battery and cross road and barb wire next morning the italian infantry carry col valbellum and col d'echele by assault the day after they take also col del rosso and beat back very heavy counter-attack the sassarus brigade and a brigade of bersaglierus specially distinguish themselves it be a important and useful success it considerably improve we line between the asiago plateau and val brenta it deprive the enemy of the secure use of the val frenzelum and it be the first offensive operation of any importance undertake by the italian since the great retreat its success go to prove that the italian army have be effectively reorganise and that its morale be again high from my sleep hut and from the battery command post i use to hear for day afterwards the italian infantry singing in great chorus far into the night there be triumph in they song and there be ribaldry and there be longing i think i know what dream be in they heart and if i be right those dream be also mine the advance leave we a long way behind the new front line and we expect to move we gun forward indeed we select and ask to be allow to occupy a very good position behind montagna nuova but this be not allow and we stay where we be for another six week it snow a great deal and we fire very little but we have plenty to do to keep pathway dig between the gun and the hut often we have to clear these afresh every hour during this time i make the acquaintance of several interesting italian and frenchman among these be colonel buccus who have be attach the year before to the staff of one of the british army in france he be now in command of a regiment of field artillery include a group of battery know as the garibaldian battery which be always place at they own request in the most forward position i hear that when he take over this command he send for all he officer and say now here we be some old man and some young man and two or three boy and we be all here for the same purpose and i hope we shall all be always the best of good friend but as a matter of convenience someone have get to be in command of the other and i have be choose because i be the oldest he use to tell a amusing story of a encounter he have in france with a british officer from one of the dominion who walk into he bedroom late one night after a liberal consumption of liquor and say he want the fire and ask if buccus be that portuguese buccus have persuasively but vainly ask he to go away get out of bed and genially take he by the shoulder -- he be a powerful man -- run he out into the passage whereat the british officer surprised and protest say you have no business to treat I like that do not you see that i be a major and have three decoration point to he left breast yes say buccus and i be a colonel and i have some decoration too but i do not wear they on my nighty and i want to go to sleep he have be in gorizium before caporetto and have keep as a melancholy souvenir the map show the line of he own regiment 's retreat i call it the via cruci he say i want to go back i want to see a advance across the piave with cavalry and field artillery i want to advance at the gallop i have apply to be send down there he be a natural leader of man and i feel that i would willingly follow he anywhere we see a good deal too of the officer of a french observation balloon one of they officer be a tall man promote from the rank with big upturned moustache a delightful smile and twinkling eye he smoke more cigar than any man i have ever meet he smoke they like some man smoke cigarette one after another all the evening with no interval between he come from marseille another be from auvergne always most elegantly dress he never smoke at all for he be very proud of he white tooth he speak italian and german but no english a third be a little blonde alsatian business man he be usually rather quiet but one evening i see he rouse when someone have say something that displeased he about alsace then he show we that he could be eloquent when he choose they be very implacable these frenchman undoubtedly clemenceau speak in they name when he say my war aim be victory another frenchman say to I once when clemenceau be speak no one dare to interrupt for they know it be the voice of the soldier at the front speaking and one can scarcely wonder that they be implacable in alsace-lorraine and in the occupied territory of northern france they say that it be know with complete certainty that the daughter and wife and widow of many french officer and man have be compel to take up they abode in brothel and there to await at all hour of the day and night the visit of they country 's enemy be it surprising that certain french regiment know these thing never take prisoner and can one fail to admire even if one do not unconditionally agree with the soldier who would fight on and on until everyone have be kill rather than accept anything less than a complete victory it be all but impossible for a foreigner to measure the spiritual effect upon a proudly and self-consciously civilised frenchman of these unpardonable brain-rending heart-stabbing provocation but the statesman at home who draw good pay and living in comfort far behind the front be ever ready to declare that he country shall continue to bleed in she glory be a less admirable spectacle it be he business to conceive some subtler and more comprehensive war aim than bare military victory and to make sure that when he have die safely in he bed and be forget other man shall not have to do over again the work which he complacently bungle a fight soldier who risk he life daily may speak brave word which be indecent on the lip of a _ imboscato _ whether military or civilian chapter xxix the asiago plateau about the middle of march the british division move up from the montello to the asiago plateau and all the british heavy artillery be concentrate in the asiago sector we therefore move six mile to the west and find ourselves in support of british and no longer of italian infantry we brigade cease to be a trench-punching and become a counter-battery brigade most of we work in future be to be in close co-operation with we own air force my battery be destine to remain here with two short interlude for seven month it be in many way a very interesting sector the british hold the line between the italian on they left and the french on they right to the right of the french be more italian the move have amusing feature one compare the demeanor of the lorry driver of different nationality the scared face of some of the british the first time they have to come up the hundred odd corkscrew turn on the mountain road take sidelong glance at bird 's eye view of distant town and river on the plain below be rather comical even the self-consciously efficient and outwardly imperturbable french stick like limpet to the center of the road and would not give a inch to staff car hoot they gut out behind they the italian driver on the other hand accustom to the mountain dash round sharp corner at full speed avoid innumerable collision by a fraction of a inch terrifying and infuriate they more cautious ally but i only once see a serious collision here in the course of many month the asiago plateau be some eight mile long from west to east with a average breadth of two to three mile from north to south on it lie a number of village and small town of which the largest be asiago itself which lie at the eastern end of the plateau and before the war have a population of about 8000 asiago be the terminus of a light railway run down the mountain to schio the chief occupation of the inhabitant of the plateau have be wood-cutting and pasture in asiago be several sawmill and a military barracks army maneuver use often to take place in this area which give special opportunity for the combined practice of mountain fighting and operation on the flat it be moreover within seven mile of the old austrian frontier asiago be hardly know before the war to foreign tourist but many italian use to visit it especially for winter sport across the plateau from north to south run the val d'assa which near the southern edge have become only a narrow gulley turn away westwards the assa stream flow finally into the river astico the ghelpac stream which flow through the town of asiago join the assa at its western turn apart from these two stream the plateau be not well water in summer when the snow have melt water be even scarcer on the surround mountain all we drinking water have to be pump up through pipe from the plain the plateau be bound at its eastern end by monte sisemol which stand at the head of the val frenzelum which in turn run eastward into the val brenta near the little town of valstagna sisemol be of no great height and be not precipitous it have a round brown top when the snow uncover it but it be a maze of wire and trench and a very strong point militarily there have be very bitter fight for its possession last November and it have remain in austrian hand at the western end the plateau be bound by the descent to the val d'astico on the northern side of the plateau rise a formidable mountain range the chief height of which from west to east be monte campolungo monte erio monte mosciagh and monte longara this range be thickly wood with pine among which we gun do great damage i always more regret the destruction of tree than of uninhabited house for the latter can be the more quickly replace this range be pierce by only four valley through each of which run road vital to the austrian system of communication the val campomulo the val di nos the val d'assa and the val di martello the austrian have also a few road over the top of the mountain but these be less good and less convenient along the southern side of the plateau run another ridge less mountainous than the ridge to the north and completely in we possession this ridge also be thickly wood and pierce by only a few valley and road the road we come to know best be the continuation of the wonderful road up from the plain through granezza to the cross-road at prium dell ' acqua and on through the baerenthal valley to san sisto thence it lead through the front line trench into the town of asiago itself at prium dell ' acqua a most misleading name where there be no water but only a collection of wooden hut another road branch off westwards run parallel to the front line behind the southern ridge of the plateau the italian engineer have create a magnificent network of road in this sector of the front before the war there have be only one road into asiago from the plain now there be half a dozen all broad and with a fine surface capable of take any traffic and in addition there be many transverse road equally good join up and cut across the main route at convenient point when the british troops take over this sector in march the whole plateau properly so call be in austrian hand it have be take last November in the mountain offensive which follow caporetto at one perilous moment the austrian have hold san sisto and they patrol have pass prium dell ' acqua but they have be throw back by italian counter-attack to the line they now hold we front line run along the southern edge of the plateau and on the right along the lower slope of the southern ridge just inside the pine wood on the leave further west it run mostly on the flat and more in the open where the val d'assa turn west we front line run on one side of the shallow gulley and the austrian on the other the austrian front line be completely in the open the first house of asiago be only a few hundred yard behind it from the defensive point of view we line be very strong and the trench particularly at the eastern end very good deeply blast in the rock the wooded ridge run close behind we front line all the way completely hide from the enemy all movement in we rear he could get no observation here except by aircraft even movement in we front line owe to the tree be largely invisible at a distance and owe to the lie of the ground large part of no man 's land could be see from we own trench but from nowhere in the enemy 's line with the result that we be able to post machine gun trench mortar and even for a short time a field battery there without be detect until these weapon have serve they immediate purpose we system of transport supply and relief of the troops in the line could therefore be carry out at any hour of the day or night with almost complete disregard of the enemy he intermittent shell of the road be perfectly blind and haphazard and seldom do we any damage he on the other hand be in a very undesirable situation not only be he front line all the way in full view from we various ground op 's but a long stretch of flat country several mile broad behind he front line be equally in view only a few small fold in the ground be invisible from all point along we ridge we could see also most of the nearer slope of the northern ridge though here the thick wood and break in the hillside give he greater opportunity for concealment take into account therefore ground observation only we have he at a tremendous disadvantage he dare not move nor show himself in daylight behind he line and be compel to carry out all he supply and troop movement at night or during fog that might lift at any moment one french battery do no other work except sweep up and down he road throughout the hour of darkness and it be obvious that the probable damage do in this way be far greater than anything he could hope to do to we take into account the possibility of observation from the air the balance in we favor become even greater we have a strong superiority in the air whenever it be worth we while to enforce it partly because we airman be individually superior to the austrian and partly because we have more and better machine we pilot often fly over the northern ridge both to observe and to bomb but the enemy seldom cross the southern ridge he anti-aircraft battery be however at least as good as ours and in my opinion better most of we pre-arranged counter-battery shoot be carry out with aeroplane observation against enemy battery situate in the thick wood on the slope of the northern ridge the airman fly backwards and forwards over the target and send we he observation by wireless but it be often necessary to spend more than half of the four hundred round allot to a normal counter-battery shoot in destroy the tree round the target before the airman could get a good view of it fly however be always difficult on the plateau especially during the winter and more difficult for we man than for theirs since there be no feasible landing-place behind we line we nearest aerodrome be down on the plain and a big expenditure of petrol be require to get the airman up the mountain and actually over the plateau and also to get he down again the time during which he could keep in the air for observation be therefore very limited weather condition on the plateau moreover be often very unfavourable for fly even in the spring and summer the practical importance of we superiority in the air be thus smaller than might have be expect from the defensive point of view then we position be pretty strong but the sector be important and might at any time become critical and much depend upon its successful defense for the mountain wall that guard the italian plain have be worn very thin in this neighborhood by the austrian success of last year a austrian advance of another few mile would bring the enemy over the edge of the mountain with the plain beneath in full view further defense would then become extremely difficult and costly and the whole situation as regard relative superiority of position and observation now so greatly in we favor would be more than reverse we be too near the edge to have any elbow room or freedom of maneuver we present position be almost the last that we could hope to hold without very grave embarrassment it would have seem evident then that to obtain more elbow room and security we should not be content with a defensive policy but should aim at gain ground and thicken the mountain wall by means of a early local offensive even if larger operation be not yet practicable but from the offensive point of view we position present great difficulty to make only a small advance would leave we worse off than now merely to go out into the middle of the plateau merely to reoccupy the ruin of asiago would be futile except for a very slight and transitory moral effect to carry the whole plateau and establish a line along the lower slope of the northern ridge would be no better we should only be take over the difficulty of the enemy in respect of he expose position while he would escape from these difficulty and obtain a immunity from observation nearly as great as that which we now possess no offensive would benefit we which do not give we at the very least the whole of the crest of the northern ridge and to aim at this would be a big and risky undertaking involve perhaps heavy casualty and large reserve we have only three british division in italy at this time the 7th 23rd and 48th two of which be always in the line and one in reserve the french have now only two division in italy and the italian when the german advance in france become serious have send to france more man than there be french and british leave in italy the large fact remain that since the military collapse of russium the previous year the austrian have bring practically they whole army on to the italian front and establish a large superiority over the italian both in number and in gun considerable italian reserve have to be keep mobile and ready to meet a austrian offensive anywhere along the mountain front or on the plain there be not likely to be much that could be safely spare to back up a franco-british offensive on the plateau none the less the value of a successful offensive here be recognize to be so great that it be several time on the point of be attempt in the month that follow but it do not finally come until event elsewhere have prepare the way and sap the enemy 's power of resistance this however be anticipate history in march when we first arrive we move into a battery position in the pine wood behind the rear slope of the southern ridge we right hand gun be only a hundred yard from the cross-road at prium dell ' acqua disagreeably close as we afterwards discover for the enemy have those cross-road absolutely tape as the expression go in other respects the battery position be a good one be a old italian position it have gun pit already blast in the rock though they be not quite suit to we gun and line of fire and we have to do some more blast for ourselves in the course of this a premature explosion occur wound one of we gunner so severely that he lose one leg and the sight of both he eye and a few day later perhaps fortunately die of other injury he be a cornishman very young and very popular with every one in the battery we miss he greatly in this same accident winterton be also injure and nearly lose a eye he go to hospital and thence to england and see no more of the war for the sight of he eye come back to he but slowly the italian have also blast some good _ caverne _ in the position and these we gradually enlarged and multiply till we have cover for the whole battery be on the side of a hill and we gun not construct to fire at a greater elevation than forty-five degree -lrb- the italian have fire at super-elevation up to eighty -rrb- we have to cut down many tree in front of the gun but this clearance hardly show in aeroplane photograph as there be already many bare patch in the wood we have perfect flash-cover behind the ridge and be indeed quite invisible when the gun be camouflage even to a aeroplane fly low and immediately overhead from we position we could shoot if necessary right over the top of the northern ridge on the other side of the plateau and this be good enough for most purpose we prepare another position which be know as the forward or battle position at san sisto about four hundred yard behind the front line this position we never occupy but we should have do so if a offensive have come from we side while we be still on the plateau san sisto i be tell be once the center of a leper reservation there be a little chapel there but no other building this chapel be use by the ramc as a first aid post one day i see a shell go clean through the roof of it but there be no one inside at the time the battery op be a glorious place up a tall pine tree on the summit of cima del taglio a high point to the east of the granezza -- prium dell ' acqua road this op have be build by the french it be reach by a strong pinewood ladder with a small platform half way up as a resting-place the op itself consist of a wooden platform nail to cross piece support on two tree it be about fifteen foot long and four foot broad and some ninety foot above the ground at one end of the platform a hut have be erect with a long glass window open outward on the northern side and a small fixed glass window on the western the other end of the platform be uncover when the weather be bad one could shelter in the hut and imagine oneself out at sea as the tree sway in the wind the op be well hide from the enemy by the branch of the tree the view be superb immediately below the thick pine forest slope gradually downward the tree still carry a heavy weight of snow among the tree patch of deep snow be visible hiding rocky ground beyond lay the plateau stud with village and isolate house with the ruin of asiago in the center of the view and to the left of it the light railway line and its raise embankment along which the austrian trench run and beyond more pinewood on the northern ridge and beyond more mountain one snowy range behind another up to the horizon the visibility be often poor and variable from one minute to another great cloud use to sweep low over the plateau blotting out everything but the nearest tree and then sweep past and asiago would come into sudden view again and the sun would shine forth once more upon the little cluster of white house some utterly wreck some mere shell other as yet hardly touch by the destruction of war the prosaic name of this op be claud there be another op call ascot which we use sometimes to man at the begin it be on or rather in monte kaberlaba just behind the front line approach through a communication trench and then a long tunnel through the rock name by we troops the severn tunnel this tunnel be full of water and many worse thing and it be impossible to clean it out properly the unfortunate telephonist off duty have to live and sleep in it the op be a cramped little stinking place at the far end of the tunnel share with the italian undoubtedly visible and well know to the enemy and with practically no view the major by he usual skilful diplomacy soon arrange that we should man claud permanently but ascot never my only pleasant recollection of ascot be that once about midnight as we be keep watch together a young italian gunner from the romagna sing to I ` addio mia bell ' addio ' cantava nel partir la gioventù mentre gl ' imboscati si stavano divertire giornale in mano e la sigaretta per noi l'assalto alla baionetta come le mosche noi dobbiam morir mentre gl ' imboscati si stanno a divertir -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : good-bye my darling good-bye sing the young man as they go away while the imboscatus be stand about to amuse themselves with a newspaper in they hand and a cigarette for we the bayonet charge like fly we must die while the imboscatus stand about to amuse themselves this be one of many front line version of a patriotic drawing-room song it have a admirable tune -rrb- he sing I also another longer song compose by a friend of he which be not fit for reproduction \* \* \* \* \* we experience great variation of weather on the plateau when we first arrive in march the snow be in full thaw and every road a sunlit rush torrent we climb about at that time in gum boot later it snow again heavily and often sometimes for several day run we be envelop in a thick mist and then suddenly it would clear away once i remember it clear at night and one see the full moon rise through the pine tree into a utterly clear ice-cold sky and under one 's foot the hard snow scrunch and glitter in the moonlight british french and italian battery be all mix together in this sector on we left come first another british battery then two french one in front of the road and one behind it then another british then a italian on we right slightly more forward the headquarters of a italian heavy artillery group in front of they a british and a italian battery one on each side of the road lead past kaberlaba to the front line to the right of the italian headquarters across the san sisto road be a french battery with two italian battery in front of it to we own right rear be one italian battery and two french and in rear of they back along the road to granezza we own brigade headquarters this mixture be a good arrangement stimulate friendly rivalry and facilitate _ liaison _ and exchange of idea we relation be specially cordial with the italian-group headquarters and with one of the french battery on we leave the italian major command this group be a mantuan and he and i become firm friend it be in he mess one night in reply to the toast of the ally that i make my first after-dinner speech in italian i do not claim that it be grammatically perfect but all that i say be i think well understand and i be in no hesitation for word not till the end of may do spring really climb the mountain and the snow finally vanish and then the day apart from the fact of war be perfect blue sky and sunshine all day long among the warm aromatic pine and the freshness of the mountain air here and there in clearing in the forest be patch of thick rich grass make a bright contrast to the dull dark green of the pine and in the grass arise many-coloured wild flower the italian have bury they dead up here in little group among the tree and not in great graveyard there be one such little group on the hillside in the middle of we battery position between two of we gunpit there be another in the middle of we forward position at san sisto and another where some thirty bersaglierus and artilleryman be bury in the baerenthal valley it be here one day that a irish major newly come to italy say to I i do not want any better grave than that nor do i it be a place of marvellous and eternal beauty ever change with the season it make one 's heart ache to be in the midst of it it be hither that they bring in the month that follow many of the british dead who fall in this sector and lay they beside the italian at whose grave we have look that day chapter xxx some note on national characteristic for a week or two in may a italian engineer officer mess with we he have a sleep hut on the hill just behind we and be in charge of a party of man who be work on british field artillery position he man be on british ration and do not altogether like they they would have prefer more bread and less meat and jam and they miss they coffee we tea they do not fancy the first time it be issue to they they think it be medicine why do the english give we _ ` camomila ' _ they ask they officer we be not ill \* \* \* \* \* i have have at one time and another much gay and delightful intercourse both with frenchman and italian which have lead I to certain speculative comparison and to many dangerous generalisation some of which i will venture tentatively to set down here but it be difficult to find form of word which be not mere journalism italian humor be more primitive and uproarious than french and the italian seem to present fewer barrier to intimacy but the proportion of rational discussion be larger in the conversation of the french both the french and the italian combine natural and easy good manners with great punctiliousness in small matter of etiquette only very arrogant or very boorish people find it difficult to get on well with either it be idle for any wideawake observer to deny that a certain antipathy exist between the french and the italian both i think generally prefer the british to they latin brother and i have hear both say unjust and absurdly untrue thing about the other they antipathy be root partly in temperament partly in history and partly in that ignorance and lack of understanding which account for nine-tenth of all international antipathy as charle lamb say in a anecdote which president wilson be fond of quote i can not hate a man i know it be sometimes say that the french and the italian be too much alike to be in perfect sympathy the frenchman have at time a instinct to be what a englishman would call theatrical which instinct the englishman himself hardly possess at all but in the italian this instinct be even stronger than in the frenchman and he give it freer play thus the frenchman often notice the italian do and say thing which he himself dislike but which it need a deliberate effort of self-repression on he part not to imitate the englishman have no inclination to do and say such thing and be therefore more tolerant of they than the frenchman think they either charming or merely queer accord to he temperament if the french be the more admirable the italian be the more lovable if the french be the more creative the italian be the more receptive in the french though not so much in the italian one do find that sheer brutality of the latin intellect which since the french revolution have dethrone many previously dominant idea and institution one find in the french a tradition of limpid precision of concise and order logic while the italian be still grope rather turgidly among those great abstract idea which the french handle so easily the spirit of france shine with the hard splendor of the noonday sun of italy with the soft radiance of the light of early morning and late afternoon the french be proud and sometimes intolerant the italian tolerant and often diffident it have be truly say that in every modern frenchman there be still something napoleonic however subconscious it may have become one could never be surprise if in the midst of conversation a frenchman should suddenly draw himself up and cry vive la france monsieur but one do not expect a italian in like circumstance to cry viva l'italia in general the french be the more tenacious and clear-visioned in adversity but none be more irresistible in success nor more conscious of its drama than the italian the low birth-rate of france as compare with italy be a fact of deep and permanent importance in year to come the french will grow more and more negligible numerically in world politics but the french spirit be immortal and unconquerable it will penetrate the heart of the best man for ever and idea characteristically and originally french will continue to mould the world 's thought and action till the end of time the italian on the other hand will play in future history a greater part numerically and moreover by a greater intermarriage with other race will continue to produce fine and generous human type not wholly italian italian will continue to show a shine example to the world by reason of they gaiety and charm of character they mental subtlety which with time will grow less involved and more lucid in expression by they art of life even now not much inferior to the french by they sensitiveness to beauty by they capacity for enthusiastic appreciation and by they technical genius in apply science italy be a naturally democratic and peaceable polity and she present imperfection will diminish rapidly with the increase of she national maturity and stability she will be a sane and healthy element in the future international order in some respects as in they indifference sometimes excessive to foreign opinion the french resemble the british just as in they excessive sensitiveness on this point the italian resemble the american this be the contrast between age and youth between nation with a continuous tradition of century behind they and nation bear or reborn only yesterday there remain the larger contrast between the latin on the one hand and the anglo-saxon on the other at first sight it be the latter who be the more realistic and the more practical the former who be the more effusive idealistic and poetical but as mr norman dougla admirably put it in _ south wind _ enclose within the soft imagination of the _ homo mediterraneus _ lie a kernel of hard reason the northerner 's hardness be on the surface he core he inner be be apt to quaver in a state of fluid irresponsibility the comparative method of approach to the institution of marriage among latin and among anglo-saxon illustrate this truth and it serve also perhaps for a example that in the midst of the terror of war the dim project of a league of nation the only hope of the world first take shape in the mind of anglo-saxon dreamer and not of latin realist the latin often think more clearly but not always more profoundly than the anglo-saxon the current on the surface be not always the same as the current in the deep chapter xxxi rome in the spring i be at rome in may of the many thing and person i see there not much be relevant here but there be a intoxication and a beauty and a sense of wonder in rome in the spring as great as i have find at any time elsewhere rome grow upon I rapidly and ceaselessly during the few day that i spend there and send I back to the mountain clothe with they pinewood and they grave of much brave youth uplift in heart and purify in spirit \* \* \* \* \* early one afternoon in the piazza venezium i fall in with two italian officer a alpino and a engineer both wound and not yet fit to go back to the front we rapidly make friend and have drunk beer together we take a carrozza and drive to the villa borghese garden where we walk and sit for several hour then we go back to the piazza venezium and walk in the neighborhood and contemplate the monument my friend say that rome be the capital city of the world and praise also the giant memorial to italian unity and victor emmanuel ii which still unfinished dominate the piazza and indeed a large part of the city this memorial be i believe condemn by the greater part of foreign aesthetic opinion the german alone conspicuously dissent personally i like it in the fading light from close at hand and in a bright light from a distance as one see it for instance from the pincio we speak a little but not much of the war they be both for fight on till final victory whatever the cost and both speak with admiration of the inflexible and stubborn spirit of the british nation very wonderful too be the spirit which animate the alpinus my alpino friend have be wound in the leg last August at rombon and still walk lame he tell I of incident which he have witness of alpinus charge across and through uncut enemy wire with the wound and the die cry to they comrade ciao -lrb- 1 -rrb- ciao avanti he sing I also certain song of the alpinus in one of which they sing that in the italian tricolor the green stand for the alpinus -lrb- 2 -rrb- the white for the snow on they mountain and the red for they blood o these fiamme verdus who can talk and sing themselves into such transfigured ecstasy as to turn death and pain almost into easy glory -lrb- footnote 1 : ciao be a colloquialism much the same as we own so long or good-bye and good luck it be a intimate word use only between friend at parting -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : the regimental color of the alpinus be plain green worn on the collar -rrb- the three of we dine at a little restaurant near the pantheon and my friend write they name and a greet to my wife on a post card and a old man at the next table order a bottle of wine in which we all drink the health of the ally and a party at another table begin to sing and go on singing for nearly a hour we stay in that restaurant talk till eleven pm when the light be turn out and then my friend demand that we should make another giro artistico which terminate beneath trajan 's column where in the warm air we sit and talk for half a hour more and separate about midnight i have have eight hour of continuous practice in the use of the second person singular of italian verb \* \* \* \* \* next day i lunch with my friend the marini at they charming villa on monte parioli and in the afternoon signor marinus offer to act as my guide to place of interest we take the tram to the piazza del popolo which be lay out in 1810 under the french empire perfectly circular and symmetrical thus differ from the more italian of roman piazza such as the elongate and quite unsymmetrical piazza di spagna we pass along the broad embankment beside the tiber and through the square of st peter 's just outside the gate of the vatican my guide point out to I the little shabby building occupy by the giordano bruno society symbolic of the brave defiance throw out all down the age by poverty and the spirit of freedom and intellectual honesty in the face of wealth and power and oppression intellectual bondage and the dead weight of tradition my guide think that out of the wreck of she material defeat and disaster russium would perhaps give a new spiritual religion to the western world to take the place of old form now dead and historic organization which have lack the audacity and the wisdom to remain poor when riches be within easy reach have now become visibly and irremediably detach from the life of the people he do not fear as some do for france a clerical revival in italy after the war for the italian branch of clerical power have show itself in the hour of italy 's deadly peril to be largely lack in italian patriotism and to have be scheming for the maintenance if not the expansion of austrian dominion and perhaps for the re-establishment by the aid of austrian and german bayonet or turkish if it have be necessary to solicit they of the temporal power of the papacy over italian citizen and italian soil i see one of the swiss mercenary of the papacy gaze forth a little contemptuously through a door of the vatican upon the secular outer world from st peter 's we drive up the janiculum stop on the way at the convent of s onofrio where tasso pass the last three week of he life and where a tasso museum have be accumulate very admirable be the equestrian statue of garibaldus on the janiculum both as sculpture and for its detail of intention such as that sideways turn of he head look down hill at the vatican as though say non ti dimentico -- i do not forget you my old enemy the view of rome from this point be magnificent the best that i have see though the view from the pincio only just fall short of it thence pass outside the old city wall through the porta san pancrazio we stand on ground make memorable by garibaldus 's defense of the roman republic in 1849 and go down past the pope 's monument to the french who die fight to defend he temporal power against the garibaldinus into the beautiful garden of the villa pamfilus attendono il finale risorgimento -lrb- 1 -rrb- say the pope 's italian version on the monument it be a ironical phrase in view of the history of the next twenty year they do not have long to wait i say a bird in the hand be worth two in the bush and my guide say i think well of the french that they be a people of great gift and of most generous mind but that they ruler have often show un po ' di volubilità un po ' di fantasia -lrb- footnote 1 : they await the final resurrection but risorgimento to most italian suggest modern history more than theology -rrb- we visit last of all the depôt of the bersaglierus in trastevere where be also the famous bersagliere museum here we be receive and show round with great courtesy by the colonel command the depôt a handsome man with most sad eye but full of great regimental pride in this creation intimately and characteristically italian of general la marmora in the museum among much that be trivial i find much that be interesting and even deeply move : the relic of enrico totus a artist who have only one leg join the bersaglierus ciclistus as a volunteer at the beginning of the war and ride up mountain track on a bicycle with a single pedal and die after act of the greatest heroism and after sustain for many hour grave wound cry with he last breath avantus savoia upon whose dead body and brave depart spirit be confer the most rare gold medal for valor photograph of all the bersaglierus who since the foundation of the regiment have win the gold medal some twenty of they hang together on one wall all dead now the steel helmet of a bersagliere major kill on the carso while lead he man this be all that they find of he but it have three hole through the front sufficient proof say the colonel that he be not go backward when he die a menu card sign by all the officer of a bersagliere battalion who dine together on the eve of the victorious action of col valbellum last January in which they play a worthy part the colonel tell I that he own son be kill and be bury beyond the isonzo near cervignano it have be suggest to he that he should have the body bring home but he prefer to leave it where it fall c ' è un ' idea che è morta lì he say it be a idea which have die there some day if i live i shall make a pilgrimage thither but the austrian may by now have destroy the grave outside in the courtyard where the colonel take leave of we i see many young bersaglierus the latest batch of recruit mere boy they be splendid material he say with a military pride not without a half-regretful tenderness one can make anything out of they they be indeed incomparable human stuff whether for the purpose of peace or war they seem to have the joy of the spring in they eye just as that middle-aged regular soldier have in he the sadness of autumn and amid all the beauty of rome in the spring i be haunt by the grim refrain nellum primavera si combatte e si muore o soldato -- in the springtide man fight and die young soldier \* \* \* \* \* i go away from rome strengthen in my previous judgment that the italian be not a militarist nation there be no sign of the militarist as distinct from the military spirit at the bersagliere depôt the relation of the colonel and signer marinus illustrate this they have never meet nor i think hear of one another before yet this little civilian seem to find it quite natural to march into a military barracks without any preliminary inquiry to walk upstairs and straight into the commanding officer 's office and not find the command officer there to send a message into the officer 's mess and the commanding officer have come out to present he card without any appearance of servility or undue deference and to ask to be take round and the colonel seem to see nothing odd in these proceedings but place himself at once at we disposal and show we everything and talk without aloofness and without reserve to both of we i could not help think that thing would not have happen quite like this at the depôt of a crack regiment in most other european capital chapter xxxii the fifteenth of June 1918 i happen to be the officer on duty in the battery command post on the night of June 14th-15th there have be a thick fog for several day and not much firing no one expect anything unusual the battery be much below strength owe to the ravages of what the doctor in the mountain call mountain fever and the doctor on the plain call influenza we have if i remember rightly about forty man in hospital owe to this cause alone i myself have a touch of it but think i could probably count on a quiet night i refuse the offer of a brother officer to take my place coldly calculate that a few night later when it would be my turn to take he duty i might have more to do but my hope of much sleep be soon dispersed order come in from brigade for a elaborate counter-battery shoot with gas shell in two part one between 11 pm and midnight the other between 2 and 3 be we have never fire gas shell from six-inch howitzer before though we have be warn that we should soon be require to do so we have no gas shell in the battery but we be inform by brigade that a sufficient quantity would arrive by the time the shoot be to begin in fact however the first consignment of gas shell be not deliver in time to enable we to take part in the first part of the bombardment and i be tell not to fire high explosive instead as that would tend to disperse the gas which other battery would be simultaneously firing on the same target the method adopt on this and later occasion when gas be use be that a number of we own battery should concentrate for say five minute at the fastest rate of fire possible on a particular enemy battery then all switch together to another enemy battery and so on all come back together on to the first enemy battery after a interval sufficient to lull the human element form part of the target into a delusive sense of security and a return to slumber without they mask or alternatively to make they wear they mask continously for prolonged hour of expectation thus subject they to much discomfort deprive they of sleep lower they morale and make they likelier victim for fresh form of devilment in the morning war be a filthy thing and must be stamp out ruthlessly the fact of gas will have help to drive this simple conviction into many a thick egotistical unsensitive head but as have be wisely say you can not half make a war of the modern sort you can not let a faint savor of regret hang about all you action and enervate you will and in plain brutal truth we employment of gas be a big factor in determine and hasten the end of the military efficiency of we gas tactic we have much evidence later on we join in the second part of the gas bombardment in the early hour of the 15th of June and when this be nearly over i get order to fire at my leisure ten round of high explosive at archibald which be we code name for a certain austrian searchlight which use to sweep round the country from the summit of monte mosciagh on the far side of the plateau so i fire the ten round and the officer at one of the op 's whom i have previously warn of my intention report that archibald have go out after the fourth round and that judge by the flash of they explosion all the round have seem pretty near it be now nearly half-past three and conscious that i have a high and rise temperature i determine to lie down and get a few hour ' sleep some of the gas shell which have be intend for the first part of the bombardment but have arrive about four hour too late be still be unloaded from lorry on the road outside but i ask a corporal to look after this and send the unload party to bed as soon as they have finish i have just fall asleep when the corporal awaken I be the man he ask to go on unload the shell still half asleep i ask why not he say that the road be be shell i pull myself together and go to the door of the command post not only the road but the whole battery position and apparently the whole area for some distance round be be bombard very violently so i order every one to take cover it be just 345 be i think for a moment that this be merely austrian retaliation for we first use of gas and for the shot at archibald in fact it be the beginning of the big austrian offensive which have long be prearrange during the last few day the austrian have bring up a large number of new gun to we sector and have place a number of they right out in the open and owe to the thick fog we airman have be able to see nothing the bombardment continue with great fury for several hour with gun of all calibre but fortunately mostly small with shrapnel high explosive and gas chiefly lacrimatory but mixed with a certain quantity of lethal luckily we have pretty good cover mainly _ caverne _ blast in the rock the command post itself be proof against anything less than a direct hit from a pretty heavy shell it be also suppose to be gas proof but be not i collect about half a dozen man in it who have nowhere else to go include two asc lorry driver early on a young bombardier be hit rather badly in the leg just outside we bring he into the command post bandage he wound and lay he on the camp bed on which i have be hope to get some sleep and there leave he till the shell should abate and it should be reasonably safe to carry he to the dressing-station a quarter of a mile away he lay there i remember look like a little tired cherub and another bombardier sit beside he and try to persuade he to go to sleep they be very great friend those two boy both signaller and inseparable both on and off duty the one who be not wound go out that same morning and spend hour repair telephone line under very heavy fire for which act he win the military medal the other month later when he wound be heal and he have return to the battery also win the military medal for gallantry on the piave the conduct of the two lorry driver afford a strong contrast in psychology one a man of middle age be superbly cheerful they can not keep this up much longer he say several time with a placid smile they have not the stuff to do it the other though younger be a bunch of visible nerve a shell explode just behind the command post and violently shake the whole structure and a storm of stone hit the log framework he collapse on the floor and be convince for a couple of minute that he have be hit and for some time after that he be suffer from shell shock such illusion come easily at such time a gas shell make a direct hit on one of we smaller dug-out a sergeant inside be badly gas they put he for the moment in a gas-proof shelter higher up the hill and several hour later i see he be carry away on a stretcher apparently lifeless but he finally pull through a gunner who be with he in the dug-out come run into the command post cry out that he also be gas i make he lie flat on the floor and tell he to keep as quiet as he could and then i watch he breathing it be clear after a minute or two that if he have have a breath of gas at all it be only of the slightest but when i tell he this he be very unwilling to believe I another man be hit just outside and lay on the ground scream like a animal in pain he too we carry into the command post and later on a stretcher to the dress station meanwhile all the telephone line have go owe to the shell cut we off from brigade other battery and op 's but intermittent communication be maintain by runner and signaller be out hour after hour mending break in the line and show they invariable gallantry till about six o'clock we order be to lie low to keep under cover and not to open fire the rain of shell continue without slacken we be wonderfully lucky to get off as lightly as we do it be one of the most extraordinary phenomenon of war how many shell can fall in a position of no great size and yet do very little damage it be estimate and i think quite soberly that at least two thousand round be pump into we battery position that morning it be soon after six that we get order pass along from the next battery up the road to open fire on we counter-preparation target this be a sign that the advance of the austrian infantry have either begin or be think to be imminent they attack in fact about a quarter to seven on we sector they synchronising be faulty as between the different sector attack some go forward earlier and other later than have be intend they be all newly equip and be carry full pack and blanket on they back they have be tell by they officer that this be to be the last great offensive of the war that they be go to drive we headlong down the mountain side that after two day they would be in verona and after ten day in rome they be not tell that they have british troops in front of they they come forward bravely and with great determination in five successive wave on the british left divisional front to the west of we they gain a large initial success and push we back well behind we first line of gun here for some time the situation look serious but next day strong counter-attack by british and italian troops restore the line we lose gun be retake and the retreat austrian suffer great slaughter and demoralisation on the british right divisional front in support of which we brigade be operate the british 23rd division fight a fight worthy of they high reputation force back for a while from they front line trench after a prolonged and intense bombardment and by a overwhelming superiority of number they never even fall back to they support line but turn on the enemy who be advance along and astride the san sisto road they drive he back and re-establish they own front line within six hour of the first attack it be here that a boy colonel a sherwood forester scarcely twenty-one year old win the vc and fall severely wound when thing look black he have organise the defense and the subsequent counter-attack collect together british infantryman of several battalion together with british artilleryman and italian machine-gunner and engineer welding they into a coherent force and make swift yet well think out disposition which do much to save the situation on the right of the british the french infantry though furiously assault never i believe budge a inch on the right of the french the italian be momentarily drive from col valbellum col del rosso and col d'echele which they have win in January but retake all three a few day later but we in the battery know nothing of all this at the time we know only that we have to open fire on we counter-preparation target the gunpit of we no 1 gun near the cross-road be in low-lying ground now so full of gas that one could hardly see one 's hand before one 's face fortunately we could achieve the rate of fire require by use three gun only so we leave no 1 out of action for the time the enemy 's bombardment as far as we be concern be begin to slacken a little but be still heavy the major out on the road with a signaller mend wire be hit in the face with shrapnel it turn out happily not a serious wound but at the time it look less hopeful he go down the mountain in the same field ambulance with the young colonel of the sherwood forester of whom i have already speak there be a abandon field ambulance in the road half in the ditch with the engine still run the driver have find the shell too hot to stay there be no one inside it but we get a couple of stretcher from it and we have need of they no 4 gun my own gun which be nearest to the road suffer most severely seven of the detachment on this gun be hit not all at once but what be apt to be much more demoralising at interval of a few minute a bombardier be in charge of the gun that day no senior nco 's be available he show a very wonderful coolness and courage shell be burst all round the gunpit and sometimes in the gunpit itself but the rate of fire never slacken every now and again the cry be hear another casualty on no 4 and stretcher bearer would start down the road from the command post but each time almost before they have start come the deep report of another round fire no casualty and no shell could silence she at one time this bombardier have only two other man to help he work the gun and both of they be as undismayed as he he win the military medal for he gallantry that day and i be very proud of he and of no 4 the brigade chaplain appear in the course of the morning and give a hand in carry the wound away on stretcher it be outside he official work and i give he all credit and respect for the help he give we but one nco in the battery with the plain speaking that come naturally in the face of common danger say to he well sir we never think much of you before either as a man or as a preacher but we be glad to see you here to-day do you bit the austrian gunner have a fine sense of discrimination in they target the wooden hut in which i and two of my brother officer use to sleep have be hit two or three time that day and much of we kit have be destroy so have both volume of morley 's _ rousseau _ which be on a shelf over my bed leave behind only a few tear and scatter page much damage have also be do to a collection of pompeian photograph of great historical interest but baedeker 's _ northern italy _ which lay alongside have not be touch \* \* \* \* \* the god of battle also discriminate delicately he take the best and leave the worst behind there die that day strike by a shell at the foot of we tree op on cima del taglio one of the finest personality in the battery a signalling bombardier who have work for some year on a railway in america and just before the war as a railway clerk in the midland he be the father of a young family thoughtful and capable and loyal without subservience to those of higher military rank in so far as he judge they to be worthy of he loyalty i remember one night at the beginning of the year when we be keep watch together among the snow at col d'astiago with the sky cold and clear and full of star and when he and i talk in complete understanding and agreement of the waste of war and the deeper purpose of life and the need to build up a better world now he be bury in the beautiful baerenthal valley along which run the road from pria dell ' acqua to san sisto and asiago as that day end which the italian always afterwards speak of as il giorno quindicus -lrb- the fifteenth day -rrb- the firing on both side in we sector slacken though we gun be seldom silent for more than a hour at a time and the austrian still carry out sudden burst of vicious fire in we neighborhood but that night and the next day and the next we begin to get through information of what have be happen all along the line and when a week later the whole tale could be tell it be evident that no great offensive on any front during this war prepare with so great elaboration and carry out with so great resource have ever quite so blankly fail as the great austrian offensive from the astico to the sea and the effect upon the self-confidence and morale of the italian army and of the ally contingent be correspondingly great for to speak frankly this offensive have be await with much apprehension and anxiety with the memory of caporetto not yet fade and in view of the success of the german offensive in france chapter xxxiii in the trentino the austrian offensive on the mountain sector from the astico to monte grappa have be obviously and decisively break by the 18th of June but there be still danger on the plain particularly in the montello sector where the austrian be establish in strong force west of the piave a fly brigade of british heavy artillery be hurriedly form and send down the mountain of this brigade my own battery form part we general function be to reinforce the italian artillery in what be at the moment the most critical sector of the whole front we particular function to destroy by shell fire the piave bridge behind the austrian troops but when we arrive we find that the emergency have already pass the bridge have already be destroy by airman and italian artillery and the austrian force have either be drive back across or into the river by italian counter-attack or have be cut off and compel to surrender we therefore come back to the plateau without firing a round but we do not remain there long the idea of a mobile artillery of maneuver be much talk of at this time and early in July a brigade consist of three british siege battery my own include be move westwards up into the trentino we travel all the way by road through verona up to brescia the eagle that look over lombardy and thence beside lake idro up the val chiese past storo into the val d'ampolum all this last stretch of country be famous in italian history as the scene of garibaldus 's campaign of 1866 which have it not be interrupt by the course of event elsewhere would probably have hasten the liberation of trento by more than half a century and greatly modify the problem of italian policy in recent year the story be well know of the recall of garibaldus which reach he at the moment of victory at bezzecca and of he famous reply a model of laconic self-discipline in the one word ubbidisco -- i obey the little town of bezzecca lay this July behind the italian line but in full view and easy range of the austrian a company of arditus be billet here with whom i lunch one day return from a front line reconnaissance the piazza have be rename by the italian piazza ubbidisco and under cover of darkness they set up one night on the mountain side just above the town a memorial stone to garibaldus and he volunteer of 1866 a provocative target for austrian gunner no other british troops except these three battery of ours ever fight in the trentino it be a proud distinction and a very memorable experience the natural scenery be superb a series of great mountain range uneven line of jagged peak enclose deep cut valley the lower slope of the mountain densely wood the higher level bare precipitous rock the austrian front line run along one ridge of peak and ours along another between run a deep valley all no man 's land into which patrol use to climb down at night often with the aid of rope one mountain mass a continuation of cima d'oro be partly in we possession and partly in theirs and up there by night among the rock patrol grapple for the mastery poise high above the world and in these struggle man sometimes slip or be throw to crash to death thousand of foot below in the val di ledro this country be austrian before the war though inhabit wholly by italian and italian troops have conquer it with extraordinary feat of endurance and daring in they first great onrush all along they old frontier in the spring of 1915 but now a big advance here by either side in the face of carefully prepared opposition seem almost inconceivable except as the result of some wide turn movement hinging on some point many mile away the special military problem present by warfare in such country be numerous and difficult we gun have to be drag into position up a rough mountain track which at some point be too narrow and at other too weak to allow the passage of a six-inch howitzer without much preliminary blasting and build up we first gun to go up take twenty-four hour of continuous labor between the time of start up the track and the time of arrive in position a distance of only about two mile of zig-zag no tractor or other power engine could be use here the only force available be that of man haul on drag rope and a party of sixty italian gunner reinforce we man what may be call the problem of pure gunnery be still more difficult british heavy gun have never fire under such condition before and for the benefit of such of my reader as may be practical artilleryman it may be interesting to remark that for one of we target the angle of sight properly so call work out at more than twenty degree while the map-range elevation be only about fifteen the devising of a accurate formulum for correction of elevation for a large _ dislivello _ as the italian shortly call it which in english means a large difference of level between a gun and its target be one of the most intricate problem of theoretical gunnery or for that matter of theoretical mechanic involve among other factor the various shape and size of projectile they comparative steadiness during flight the resistance of the air and the effect of other atmospheric condition and of the force of gravity there be a splendid opportunity for systematically test various rival formula in the trentino but it be allow to slip among gunner as among other class and especially among regular army gunner the so-called practical man see little value in scientific experiment which do not produce large obvious and quick return we fire many hundred round in the trentino and i have no doubt that they be tolerably effective but most of they be fire at night with no observation possible and we be often restricted in we registration by daylight to four round a section per target from which no really reliable conclusion could be draw -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : we could get no help from italian range table which be not merely for different gun and ammunition but be draw up on different principle from we own -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* we be billet in the village of tiarno di sotto where the mayor under the austrian regime a italian by race be still carry on he duty but i shall have to disappear if the austrian ever come back he say with a smile it be a tremendous climb from we billet to get anywhere the least tremendous be to we battery position straight up the nearest mountain side a very active and energetic man could get up in a quarter of a hour it use to take I twenty minute the weather moreover be hot though considerably cooler than on the plain some czecho-slovak be billet in the next house to ours but owe to lack of a common language we be unfortunately unable to talk to they they be well-built fellow and give one a impression of great tenacity and intelligence and i know that they be fine fighter but they have not the gaiety of the italian partly perhaps because they be exile in a strange land and must so remain till the day of final victory which might then have seem still infinitely remote a amusing incident happen one evening four officer have desert from the austrian line and surrender to the czecho-slovak it be one of they military function to induce surrender two of these officer be themselves czecho-slovak the third a jugo-slav and the fourth a italian from istrium they be very hungry and be in the midst of a good meal in the presence of a czecho-slovak guard when a corporal and two gunner from we battery pass outside the house and hear some language be speak within which they recognize to be neither english not italian rightly think it they duty to enter and investigate the matter the deserter be astonish to see these unfamiliar look person speak a strange tongue and wear a uniform which they have never see before but they be still more astonished to learn that they be british they seem hardly to be aware that the british be at war with austrium much less that any british troops have be within hundred of mile of they the incident close in much mirth and friendliness in the village be also billet many italian troops who use to fill the night with song long after most of we have go to bed : -- ` addio mia bell ' addio ' cantava nel partir la gioventù which be never very far from the lip of any italian soldier and those endless _ stornellus _ which to a invariable tune they multiply from day to day ii general cadorna mangiava la bifstecca be poverus soldatus si dava castagna secca -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : general cadorna use to eat beefsteak to the poor soldier they give dry chestnut -rrb- or il re dal fronte giulio ha scritto alla regina ` arrivato a

want to see trieste buy a picture post card ' -rrb- many of the other be for various reason unprintable though many be extremely witty and amusing even those which i have quote be nominally forbid by the high command to be sing but the prohibition be not very rigorously enforce and general cadorna after all have now pass into history of he successor i never hear any evil sing though i remember once hear a great crowd of soldier and civilian at genoa shout monotonously viva viva il generale dia the refrain of the _ stornellus _ be onomatopoeic and be intend to represent the sound of gunfire bim bim bom bim bim bom al rombo del cannon \* \* \* \* \* what a theatrical country italy be i remember be out in the street of tiarno one evening with a stream of song issue from almost every house and look up at the full moon ride high over the towering peak that lock in we valley and all but shut out the night sky i could hardly believe that it be neither a stage setting nor a dream i remember another day when i do a great climb above bezzecca to carry out a front line reconnaissance and arrive limp and perspire to lunch at the headquarters of a italian artillery group high high up look out upon a glorious and astounding view and in the afternoon i take my first ride on a _ teleferica _ or aerial railway sling along a steel rope across the deep seat on a sort of large wooden tea tray some six foot long and two and a half across with a metal rim some six inch high run round the edge i be quite prepared to be sick or at least giddy but i be pleasantly disappointed my journey take about a quarter of a hour walk it would have take about three hour of very stiff climb the motion be quite steady except for a slight jolt as one pass each standard and provide one sit still and do not shift one 's center of gravity from side to side there be no wobbling of the tea tray and look down from time to time i see tree top far below I and man and mule on mountain track as black speck walk \* \* \* \* \* there be various theory to account for we be send to the trentino one be that a austrian attack be fear there another that a italian attack be intend but that the intention be afterwards abandon a third that the whole thing be a feint to puzzle the austrian but in any case we do not remain there long by the beginning of August we be back on the plateau on the return journey which be again by road all the way we be give three day ' rest at desenzano and i be able to spend half a day in verona chapter xxxiv sirmione and solferino leave be a privilege and not a right accord to a hack quotation from the king 's regulation this quotation have do good service in the mouth of more than one under secretary of state for war head off tiresome questioner in the british house of common leave be a very rare privilege for the british force in italy in france take a rough average of all rank and period british troops get leave once a year in my battery in italy the majority be without leave home for nineteen month how much longer they would have have to wait if the war have not conveniently come to a end in the nineteenth month of they italian service i do not know even in italy of course the privilege be extend somewhat more freely to junior regimental officer and much more freely to staff officer and lieutenant-colonel in view of the danger of brain fag and nervous strain follow upon they greater mental exertion and they abnormal exposure to shell fire and the weather the former class go home about every eleventh the latter about every third month the french parliament fairly early in the war with that gross lack of discrimination and of military understanding habitual to politician insist on the grant of leave every three month to all rank in all theater of war the italian parliament pedantically lay down a uniform period of six month the british parliament with the sure political instinct of we race prefer to leave the whole matter in the hand of the war office the interference in purely military affair of unpractical sentimentalist be strongly discourage at westminster why no leave to england could be grant except in special case be cogently explain from time to time during the summer in circular write by staff officer of high rank who have frequent opportunity of inform themselves of the reality of the situation while visit london these circular be read out on parade and treat with the respect which they deserve to allay possible though quite unreasonable unrest it be determine to open a british club or rest camp at sirmione which as every reader of tennyson know stand on the tip of a long promontory at the southern end of lake garda here a week 's holiday be grant to a large proportion of the officer and a small proportion of the rank and file many officer go there more than once two large hotel be hire which have be chiefly frequent before the war by corpulent and diseased teuton for whom a special course of medical treatment include sulphur bath use to be prescribe one of these hotel be now set apart for british officer the other for man a funny little person in red tab be put in charge there be various speculation as to he past activity but all agree that he have get into a good job now and be not go to lose it if tact could prevent it this little man use to stand outside the hotel gate as each week 's guest arrive from the steamer and always have a cheery smile of welcome for every field officer to general officer he show special attention he take he meal in the same room as the rest of we but at what be know as the staff table where he invite to join he any officer of high rank who might be stay at the hotel or if there be none such available certain of he private friend the food supply to ordinary people like myself be good wholesome reasonably plentiful and cheap at the staff table special delicacy be provide and additional course with no increase of charge the profit he use to say be make entirely on the drink and smoke a series of rule be draw up that none of we might be lead into any avoidable temptation all town within reach -- milan verona mantua brescium peschiera -- be place out of bound

ration carefully regulate excursion on the lake by steamer or launch be permit and even encourage likewise bathing i spend a week here from August 14th to 21st in gloriously fine hot weather some say that the damp heat be relax and depress but i in my second italian summer be get acclimatise the place be wonderfully beautiful the end of the promontory be cover with olive tree the ground thickly carpet with wild mint and thyme surround on three side by the deep blue water of the lake along the shore of which lie little white village back by group of straight dark cypress with mountain range rise in the background range behind range and overhead the hot italian sun shine from a cloudless sky here at the point be the ruin of what be call upon what evidence i know not the villa the bath and the grotto of catullus here too be a italian anti-aircraft battery and the grotto of catullus be fill with they ammunition the austrian still hold the upper end of the lake include the town of riva but only italian motor boat now survive on the lake occasionally raiding riva the austrian boat have all be sink early in the war \* \* \* \* \* on the 15th i go round the lower end of the lake in a steamer and pass along the shore of the beautiful isolum di garda on which stand the less beautiful villa borghese land at maderno famous for its lemon grove here a church be be use as a ration store it have fine carve on the door the french have establish artillery and machine gun school close to the lake and several of they officer be on the steamer on the 16th i go with a young officer from a yorkshire battalion a most agreeable companion to desenzano which be out of bound we play billiards and lunch and in the afternoon go to sleep on the grass in the shade beside the lake we be drive back in a carrozza along the promontory by a old garibaldino a capuan by birth who in 1860 at the age of eleven join garibaldus when he cross from sicily to the mainland and hold older people 's horse at the battle of the volturno he serve with the fifth garibaldinus in the trentino campaign of 1866 and know intimately the country where i have lately be the val d'ampolum and storo tiarno and bezzecca he then join the italian regular army and in 1870 be a corporal in the pavium brigade he be present at the taking of rome and claim that although a infantryman he help to load one of the gun which breach the porta pium if this claim be true there must have be either a lack of gunner on this famous occasion or a certain degree of enthusiastic confusion have enter rome he get very drunk and absented himself from he regiment without leave for three day as a punishment he be make to march on foot carry a full pack from rome to padua he show we he old military pay-book he medal and other souvenir next year he will be seventy year old and will begin to draw a pension have return to sirmione we arrange with he to drive we next day to the neighbouring battlefield of 1859 san martino and solferino much delighted he assure I quite without necessity that next day he would put on he best clothes would wash and shave and give he horse a extra bit of groom accordingly next morning at ten o'clock we start off again in the carrozza we visit first san martino dellum battaglium only a few mile from the southern end of the lake this be the northern extremity of the battlefield of solferino it be here that the sardinian and piedmontese form the left wing of the franco-italian army attack and drive back the austrian right wing a memorial tower have be erect here 250 foot high with great avenue of cypress radiate outwards from it the custodian be a handsome boy who lose a leg at the taking of gorizium two year ago there be no stair-case within the tower one go up by a spiral inclined plane at successive stage as one ascend be large and detailed painting run right round the inner circumference of the tower represent the battle of the italian war of liberation from 1848 to 1870 as work of art they be not of the first class but they convey here and there a vivid sense of life and movement a advance of the bersaglierus with they cock ' feather wave in the wind garibaldinus in they red shirt rush bomba 's gunner on the volturno italian cavalry charge a battalion of brown-coated croat at custozza the defense of a fort in the venetian lagoon against austrian warship on a fine day the view from the top be very good but that day it be hazy in the great heat close by be a ossario contain the skull and bone of seven thousand dead collect in the neighborhood wash clean with white wine and set out in neat row the majority italian a good warning one would think against war and more compact and less wasteful of space than a conventional graveyard thence we drive on to solferino a little remote village with a single street pave with cobble stone seldom visit by foreign tourist the plaster on the wall of the farmhouse hereabouts still bear many bullet mark as we drive the garibaldino point out to we some of the position where napoleon iii 's general have site they battery we be the first british officer see here during the war and have a enthusiastic reception i be surprise to find that none of we regular have come over from sirmione as a matter of professional interest and duty to study the tactic of 1859 upon the ground we lunch well at a small _ albergo _ there be four good-looking daughter of the house who come and sit with we in turn and watch we eat they have the naturalness and simple charm of dweller in remote place four good cow say the garibaldino with the frank realism of the south but all the local proprietor be too old after lunch my companion remain in the village and i climb the ridge from which the french drive the austrian a very strong natural position even now i go up la rocca at its south-eastern extremity on which stand a old square tower also convert into a battle memorial here again there be no step within but a ascend spiral plane the slope at this end of the ridge be thickly plant with young cypress and the place will grow in beauty year by year even now it be well wooded with larger tree just below the tower the village lie at the foot of the slope just outside it off the road on slightly rise ground at the end of a avenue be another and larger ossario contain twenty thousand skull and set of bone french and austrian the building be full of banner and wreath and memorial tablet include one lately send by the french troops now fight on the italian front ceux de la grande guerre a se glorieux ancien 1859-1918 a few skeleton have be preserve intact include one say to have be a austrian bandmaster a giant eight foot tall the nationality of some of the skull can be determine by bullet french or austrian find in the head and now attach by a string i step forth from this well-ordered tomb into the outer sunshine with a sense of personal oppression and of human ineffectiveness how slowly and how clumsily do the foot of history slouch along and yet if napoleon iii have keep faith with cavor the fighting here might have liberate venetium without the necessity for another war a few year later how quiet and silent lie these battlefield of yesterday even so one day will lie the pine wood round asiago shell-torn and torment now and populous with the soldier of many nation yet of a wondrous beauty in the full moonlight and the fresh night air i shall be back up there in three day ' time \* \* \* \* \* we drive back in the warm evening by the road through pozzolengo toward peschiera along which many of the defeat austrian flee in 1859 the roadside be dusty but along all the hedge the acacia still show a most delicate and tender green chapter xxxv the asiago plateau once more during August and September we be keep pretty busy on the plateau concentration on enemy trench and wire and special counter-battery shoot by day and counter-battery support of infantry raid by night be continually require of we we fire high explosive by day and chiefly gas shell at night we own infantry and the french on we right raid the enemy 's front and support line very frequently bring back many prisoner the french constantly penetrate and reconnoitr the enemy 's defensive system on mount sisemol many of we be incline to think that the casualty sometimes heavy which be incur in these raid and the great quantity of ammunition shot away be largely waste we see no sufficient return for they beyond a certain amount of information obtain from prisoner much of which be of small and doubtful value but in view of what happen later i think it must be agree that these continual raid and bombardment do they share in gradually wear down the morale and power of resistance of the austrian army there be a persistent rumor that the enemy be on the point of retire to a line on which he be know to be work hard along the lower slope of monte interrotto and monte catz on the far side of the plateau this line we learn from prisoner be commonly refer to as the _ winterstellung _ -lrb- winter position -rrb- it would have be stronger defensively than he exist line and would have have the great advantage of be able largely to be supply and munition during daylight as there be much good cover and road hide in the pine wood lead down immediately behind it it would have involve the moral disadvantage of evacuate the ruin of asiago but with the snow down on the plateau every austrian track and foot-mark would have be visible from we op 's and the austrian situation bad as it already be from this point of view would have become quite intolerable if on the other hand we have follow up a austrian retreat to they _ winterstellung _ by the occupation of asiago and the throw forward of we line across the plateau the relative situation would have be reverse we infantry and many of we battery would then be out in the open in view from the austrian op 's unable to light a fire by day and only able to send up supplies by night and we general situation would be so much the worse with heavy snow increase we discomfort and the visibility of any work we might undertake and of we every movement for this reason as have be explain in a earlier chapter it be take for grant that a small advance from we present excellent line would be worse than useless and that only a advance at least to the crest of the first mountain range beyond the plateau would be of any military value the possibility of such a advance be attempt be evidently still in the mind of the staff for we forward or battle position at san sisto have to be keep in constant readiness for occupation and it be suggest by some that the occasion for a big attack would be the moment when the enemy be in the act of retire voluntarily to he _ winterstellung _ necessarily a somewhat difficult and risky operation meanwhile the enemy gun be not silent they be indeed unpleasantly active constantly sweep the road just behind we battery put down violent though brief concentration on the cross road at prium dell ' acqua less than a hundred yard to we right and apparently also endeavor to carry out occasional counter-battery shoot after we own pattern the british battery in this sector suffer a number of casualty during this period and one in particular not my own be frequently shell with great precision by twelve-inch howitzer most disagreeable weapon firing at extreme range from the cover of some distant valley many effort be make to locate these particular gun but i be not confident that any of they be successful among the victim in this battery be preece a young officer who have serve under I in a training battery in england he be the only son of a widow mother and have he live might have become a world-famous chemist he grave too be in the baerenthal valley we own officer ' mess have several narrow escape especially on one occasion when the impact of a enemy shell be break by a trench cart and a box of tool only seven or eight yard away none of the tool be ever find again and portion of the trench cart be see next morning hang on the telephone wire beside the road only a few splinter come into the mess and do no harm all the occupant myself include warn by the sound of the approach shell have fling ourselves face downward on the floor another frequent exercise of the enemy at this time be night bombing which during the full moon become somewhat serious but a big raid by we own airman on the enemy aerodrome at borgo in the val sugana put a end to this source of trouble i be able now and then to make short expedition down the mountain in the battery car to thiene and sometimes even to vicenza for the ostensible purpose of buy canteen and mess store and draw the battery pay thiene be the ugliest and dullest little town in italy but vicenza with its exquisite olympian theater and other fine palladian architecture vary by many smaller building which be beautiful example of the venetian gothic style with its busy and animated piazza centre round the ever-crowded café garibaldus and with the wooded slope of the famous monte berico rich with historic memorial rise behind the town never fail to lift my mind out of the dreary monotony of war into a atmosphere of cleaner and more enduring thing i remember too the strange thrill i have one day when have pass the sawmill and dump of store and shell and the huddle of headquarter office at granezza i come out on the last edge of the mountain wall into sudden full view of the great plain below full of river and city and see for the first time from up here the sunlight flash on a strip of distant golden sea it be the lagoon round venice i spend also many interesting day about this time at we tree op on cima del taglio the italian have a op in a neighbouring tree which they call osservatorio battistus the british field artillery occupy a third tree and the french a fourth the pine tree on that summit be literally full of eye but the enemy never discover any of we though he sometimes drop a few stray shell in we neighborhood we own op be not generally man at night unless some prearranged operation be take place but the officer on duty have to remain within call and sleep in a log hut near the foot of the tree in telephonic communication with battery and brigade the french and italian also have hut close by and i spend several evening play chess with they or talk or listen to the mandolin and the singing of italian _ stornellus _ one young italian in particular i remember with some affection a certain lieutenant prato a mandolin player of great skill and a very charming personality one day in September when the news from the french front be get better and better i remember talk on we tree top to the italian officer who be at that time act as _ liaison _ officer to we brigade a member of a family well know in milan he know every inch of those mountain now in austrian hand along the old italian frontier he battery have fight there in the early part of the war he know too gorizia and the carso battlefield and he be sick at heart as every italian always silently be at the memory of the retreat of last autumn and i remember say that what be now happen in the somme country would happen soon in italy there i remind he be a stretch of country which we have once conquer inch by inch with terrible loss and infinite heroism and insufficient artillery just as italy have conquer those position on the carso and on monte santo and all those gain of ours have be wipe out in a few disastrous hour last march as italy 's have be wipe out last October and now we be advance again over that same country and beyond it far more rapidly and with far smaller loss than in those bloody day two year ago and so i prophesy to he would it be on this front too the day be come when italy would win back all she have lose and far more than she have ever win before far more swiftly and cheaply than in she early brave offensive and austrium like germany would be break in hopeless irretrievable defeat he say to I then that he hope it might come true but that he be less certain of the future than i but two month later when i have prove to be a true prophet he remind I of that conversation of ours part vi the last phase chapter xxxvi the move to the piave the second week in October we move down from the plateau and lay for a week at mestre within sight of venice one clear afternoon it look as though one could throw a stone across the intervene water every one take for grant that a big italian offensive be imminent the rumor be that it would be time to begin as near as possible on the anniversary of the defeat of caporetto in italy more weight be attach to anniversary than with we one feel expectation everywhere in the air \* \* \* \* \* it be during these day that i fall in with the rumanian legion i have be in padua and see a group of they stand on the platform at the railway station they be obviously not italian they uniform be similar to that of the italian infantry but they collar be red yellow and blue and they wear a cockade of the same three color on they hat they wear sam browne belt too and carry a _ pugnale _ like the italian arditus i ask a carabiniere on duty who they be he smile but do not know perhaps yugo-slavs he suggest one of they overhear we conversation and come up to I say siamo rumenus legione rumena then follow a tremendous fraternisation we shake hand all round and begin to talk we talk italian which be very like they own language they all understand indeed for a italian rumanian be much easier to understand than many of the italian local dialect they be attractive people of all age and very friendly rather like italian but with a queer indescribable racial difference they be native mostly of transylvanium and have much to say of the oppression of they nationality by the magyar most of they have be conscribe to fight in the austro-hungarian army but have cross over to the italian line at the first opportunity one say there be four million of we in austrium and hungary then with a air of restrained fury be that not enough another say but after the war there will be a great rumanium -- great and beautiful and another say we rumanian must be very grateful to guglielmone -lrb- 1 -rrb- if he have not make this war we should not have see the greater rumanium in we lifetime but now if it be not certain before the blunder of carluccio -lrb- 2 -rrb- have put it beyond all doubt and another tell I that he father write and speak english very well have live for twelve year in america at st loui and another explain to I how the rumanian have retain more than any other modern nation the speech and custom and dress and tradition of the ancient roman which thing they have originally derive from the legionary of the emperor trajan -lrb- 3 -rrb- when we part i say may we all meet again on the field of victory beyond the piave long live the greater rumanium and they all cry long live england long live victory and so i be go away when one of they a little fellow with a rather sad earnest face who have apparently miss a parting handshake run after I about twenty yard and seize I by the hand and cry again long live victory -lrb- footnote 1 : big william -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : wretched little charle -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : this common boast of the rumanian be quite true it be partly to be account for by the fact that they be able to retreat before successive invade horde of barbarian into the inaccessible valley of the carpathian and come down again on to the plain when the danger have pass by -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* from mestre we move up through treviso to a battery position on which a advance party have be at work for several day it grow more and more certain that the offensive be come at last troops of all arm be move forward in unending stream along every road lead toward the piave prominent among they be many italian engineer and bridge detachment with great number of pontoon beyond treviso all troop movement take place at night and we defensive -lrb- and offensive -rrb- measure against aircraft be apparently sufficient to prevent the enemy from get any clear idea of what be go on it seem that he expect a attack in the mountain but not on the plain the italian high command on the other hand consider that the relative strength and morale of the oppose army be now such that we could attack on the plain without fear of a successful counter-attack in the mountain and that the attack on the plain once well under way we could pass to the offensive in the mountain also this view of thing be justify by the event which follow two british division be move down to the plain and one be leave in the mountain the heavy artillery be divide proportionately and of my own brigade one battery be leave in the mountain but the rest move down we new battery position lay between the ruin village of lovadina and the river piave about three-quarter of a mile from the nearer bank there be a farmhouse not much knock about close to the gun pit and with the aid of a few tent erect out of sight along a shallow ditch the whole battery be very tolerably billeted another british battery be less than a hundred yard in rear of we and two other not far away on we right flank we be once more in a land of acacia hedge begin now to take on they autumn tint for mile round we the country be dead flat beyond the river we could see on a little rise what be leave of susegana castle near to conegliano and on a higher longer ridge further away the white _ campanile _ of san daniele del friuli above udine it be there that almost a year ago in the first newspaper i see after the retreat i have read that italian rearguard be still fight in the far distance rise great mountain mass up there be feltre and belluno and behind just visible when the light be very bright the peak of carnium and the cadore it be a unaccustomed feeling after month of comparative immunity from observation behind mountain ridge to be in flat country again at first we all feel a queer sense of insecurity whenever we walk about even when thick hedge manifestly screen we from enemy eye but the road from lovadina to the river bank at palazzon which run right through we position and within a few yard of we billet be in full view and no movement along it be permit during daylight when we first arrive we find a deep sense of gloom prevail amongst we advanced party they be convince that we position have be spot already for the austrian that morning have put down a five minute ' concentration all round the place nothing much heavier than field gun have be firing but it have be lively while it last it seem probable however on further inquiry that this outburst have be cause by the fact that a idiotic officer belong to the battery immediately in rear of we have march a work party up the road in fours then halt they and allow the man to stand about in group on the road for several minute it be at these group that the austrian have apparently be firing a vigorous protest extract from we neighbor a promise that more common sense should be use in future we be to remain a silent battery until the start of the offensive and this be to be dependent on the height of the river which at that time be in full flood owe to heavy rain in the mountain we gun be well camouflage and the chance of we detection seem small but one day we have a lucky escape it be very clear and there have be great activity in the air on both side all the morning all seem quiet again however and we have the camouflage off one of we gun and two small party work in the open on shelter trench behind a plane be see approach but the air sentry whose duty it be to keep a sharp look out through glass and signal the approach of enemy aircraft by two blast of a whistle give no warning he have be deceive by the mark on the plane a very thin black cross instead of the thick one usually find on enemy aircraft not till it be right upon we do he blow the whistle and then it be too late the plane fly very low over we we could see the pilot look calmly down at we uncovered gun and we man try ineffectually and belatedly to take cover he certainly take it all in and mark we down on he map the position be ` very easy to identify owe to the solitary farmhouse and the road close by a few rifle shot be fire but they do he no harm and he sail away toward the river and he own line we have certainly be spot and then we suddenly see another plane this time a italian come from the left fly high hard in pursuit the austrian begin to rise but the italian outpace he and get right above he and press he gradually down towards the ground we hear the wooden-sounding _ clack-clack-clack _ of machine gun fire and then we see the austrian evidently go out of control diving toward the ground more and more rapidly and the italian circle downward above he and then the austrian go out of sight behind the acacia and a few moment later a column of smoke begin to rise he have crash in flame just this side of the river and he valuable information with he the italian fly back over we triumphantly and very low this time and wave he hand to we and we give he a grateful cheer chapter xxxvii the beginning of the last battle by the night of October 24th the river have fall a few inch and british infantry cross in small boat to the grave di papadopoli a long island of sand in the middle of the stream on the right a battalion of the gordon cross row over by venetian boatman i meet one of they officer afterwards everyone of those boatman deserve a decoration he say they be all as cool under heavy shell fire as if they have be rowing on the grand canal we infantry hold they preliminary position here for two day in spite of considerable austrian bombardment and counter-attack british aeroplane fly over the island and drop ration in sandbag throughout the fighting of these two day we be stand by ready to open fire if order should come but no order come and we remain a silent battery but on the night of October 26th half a hour before midnight the big bombardment open and we gun speak again it be to be they last great oration it be of its kind a fine thunderous performance and the austrian reply in we own neighborhood be feeble evidently they have not spot we position thanks to that italian airman we target be enemy battery and brigade headquarters we fire gas shell continuously for many hour switch from one target to another until a strong wind get up render gas shell comparatively ineffective then we get order to change to high explosive the gun detachment work splendidly as always we be below strength and could not furnish complete relief but no one spare himself or grumble on the morning of the 27th just before 7 o'clock we infantry attack cross from the island to the further bank of the river there be no bridge and the water be breast high in some place in place it come right over the head of the smaller man but they taller comrade pull they through where the current be strongest cable be throw across and firmly secure and to these man hold on as they force they passage through the water about ten o'clock i go forward from the battery position to the river bank at palazzon to ascertain the situation a little man name sergeant barinus half a italian and half a englishman but serve in the english army and attach to we battery accompany I at palazzon the river be broad and under fire unbridgeable and we go half a mile down stream along what up to this morning have be we front line trench to the bridgehead at lido island the island in mid stream be crowd with prisoner and wound come back and fresh troops go forward and dead body lay about british and austrian together of man who have fight they last fight and two crash aeroplane the austrian have put up elaborate barbed-wire defence on the island but these have be pretty well break up by we fire some enemy gun of big calibre be still shell the crossing and cause casualty among a battalion of the northumberland fusilier who be in reserve wait on the bank for the order to cross i try to locate as accurately as possible the direction of these gun and report they by telephone to we brigade headquarters i see a infantry brigadier who say that thing be go well but ask for some additional artillery support for he left flank on the other side and if possible for a enemy battery which he think be near susegana castle to be knock out i look across the river and see the dense white smoke screen which we field gun be put up to cover the advance these italian river of the venetian plain feed by the melting alpine snow be not at all like the thame where i be there be about nine successive channel vary in breadth and depth and in between stone and sand and rough vegetation on island vary in size and shape and number with the height of the river and it be no uncommon thing for the river to rise or fall several foot in a night for whole island to be submerge or for whole channel to run dry the difficulty here of carry out military operation accord to a time table arrange several day in advance be very great over the main channel pontoon have be throw over other light plank bridge less strongly support through other everybody be wade large body of engineer mostly italian be ceaselessly work at these river crossing and work magnificently for not only be it necessary to be constantly strengthen and multiply the bridge already make to take the ever-increasing volume of traffic that would be require to supply the troops across the river but the enemy 's gun be still firing with terrible accuracy at the crossing and swarm of enemy plane be constantly appear bombing the bridge and the island in a last desperate effort to hold up we advance we plane too be never far away and succeed in drive off or drive down many of these attacker but other get through and be constantly undoing the work of the engineer when we have get all the information we could barini and i go back to the battery and report what we have hear and see on the way i let myself go and spout much cheap rhetoric i be afraid at the little man and he laugh rather nervously and think I i expect a queer companion in rather unpleasant surroundings for several shell kick up great cloud of earth and stone pretty close to we but he too i know smell victory in the air that day chapter xxxviii across the river next day i go over the river and right on one of the two foo 's -lrb- forward observation officer -rrb- from my brigade who be to establish and maintain contact with the advance infantry three signaller and a runner come with I carry rifle bayonet and ammunition a day 's ration and much signalling gear the other officer have he own party we soon subdivide we work and separate the twenty-four hour of my duty do not lend themselves to a sustained description i pass and identify from the map one of the target of my battery in the preliminary bombardment a austrian battery position which we have bombard for many hour with gas and high explosive alternately we shooting have be accurate and deadly the position be a mass of shell hole one of the gun have be blow up a second badly damage a third have be pull out of its pit and half way up a bank by a team of horse the enemy have make a desperate effort to get it away but horse and man and fragment of man lay dead around it it be a well prepared position and well conceal by tree but italian airman have spot it and mark it down with precision on the map mark it down for destruction the enemy have do much work here there be fine deep dug-out well timbered and weatherproof comfortable dwelling place in quiet time and strong enough to resist shell splinter and even direct hit by gun of small calibre but we have get a direct hit on one dug-out and kill half a dozen occupant and the other have not be proof against we gas they be full of corpse mostly victim of gas some be wear they gas mask but we gas have go through they some have apparently be gas outside some with mask on and some without and have crawl die into the dug-out in the vain hope of find protection there however harden one may grow by usage to the common fact of war few can look on such a sight as this without feel a queer thrill of very mixed emotion my man look with solemn face at the work they have help to do one say poor chap _ they _ be pretty well do in and then we turn and go on \* \* \* \* \* it be a very rapidly move warfare that day one infantry brigade headquarters with whom i keep in intermittent touch occupy four successive position mile apart in the course of twelve hour about noon i come to a ruin village tezze i go on to reconnoitre it with one signaller in a half wreck house we hear the voice of italian peasant woman and see through a open door a ugly little dirty child probably about a year old crawling among rubbish and refuse the village be only just ours on the far side of it man of the manchester regiment be line a ditch under cover of a hedge wait the order to charge they warn I to go no further along the road which they say be under enemy machine gun fire every few minute enemy shell whistle over we head and burst in the field and house behind we a wet wind blow down the road there be no fixed clearly marked line everything be in movement and rather uncertain enemy gun capture with they ammunition swing round and firing at the enemy big gun and little gun on the british leave the como brigade be advance rapidly in spite of pretty strong opposition for a while we left flank have be perilously in the air but the danger be past now all the road be thick with austrian equipment throw away in the confusion of departure rifle steel helmet -lrb- grotesquely shape like high-crowned bowler hat -rrb- ammunition coat pack -lrb- handsomely get up with furry exterior -rrb- mail bag map office store tin despatch box photograph of blonde girl bayonet hand bomb everything dead thrust into the ditch both man and horse the latter smell earlier and stronger than the former -lrb- the more i look at dead body the more childish and improbable do the old idea of personal immortality appear to I -rrb- at one cross-road a huge pool of blood mingle with and overwhelming the mud here a whole transport team of heavy gray horse with wagon have be hit and blow up close by in a ditch two british wounded lay on stretcher cover with blanket one only lightly wound give we information and direction the other be very near to death he face be grow pale already as only the face of the dead be pale he be shift feebly and ineffectually with the vain instinct to escape from pain he be past speech but he look at we out of wide open half-frightened eye that seem to question the world despairingly like a animal broken helplessly in a trap there be some civilian wander on the road liberate now but uncertain whither to go or what place be safe they possession on cart but soon the storm of battle will have pass well beyond they and they will be able to return to what be leave of they home one old woman in black walk lame ask I if the austrian would come back and begin to cry i hear some of we soldier say in wonder to each other do you see those civy go along the road just now queer irrelevant creature in the battle zone other more fixed liberate in they own village be eager to talk and to welcome we but a little lose with the british and they unfamiliar way and language full of tale of the lack of food under the austrian occupation and the robbery of all they livestock and metal and many other thing but the retreat hereabouts have be too rapid and involuntary for deliberate burning or destruction or trap-setting on a appreciable scale that night i make my headquarters in a wreck church from the tower of which i send back signal in the morse code by means of a lamp i sleep for a hour or two under a austrian blanket none too clean as it afterwards appear and drink austrian coffee and eat austrian biscuit all through that day and night and the day follow the cannonading continued but with very variable intensity at different point and time sometimes a tremendous affair heavy field gun and trench mortar all pound away together creep barrage smoke screen and the rest of it elsewhere and at other time nothing infantry well ahead of the gun go forward almost into the blue with nothing heavier than machine gun to support they british cavalry go through in the dawn spectral artistically perfect aim at ambitious distant objective northamptonshire yeomanry who have come from france to italy a year ago and have be keep behind the line all through the war and be have they first show at last the next day they suffer many casualty but they do fine work they reconnaissance officer come into the church soon after midnight and ask I if the austrian still hold any part of the village i tell he no not since yesterday morning later on in the morning great mass of infantry move up through the village british infantry with a look of evident satisfaction in they face but unemotional italian infantry look usually even less expressive but ready to burst into electrical enthusiasm at a touch at a word at a sign a british general all smile ride past on he horse and stop to ask I a question or two he tap I playfully on the helmet with he ride crop when will you get you gun across the river he ask as soon sir as the sapper can build a bridge that will carry they i reply now and again italian plane go on or come back from raid and reconnaissance fly very low over we head the pilot wave they hand over the side and cheer the troops on the road cheer back and upwards in return when i be relieved i tramp back to the piave many mile now and wade those of the channel that be still unbridged return tired and footsore but with a song in my heart to my battery \* \* \* \* \* not till later do we come to comprehend the vast sweep and the triumphantly execute plan of this last great battle -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : for a full and lucid account see the official _ report by the comando supremo on the battle of vittorio veneto 24th October -- 2nd November _ 1918 -rrb- at dawn on the 24th the same day that the british division have cross to the grave di papadopoli the italian fourth army have attack in the grappa sector where fighting be desperate and progress slow for several day on the evening of the 26th the piave be bridge in three sector and on the 27th three bridgehead be in be the first on the upper piave in the hand of alpinus and french infantry of the italian twelfth army the second on the middle piave in the hand of arditus and other troops of the italian eighth army the third further downstream in the hand of we two british division and the italian eleventh corps for a while the situation have be critical owe to the gap between the second and third bridgehead but by the 28th fresh division have cross the river at all three bridgehead and spread out fanwise link up the gap in the line the same day on the asiago plateau the enemy at last fall hurriedly back to he _ winterstellung _ and british troops occupy the ruin of asiago itself during the next two day the advance troops on the plain sweep steadily eastward on the 31st the enemy 's line in the grappa sector completely collapse with great loss of man and gun on the 1st of November a attack be launch along the whole of the italian front from the sea to the height of the stelvio amid the glacier and the eternal snow on the swiss frontier and on this day italian british and french troops carry at last after strong resistance the whole northern ridge of the asiago plateau at which we have gaze with eye of desire for many long month chapter xxxix liberatorus on November the 1st a reconnaissance by car be order to test the practicability and the need of accelerate the forward movement of we gun leary and i and two other start early in a car adequately armed and carry a day 's ration and a flask in which rum have be mixed accidentally with _ florio _ -lrb- marsalum -rrb- this most original mixture which we christen florium be excellent more thirst-quenching than rum more sustain to the spirit than florio that day we travel 76 mile at the least in a great curve through liberate country we have everywhere a astounding reception never to be forget everywhere we pass we be wildly deliriously cheer by the civilian population old man run up to we wave they hat old woman clap they hand young girl wave and throw flower at we little boy run shout after we all cry evviva evviva liberatorus viva gl ' inglesi the radiant joy of they and they smile never far from tear be the manifestation of a form of human emotion singularly pure and indescribably move every town and village be hang with the italian flag and at one place a arch of flower run from tree to tree above the road everywhere crowd with smile wonder face stand watch the ally troops move up along the road wave upon wave upon wave triumphant unendingly here a few day ago the foreign invader have rule perhaps only yesterday perhaps only a few hour ago : now he have vanish like a bad dream from which one suddenly awake leave behind he only he dead and certain grim mark of he occupation and vivid memory of many brutal and cruel and thoughtless act to prove that he be worse and more real than a dream \* \* \* \* \* we cross the piave at spresiano on a series of wooden bridge and pontoon similar to those further down the stream at palazzon and lido island on the further bank we come first to conegliano here just a year ago some of von below 's german troops who break the line at caporetto have be billet and later a bulgarian governor and staff have be install for the encouragement and flattery of the waver minor ally of the enemy power on the same principle a turkish governor have be appoint at feltre the troops of occupation have be guilty of wicked excess at conegliano the little town have be ruthlessly ravage and set on fire and the majority of the house have be completely burn out only the char shell of they remain hence we turn northwards up into the alpine foothill through country of exceptional beauty and along the shore of a piece of long blue water to the village of revine lago here be many capture and abandon austrian gun some in the last desperate moment of departure have be throw down a steep cliff which overhang the lake and lay below we for the time be out of reach here i meet again several officer of the italian field artillery whom i meet above val brenta in January include the neapolitan adjutant of colonel buccus also general clericus of the bersaglierus who for the moment have he headquarters here a friend of one of my companion they all substantiate the rumor that last night or the night before austrian envoy have appear with a white flag in the val lagarina and have be take to diaz 's headquarters we part from we friend and speed on to vittorio veneto which give its name to this last great battle be the point on which those italian force move whose purpose and whose successful achievement it be to cut the austrian army in two separate the army in the mountain from the army in the plain vittorio stand on and around the summit of a little hill itself one of the foothill the older part of the town picturesque with little wind street the newer part well lay out with broad road shaded with avenue of tree here the austrian flight have be more rapid and the damage smaller but we be still many mile behind the ever advance battle line we determine therefore to turn sharply eastward and make for pordenone in the hope of come up with the fight thereabout for last night we hear the austrian be still defend themselves on the near side of that town the road from vittorio to sacile grow thicker with advance troops at first all italian then as we approach sacile mixed italian and british much italian cavalry and artillery then british infantry and some battery of field gun in sacile itself which british troops have liberate the crush of troops be dense and hold we up for more than half a hour union jack hang out from many house side by side with the italian tricolor as we wait for a chance to go forward a battalion of the bisagno brigade go past along the side of the road two deep at a steady double several officer i recognize whom i have meet at dinner at a little restaurant at marostica many month before and again near casa girardi on the plateau we wave to one another and cheer as they pass when at last we move on again we find the road from sacile to pordenone pretty clear for several mile and be able to get up speed but what a sight this road present along it a confused mass of austrian transport be move yesterday in headlong retreat they be bombard by artillery ceaselessly bomb and machine-gun from the air the slaughter here have be great the ditch be full of dead man and horse and the loss in wreck and abandon material of every kind have be immense and the civilian who have be practically without food for many day have be cut up and eat the dead horse poverinus say a italian officer to whom we give a lift into pordenone they be all starve and we have little chance yet to bring they food pordenone be ours it have fall in the early hour of this morning but the depart austrian have burn and wreck it the street be full of the debris and furniture which they have throw out of the house and shop in the last mad search for loot we push on and come up with british infantry advance and the transport wagon and the steam field cooker of two battalion and some cyclist company of bersaglierus but the transport be at a standstill and the dismount man only go forward slowly we soon discover the cause the wooden bridge over the meduna river be on fire pour forth cloud of smoke the austrian have be here only four hour before and have blow up two span as they retreat and soak the rest with paraffin and set it alight the bridge be effectually destroy italian cavalry we hear have go through the water in pursuit and likewise some british infantry patrol swim and wade and make use of various ingenious improvise device but the austrian have a good three hour start and be run fast and travel light it be think but we be unable to get we car across turn northward along the river bank and drive furiously and after a mile or two outrun the foremost infantry patrol -lrb- i think of the royal warwick -rrb- who be push cautiously forward search the wood and farmhouse for lurk rearguard and so it be that first of all the ally troops we four enter the little village of nogaredo and as we come in we sing very loudly and perhaps somewhat out of tune the chorus of _ la campana di san giusto _ the forbid song which to the italian irredentist stand for somewhat the same officially repress but inextinguishable emotion as that once forbid song _ the wear of the green _ stand for to the nationalist irishman of a now vanish generation le ragazze di trieste cantan tutte con ardore ' o italium o italium del mio core tu ci vieni a liberar ' -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : all the maiden of trieste sing with passion o italy o italy of my heart thou comest to set we free -rrb- so to that village _ we _ be the visible liberator all the villager come run towards we crowd around we car weep and cheer pour out they story touch and hold and kiss we it be seldom that thing happen with such dramatic perfection the last austrian they say have be go only half a hour we press on along a narrow road but it be late afternoon and the light be fail the road grow worse and the mud thicker much retreat traffic have only lately traverse it at last we stick deep in two muddy rut the wheel skid round helplessly we could go neither forward nor backward three of we get out and shove with all we strength there be a crackle of rifle shot not far away we be prepare for a encounter but nothing come of it we get the car out at last but the road be too bad for further progress and it be almost dark we turn and drink up the remains of we florium and come back but that day have be unforgettable chapter xl the completeness of victory the end be almost come on November 3rd we receive the official announcement that a armistice have be sign and that at 3 pm on November 4th hostility on the italian-austrian front would cease that same day trento trieste and udine fall one begin to be aware of the completeness of

come back \* \* \* \* \* the fighting be over that night of the 4th of November all the sky be light up with bonfire and the firing of color rocket and white véry light one could hear bell ring in the distance back toward treviso and singing and cheer everywhere it be a hour of perfection and of accomplishment it be the ending of a story a epic cycle of history be finish the cycle of the war of italy against austrium the task of complete italian unity be finish so far as a series of war could finish it the fight be do but the banner win thy comrade of old have bear it hence have bear it in triumph hence then the soldier spake from the deep dark grave : ' i be content ' the soldier have do he duty now let the statesman do no less let wisdom and imagination make sure the fruit of valor \* \* \* \* \* the old austrium be dead and from she grave which italian hand have dig be rise up new nation the future comrade of the old nation and of italy who in these bloody year have grow from youth to full manhood it have be say that a nation be a friendship and the common life of nation in the future must also be a friendship necessarily less intimate but in no way less real the youth of the world must never be call to swim again with old age on its back through sea of needless death to the steep and distant cliff of military victory there must be no more secret plot nor seeming justification of plot by little group of elderly man against the life and happiness of young man everywhere the world must be make safe for justice and for youth \* \* \* \* \* youth be rejoice that night in italy when the war against austrium end and not youth only nor italian only the british troops loudly and healthily and almost riotously sing also all the temporary soldier and nearly all the regular yet here and there be gloom and drab wet blanket try to make smoulder those rage fire of joy in a few officer ' mess especially among the more exalted unit man of forty year and more croak like raven over they impending loss of pay and rank brigadier general who would soon be colonel again and colonel who would soon be major to have be through long uneventful unmental year a peace-time soldier put the imagination in jeopardy and be apt to breed a self-centred fatuity which the inexperienced may easily mistake for deliberate naughtiness yet these brave man who hate peace and despise civilian have many human quality they be generally polite to woman and they be kind to animal and to those of they inferior who show they proper deference and salute they briskly it be not always easy to judge they fairly and that night one do not try they jar intolerably they seem a portent though in truth they be something less they find themselves leave alone to they private grief ruminate regretfully over the golden age that have suddenly end gaze into the blackness of a future without hope chapter xli in the euganean hill _ November 12th _ 1918 it be all over for a few day it seem possible that we might be send northward through redeem trento and over the brenner and the crest of the alp and down through innsbruck to open a new front against germany along the frontier of bavarium but that will not be necessary now it be all over we battery be live partly in a little terra-cotta villa and partly in a barn close by we be among the euganean hill a group of little hump shape like sugar loaf which rise out of the dead level of the venetian plain south-west of padua here shelley write a famous and beautiful poem and venice on a clear day be visible in the distance from a monastery perch among tree upon one of the loftiest hump we gun which will never fire any more sit in a neat row dress by the right along the garden path outside the villa they nose point across a grass lawn they name which be the battery 's italian history be paint on they muzzle and they trail in large white letter pick out with red upon a dark green ground : _ carso _ _ piave _ _ altipiano _ and _ trentino _ _ trentino _ be my gun they look very ornamental in they new coat of paint and with a high polish on they unpainted metal part it be a hour of anticlimax there be nothing to do and one have to make work in a hundred silly ingenious way next week some of the man who have be out of england for 19 month will go on leave then after a fortnight in england unless something tremendous and unexpected happen they will all come back again and there will still be nothing to do be it wordsworth who say that poetry be emotion remember in tranquillity wordsworth would undoubtedly have write much poetry here we chief delight be leary 's musical voice he sing to we in the evening after dinner _ la campana di san ginsto _ and _ addio mium bell ' addio _ and choice _ stornettus _ and _ come to ferrara with I _ a cheerful song of he own composing set to a music-hall tune which be famous three year ago and _ we 'll all go a-hunting to-day _ a old song with a superb chorus and so the day pass one very like another i dream last night that a regular soldier of high degree and uncertain nationality appear to I and say do you not see now young man that peace be degeneracy and that war be a ennobling discipline and i chance my luck reply yes the great von moltke himself say that peace be a dream and not even a beautiful dream whereupon my visitor change into a white owl and vanish with a hoot and i awake and find that i have oversleep myself and that the nine o'clock parade which i be due to attend be already fall in outside then say i to myself bitterly at any rate we here have all survive and therefore since war be the greatest of all biological test we must all be very fit to have survive especially that most fit young man who come out to the battery from england a day or two before the armistice be sign after three year at shoeburyness and the fittest of all must be those whose survival apart from such danger as influenza and air raid have never be in doubt the valuable people who have be keep in england because they be member of concert party or football team at the depôts or officer ' servant to influential _ imboscatus _ or influential _ imboscatus _ themselves and then with a great and well-disciplined effort i pull my thought together and say to myself enough of these musing of the peace-time soldier chapter xlii last thought on leave italy on the 3rd of December i pass out of italy after eighteen month spend as a soldier within she border these eighteen month will always be light up for I by the memory of a great comradeship between man of ally nation we have live together through the dark day and the sunshine through sorrow and joy through uncertainty and defeat to final victory i have be very fortunate in my personal relation in italy i have find always among italian both civilian and military and from simple soldier to general the most open friendliness the most unsparing kindliness the most happy spirit of good fellowship and on my journey home i close my eye and imagine myself back once more at venice in full summer and at milan and at hospitable ferrara and at rome in the spring and on the shore of the bay of naple and out on caprus and in the wonder world of sicily -- and always among friend and then my step go back in fancy to the battlefield where we gun have be in action i see again the great peak and the precipitous valley of the trentino i see the wreck of liberated asiago ringed round with mountain whose side be clothe with shattered pine tree heavy with snow and i go down once more by that astounding mountain road from granezza to marostica with the venetian plain and all its city spread out beneath my foot and venice herself on the far horizon amid the shimmer of sunshine on the distant sea i stand again on the bridge at bassano look up the val brenta with monte grappa towering above I on my right hand and then turn south-eastward across the level plain i hear again the rush water of the piave and cross to the farther side pass through conegliano burn out and ravage and vittorio veneto a name that will resound for ever to the broken bridge over the meduna east of pordenone and the village of nogaredo whither i come as one of its first liberator and as in a dream i see udine unspoilt and radiant as she be fifteen month ago before caporetto and poor little palmanova as i last see she wreathe in the black smoke of she own burning and the cypress and the great church of aquileium and the lagoon of grado then the fly foot of memory carry I beyond the isonzo up the wooded slope of san michele where the dead lie thicker and along the vippacco run swiftly between bank thick with acacia and among the ruin suburb of gorizium up towards those desolate land which for future generation of italian will be i think the holiest ground of all -- the bare summit of monte santo and the mountain-locked tableland of bainsizza and the rocky inexorable carso these rock have perhaps be more deeply soaked with blood than any other part of the entire ally line on any continent here die many thousand of the bravest and the best of the youth of italy nellum primavera si combatte e si muore o soldato how many great lover father thinker poet statesman that might have be but never be lie here these land will ever be more thickly people with the cemetery of the dead than with the village of the living land desolate and barren yet strange and beautiful clear and clean be the beauty of those grave in the noonday brightness delicate and tremulous in the early dawn and in the soft light of a fading day and for we who think of those dead with a proud and tender emotion that beauty be in some sort a frail consolation the dust of strong man from the great mountain be bury here and of man from the historic city and the small unknown town and the little white village of italy and of peasant from the wide plain and of brave man from the island and a handful of frenchman and englishman along with they and very many of those tragic soldier draw from many race who die in the service of the austro-hungarian state fight against they own freedom i see again as vividly as though it be yesterday those high-hearted legion of italy sturdy man and fresh-faced boy go forward with a frenzied courage support by a artillery preparation which elsewhere would have be think utterly insignificant to assault position which elsewhere would have be declare impregnable the world say lincoln at gettysburg will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they do here it be for we the living rather to be dedicate here to the unfinished work which they who fight here have thus far so nobly advance that from these honor dead we take increase devotion to that cause for which they give the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have die in vain so may it be they die for the dream of a greater a free and a secure italy and the more reflective of they for a better more coherent world and no more war a part of they dream be already come true but part be a dream still a debt to they that only we can pay it will need to be a far better world with a progress sustained and ever grow through century to come if this tremendous sum of waste youth of broken heart of embittered soul of moral degradation of wound that can not be heal until all this ill-fated generation have pass away if this great sum of past and present evil be to be cancel by future good in the cold balance of historic reality of the dead we may say they task be over they warfare be accomplish but not of the live the future be theirs to make or mar end of project gutenberg 's with british gun in italy by
