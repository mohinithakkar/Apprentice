's surrender part i -- at ashness chapter i the lease the morning be bright after heavy rain and when osborn look out of the library window a warm south-west breeze shake the larch about tarnside hall now and then a shadow speed across the tarn darken the ripple that sparkle like silver when the cloud drive on osborn frown for he have mean to go fishing and it be a morning when the big shy trout would rise he game-keeper be wait at the boathouse but the postman have bring some letter that make he put off he sport this be annoying because osborn hate to be balk and seldom allow anything to interfere with he amusement one letter from a housemaster at a famous public school cover a number of bill which the writer state somewhat curtly ought to have be pay another announce that haye the agent for the estate and a tenant would wait upon osborn who know what they mean to talk about he admit that a landlord have duty but he generally demand attention at a inconvenient time osborn be fifty year of age he have a ruddy skin and well-proportioned figure and be physically a rather fine example of the sport country gentleman for all that there be line on he forehead and wrinkle about he eye he mouth be loose and sensual and something about he hint at indulgence he manner as a rule be abrupt and often overbear the library be spacious the furniture in good taste but get shabby in fact a certain look of age and shabbiness be typical of the house although the window be open the room have a damp smell and the row of book that osborn never read be touch with mildew rain be plentiful in the north-country dale coal be dear and mrs osborn be force to study economy partly because she husband would not by and by osborn turn he glance from the window and fix it on he son who stand wait across the big oak table gerald be a handsome lad like he father but mark by a certain refinement and a hint of delicacy although he feel anxious he pose be free and graceful and he look undisturbed osborn throw the bill on the table this kind of thing must stop he say i have not grumble much perhaps not as much as i ought about you extravagance but only a fool imagine he can spend more than he have get we have have such fool in we family the boy remark and stop when he see osborn 's color rise it be a pity it be true the latter agreed with a patience he do not often use i be pay for it now and you will pay a higher price if you go on as you promise you must pull up i have do enough and be get tired of self-denial gerald 's smile fade he have inherit he extravagance from he father but feel he must be cautious although osborn sometimes show he a forbearance he use to nobody else i be sorry sir he say perhaps i be extravagant but if you do not want to be a outsider you must do like the rest and i understand you expect I to make friend among we own set we can not be shabby he strike the right note for osborn be not clever and perhaps he strongest characteristic be he exaggerated family pride you have enough and i pay you debt not long since he say in fact you have have more than you share with the consequence that grace get less than hers he knit he brow as he indicate the house-master 's curt letter then you have give a stranger a opportunity for write to I like this gerald know he father 's humor see he be get on dangerous ground brown 's a dry old prig sir nothing sport about he he be hardly a gentleman osborn be seldom logical and now he annoyance be rather concentrate on the master who have write to he with jarring frankness than on the extravagant lad he letter imply it he agree and then pull himself up gerald be clever and no doubt mean to divert he thought after all this do not matter he go on i 'll pay these bill but if you get into debt at woolwich you have better not come home i have enough trouble about money and you allowance be go to be a strain there be another thing : carter who have not have you advantage get in as a prize cadet gerald smile he have not get he commission old harry mean well but he be not we sort and these plod cram fellow seldom make good officer a officer must pay he mess bill whether he be good or bad osborn rejoin if you go into the horse artillery there will not be much money leave when you have settle yours so it might be prudent to begin some self-denial now anyhow if you get into debt again you know the consequence he raise he hand in dismissal and walk to the window when the lad go out he have not take the line he mean to take but gerald often so to speak elude he the lad have a way of hint that they understand one another and osborn vaguely suspect that he work upon he prejudice but he be a sportsman he have pluck and know what the osborn tradition demand in fact gerald might go far if he go straight then osborn think he need a drink and after ring a bell he sit down by the window with the tray and glass a servant bring it be significant that he have give no order the servant know what the bell mean when he have drain the glass he vacantly look out boggy pasture and stony cornfield run back from the tarn here and there a white farmstead surround by stunt tree stand at the hill foot farther back a waterfall seam the rock and yellow grass with thread of foam and then a lofty moor red with heather shut off the view the land be poor at the dale head but there be better below where the hill drop down to the flat country and with the exception of ashness farm all be osborn 's from force crag where the beck plunge from the moor to the rich bottom round allerby mill unfortunately the estate be encumber when he inherit it and he have pay off one mortgage by raise another he might perhaps have use other means let he sport rights and use economy but this would have jar the only osborn who bother about money be he wife and alice be parsimonious enough for both money be certainly what he agent call tight but as long as he could give he friend some shooting and a good dinner and live as a osborn ought to live he be satisfy still gerald must have he chance at woolwich and this need thought osborn feel he would like another drink but glance at he watch and see that he visitor would arrive in a few minute they be punctual and osborn get up when he agent and another man come in haye be tall urbane and dress with rather fastidious neatness bell be round-shouldered and shabby he have a weather-beaten skin gray hair and small cunning eye osborn indicate chair and sit down at the top of the big table he dislike business and know the other mean to persuade he to do something he would sooner leave alone this would have be impossible have he not need money mr bell wish to know if he tender for the slate company 's haulage be approve haye begin he traction engine be suit for the work and he be prepare to buy a trailer lurry which we would find useful in the dale mechanical transport would be a public advantage on we hilly road it need a good horse to bring half a load from station bell interpose t ` lurry would move as much in yan day as farmer ' cart in four osborn agree he be not much of a economist but it be obvious that time and labor be waste when a farmer take a few sack of potato to the railway and another a sack of wool there be no difficulty about the tender because osborn be chairman of the small slate company the trouble be that the contract would help bell to carry out another plan the fellow be greedy and be get a rather dangerous control he have already a lease of the limekiln and allerby mill but he rent be regularly pay and it be a advantage to deal with one prosperous tenant instead of several who have not he punctuality and capital the trailer would be useful if you decide to make the new terrace you think about haye suggest the cost of cart the gravel and the slab for the wall would be heavy but i have no doubt mr bell would undertake the work with the trailer on very reasonable term i might forget to send in t ' bill yan good turn deserve another bell remark haye frown he have mean to imply something like this but bell be too blunt for all that osborn be not very fastidious and have long mean to make the terrace when fund permit in fact he hardly see the thing as a bribe it be rather a graceful recognition of he authority very well he say i 'll sign the contract there be another matter haye resume mr bell be willing to take up harkness ' tenancy of the coal yard and seed store at the station he hope you will grant he a long lease osborn ponder harkness have be drunken careless and often behind with he rent he have let he business fall away and it be understand that bell who manage the opposition coal yard have lend he small sum and until recently keep he on he foot this be not because bell be charitable but because if harkness come down while he have any trade leave a capable rival might take he place in the meantime he customer gradually go to bell and now harkness have fail there be no business to attract a newcomer i do not know say osborn i have think of advertise the yard and store you 'll get nobody to pay what i be offer bell reply a stranger would want to see harkness ' book and there be nowt in they as would tempt he to pay a decent rent then with trailer go back from station i could beat he on the haulage up the dale he would niver get he money back if he bowt a engine like mine this be plausible but osborn hesitate he see that bell want a monopoly and have a vague notion that he ought to protect he tenant it be sometimes a advantage to have two trader in a place he remark a certain amount of competition be healthy i do not know if it would be a advantage to the estate and imagine you would not get a tenant to pay what bell offer haye reply besides rival trader sometimes agree to keep up price and competition do not always make thing cheap that be one of the ridiculous argument people who want the government to manage everything sometimes use say osborn with a scornful gesture haye smile it be very well know that i be not a advocate of state ownership all the same unnecessary competition would be wasteful in the dale for example if you have two tenant at the station the farmer who deal with the new man must use they cart each come separately for the small load a horse can take up redmire bank while bell 's trailer after bring down the slate would go back empty then i hear some talk about a fresh appeal to the council to make the loop road round the hill for a moment or two osborn do not answer redmire bank be a obstacle to horse traffic and the road surveyor have plan for ease the gradient that would necessitate cut down a wood where osborn 's pheasant find shelter he have refuse permission and the matter have be drop but if the farmer insist the council might be force to use they power he be obstinate and do not mean to let they have the wood unless he could get he price you know my opinion about that he say yes say haye i imagine it would be prudent not to have the matter bring up however if bell can send back he lurry full the economy be plain it will enable he to sell he coal and seed at a moderate price and pay a higher rent that be so osborn agreed and knit he brow he doubt if bell would give he customer the benefit of the cheaper haulage but the advantage of get a higher rent be obvious osborn know he be be persuade to do a shabby thing and hesitate money however be need and must be get very well he say mr bell can have the lease they talk about something else and when osborn go fishing after the other leave the wind have drop the sun be bright and the trout would not rise he feel rather injure because he have pay for he attention to duty when he join he wife and daughter at tea on the lawn a copper beech throw a cool shadow across the small table and basket chair the china and silver be old and good beyond the belt of waver shade the recently mown grass give out a moist smell in the hot sun the grass grow fine and close for the turf be old but there be patch of ugly weed the border by the house be thinly plant and the color plan be rude but one could not do much with a rheumatic gardener and a boy there use to be two man but mr osborn have insist on cut wages down across the yew hedge the tarn sparkle like a mirror and on its farther side where a clump of dark pine overhang a beach of silver sand the hillslope shine with yellow grass relieve by the green of fern and belt of moss the spot be picturesque the old house with its low straight front and mullioned window round which creeper grow have a touch of quiet beauty osborn be proud of tarnside although he sometimes chafe because he have not enough money to care for it as he ought by and by he glance at he wife who have silently fill the cup and be cut cake she be a thin quiet woman with a hint of reserve in she delicately mold face sometimes she tactfully exercise a restrain influence but for the most part acquiesce for she have find out soon after she marriage that she husband must not be oppose grace who sit opposite have recently come home from school and be mark by a independence somewhat unusual at tarnside she argue with osborn and be firm when he get angry then she have a fresh enthusiasm for change and improvement and a generous faith in what she think be good since osborn be obstinately conventional this sometimes lead to jar after all i be go to have the terrace make he remark and wait for he wife 's approval be it prudent she ask hesitatingly if i remember you think the work would cost too much when we talk about it last it will cost very little in fact i imagine the haulage of the gravel and the slab for the wall will cost nothing osborn reply bell have promise to bring I all the stuff we 'll need with he new trailer oh say grace rather sharply i suppose this mean you have give he the lease of the station coal yard no doubt he offer to bring the gravel before you agree he be cunning and know you want the terrace i can not remember if he offer before or afterwards osborn reply with a touch of embarrassment anyhow i do not think it be important because i do not allow he offer to persuade I for all that it be some satisfaction to get the work do cheap grace ponder she be intelligent contact with she school companion have develop she character and she have begin to understand osborn since she come home she know he be easily deceive and sometimes half-consciously deceive himself no she say i do not think the work will really be cheap it be often expensive to take a favor from a man like bell he will find a means of make you pay ridiculous bell can not make I pay then he will make somebody else pay for what he do for you and it be hardly honest to let he grace insist mr osborn give she a warning glance and osborn 's face get red it be a new thing for a young girl to criticize she father this be what come of indulge you mother and make some sacrifice to send you to a expensive modern school if i would have my way you would have go to another where they teach the old-fashioned virtue : modesty obedience and respect for parent grace smile because she know the school osborn mean and the type it produce she be grateful to she mother for a better start i be sorry she say quietly but with a hint of resolution i do not want to criticize but bell be greedy and cunning and now he have get both coal yard will charge the farmer more than he ought he have already get too large a share of all the business that be do in the dale it be obvious that you have learn less than you think osborn rejoin feeling that he be on safer ground you do not seem to understand that concentration mean economy bell for example buy and store he goods in large quantity instead of handle a number of small lot at different time which would cost he more i can see that grace admit but i imagine he will keep all he save you know the farmer be grumble about he charge osborn frown you talk too much to the farm people i do not like it you can be polite but i want you to remember they be my tenant and not to sympathize with they imaginary grievance they be a grumble lot but will keep they place if you leave they alone he get up abruptly and when he go off across the lawn mr osborn give the girl a reproachful glance you be very rash my dear on the whole you father be remarkably patient grace laugh a rather strain laugh as osborn 's angry voice rise from behind a shrubbery he be not patient now and i be afraid jackson be pay for my fault however i really think i be patient too to talk about people keep they place be ridiculous in fact it be piffle father 's notion be horribly out of date one wonder he do not know thing change perhaps we do not quite realize this when we be get old but you must not argue with you father he do not like it and when he be annoyed everybody suffer it be true but how illogical grace remark and muse while she look dreamily across the grass she be romantic and generous and have learn something about social economy at the famous school in fact osborn would have be startle have he suspect how much she know nevertheless she be young she study be half digested and she theory crude she have come home with a vague notion of play the part of lady bountiful and put thing right but have get a jar soon after she begin she father 's idea of justice be elementary : he resent she meddling and be sometimes tyrannical when it be obvious that he have take a improper line he blame he agent but perhaps the worst be he seldom know when he be wrong then the agent 's main object be to extort as much money from the tenant as possible grace do not see what she could do although she feel that something ought to be do she have a raw undisciplined enthusiasm and imagine that she be somehow responsible yet when she try to use some influence she father get savage and she feel hurt well she must try to be patient and tactful while she meditate mr osborn get up and they go back to the house chapter ii the otter hound grace 's tweed dress be wet and rather muddy when she stand with gerald on a gravel bank at the head of a pool where the beck from the tarn join a larger stream that flow through a neighbor dale there have be some rain and the water be stain a warm claret-color by the peat bright sunshine pierce the toss alder branch and the rapid close by sparkle between belt of move shade large white dog with black and yellow spot swim uncertainly about the pool and search the bank a group of man stand in the rapid while another group watch the tail of the pool somewhere between they a hard-pressed otter hide a few of the man wear red coat and belong to the hunt the rest be shepherd and farmer whom custom entitle to join in the sport all carry long iron-pointed pole and wait with keen expectation the reappearance of the otter grace be perhaps the only one to feel a touch of pity for the exhaust animal and she wonder whether this be not a sentimental weakness there be not much to be say for the otter 's right to live it be stealthy cruel and horribly destructive kill many more fish and moorhen than it could eat indeed before she go to school she have follow the hunt with pleasant excitement and be now rather surprise to find the sport have lose its zest the odds against the otter be too great although it have for some hour baffle man who know the river and well-trained dog it have steal up shallow rapid slip between the watcher ' leg dive under swim dog make bold dash along the bank and hide in belt of reed its capture have often look certain and yet it have escape at first grace have notice the animal 's confidence beauty of form and strength but it have gradually get slack hesitate and limp now when it lurk half-drowned in the depths of the pool while its pitiless enemy wait for it to come up to breathe she begin to wish it would get away thorn the master of the hound be talk to he huntsman not far off he be a friend of osborn 's and grace have once think he a dashing and accomplished man of the world but have recently for no obvious reason feel antagonistic alan be not as clever as she have imagine he be smart sometimes cheaply smart which be another thing then he be begin to get fat and she vaguely shrink from the way he now and then look at she on the whole it be a relief to note that he be occupy for a few moment grace let she eye wander up the dale to the crag where the force leap down from the red moor at malton head belt of dry bent-grass shone like gold and mossy patch glimmer luminously green the fall look like white lace draw across the stone a streak of mist touch the lofty crag and above it a soft white cloud trail across the sky then she turn as she brother speak alan have give we a good hunt and mean to make a kill he be rather a selfish beast and a bit too sure of himself but he run the pack well and know how to get the best out of life no woolwich and sweating as a snub subaltern for he he stop at home see he tenant farm well and shoot he game that be my notion of a country gentleman father can look after tarnside and a duty go with own land grace remark a landlord who need not work ought to serve the state that idea be perhaps the best thing in the feudal system and it be not altogether forget yet father be right when he decide to make you a soldier he can send I to woolwich but after all that be as far as he can go you be not at you best when you be improve gerald rejoin and add with a grin you do not like old alan do you i think you snub he half a hour since grace color but do not answer she have hurt she foot by fall from a mossy boulder and thorn have come to help as she flounder across a shallow pool she be draggle and she hair be loose and thorn 's faint amusement annoy she somehow it hint at familiarity she would not have resent it once for they have be friend but when she come home and he have try to renew the friendship she have note a subtle difference alan be forty but now she have leave school the disparity of they age be in a sense much less marked then a shout rouse she and she look round where the smooth brown water run past the alder root a very small dark object move in advance of a faint widening ripple grace know it be the point of the otter 's head the animal 's lung be empty since it remain up so long next moment plunge dog churn the pool into foam the object vanish and man run along the bank to the lower rapid while those already there beat the shallow with they pole the dog bunch together and begin to swim up stream gerald and one or two more plunge into the water and for a few moment the otter show itself again it look like a fish and not a animal as it break the surface rise in graceful leap then it go down with the dog swim hard close behind and grace think it must be catch it be be steadily drive to the lower end of the stop rapid where the water be scarcely a foot deep the animal reappear plunge in and out among the shallows but forge up stream and the man who mean to turn it back close up there be one at every yard across the belt of sparkling foam they have spike pole to beat the water and it seem impossible that they victim could get past yet the otter vanish and for a minute or two there be silence until the dog rush up the bank then somebody shout the huntsman blow he horn and a small wedge-shaped ripple trail very slowly across the next pool the otter have somehow steal past the watcher ' leg and reach deep water but its slowness tell that its strength have go the dog take the water with a splash and grace turn she head she feel pitiful and do not want to see the end the animal have make a gallant fight and she shrink from the butchery the clatter of heavy boot on stone suddenly stop there be a curious pause and grace look up as somebody shout : ` go to holt can ' off you hound wheer 's t ' terrier the hunt sweep up the bank smash through a hedge and spread along the margin of the neighbor pool a few big alder grow beside its edge send down they root into deep water but for the most part the bank be support by timber drive into the soil and freshly lay with neatly-bedded turf grace know this have be do to protect the meadow because the stream be throw against the concave side when a pool lie in a bend as she stop at the broken hedge a man run past carry a small wet terrier and two or three more come up with spade the otter could not escape now since the hound would watch the underwater entrance to the cave among the alder root while the terrier would crawl down from the other side if a hole could not be find the man would dig they be interrupted soon after they begin for somebody say put down you spade tom hold the terrier grace study the man who have interfere he be young and on the whole attractive he face be honest and sunburned he carry himself well and be dress rather neatly in knickerbockers and shooting jacket she know christopher askew be the son of a neighbor farmer who own he land then as the man stop digging thorn push past what be this he ask haughtily why have you meddle askew look hard at he but answer in a quiet voice it cost we some trouble to mend the bank and if you dig out the otter the stream will soon make a ugly gap then it be a matter of the cost say thorn how much not altogether askew reply color it be a matter of the damage the next flood may do we have a awkward job to strengthen the bank and i be not go to have it cut noo kit dinna spoil sport the old huntsman urge it be none a trick for a canny lad to cheat the hound put terrier in a ' niver mind he shout another and there be cry of approval stop digging tom askew say with quiet firmness pick up the dog we be waste time thorn remark i do not like bargaining you have better state you price grace look on across the broken hedge sympathize with the farmer for one thing she want the otter to escape besides she approve the man 's resolute quietness he have pluck since it be plain that he be take a unpopular line and he use some self-control because thorn 's tone be strongly provocative in fact she think thorn be not at he best he be not entitle to suggest that the other be try to extort as much money as he could no more do i like bargaining askew reply there will be no digging here you have smash the hedge and that be enough call off you dog so you mean to spoil sport even if the damage cost you nothing i know you kind it be get common oh no say askew i will not have the bank cut down but that be all if you like you can look for another otter on we part of the stream thorn give he a search glance and then see he be resolute shrug contemptuously the huntsman blow he horn the dog be draw off and gerald follow the other across the field grace however sit down on a fall tree to rest she foot and for a minute or two think herself alone then she rise as askew come through the gap in the hedge he begin to pull about the broken rail and thorn but see she when he look up they have leave you behind miss osborn he remark with a smile i think i have enough besides i hurt my foot badly no say grace i have only begin to feel it hurt but i wish it be not quite so far to the bridge askew look at the water measure its height the step stone be not far off one or two may be cover but perhaps i could help you across and it would save you a mile grace go on with he and they presently stop beneath the alder branch by a sparkling shallow tall brush grow up the shady bank and briar trail in the stream a row of flat-topped stone run across but there be gap where the current foam over some that be lower than the rest grace 's foot be get worse and sit down on a slab of the slate stile she glance at she companion i imagine it need some pluck to stop the hunt she say for one thing you be alone nobody agree with you askew smile opposition sometimes make one obstinate but do you think it be hard to stand alone yes say grace impulsively i know it be hard yet of course if you feel you be take the proper line you ought not to be daunt by what other think she stop remember that the man be a stranger and then resume in a different tone but why do you really stop the hunt be you one of the people who do not believe in sport no say askew good humoredly it be curious that mr thorn hint something like that anyhow i be not a champion of the otter 's right to destroy useful fish i think they ought to be shoot oh say grace with a touch of indignation you would shoot a otter well i suppose they must be kill but to use a gun it be better for the otter which do you imagine it would choose -- a mercifully sudden end or two or three hour of agony with man and dog close behind until the half-drowned exhaust animal be tear to piece or mangled by the pole i suppose one must answer as you expect you be honest askew remark i imagine it cost you something to agree it do grace admit after all you know we tradition and many people not cruel people like the sport that be so but let 's take the hunt to-day for a example there be three or four man without a occupation and no doubt they find follow the hound healthy exercise the other have leave work that ought to be do in fact if you think you 'll own that some be man we have not much use for in the dale yes say grace with some reluctance i know the man you mean all the same it be really not we business to decide if they ought to work or hunt askew look amuse and she like he twinkle he be obviously intelligent and on the whole she approve he unconventional point of view conventional insincerity be the rule at tarnside besides although it be possible she ought not to talk to the man with such freedom she foot hurt and the stile make a comfortable seat she like to watch the shadow quiver on the stream and hear the current brawl among the stone this be a excuse for stop since she would not acknowledge that the young farmer 's society have some charm after a moment or two he resume : it be not my business anyhow and i do not want to argue if otter-hunting be a proper sport it be a advantage so to speak to stick to the point all i object to be the hunt 's break down the mend bank there be not many good meadow at the dale-head and grass land be too valuable to be destroy do not you think this justify my opposition i suppose it do grace agree and then decide that she have talk to he enough well i must go on she add with a doubtful glance at the stream but it do not look as if one could get across you can try askew reply and jump down stand in the water hold out he hand come on there be not much risk of a slip since it be too late to refuse grace take he hand and he wade across steadying she while the current rippled round he leg some of the stone be cover but with he support she spring across the gap and the effort do not hurt she foot as much as she have think he be not awkward she like he firm grasp and he care that she do not fall particularly since she see he be satisfy to give she the help she need and know when to stop after she get across she thank he and let he go when she cross the field askew go home in a thoughtful mood though he be conscious of a pleasant thrill he have feel the girl 's charm strongly as he stand near she at the stile and now try to recapture the scene the dark alder branch move overhead the sparkle of the water and the light and shadow that touch he companion she face be attractive although he be not a judge of female beauty he know its molding be good mouth nose and chin be finely but firmly line she color be delicate pink and white and she have rather grave blue eye she figure be mark by a touch of patrician grace askew smile as he admit that patrician be a word he dislike but he could not think of another that quite express what he mean anyhow the girl 's charm be strong she be plucky and frank perhaps because she know she value and need not to pretend to dignity in a sense this be patrician too all the same askew though young and romantic be not a fool he have have a good education and have then spend two year at a agricultural college but he be a farmer 's son and he know where he stand from the osborn ' point of view he have be of help but this be no reason miss osborn should recognize he when they next meet yet he somehow think she would in the meantime it be rash to think about she much although he thought return to the stile beneath the alder where he have watch the sun and shadow play about she face chapter iii a council of defense the sun have sink behind the moor when peter askew sit by a open window in he big slate-flagged kitchen at ashness all be quiet outside except for the hoarse turmoil of the force and a distant bleating of sheep in front across a stony pasture the fellside run up abruptly its summit edge with purple heath cut against a belt of yellow sky the long green slope be break by rocky scar and dot by small herdwick sheep that look like scatter stone until they move the kitchen be shadowy because the house be old and build with low mullioned window to keep out snow and storm and a clump of stunt ash tree grow outside the courtyard wall a fire of root and peat however burn in the deep hearth and now and then a flicker glow touch old copper and dark oak with red reflection collector have sometimes offer to buy the tall clock and ponderous meal chest but askew would not sell the most part of he furniture have be bring to ashness by he great-grandfather peter 's face be brown and deeply line and he shoulder be bent for he have lead a life of steady toil this be rather from choice than stern necessity because he own the farm and have money enough to cultivate it well as a rule he be reserve and thoughtful but he neighbor trust he they know he be clever although he use they homely dialect and live as frugally as themselves in the dale one work hard and spend no more than one need yet peter have break the latter rule when he resolve to give he son a wider outlook than he have have kit have go from the lonely farm to a good school where he have beat by brain and resolution the son of professional and business man he teacher say he have talent and although peter be often lonely since he wife die he mean to give the lad he chance somewhat to he relief kit decide to return to the soil and peter send he to a agricultural college since kit mean to farm he should be arm by such advantage as modern science could give it be obvious that he would need they all in the struggle against low price and the inclement weather that vex the dale now he have come home in a sense not much change and peter be satisfied kit and he seldom jar and the dalesfolk who do not know how like they be under the surface sometimes think it strange four or five of they neighbor sit in the kitchen for the most part smoking quietly but now and then grumble about the recent heavy rain this be not what they have come to talk about and peter wait he know they cautious reserve they be obstinate and slow to move and if he try to hurry they might take alarm by and by one knock out he pipe how be you get forrad with t ' peat-cutting he ask we have cut enough to last for three or four month you 'll need it aw coal 's a terrible price another remark it will be dearer soon say peter since bell have t ' lease o ' both coal yard he can charge what he like a grasp man yan canna get feed stuff for stock seed a ' lime unless yan pay he price noo he have t ' traction-engine kiln and mill he 'll own aw t ' dale before lang it be very possible unless you stop he kit interpose landlord ought to stop he one rejoin kit smile that be too much to expect it be you business to help yourselve mr osborn take the highest rent that be offer and you miss you chance when you let bell get allerby mill neabody else have t ' money another grumble two or three of we could have club together and make a profit after sell feeding stuff at a moderate price the other be silent for a minute of two and kit let they ponder he have learn something about the wastefulness of individual effort and on he return to ashness have urge the farmer to join in bidding for a lease of the mill they have refuse and would need careful handle now for the old cooperative custom that have rule in the dale before the railway come have go poor folk willunt have much left for grocery when they have pay bell 's price for coal say one since he get he money for haul in t ' slate it cost he nowt to tak ' a big load back on t ' lurry but with redmire bank to clim ' it be a terrible loss o ' time cart half a ton up dale you will not be able to buy the half-ton unless you deal with bell i think you 'll find he have a contract for all the coal that come down the line they ponder this and another remark peat 's terrible messy stuff and bad to dry at back end o ' year it can be dry say a old man i mind the time when iver a load o ' coal go past allerby aw t ' folk club togedder to cut and haul t ' peat from malton browt it doon on stane-boat by the oad green road howiver i reckon it cost they summat count they time kit give he a paper this be what we peat have cost we i have charge we labor and what the horse would have earn if we have be pay for plow they study the figure pass the paper around and then one say but peat cost you nowt malton moor be yours and i ken nea ither peat worth cut mayhappen yan could find some soft trash on the back moor but i doot if osborn would let yan bring it doon osborn do what he agent say and it be weel kent haye be a friend o ' bell 's another agree peter smile and give kit a warning glance he suspect the agent have a private understanding that be not to he employer 's benefit with bell but this be another matter peter have teach he son to concentrate on the business in hand weel he say you can have aw t ' peat you want and we willunt fratch if you pay I nowt there be acre o ' good stuff on malton moor and the value o ' peat t ' labor it cost to cut aw t ' same it willunt pay to send a man or two noo and then you must work in a gang ivery man at he proper job it be do like that in oad day say one peter look at kit who do not speak for both know when enough be say indeed although he be hardly conscious of it yet kit have something of a leader 's talent for a few minute the other smoke and think they be independent and suspicious about new plan but it be obvious that the best defense against a monopoly be a combine in fact they begin to see it be the only defense they have then one turn to peter if you be for stop bell rob we and starve poor folk at allerby i be with you one after another promise he support a plan be agree upon and peter be satisfy when he neighbor go away they be patient cautious and hard to move but he know they obstinacy when they be rouse now they have start they would go on stubbornly take a road that be new to they bell of course would make a cunning fight but peter doubt if he would win i reckon you plan will work he say to kit with a nod of satisfaction kit nod and pick up he hat and some letter go out as he walk down the dale the moon rise above a shadowy fall touch the opposite hillside with silver light that reach the field at the bottom farther on tall pike of wet hay throw dark shadow across a meadow and he hear the roar of a swollen beck there be too much water in the dale but kit know something might be do to make farm pay in spite of the weather land that have go sour might be recover by drain and a bank could be build where the river now and then wash away the crop osborn however be poor and extravagant and he agent 's talent be rather apply to raise rent than improve the soil kit stop when he get near allerby where the dale widen and a cluster of low white house stand among old tree the village glimmer in the moonlight and beyond it rolling country dot by dark wood run back to the sea a beck plunge down the hillside with a muffle roar and a building half in light and half in shadow occupy the hollow of the ghyll kit lean on the bridge watch the glistening thread of water that trickle over the new iron wheel and note the raw slate slab that have be recently build into the mossy wall a big traction engine neatly cover by a tarpaulin and a trailer lurry stand in front of the slide door osborn have spend some money here for allerby mill with its seed and chemical manure store pay he a higher rent than the best of he small farm it be obviously well manage by the tenant and kit approve modern machine and method although expensive be good and be need in the dale the trouble be they sometimes give the man who could use they power to rob he poorer neighbor kit see that concentrated power be often dangerous and since unorganized individual effort be no longer profitable he know no cure but cooperation although young he be seldom rash enthusiasm be not common in the bleak northern dale whose inhabitant be for the most part conservative and slow wind and rain have harden he and he have inherit a reserved strength and quietness from ancestor who have brave the storm that rage about ashness yet the north be not always stern for now and then the gray sky break and fall and dale shine in dazzling light and melt with mystic beauty into pass shade kit like he country vary in he mood sometimes he forget to be practical and he caution vanish leave he romantic and imaginative he go on and as he reach the first of the white house a girl come out of a gate and stop where the moonlight fall across the road she have some beauty and she pose be graceful oh she exclaim with rather exaggerated surprise it be kit i suppose you 'll take this letter i be go to the post kit do not know much about young woman but hesitate because he doubt if she want he to post the letter if you like he say i expect the causeway at the water-splash will be wet she give he a curious smile oh well here be the letter jim nixon have to help I across the water when i go last night and i do not suppose you be afraid of wet you foot you be use to it at ashness yes say kit my boot be stronger than yours canny lad she answer with a mock laugh kit feel embarrassed for he think he see what she mean janet bell be something of a coquette i hear people come down the road not long since she resume have you have a supper party tell you father i think he be shabby because he leave I out it be not a supper party and there be no woman three or four neighbor come in to grumble about the weather or argue about the sheep they do grumble about the weather kit reply janet look amuse you be very cautious my lad but you need not take it for grant i be always on father 's side do you think i do not know why you neighbor come you do not know altogether the moonlight be clear enough to show that janet color and you think i stop you to find out i do not say kit rather awkwardly still perhaps it be better that you should not know oh say she with some emotion i can not tell if you mean to be nice or not it be the lazy feckless people who dislike father because they be jealous and they try to make thing hard for I why should i suffer because he be cleverer than they you ough not to suffer i really do not think people blame you they do blame I janet insist you doubt if you could trust I just now this be true enough to embarrass kit but he say i do not see why i should talk to you about we business that be all in fact i do not mean to talk about it to anybody now you be nicer i do not like to feel you be take particular care not to let I know well of course father 's no friend of yours and perhaps he 'll like you worse by and by but after all do that matter not in a way say kit pretend to be dull you have nothing to do with the dispute and we do not want to quarrel with you father although we mean to carry out we plan janet look rather hard at he and there be some color in she face but she force a smile oh well good-night i have stop you and expect you want to get home she go back through the gate and kit resume he walk struggle with a annoyance he feel be illogical he know something about bell 's household and imagine that janet 's life be not smooth he be sorry for she and it be of course unjust to blame she for she father 's deed all the same the favor she have sometimes show he be embarrassing he be not a philanderer but he be young and she have make he feel that he have play a ungallant part jane be a flirt but after all it would not have cost he much so to speak to play up to she perhaps he have act like a prig this make he angry although he know he have take the proper line by and by he come to the water-splash where a beck cross the road its channel be pave so that one could drive across and at the side a stone causeway have be make for foot passenger sometimes when the beck be unusually swollen shallow water cover the stone and kit see the significance of a statement of janet 's as he note the width of the submerge spot it look as if jim nixon have carry she across then he annoyance vanish and he laugh gallant or not he be satisfy to carry janet 's letter as he go on in the moonlight he begin to see that there be some grounds for he reluctance to indulge the girl he have think about miss osborn often since he help she across the step stone he have not hesitate then and although the thing be different to dwell upon the incident be perhaps rasher than indulge janet miss osborn have no doubt forget but he have not the trouble be he could not forget he imagination picture she vividly sit beneath the alder talk to he with something of a effort kit pull himself up he be a small farmer 's son and the osborn be important people he know osborn 's family pride which he think he daughter have inherit in osborn it be mark by arrogance in the girl by a gracious half-stately calm for all that the pride be there and kit resolve that he would not be a fool go to the post office and put janet 's letter in the box chapter iv the peat cutter osborn be dissatisfied and moody when one afternoon he stand wait for the grouse behind a bank of turf on malton moor to begin with he have play card until the early morning with some of he guest and have be unlucky then he get up with a headache for which he hold he wife accountable alice be get horribly parsimonious and have bother he until he try to cut down he wine merchant 's bill by experiment with cheaper liquor he headache be the consequence the whisky he have formerly keep never trouble he like that moreover it be perhaps a mistake to invite jardine although he sometimes give one a useful hint about speculation on the stock exchange the fellow go to bigger shoot and look bore when osborn 's partridge be scarce and wild besides he have break rule in order to get a shot when they walk the turnip field in line osborn imagine jardine would not have do so have he be a guest at one of the house he boast about visit as they climb malton head another of the party have break dowthwaite 's drystone wall and the farmer have say more about the accident than the damage justified in fact dowthwaite be rather aggressive and now osborn come to think of it one or two other have recently grumble about thing they have hitherto bear without complaint in the meantime osborn and thorn who share he butt look about while they wait for the beater the row of turf bank regularly space run back to the force crag at the head of the dale the red bloom of the ling be fading from the moor which have begin to get brown sunshine and shadow sweep across it and the blue sky be dot by fly white-edged cloud a keen wind sweep the high tableland and the grouse fly before it would come over the butt very fast in the distance one could distinguish a row of figure that be presently lose in a hollow and get larger when they reappear they be beater drive the grouse and by and by osborn pick up he glass see cluster of small dark object that skim and then drop into the heath it be satisfactory to note that they be numerous although the bird be rather wild he could now give he friend some sport after a time however the cluster of dark dot be see first to scatter and then vanish osborn frown as he give thorn the glass what do that mean look as if the bird have break back some have break back say thorn if they have fly over the beater we have lose they for the afternoon he pause and resume : i think the first lot be drop no they be come on pick up he gun he watch the advance grouse they fly low but very fast make a few stroke at interval and then sailing on stretch wing down the wind in a few moment they be large and distinct but there be not enough to cross more than the first two butt when they be fifty yard off thorn throw up he gun and two pale flash leap out osborn be slower and swing he barrel the sharp report be echo from the next butt and a thin streak of smoke that look gray in the sunshine drift across the bank of turf two brown object spin round strike the heath and a few light feather follow the grouse that have escape go on and get small again miss with my right say osborn have to shoot on the swing do not know about the other barrel thorn do know but use some tact i may have be a trifle slow my last bird be go very fast i expect you see whose bird it be osborn say to the lad who take they gun yes sir mr thorn 's sir oh well say osborn force a smile as he turn to thorn you have youth upon you side anyhow i do not imagine the other have do much better and it look as if we might as well go home when the bird break back we lose the best chance we 'll get i wonder what spoil the drive something on the old green road i think the grouse turn as they cross the hollow a short distance off there be a fold in the moor and while osborn wonder whether he would walk to the top a man come over the brow lead two horse that haul a clumsy sledge another team follow and presently four advance across the heath now you know what spoil the drive thorn remark with some dryness you can not expect a good shoot on the day you tenant move they peat osborn who be very angry pick up the glass the first two be not my tenant they be the askew and the boundary of they sheepwalk run on this side of the green road then i suppose there be nothing to be say in the meantime osborn 's friend have leave the other butt and come up with jardine in front he be a fat red-faced man and as he get nearer remark to he companion : i call it wretched bad management somebody ought to have turn the fellow off the moor osborn hear and glance at thorn as he leave the butt there be something to be say i be go to relieve my mind he go off and signal the farmer to stop they wait stand quietly by they horse on the open moor they powerful figure have a touch of grace and they clothes fade by sun and rain harmonize with the color of the heath peter askew 's brown face be inscrutable when he fix he steady eye on osborn you turn back the grouse and spoil the beat do you call that sport osborn ask i be sorry peter reply if i would ken you be shooting mayhappen we could have put off load the peat you know we be shoot when you see the beater aw yi say peter it be over late then i wad not willingly spoil any man 's sport but we have browt up eight horse and have to get to work you have plenty of work at ashness it be verra true but the weather 's we master and we canna awtogether do what we like the peat 's mair important than a few brace of grouse important to you osborn rejoin but what about I and my friend one have come from london for a few day ' sport then i be sorry he have lose the afternoon kit interpose quietly but you well know the wages laborer get in the dale and there be old folk and some sick at allerby who need a good fire the winter 's hard and some of the cottage be very damp the farmer pay the wages none of they make much money they pay what they rent allow i do not force up the rent they be fix by the term new tenant be willing to offer when a lease run out that be so kit agree i do not know that my neighbor grumble much because the rule work on you side but peat be plentiful and we do not see why it can not be use when coal be dear i imagine you can see a opportunity of sell the right to cut it osborn sneer we be willing to sell at the buyer ' price anybody who can not pay may have the peat for nothing none of the day laborer have pay we yet and none shall be force to pay osborn do not know whether he could believe this statement or not but he say ironically then it look as if you be generous however you be not a friend of my agent 's and no doubt see a chance of make trouble when you meddle with my tenant you play a risky game and they may find they be foolish to join you one of the farmer who have stand quietly by peter askew look up with a slow smile another 's weather-beaten face get a little harder they be seldom noisily quarrelsome but they be stubborn and remember a injury long peter however interpose : we will not fratch there be not much in argue you can beat moor t ` ither side o ' green road good day to you he speak to the horse and the sledge lurch forward with its chocolate-colored load the other team strain at the chain there be a beat of hoof and the row of sledge move noisily away osborn wait for a few moment but he face be very red when he go back to the butt the farmer 's refusal to dispute with he be galling for all that he must try to find he friend some sport and after consult with he gamekeeper send the beater on across the moor the new drive be not successful and in the evening the party come down the hill with a very poor bag when they reach the redmire wood osborn stop beside a broken hedge red beech shine among the yellow birch and dark fir the sun be low and its slanting ray touch the higher branch but the gap between the trunk be fill with shadow a few bent figure move in the gloom and osborn frown when three or four child come down a drive drag a heavy fall bough a elderly woman with a sack upon she back follow they slowly and it be obvious that cottager from allerby be gather fuel confound they this be too much he exclaim and beckon he gamekeeper if that be mrs forsyth tell she to come up the woman advance and rest she sack upon the hedge she wrinkled face be wet with sweat but she do not look alarmed eh she say stick be heavy and i be none so young as i be you have no business in the wood say osborn sternly there be nea place else where we can pick up stick that be you affair you know you be not allow to gather wood in my plantation we canna gan withoot some kindling when you canna keep it dry peat be ill to light terrible messy stuff too and mak 's nea end o ' dirt the child come up and when they stand open-mouthed gaze at the party one of the sportsman laugh then burn coal and the dirt will not bother you osborn rejoin hoo can we burn coal the woman ask noo tom bell have lease o ' baith yard he be putten up t ' price and when you have pay what he be ask there be nowt leave for meal i canna work for mr osborn as i use and with oad jim yearning nobbut fifteen shilling -- she pause for breath and wipe she hot face and osborn sign to the keeper the woman be make he ridiculous turn they all out holliday he say and go on with he friend the old lady 's talkative one remark quite frank but not at all angry i think she line be rather dignified i have meet country folk who would have be servilely apologetic and some who would have call you ugly name these people be never apologetic osborn say dryly as a rule they be not truculent but they be devilish obstinate i think i see after all it be possible to stick to you point without abuse you antagonist i suppose you turn they out because of the pheasant yes good cover 's scarce and if the bird be disturb they move down to rafton wood for a sport neighbor hayton hardly play the game to put down corn be of course allowable but he use damage raisin then you do not feed very little osborn reply corn 's too dear the tarnside pheasant live on the country i expect that really mean they live on the farmer osborn frown it be jardine 's habit to make stupid remark like that osborn wonder whether the fellow think they smart the farmer know my rule when they sign the lease he say anyhow pheasant do much less damage than ground game and i do not think my tenant have leave a hare in the dale jardine begin to talk about something else and no more be say about osborn 's grievance until the party meet on the new terrace in the twilight the tarn glimmer with faint reflection from the west but thin mist drift across the pasture and the hill rise vague and black against the sky in which a half moon shine osborn sit at the top of the shallow step that go down to the lawn grumble to he wife about the day 's shooting i do not think i be a exacting landlord he remark in fact since i ask for nothing but a little give-and-take it be annoy when people spoil my sport dowthwaite make himself unpleasant about he broken wall the askew turn the grouse back and then i find the allerby cottage child ransack redmire wood when the pheasant be go to roost grace who stand close by with thorn indicate the smooth gravel and the low wide-topped wall on which red geranium grow this she say be a great improvement on the old grass bank the wide step and broad slate coping have a artistic effect however you can not often get the thing you like without pay very true but rather trite osborn agree i do not see how it apply well i be really sympathetic about you spoil day but it look as if all you disappointment spring from the same cause ah say osborn sharply i suppose you mean the coal yard ' lease i think i mean bell 's greediness if he do not charge so much for he coal askew would not have cut the peat and the child would not have be send to gather wood then dowthwaite might not have grumble about he wall he feel the farmer have not be treat justly and i imagine he blame you osborn knit he brow then it be a example of the fellow 's wrong-headed attitude he and one or two other be treat better than they deserve and would not be satisfy with anything i do if you have to manage the estate pay extortionate tax and make the unnecessary repair the farmer demand it would be interesting to see the line you would take perhaps the right line be not easy grace admit still if i want a guide there be the motto of we county town : ` be just and fear not ' osborn look at she with indignant surprise and then shrug scornfully thorn smile it be a excellent motto but they choose it some time since one imagine it be out of date now grace color and move away feel embarrassed she have make herself ridiculous and perhaps sentiment such as she have indulge be cheap but it hurt to feel that she so to speak stand alone although she have no doubt be imprudent she have say what she feel and thorn have smile she turn to he angrily when he follow she along the terrace i daresay i be a raw sentimentalist but i be glad i be not up to date she say i hate you modern smartness thorn note the hardness of she voice stop with a apologetic gesture and let she go chapter v railton 's tally winter have begin and although the briar shine red along the hedgerow and the stunt oak have not lose all they leaf bitter sleet blow across the dale when grace go up the muddy lonning to mireside farm railton 's daughter have for a time help the housekeeper at tarnside and grace hearing that the farmer have be ill be go to ask about he it be nearly dark when she enter the big kitchen the lamp have not be light but a peat fire burn in the wide grate where iron for cooking pot hang above the blaze a bright glow leap up and spread about the kitchen touch the people in the room and then fade as she shut the massive door grace think she arrival have embarrass the other because nobody say anything for a moment or two railton sit in a old oak chair by the fire with a stick near he hand tom the shepherd occupy the middle of the floor and kit askew lean against the table at which mr railton and lucy sit grace wish she could see they better but the blaze have sink and the fire burn low give out a aromatic smell and throw dull reflection on the old oak furniture copper kettle and tall brass candlestick as a rule the lonely homestead in the dale be furnish well with object make long since and hand down from father to son then mr railton begin to talk rather nervously and grace turn to the farmer as the light spread about the room again he have a thin line face he shoulder be bent and he pose be slack sickness no doubt account for something but grace imagine he attitude hint at dejection how be you to-day she ask no varra weel i be none so young and the wet and cold dinna agree with my oad bone mayhappen i 'll be better soon but noo when i be need i canna get aboot he 'll not can rest mr railton interpose he be oot in sleet boddering among t ' sheep aw day and weel you ken i have to gin the farmer rejoin mr railton 's silence imply agreement and grace 's curiosity be excite because of something she have hear at home railton 's lease of the sheepwalk run out in a few day but he be by local custom entitle to its renewal after a review of the term moreover it be usual for the tenant to take the sheep with the farm and leave they equal in number and condition when he go the landlord could then demand a valuation and payment of the difference if the flock have fall below the proper standard why be you force to go out in this bitter weather she ask railton hesitate and then see he daughter 's meaning glance lucy be clever and he think she want he to be frank i have to see how sheep be he answer dully not that it be o ' mich use t ' lamb niver get over wet spring and t ' ewe be poor then flock be weel under tally i have lose two score swinset herdwick and the mak-up 's next Thursday but how do you lose forty sheep grace ask there be a hole in fall dyke and swinset sheep be thief sheep varra bad to hoad i bowt ewe there and t ' lamb follow when they wandert back to they heaf grace ponder she have note some reserve in railton 's manner when he mention the broken dyke and know the flockmaster be careful about they dry wall the rest be plain the _ heaf _ be the hill pasture where a lamb be bear and swinset be fifteen mile away it be a very large sheepwalk and much time would be need to find the sheep on the wide belt of moor if you know the sheep be at swinset they would be allow for in the count she say i have my doubt mr haye send I notice tally would be take on Thursday and he be a hard man grace color although she do not like haye he be osborn 's agent there be much she want to know but she could not ask mr haye can not do exactly as he like he must get my father 's consent she say however as i be go home by the field path i have better start before it be dark there be a broken gate that be awkward to open i will come with you until you reach it kit remark they go out together the sleet have stop but leaden cloud roll across the hill that glimmer white in the dusk as they strike across a wet field grace say : i suppose railton 's flock be below the proper standard and the count be short yes the two or three wet year have hit flock-master hard and railton have to sell more stock than be prudent in order to pay he debt then if he can not pay the difference in number and value the lease can be broken kit make a sign of agreement and grace ask : but do you think haye would break the lease and turn he out it be possible kit answer cautiously grace give he a sharp glance what do you really think mr askew i want to know then my notion be haye would like to get mireside for jim richardson richardson be he nephew just so say kit with some dryness all the same he would make a good tenant he father be rich enough to start he well grace 's eye sparkle for she see where the hint lead but she hide she resentment because after all she have doubt osborn need money and haye be cunning i imagine it would hurt railton to leave it would hurt he much he be bear at mireside and he father take the farm from you grandfather a very long time since then he be a old man and have not enough money to begin again at another place ah say grace it would be very hard if he have to go but if he have not money he could not carry on even if we renew the lease we have have remarkably bad weather for two or three year and the cold rain kill the young lamb but a change be due a dry spring and fine summer would put the old man straight grace be silent for a few moment and then look at kit with some color in she face thank you for make the situation plain you be not anxious to do so be you i think you do not trust we i do not trust haye kit say awkwardly but haye be we agent we be accountable for what he do in a way i suppose you be accountable for all that when a landlord have a capable agent it be not the rule for he to meddle i understand mr osborn leave much to haye grace ponder kit 's embarrassment indicate that he be try to save she feeling but he must know as she know that a landlord be rightly judge by he agent 's deed although she rather like kit askew he have humiliate she well she say resolutely something must be do if the strayed sheep could be find it would help yes say kit tom and i start for swinset to-morrow to try to bring they back but if you 'll wait a moment i 'll open the gate he walk through the mud the cattle have churn up and lift the broken gate push it back so that grace could cross a drier spot then as he stand with he hand on the rotten bar she stop do not start for swinset until you hear from I she say thank you good night grace go on and kit turn back to the farm with a satisfaction that make he heart beat in a way the girl have give he she confidence she have at least not hide she feeling she proud calm be only on the surface it cover a generous impulsive nature then she have pluck because he could understand she difficulty she be loyal to she father but hate injustice and be quickly move to sympathy all the same he have note that when she speak of osborn renew the lease she say we and since he know why she have do so it give he cause to think it be the code of the old school the family stand together a compact unit to which she belong and for whose deed she believe herself accountable in a sense this be rather fine but kit know osborn 's pride see it would confine they friendship to narrow limit still he have no ground for imagine she be he friend and he try to fix he thought upon the search for the sheep grace obviously mean to talk to osborn but kit do not believe the latter would be move by she argument when kit return to the farm kitchen railton be sit moodily by the fire and he wife 's face be sternly set they be not a emotional people in the dale and she trouble be too deep for useless tear but as she glance about the room all she see waken poignant memory the old china in the rack have be she mother 's she have bring it and the black oak meal-chest to mireside thirty year since the copper kettle and jelly-pan be wedding present and tom she son who die in australium have send the money to buy the sewing machine now it look as if she household treasure must be sell and to leave mireside would mean the tear up of root that have strike deep besides while she would suffer it would hurt she husband worse when kit come in she give he a keen glance weel what have miss osborn to say she do not say much i think she mean to talk to osborn railton look up gloomily t ' lass have a good heart but talk to osborn will be o ' nea use haye be real master and he want mireside for jim richardson kit make a sign of agreement the fellow 's get dangerous and must be stop i suspect he be back bell and now he mean to use he nephew it be not altogether for richardson 's sake he want to break you lease some day i imagine osborn will find he agent own the estate but that be not we business well peter tell I to remind you that you and he be old friend and if a hundred pound would be some help -- it would be a big help say railton and kit turn to the shepherd when mr railton awkwardly begin to thank he about the broken dyke tom what d'you think bring it down i canna tell dyke 's good and there be nea wind they be all silent for a few moment and then kit say well richardson be a cunning hound he pause and pick up he hat before he turn to railton i have a job at ashness that must be finish to-night there be not much time but if it be possible tom and i will find the sheep in the meantime grace walk home think hard kit be railton 's friend but he have use some tact until she force he to tell she the truth this however be not important because she have get a jar it look as if osborn have consent to a cruel plot a landlord ought to help he tenant and not take advantage of they need she try not to blame he he have a bad agent who use a dangerous influence she must try to protect he from the fellow and in a way from he own carelessness after all it be for the most part carelessness because he do not know haye as she know he still she have not undertake a easy thing and she brace herself as she go up the step of the new terrace grace hate the terrace it be the price they the osborn have take for a shabby deed and for which poor people and hard-worked woman pay grace know about the extra dust that peat fire cause and how often the bread be spoil when she enter the library osborn be study some document he look up impatiently and she say i be at mireside railton 's no better and be much disturbed about he lease not more disturbed than he deserve osborn rejoin the fellow have be get slack for some time he sell he store sheep imprudently and let the flock run down he have be ill and the weather have be bad for some year exactly a cautious man provide for bad year he know they will come grace be surprise she father do not see that he statement have a humorous touch since improvident extravagance be he rule but it be obvious that he do not one can not save much money when rent be high and price be low do you know much about these matter osborn ask i have hear the farmer talk sometimes i ask they question osborn frown you talk too much to the farmer i do not like it you know this well say grace i think you ought not to break railton 's lease why grace hesitate she begin to see that osborn could not be move but she have undertake to plead railton 's cause he be a old man and have be at mireside all he life he have work hard and always pay he rent now he be ill and in trouble it would be shabby to turn he out because there be a risk -- it be only a risk -- that we might lose something by let he stay you do not seem to understand a landlord 's duty osborn rejoin he be so to speak the steward in charge of the estate it belong to the family and be not he he must hand it on in good order and this mean he can not indulge he sentimental impulse if he keep a bad tenant from pity or because he be afraid to seem harsh he rob he heir grace know there be other and perhaps worse way of rob one 's heir but she say be not you take haye 's view that railton be a bad tenant after all we be responsible then you suggest that haye be mistaken osborn ask ironically i do not know if he be mistaken or not say grace with a steady look i know he be greedy and unjust but there be a thing you ought not to let he do railton have lose forty sheep that have stray back to swinset and haye do not mean to count they in the tally osborn 's face get red and he knit he brow i have try to be patient but this be too much do you know more about manage a estate than a clever agent or do you think i be a fool and haye lead I like a child anyhow you be much too young to criticize my action let we have no more of it a unmarried girl be not entitle to opinion that clash with she parent ' grace go out silently to know that she have fail hurt she pride and it hurt worse to suspect that she father have get angry because he know she be right besides she feel strangely alone as she have often feel since she come home gerald be careless and think about nothing but he extravagant amusement she mother 's main object be to avoid jar and smooth over awkward situation then she have household care money be scarce and since osborn hate self-denial she must economize grace could not tell she she trouble but there be a way by which railton might save he lease and kit could help get a pencil and paper she write he a very short note : you must find railton 's sheep then know that she be rash she go to look for the gardener 's boy and send he to ashness chapter vi bleatarn ghyll it be get dark when kit and tom the shepherd stop to rest behind a cairn on the summit of swinset moor close by the two score sheep stand in a compact flock with head towards the panting dog they be herdwick a small hardy breed that best withstand the rain and snow that sweep the high fell in the lambing season when he have light he pipe kit thoughtfully look about on one side the barren moor get dim in the distance roll back to the edge of the low country here and there patch of melting sleet gleam a livid white among the withered ling and storm-torn hummock of peaty soil shone dark chocolate-brown these be the only touch of color in the dreary landscape except for the streak of pale-yellow sky that glimmer above a long black ridge on the other side a line of rugged fell with summit lose in snow cloud rise dark and forbid it be very cold and a bite wind sweep the heath kit be tire for he have be on the moor since morning and have not eat much it be a awkward matter to find the sheep and then the man and dog have some difficulty to keep the ewe move because the herdwick never willingly leave the neighborhood where it be bear and will if possible return the lamb now grow large and fat give less trouble and when they sometimes stop irresolutely while the ewe try to break away kit understand they hesitation two instinct be at work : it be natural to follow they dam but mireside be they native heath and they know they be go to be take home now they have go some distance kit have to make a choice one could reach mireside by a rough moor-land road but it go round the hill and there be a shorter way across the range if he go round he might arrive late for the reckoning and some of the lamb would get footsore and stop on the other hand he know the fell and shrink from try to find he way among the crag in the dark it be however important that he should not be late haye be hard and the herdwick must arrive in time to be tally with the rest of railton 's flock in the dale a tenant have a traditional right to have he sheep value by a jury of he neighbor and haye have fix the time at eight o'clock next day the animal however must be sort and pen before this and the work would begin early in the morning we have better try the fell tom say kit the shepherd look at the threatening sky and fading line of rugged height aw yes it be gan t ' be a rough neet but we 'll try ' t we can rest a bit at oad mine-house this side bleatarn ghyll now they route be fix kit muse about something else railton be he neighbor but except for this kit have no particular grounds for help he he have obviously nothing to gain then the peat-cutting be he plan he have without altogether mean to do so allow himself to become the leader of the revolt against osborn in a way of course he be the proper man because ashness belong to he father and haye could not punish he for meddle still haye could punish the tenant farmer and kit know they run some risk on the whole he think the risk worth while he have a talent that be begin to develop for lead and see when one could negotiate and when one must fight he do not want to fight osborn but be be force into the conflict and it be comforting to feel that miss osborn be not against he she note tell he he must find the sheep be in he pocket and he think it have cost she something to write she be generous and plucky and he must not hesitate after all the job be he and since he have accept it he must if needful bear the consequence knock out he pipe he get up we 'll make a start tom he say the shepherd shout to the dog the flock break up and trail out across the heath the ewe move slowly turn now and then and kit think it ominous that they meet other flock come down the herdwick know the weather and be head for the sheltered dale for all that he push on with a bitter wind in he face and by and by cold rain begin to fall it change to sleet and the night have get very dark when they cross the shoulder of a stony fall one could not see fifty yard but the steepness of the slope and the click of little hoof on the wet rock tell kit where they be two hour afterwards he stop for breath at the bottom of a narrow valley the sleet have turn to drive snow the wind howl in the rock above and a swollen beck brawl angrily among the stone tom be hardly distinguishable a few yard ahead and kit could not see the sheep but the bark of the dog come faintly down the steep white slope the herdwick be string out along the hillside with a dog below and above and it be comforting to know they could not leave the valley which be shut in by rugged crag for a time drive they would be easy but it would be different when they leave the water and climb the rise to bleatarn ghyll how far be we off the mine-house tom he shout i dinna ken say the shepherd mayhappen two mile ewe be travel better t ` lamb be lead they kit agree and they push on through the snow after a time the ground get steeper and when they cross the noisy beck and scramble up a shaly bank kit be glad to see a broken wall loom among the toss flake this be the shaft-house of a abandon mine and there be a sheep-fold build with pulled-down material close by he shout and wait until he hear the dog bark and a rattle of stone the herdwick be come down and presently break out from the snow in a compact struggle flock tom shout and throw a hurdle across the entrance when the dog have drive the sheep into the fold i dinna ken if snow 'll tak ' off or not but it be early yet and we must have a rest before we try ghyll he say they go into the shaft-house and kit strike a match one end of the building have be pull down and the snow blow in through hole in the roof but a pile of dry fern fill a corner and rotten beam lay about with some trouble they light a fire and sit down close by take out the food they have bring the wind scream about the ruin wall the smoke eddy round they and now and then a shower of snow fall on they head but they have some shelter and could if force wait for morning miss osborn 's a bonny lass and kind but i reckon she could not talk she father round tom presently remark no say kit i believe she try favor she mother tom resume mr osborn 's heart be good but at tarnside woman dinna count it be a kind o ' pity because t ' osborn menfolk be laker and always be a _ laker _ be a lounge pleasure-seeker and kit admit that the remark be justified i sometimes think osborn mean well he say mayhappen for aw he order folk aboot he be wake like he father i mind he weel might mak ' a fair landlord if he be letten and have t ' money but oad haye be grasp and always at he tail the rent-roll 's good the estate could be manage well there be t ' mortgage and osborn canna keep money when he have it he must spend there would be nea poor landlord 's if i have my way i would let they putten rent up if they have money and spend it on the land low rent mean poor farm kit know this be true on the tarnside estate dyke that have keep the flood off the meadow be fall down drain be choke and land that have grow good crop be go sour the wise use of capital would make a wholesome change but kit do not altogether like centralize control although it be economical the landlord get the main advantage and there be much a farmer could do in cooperation with he neighbor to help himself if he lease be long enough then joint action be once common in the dale man pool they labor and implement at hay time and harvest and combine for they mutual benefit in other way now it look as if they might combine again be they grumble much at allerby about burn peat he ask t ' woman grumble tom say dryly but they willunt stop for aw the dirt peat mak a ' they canna get oven hot i reckon bell have mair coal come in than he can get shut of when i be at station last t ' yard be nearly full i rather think bell have be too greedy he must pay for the coal as it arrive and he money be probably get short the traction engine and trailer cost a good sum and he have spend something on the lime-kiln in fact if we hold on he be bind to give way then we 'll brek he we folk be slow to fratch but they be not quick at let go say tom who pause and add : i wunner where bell get he money he have none when he take a job at mill in oad osborn 's time this start kit on another line of thought bell have no doubt save something for he be parsimonious and be too keen a business man to leave he money in the bank all he make by one speculation be sink in another but after allow for this it be hard to see where he get the capital for he numerous venture kit wonder whether haye help if he do it be not from friendship the agent be clever and might be play a cunning game in which he use both osborn and bell in fact kit think if he be osborn he would watch haye this however be not he business and get up he go to a hole in the wall it be snow very hard he could see nothing but a haze of toss flake and the wind fill the valley with its roar he could hardly hear the beck a few yard off the drift will be get deep but we can not start yet he say if we miss the track at the top there be nothing to stop we fall over the ling crag tom agree and kit shiver when he sit down again he be cold and tired and the worst part of the journey must yet be make look at he watch he resign himself to wait and lean back with eye close against the wall while a wet dog crouch at he foot a hour or two pass and then tom get up snow 's takin ' off he say we must try it kit pull himself together go out and face the storm the snow be thinner but the wind have not drop and buffet he savagely as he struggle through a drift to the fold the dog have some trouble to drive out the sheep and when they straggle through the opening kit imagine the lamb go in front in a few moment the flock vanish and he breathe hard as he follow they track up hill now and then the dog bark but for the most part he hear nothing except the roar of the wind in the crag he hope the dog could find the path across the narrow tableland between two branch ghyll because it be obvious that he judgment might be at fault however there be the lamb one could trust a herdwick to return to its heaf when he reach the top the wind have blow away the snow and he stand near the middle of a narrow belt of heath with he foot sink in a bog on each side he get a glimpse of dark rock streak with white where the wind have pack the snow into the gully in front there be a gulf down which he path lead scatter snowflake and roll mist stream up from the forbid hollow at first he could see nothing of the sheep but as he flounder across the bog the dog bark and he find they presently guard the flock in a hollow among the crag the sheep break away and kit push on across the narrow belt of bog that be dot by the mark of little foot sometimes he slacken he pace to wait for tom the shepherd be get old and the long climb have tire he both stop for some moment when they reach the brow of the descent and kit brace himself against the storm try to look about he think he see the flock close in front they seem doubtful where to go he say we can do nowt but leave they to find t ' ghyll the shepherd remark kit agree bleatarn ghyll be beneath he but there be another hollow and it be hard to walk straight down hill in the dark he must trust the sheep and huddle close together they refuse to leave the crag when the dog drive they out they vanish and since the ground be bare of snow they leave no track he stumble on fall into pool and stumble across bank of stone and soon stop again he have come down the slope so to speak blindly and now stand on the edge of a vast dark pit one could not see beyond the edge but the confused noise that come up hint at profound depth the gale shriek but he hear the roar of fall water and the rattle of stone the wind dislodge do you think this be beatarn ghyll he ask i dinna ken tom answer and add hopefully if it be t ` ither we 'll mayhappen find oot before we step over ling crag they go down at a venture whistle vainly for the dog the drop be very sharp and now they be leave the wind-swept pass the snow have begin to pack among the stone and boggy grass still so far as they could see there be no mark of little foot and they wonder what have happen to the flock until a faint bark come out of the mist the noise get louder and kit know the dog be run round the stop sheep we be right he say they have go through the broken wall and the dog be hold they at the top of the force a few minute afterwards he scramble over a pile of fall stone shout to tom and begin to run for he understand what have happen the broken wall mark the boundary of the mireside heaf and the sheep be now on familiar ground it be he business to drive they to the farm but they be try to turn off to look for shelter among the crag at the force where the bleatarn beck leap in link fall to the valley one could get down between the water and the rock on the other side a path about a foot wide lead across the face of a precipice in daylight if the stone be dry a man with steady nerve could use the path but when slab and scree be pack with snow nothing but a herdwick could cross it safely the dog know this and be try to hold the flock when the man come up they see a indistinct woolly mass on the other side of the beck the mass be not level but slant sharply and the sheep at the bottom send down shower of stone as they surge to and fro with head turn to the dog it be obvious that they do not mean to go down the ghyll and herdwick bear among the crag can climb where no dog can follow the dog canna turn they gasp tom they 'll be away ower eel scar they be brekkin ' noo the flock begin to open out and three or four sheep straggle forward but kit 's bob-tailed dog slide down a snowy slab and fall upon the first the sheep run back but the other stand and kit see the dog could not stop they long the herdwick know the advantage be theirs on ground like this jump from a boulder he fall into the swollen beck and make he way up the nearly perpendicular slab at the top he find a dangerous ledge and advance upon the sheep which have they back to the stream twine he finger in a lamb 's wool he pick up the animal and balance himself precariously throw it as far as he could it fall into the beck and scramble out on the other side where the track lead down the ghyll the effort have cost he much for he heart beat and he gasp for breath but he doubt if he have do enough drag another lamb from the flock he hurl it into the water and then he foot slip and he roll down the slab and fall in the snow he get up badly shake and see that he plan have work sheep will follow a leader and the flock be straggle down the ghyll behind the lamb kit recross the beck and descend cautiously keep close to the rock the ghyll be a rough climb in daylight and summer tourist try to cross the fell often turn back at the bottom there be no path and one scramble over large sharp stone some of which be loose and fall at a touch in place bank of treacherous gravel drop to the beck which plunge over ledge into deep spray-veiled pool now the stone be slippery with snow the wind rage and mist and toss flake hide the ground a few yard ahead somehow he get down but he be exhaust and breathless when he reach the bottom where he be force to wait before he could whistle to he dog he hear its bark and stumble forward find the flock bunch together in a hollow then he sit down in the snow while tom count the sheep they be aw here say the shepherd a better job than i thowt we would mak weel let 's gan on kit be tired and bruise by he fall but he go forward behind the dog he trouble be over for a broad smooth path lead along the hill-foot to mireside chapter vii the reckon the morning be dark and although the gale have drop a raw cold wind blow up the valley past mireside farm where three or four farmer ' trap and some rusty bicycle stand beneath the project roof of a barn the bleating of sheep rise from a boggy pasture by the beck and light twinkle as man with lantern move about in the gloom now and then somebody shout and dog bark as a flock of herdwick be drive to the pen in the flag kitchen mr railton and lucy bustle about by the light of a lamp and the glow of the fire the table be cover with use plate and cup the man outside have breakfast but one or two more might come and mr railton wonder when kit would arrive she have lie awake for the most part of the night think about he and the stray herdwick while she listen to the gale now and then lucy go to the door and look up the dale to the glimmering line of foam that mark the spot where bleatarn beck come down a path follow the water-side but she could not see man or sheep in the gloom and if kit do not come soon he would be too late railton sit gloomily by the fire he have have rheumatic fever and the damp cold rack he ache joint besides there be nothing for he to do he have call in he neighbor to value he flock but he know to a few pound what they judgment would be haye would presently arrive and railton would be ask to pay or give security for the shortage which be impossible haye know this and mean to break he lease perhaps the hardest thing be that the shortage be small if the next lambing season be good he could pay but haye would not wait although railton be too proud to beg for help from he neighbor he have go to the bank osborn however use the same bank and it look as if haye have give the manager a hint because he refuse a loan askew have offer a hundred pound but this be not enough and even if kit arrive with the sheep from swinset railton could not find the rest of the money however the arrival of the herdwick would make a difference and he do not altogether give up hope by and by he try to get up and sit down again with a groan beckon he wife martha you might gin to door mr railton know what he mean go to the porch it be lighter outside and the hillside be grow distinct she think something move on the path beside the beck and turn to she daughter who have follow what be yon by the water lucy lucy be silent for a few moment and then say quietly i think it be sheep she watch the path the mist make a puzzling background and she eye be get dazzled but there be something then she hear a chair jar on the flag and glance at railton who lean forward weel he say canna you speak be neabody come yet lucy throw another glance up the dale and she heart beat a indistinct row of small dark object move along the path with two tall figure behind kit 's come down the beck he be bring the herdwick she cry canny lad say railton and lean back limply wipe he face he forehead be wet with sweat for he be weak and the suspense have be keen the sheep vanish behind a wall and lucy begin to put fresh food on the table mr railton hang a kettle on a hook above the fire and then turn with a start as a girl come into the porch miss osborn she exclaim grace advance calmly although there be some color in she face because she know the other be surprise that she have come be mr haye here she ask mayhappen he be at the pen lucy reply i think i hear he car then i miss he at the cross-road say grace i be go to allerby and my father ask I to give he a note when he stop at lawson 's she hesitate and then resume impulsively : perhaps i ought not to have come on but i want to do so they know what she mean but nobody answer and grace sit down on a bench by the table will you give the note to mr haye have kit askew bring the swinset sheep he be come now say lucy pick up the note and grace 's eye sparkle i know he would bring they i tell he he must lucy go out and grace ask railton about he pain while they talk somebody shout outside and the old man get up with a effort hobble to the door hoad on dinna close t ' pen a man call here 's kit and t ' lot fra swinset three of four more shout and grace who have follow railton think there be a note of triumph in they cry then dog begin to bark somebody open a gate and a flock of herdwick leap out with wet fleece shake and hoof click on stone run across a shallow pool where the beck have overflow a few minute afterwards kit come in he look tired he face be rather haggard and he clothes be wet tom the shepherd follow and sit down by the fire it be nea a easy job but we manish it he say swinset sheep be thief sheep but they be none a match for kit 's oad dog kit stop abruptly as he cross the floor and he heart beat ah he say miss osborn grace smile as she get up and give he she hand well do have you bring they all but of course you have they be in the pen kit answer with some embarrassment then railton stand up lean awkwardly on he stick i have misdoubt you new-fashioned plan and ken that i be wrang there be nea ither lad in aw t ' dale could ha ' browt herdwick doon bleatarn ghyll last neet weel t ' oad way for t ' oad man but i ` se niver deny again that the young and new be good he sit down and while mr railton begin to bustle about the table grace steal away she know she ought not to have come and have do so with a feeling of rebellion against she father 's harshness although she try to persuade herself that haye be most to blame now she be glad the note make a pretext for the visit she have show the railton she sympathy and have thank kit after all he have perhaps go to look for the sheep because she tell he she rather hope he have and rejoice with the other at he success grace admit that she like kit askew he be resolute but modest and have just do a bold deed by which he have nothing to gain railton 's praise have move she because she know the dalesfolk 's reserve and that the farmer would not without good grounds have speak as he do moreover she know the fell and it be something of a exploit to bring the sheep from swinset in the storm kit be of course a farmer 's son but he be plucky and generous besides she approve he steady look well-balanced muscular figure and clean brown skin then she blush and begin to wonder what she would say about she visit to mireside when she go home in the meantime kit eat he breakfast and soon afterwards peter askew come in and begin to talk to railton until the valuation be agree upon there be nothing for they to do and it be some time before the man return from the pen they be plain farmer with rather hard brown face and stand about the fire in half-embarrassed silence while haye sit down at the table and open he pocket-book we have make up the tally he begin and railton interrupted counting in the lamb and ewe fra swinset they be count haye reply i 'll give you particulars of the different lot he read out some figure and then turn to the group by the fire i think we be all agree aw yi say one it be as near as yan can mak ' it withoot send flock to auction haye turn to railton be you satisfy we willunt fratch mayhappen two or three lot would fetch anither pound or two but we 'll can ' it fair then we must thank these gentleman say haye who shut he pocket-book and take out a document as there be some other business and they have give we some time we need not keep they the man look at one another and peter askew say if railton do not mind we would sooner stop stop if you like railton agree you have get I a just reckoning and you be neebor aw it be not necessary haye object the business we have to transact be private they ken it railton reply in a stubborn voice i have bid they stop and the hoose be mine until mr osborn turn I oot very well you know the sum due to the landlord be you ready to pay i canna pay it be weel you ken then can you give security for the debt i canna and wad not give it if i could there be way a cliver agent can run up a reckoning and when you want mireside i 'll have to gin then i be afraid we shall be force to break the lease and take measure to recover the sum due hoad on a minute say one of the group who turn to railton would you like to stop i would like i have live at mireside sin ' i be bear there be another thing : it be none too good a time for a sale o ' farm stock and when i have pay osborn i 'll need some money to mak ' anither start then may-happen a dry spring wold put I straight it ought to you be not much behind peter agree weel you ken i be generally willing to back my judgment and noo it seem there be other think like I in a sense the lease do not run out yet kit interpose it have rather reach the half-term because by we custom railton be entitle to take it up again for a equal period if he and the landlord agree about the necessary adjustment we lease really cover a double term haye turn to he with a ironical smile do you know much about tenant law he ask no say kit rather dryly i make some study when i could get the book but they do not take I far in fact i imagine that in this neighborhood there be very little law and much precedent which have generally be interpret for the landlord 's advantage there be old barony law and manor rights and my notion be that nobody know exactly how he stand but we 'll let this go if railton pay he fine you will have some trouble to get rid of he haye agree and railton look up with a puzzle air but i canna pay he say dully the farmer who have interrupted haye take out a bulky envelope and cross the floor well he say i think you be wrang you friend have be talk aboot the thing and wad not like t ' see you gin he give railton the envelope add : it be a loan railton 's hand shake as he take out a bundle of bank-note you be good neebor he say in a strained voice but i dinna think i ought to tak ' you money there be a risk not much risk in back a honest man the other rejoin and take the note from railton give they to haye noo if you 'll count these -- haye ' face be inscrutable as he flick over the note the total 's correct it be a awkward bundle a check would have be simpler a check have the drawback that it must be sign kit remark with a meaning smile we be modest folk and nobody be anxious to write himself down the leader i see say haye i do not know if you be modest but you be certainly cautious anyhow we be aw in this say one of the other so it seem i hope you will not lose you money haye rejoin dryly and take out a fountain pen well here 's you receipt mr railton i do not think there be anything more to be say he put the receipt on the table and when he go away a farmer laugh o'ad haye be quiet and cunning as a hill fox but my lease have some time to go and he canna put we aw oot railton try to thank they while mr railton smile with tear in she eye but the dale folk dislike emotion and as soon as it be possible the visitor go away a hour or two afterwards grace hear about the matter from the sick wife of a farmer whom she have go to see and when she go home think she have better not confess that she have take haye ' note to mireside when osborn join he wife and daughter at the tea-table in the hall after some disappointing shoot he remark about he tenant be rancorous grace think it prudent not to talk and leave the table as soon as she could when she have go osborn frowned and get up savagely kick a log in the grate i get a nasty knock this morning he say it be not so much that i mind let railton stop i hate to feel i have be baffle and make the victim of a plot after all be not it rather haye 's idea than yours that railton ought to go mr osborn venture it be there be some comfort in that you do not like haye much i do not know that i dislike he i be not sure i trust he well say osborn thoughtfully i sometimes feel he be keenest about my interest when they do not clash with he and this last affair be a pretty good example of nepotism for all that he nephew would have be a better tenant and have pay a higher rent he pause and knit he brow angrily as he resume : however it be do with and one can not blame railton for hold on to he lease what i hate to feel be the other plot to baffle I the land be mine but i would sooner get on well with my tenant one can not so to speak have it both way mr osborn remark timidly oh i know what you mean but i do not think i be a harsh landlord if money be not quite so scarce i might be generous in fact i do not know that i would have agree to turn railton out if it have not be for gerald 's confounded debt and he allowance at woolwich that be a fresh expense mr osborn think the expense do not count for much by comparison with she husband 's extravagance but he have be rather patient and she must not go too far well she say you have get railton 's fine it be not a large sum osborn answer with a frown i need the money but in a sense i would sooner it have not be pay anyhow i would sooner it have not be pay like that the other ' confound organize opposition annoy I they be force to subscribe to a fund if they want to help just so but they probably would not have think about subscribe if askew have not suggest it they be a independent lot and believe in standing on they own foot for a time after i get tarnside they use a sensible give-and-take attitude it be only recently they have meet with stupid sullen suspicion perhaps it be rather a mistake to give bell the coal yard ' lease the coal yard have nothing to do with it osborn declare the trouble begin earlier and i have grounds for believe it begin at ashness if i be rich enough i would buy the askew out they know i have no power over they and take advantage of the situation the old man be a bad example for the other but he son with he raw communistic notion be dangerous if i could get rid of the meddling fool somehow it would be a keen relief he come back to the table and pick up a cup of tea then grumble that it have go cold he put it down noisily and go out chapter viii grace find a way soon after the reckoning at mireside the snow melt off the fell and for a month dark rain cloud from the sea roll up the dale they break upon the hill top in heavy shower gray mist drift about the wet slope the beck roar in the ghyll and thread of foam that waver in the wind streak the crag in the bottom of the valley it be never really light water flow across the road and the low-standing farmstead reek with damp all this be not unusual and the dalesfolk would have bear it patiently have fuel not be short large fire be need to dry the moisture that condensed in the flag kitchen and soak the thick wall but coal could not be get at a price the house-wife be willing to pay some would have have to stint they family in food have they buy on bell 's term and the rest struggle for the common cause against the mould that gather on clothing and spoil the meal they grumble but they resolution harden as the strain get worse while bell wait rather anxiously for they to give way he yard be full and more coal be come in but he see that if he let the farmer beat he he power to overcharge they another time would be go the new combine be dangerous since the cooperative plan might be extend to the purchase of chemical manure seed and lime in the meantime there be plenty of peat stack so that it would escape much damage on malton head but askew and he friend could not get it down cart could not be use on the fell and the clumsy wooden sledge the farmer call stone-boat would not run across the boggy moor the few load kit bring down at the cost of heavy labor be carry off by anxious house-wife as soon as they arrive the weather be help the monopolist but he could not tell if a change to frost would be a advantage or not although it would make the need for coal feel keenly it might simplify the transport of peat when bell think about it and the colliery company 's bill come in he feel disturbed but he be stubborn and would not lower he price yet at length the rain stop and after a heavy fall of snow keen frost begin the white fell glitter in cold sunshine that only touch the bottom of the dale for a hour or two the ice on the tarn be cover so that skating be impossible and thorn feeling the need for amusement have a few sledge make he have learn something about winter sport in switzerland and one afternoon stand with a party of young man and woman at the top of malton head they have practice with a pair of ski farther down the hill where one or two be slide on a small swiss luge but thorn want to find a long run for he canadian-pattern toboggan grace stand near he she face touch with warm color and she eye sparkling as she look about she do not altogether approve of alan thorn but she be young and vigorous and enjoy the sport besides she love the high fell and now they look majestic in the pale sunshine they be not all white dark rock with glitter vein edge the snowfield and the scar face of force crag run down where the shoulder of the moor break off four hundred foot below where the sun do not strike the snow be a curious delicate gray and the bottom of the dale be color a ethereal blue the pale-gray riband wind in a graceful curve round the crag mark the old green road that be sometimes use for bring down dry fern and grace 's face get thoughtful as she note a row of man and horse some distance off she imagine they be askew and he helper in the meantime thorn study she with artistic satisfaction he have a eye for female beauty and the girl look very well in she rather shabby fur she pose be light and graceful she figure finely model and he like the glow the cold have bring to she skin moreover he like she joyous confidence when they try the luge on a risky slide she be as steady-nerved and plucky as a man and be mark by a fine fastidiousness that do not characterize other girl he know i think this be about the best spot we have see he say the drop be steep but regular although i expect we 'll be breathless when we get to the bottom would you like to try if not perhaps somebody else will come he look at the other and they look at the white declivity it be much longer than any they have go down and a girl laugh to begin with we 'll watch you i be upset on the last slide and it be rather a long way to roll down to the dale grace lay down on a cushion with she head just behind the toboggan 's curved front thorn find room farther back with he leg in the snow and amidst some laughter and joke the other push they off the surface be hard and for a time the toboggan run smoothly and steadily then the pace get faster and shower of snow fly up like spray it beat into grace 's eye and whip she face until she bent she head in the shelter of the curl front the sharp hiss the steel runner make be louder the wind begin to scream and she get something of a shock when she cautiously look up it be hard to see through the snowy spray but the top of the crag look ominously near glance down hill with smart eye she think the slope which from the top have seem to fall evenly to the dale be also inclined towards the crag she could not see much of the latter but there be a fringe of dark rock where the white declivity break off be not we get too near she shout nearer than i think thorn gasp not sure i can swing the sledge can you get back and help grace brace herself alan 's nerve be good but there be a disturbed note in he voice besides he would not have ask she help unless it be need wriggle back cautiously she get level with thorn although there be not much room for they side by side she foot and the seam of she short dress brush in the snow and tear up the surface she feel the looser stuff beneath foam about she gaiter but this be a advantage the drag would help to stop the sledge and if she could put a extra pressure on one side to some extent direct it still they be go very fast and at first she be nearly pull off she tighten she grasp with she hand until she feel she glove split and then risk another glance ahead the rock be very close but the sledge have pass the top and she could see a few yard down the dark side as they follow the curving edge of the crag the sledge be now run nearly straight down the hill but the curve bent in towards they and she could not tell if they would shoot past the widest spot or plunge over perhaps you have better let go thorn say hoarsely grace shake she head if she drop off it be uncertain whether she would stop until she have roll some distance perhaps she might not stop before she reach the edge of the crag anyhow she do not mean to let go and try to catch the snow with she toe in a effort to help thorn to steer the sledge it swerve a little but rush on again and she see that the edge of the rock curve in yet she doubt if they be far enough off to get past the bend then she see that thorn have slip farther back in order to increase the drag of he leg he face be dark with blood and she hear he heavy breathing as he try to change they course she help all she could while the snow roll across she dress and then for a moment lift she head powdered snow beat into she face and nearly blind she but she think there be now a unbroken slant in front they must have pass the middle of the bend although thorn be between she and the side on which it lay and she be not sure yet she remember with horrible distinctness how she have once stand at the bottom of the crag and see a stone that roll over the top smash upon the rock try again thorn gasp swing she to the right grace let she body slip back the thrust and drag be tell for the sledge have swerve and then there come a few seconds of keen suspense after this she hear thorn draw a labored breath and feel he hand on she waist we be past hitch yourself up before you be pull off he say with some trouble grace get back to she place and lay still while she heart thump painfully and something ring in she ear the reaction have begin and she know she could not move if thorn want help again it look however as if he do not and some moment afterwards she see that the way be clear ahead she wonder whether they would stop before they reach the bottom of the dale and how far it be the round sheepfold in the first field look no larger than a finger ring she be get numb and the rush of bitter air take away she breath hold tight thorn shout presently and she note that the hillside break off not far in front since there be no crag near the spot it be obvious that they have come to a extra steep pitch the brow of which prevent she from see the bottom next moment the sledge seem to leave the ground and leap forward grace think that for some yard they travel through the air and then the hiss of the runner that have suddenly stop become a scream the speed be bewildering and a haze of fine snow stream past by and by however this begin to thin the speed slacken and thorn give a warn shout she feel he try to turn the sledge but they be go too fast the light frame cant and turn over and they roll off into the snow when grace get up and shake herself fifty yard lower down she see thorn standing by the right sledge he come to meet she as she toil back and he eye sparkle by george he say you be fine you be a thorough sport grace color the compliment be obviously frank and not premeditated perhaps she deserve it but she do not want thorn to praise she he manners be good but somehow he often jar he have not within she memory say anything that could justly offend she and although he be a neighbor and there be no secret in the dale she have not know he do a shabby thing yet on the whole he rather repel than attract she she study he as he come down the hill he be a big handsome man and it be of course ridiculous to dislike he because he be older than she and be get fat he be a amusing talker and a good sportsman but now and then one get a hint of hardness and cunning somehow so to speak he do not ring true i hold on because i think i might fall over the crag if i let go she say with a laugh then as i do hold on it be merely prudent to try to steer the sledge oh yes thorn agreed but the important thing be you see this and do not lose you nerve anyhow if you have lose it i could not have blame you i blame myself for my confound thoughtlessness that let you run the risk in fact i be dreadfully sorry and do not mind own that i get a fright grace note that he be rather shake and feel vaguely disturbed she have see he follow the foxhound among the crag for they hunt on foot in the rugged dale and know he steadiness and pluck he have not be afraid for himself and she do not want he to be afraid for she after all she say the hill seem to run down evenly when we stand at the top if the little slant towards the crag deceive you it deceive I i know more about toboggan and ought not to have be deceive it hurt to feel i do not take proper care of you it really do not matter grace reply with a smile and thorn give she a steady look oh but it do matter you ought to see that i do not see it grace insist quietly although she heart beat you be not accountable and we get down quite safe let 's talk about something else thorn 's eye rest on she for another moment and then he make a sign of acquiescence and they go back up the hill at the top he mark a new line for the next day 's sport and then as the sun be get low the party start home by the old stone-boat road near the bottom they overtake the askew and one or two other walk at they horse ' head as they cautiously descend a steep pitch grace note that although they be not bring much peat there be a risk of the sledge run down upon the team you have not get on very fast she say to peter if we be no verra careful we 'll gin faster than we like i suppose that be why you be only take half a load just that peter agree it wad not suit for load to run ower the team better safe than sorry though it be a terrible loss o ' time then why do not you look for a easier way down there be only the oad green road fellside 's ower steep for horse well if i can think of a better way i 'll tell you grace reply smile and hurry on after the other they leave she at the tarnside gate and she stop abruptly as she go up the drive it have obviously take askew a long time to bring down half a load because of the risk to he horse but she have find a better plan it be not needful to use horse after they have pull the sledge up the latter could be heavily loaded and leave to run down alone she must tell kit askew when she see he next but she do not reflect that it be curious she mean to tell kit and not peter chapter ix the plan work although the air be bracingly keen the afternoon be calm and the scatter cloud scarcely move across the sky the snow in the valley shine a delicate gray and soft light and shadow rest on the hill a peak that rise above the edge of the lofty moor gleam pale-yellow against a background of deep blue grace note the tranquil beauty of the landscape but hesitate now and then as she climb the steep road out of the dale she have come to meet kit askew and now she review she reason for do so they do not look very sound in fact if kit approve the plan she mean to suggest she would perhaps be meddle unjustifiably with she father 's business after all however it be really not he business he have allow himself to be persuade to help haye and the latter 's accomplice bell without quite understand what this imply she plan would prevent he do a injustice he do not really mean to do she suspect that there be a touch of sophistry about she argument but would not own that she have come because she want to meet kit it be necessary that she should meet he yet when she stop at a gate and hear the tramp of horse ' foot behind she color come and go for all that she look very calm when kit pull up he team and go forward to open the gate he make a abrupt movement as he recognize she but he eye shine with satisfaction i suppose you be go for some peat she say kit say he be and add that peter and two or three neighbor be load the stone-boat on the moor then i wonder whether you could let I have a small quantity when you come down you can have a load if you want grace laugh two or three basketsful would be enough and i do not want they for myself i go to see mr waite and find she old father cripple by rheumatism the kitchen be cold and damp but she have a very little fire she say she coal be nearly go and she have get no peat thank you for tell I i do not know say kit i 'll take she a sack as i go down the dale he pause and hesitate with he hand on the open gate but it be rather cold be i keep you grace note with some satisfaction that he do not seem to think it remarkable she have meet he at the lonely spot oh no she say i be go up the hill i like the view from the crag and sometimes go to watch the sunset when it shine over the shoulder of the pike it throw wonderful light on the snow kit agree and after he start he horse they go on together by and by grace resume : when i meet you yesterday you father say the sledge often run down too fast and you could not put up a proper load that be a drawback you see there be plenty peat cut the trouble be to bring it down after the heavy rain we could not drag the stone-boat across the boggy moor and although the snow have make this easy it have not help much otherwise if we put up a big load there be some danger of the sledge overtake and knock down the horse where the track be steep and you can not see a way of get over the difficulty kit say he could not and grace 's eye twinkle then i can i 'll show you a way if you be not too proud to take advice from a girl certainly not kit say smile i do not know why you think i be proud then perhaps you be obstinate some of the dalesfolk be we be slow we like to try thing properly and then perhaps we stick to they longer than be needful if we find they good but caution 's prudent you be very cautious now grace rejoin you do not seem curious about my plan be you afraid it be not practical no say kit rather earnestly since it be yours it be no doubt good then he pull himself up and add with a twinkle : but i have not hear it yet well while you difficulty be that the peat come down too fast i think it do not go fast enough you be afraid about you horse but you need not use they the stone-boat would run down alone do you understand now kit start i expect you have find the way miss osborn and we owe you some thanks in fact you be cleverer than the lot the admission do not seem to hurt you grace rejoin but i imagine to feel you have to make it be something of a shock no say kit with a laugh she like we be often dull and we womenfolk have help we much but somehow i do not expect -- he stop and grace give he a level glance you mean you do not expect help from I well he say i suppose i do mean something like that then i be glad you own it because it allow I to clear the ground i do not want poor people to be cold in winter in order that bell may get rich neither do my father want it -- you must believe this he do not know all that go on haye hide thing from he there be no reason i should not help you to spoil _ bell 's _ plot kit be silent for a few moment the girl have pluck and he like she frankness she be try to persuade herself osborn be not unjust and although he imagine she find it hard he do not mean to make it harder one must respect she staunchness bell be we real antagonist and he be a awkward man to beat he say however the hint you have give we ought to be useful i 'll look for a way down when we get to the top grace warn he about the inclination of the hillside to the rock and stop at the bottom of the crag i think i 'll go across the hill and watch the first sledge come down if you be not too long she say and pause for a moment perhaps you need not tell the other it be my plan kit say he would not do so and be strangely satisfy as he go on with he horse he understand she hesitation it be delightful to feel that she have give he she confidence and they share a secret at the top he find the other have load the sledge and be ready to start since the dale folk be conservative he have expect some opposition to he plan but they listen attentively and a old man support he i mind hearing my father say that yan hard winter after a wet back end o ' year they let peat run doon t ' fall what have be do yance can be do again kit say nothing for the other by use a favorite motto have banish he companion ' dislike of novelty it be deeun no ' so long sin ' another remark in my time they browt slate doon on t ' stane-boat across the fleet-pike scree push they off at top and let they go there be some further talk and when they resolve to make the experiment kit go down the hill he say he want to see how the first sledge cross a awkward pitch but it count for much that he see a small figure below grace look satisfied with he excuse for join she and they wait for a time while the man above move the first load to the edge the sunshine have go and it be get cold the shadow in the dale have fade from blue to dusky gray and the frost be keen all be very quiet but now and then distant voice and the musical rattle of chain come down through the nipping air it will be dark before they be ready if they be not quick say kit and grace look up the hill i think they be start the sledge if there have be nobody about i would have like to come down with the peat you can not imagine how exciting it be they watch the sledge slip over the brow of the descent it get larger as it come down but it do not run as fast as the toboggan one could see it rock and swerve shake off loose peat where the ground be break and grace glance at the steep pitch kit have come to watch it will go down there with a splendid rush but i do not think it will upset she say my plan be go to work the sledge get nearer they see the snow fly up about its front and hear the scream the runner make there be something fascinating about its smooth but fast descent and as it approach the top of the dip they move back rather unwillingly to let it pass when it be nearly level with they it slow on the change incline and grace note that there be a narrow space between the back of the frame and the peat she give kit a quick look as she say if one want i think one could jump on let 's try say kit impulsively and they run forward he reach the sledge first and throw himself down hold out he hand to grace who fall upon the runner log kit pull she up and although the light be go see she face glow after the effort she have make she eye sparkle with excitement but kit feel half embarrassed because he do not know whether he have persuade she to venture on a undignified adventure or she have persuade he it be a relief to hear she laugh this be rather ridiculous and i do not know if we can hold on she say as she try to grasp the shake peat the sledge run faster and lurch violently as it plunge over the edge of the steep drop a shower of peat fall on they the speed get furious and they hear the runner scream but they be sheltered from the rush of wind and could not see ahead after a few moment grace look up with twinkling eye you could drop off if you like be you sorry you come no say kit i come because i want and now i be here i 'll stop i really think you mean to be nice grace rejoin with amusement and kit understand she see he do not mean to admit that she have suggest the adventure but this be not important it be something of a adventure for a girl like miss osborn although she have embark on it give he a delightful feeling of partnership in a harmless folly i hope there be nothing in the way he say we be go very fast and hindbeck farm can not be far off i ought to have look before we jump it be too late now grace answer with a excited laugh i imagine you be not as cautious as you think but we will not talk it be hard to hold on and i have not much breath kit move nearer and seize the edge of the frame put he arm round she waist she do not seem to resent this and for a time they speed down hill with they foot plow through the snow kit do not care how long the swift rush last but by and by he begin to get anxious the sledge have go a long way since they jump on and the hillside be steep to the bottom where it meet the hindbeck pasture while he wonder whether grace would slide far and get shake if he make she let go the sledge tilted up it stop with a violent shock he hear stone fall and be throw off amidst a shower of peat when he get up grace be sit in the snow some distance off and he run towards she she have lose she small fur cap and she hair be loose but to he relief she laugh oh she say it really be ridiculous but the plan will work the peat will run down that be so kit agree with a breathless chuckle i think it would have run into the hindbeck kitchen but for the wall then it be a wall that stop we it feel like a rock come and see say kit hold out he hand to help she up i think she say i would rather you look for my hat he go off and it be two or three minute before he find the hat among the scatter peat when he come back it be nearly dark but grace 's hair be no longer untidy and the snow that have smear she clothes have go she walk with he to where the sledge rest on a pile of stone and look through the gap they see a woman with a lantern cross a narrow pasture between they and a house what be t ' matter the woman shout and turn round janet gan on and see what be brokken t ' wa ' another figure come out of the gloom and grace look at kit i do not know who janet be but i do know mr creighton she talk she say if you 'll stop and explain matter i 'll go down the lonn it be a glorious adventure good-night she steal away round the corner of the wall and kit who understand that he be so to speak to cover she retreat wait until the two woman come up the one who carry the lantern be fat and homely the other be slender and look like janet bell it be kit a ' stane-boat stucken in t ' wa ' say the first as she hold up the light but where 's team a ' hoo do you get here there be nea road this way kit laugh it be lucky i leave the horse at the top this be a new plan for bring down the peat and it certainly work although next time we must try to stop a little sooner mrs creighton ask he some question before she understand what have happen he be in the light because she have put the lantern on the wall and although he could not see she companion 's face he suspect from janet 's quietness that she be study he then you leave the other on the moor the girl remark i do say kit we send the stone-boat off by itself and it be half-way down when i jump on then none of the man come with you no say kit who feel annoyed because he see janet suspect something i go down to watch the sledge and see if we have hit the best track it be strange say janet i think there be somebody else when i first come out still of course it be nearly dark kit be puzzle because he could not tell how much janet have really see and think the situation need careful handling if she know miss osborn have be with he it would be a mistake to make the thing look significant by pretend that she have not but it be possible that janet do not know then grace have hint that she do not want they adventure talk about i do not expect you could see very well if you have just come out from the light in the kitchen he reply anyhow none of the man come with I and i must go back and tell they not to send off another lot we 'll see about mend you wall to-morrow mr creighton he go off to a gate that open into the lonning this be the wisest plan because he do not want to talk to janet he be half afraid of she but not because he think she sympathize with she father 's plot it be know that bell and he daughter quarrel the girl be a dangerous coquette and have tactfully hint that she rather approve kit this have alarm kit who know she be clever and resolute when he reach the lane he stop abruptly as he remember something and take out he pipe although he do not mean to smoke he must be cautious since he be not sure if janet have go in strike a match he hold it between he hand as if he be go to light he pipe and stoop in the shelter of a wall the light shone on the ground and he knit he brow as he see sharp footstep in the snow the farm people do not wear boot that would leave mark like these moreover the footstep would lead anybody who think it worth while to follow they to the spot where the sledge upset kit throw down the match and frown as he go on again chapter x janet meddle bright moonlight sparkle on the snow when kit leave ashness to post some letter he have write order new machine he be young but since he come home peter have allow much of the business of the farm to fall into he hand kit 's judgment be sound he have study modern method at the agricultural college and be progressive without be rash for the most part he experiment have pay and peter sometimes think the lad 's talent be waste in the quiet dale kit have ability particularly for management then although he be rather reserve people trust he and often ask he advice peter know kit be satisfy to stay at ashness but for all that if the lad feel he want a wider field for he energy later he would not stand in he way the time might come when he must let he go for peter have a brother who have get rich in america and be willing to give he nephew a start indeed adam have write again not long since ask if peter be go to send he it be a relief when kit laugh and declare that he do not mean to leave ashness yet when he pass allerby mill kit look about icicle cover the idle wheel a snow cornice hang over the flag roof and water splash softly in the half-frozen race farther on the snowy road be checker by the shadow of hedge and bare tree low roof touch by hoar-frost rise behind the trunk and here and there a gleam of yellow light shone out the road however be empty as kit be relieve to note he have once or twice recently when he go to the post in the evening meet janet bell come from the little shop in the village in fact the thing begin to look significant kit be sorry for janet because bell 's rule be harsh and he neighbor extend they dislike for he to he family all the same kit do not trust the girl and would sooner she leave he alone he might be take too much for grant but romantic pity be a treacherous guide janet be pretty and clever and he be human he have think about change the time he go to the post but feel it would be cowardly besides he be occupy all day and letter could not be write until the outside work be do while a postman call at allerby early in the morning there be however nobody about and for a minute or two kit go on at a quick pace he pass bell 's house and then hesitate with a frown as a figure he think he know come round a bend in front close by the tall hedgerow be break by a stile from which a path lead across a field and join the road farther on he be in the moonlight and if he vanish the thing would look too marked moreover there would be something ridiculous about he run away kit go forward wonder whether janet have note he hesitation and she stop he near a big ash-tree the shadow of the branch make a black open pattern on the snow and a belt of gloom lay behind the wide trunk kit would sooner janet have stop in the moonlight since the villager often go to the shop and post in the evening and he standing in the shadow give a hint of secrecy to the accidental meeting he think it strange that janet do not see this you be walk fast she say i believe you would have go by if i have not speak the frost be sharp enough to make one move briskly and i have something to do when i get back busy lad say janet in a mock voice you be always in a hurry kit i suppose peter work you hard he say i work he harder than he like kit reply smile perhaps the truth be he let I have my way you be lucky janet remark with a sigh it be nice to be able to do what you like there be only one way at the mill house and that be father 's but i suppose you agree with he that woman 's idea do not count i daresay they idea be as sound as ours but i do not know much about it we have no woman except old bellum and the dairymaid at ashness and you never miss they in that big lonely house kit muse for a moment sometimes particularly on summer evening when they do not light the lamp and the shadow of the fell rest on the old building ashness be lonely and drearily quiet he have think now and then the difference would be mark if a woman 's laugh ring through the dim room and a graceful figure sit by the hearth still he imagination have not picture janet there oh well he say we be out all day and when we come home there be letter to write and book to read letter and book say janet kit i wonder if you be quite alive then she laugh provocatively anyhow you do not seem to know when you be give a chance of be nice kit do not answer and wish she would let he go he feel awkward and think janet know this for she resume : however one must not expect too much and you want to get back it be a habit of yours you be in a hurry to get away the last time i see you when the stone-boat break creighton 's wall i would be at work since morning in the snow and miss osborn be wait for you in the lonning no say kit sharply she be not anyhow she be with you before she steal away she do not steal away kit begin indignantly but hesitate now he come to think about it grace have go as quietly as possible you mean miss osborn do nothing undignified for all that she do not want mr creighton to see she i do not suppose osborn would be please to know he daughter and you go for moonlight walk on the fell kit know osborn would not like it and since the dale folk be fond of gossip see he must stop the story go round i have not go for a walk with miss osborn i meet she as i come down from the moor she do not know i be come so she be not wait for you janet remark with a hint of mockery she stop and put she hand on kit 's arm push he nearer the hedgerow as a man and woman come round a neighbor corner kit be annoyed but he wait and watch the people as they pass the shadow be not very dark and he think the woman give he a curious glance he know she and imagine that she know he when the people go through a gate janet laugh that be very unlucky kit old nanny 's fond of talk i be afraid you character be go kit frown he do not see much humor in the situation although janet be amuse oh she say you be dull i expect you could not be nice if you try but we be talk about miss osborn you be not ride on the stone-boat when you meet she i do not suppose you could have stop it no say kit shortly i be not but i see you and somebody else hardly a minute after the stone-boat hit the wall you see _ I _ i do say janet the snow be stick to you clothes as if you have fall and you look angry when mr creighton put the lantern on the wall she pause for a moment and go on : i begin to see you do come down on the stone-boat and miss osborn come with you you be both throw off by the upset at the wall well if you persuade she to join you in a adventure like that it look as if you be pretty good friend kit say nothing in a sense miss osborn have persuade he and it be difficult to explain that both have really give way to a rash impulse somewhat to he surprise janet gently touch he arm be careful kit i would not like to see you hurt miss osborn 's friend be not you kind of folk she only want to amuse herself when they be not about that be ridiculous kit declare miss osborn be not amusing herself with I perhaps you ought to know janet rejoin with some dryness now i come to think of it you be not always very bright anyhow when she find the game tiresome she 'll soon get rid of you i meet miss osborn now and then and sometimes she stop and speak that be all kit say sternly i imagine it be enough janet remark well i do not want to see you make to look a fool you be rather a good sort kit if you be not very clever be careful and remember you have be warn she give he a friendly nod and go off but after a few moment turn and look back kit be walk down the road with swift angry stride janet smile but when she enter the mill-house kitchen she face be flush soon after she sit down by the fire bell come in and lean against the table with a angry frown there be two mair truck o ' coal and i canna find room for t ' stuff he say yard be full and i only sell three or four car load last week janet know silence be prudent when she father be disturbed but he have give she a lead kit be a fool and although she doubt if he be as dull as he pretend she be angry with he anyhow it might be possible to stop he ridiculous infatuation for miss osborn you can not sell coal when the askew be give peat away she say look like that bell agree i would ha ' break the other before noo if i have not have peter and kit against I hooiver if i canna sell coal i canna pay the rent and landlord will have to do something mayhappen it will be easier for he if he ken the askew start the plot osborn 's none too fond of they he would not like they any better if he know what i know janet remark with a malicious smile what do you ken about they bell ask scornfully i do not imagine osborn want kit for he son-in-law bell start and then laugh harshly old wife ' crack kit 's not such a fool you know best say janet if you like i 'll tell you what i have see she do so and bell 's mean face get thoughtful on the whole janet do not exaggerate much although she now and then make a rather unwarranted implication she throw a fresh light on matter the gossip already talk about among other be grace 's visit to mireside the morning railton 's sheep be count and she meeting with kit before he go to look for the herdwick when she stop bell knit he brow if it be use right i might mak ' some use o ' this he observe we 'll see what osborn say about coal yard and the alteration at mill he go to he office and janet sit quietly by the fire she plot would work miss osborn should not have kit bell make some calculation he money be get short he have bill to pay and he stock of coal be large he could not hold it much longer and since the askew be bring down large quantity of peat there be no ground for imagine the dalesfolk would give way it look as if he must meet they and he write a notice that coal would be deliver by the trailer lurry at a reduction of two-and-six a ton when he have put this in a envelope for the printer bell knit he brow although he neighbor would sooner burn coal than peat he be not sure the reduction would stimulate the demand for the former and he must look for relief in some other direction he pay a high rent for the yard and the landlord ought to help osborn would no doubt be reluctant but he might be force bell 's lease of the mill would soon run out nobody else could pay as much as he pay and he would demand certain expensive alteration furthermore osborn do not like the askew and bell imagine he see how to strike a blow at kit janet have show he the way it would be some satisfaction to punish the meddlesome fellow two day afterwards the notice be fix on the gatepost but a week go by without its attract fresh customer then a bill from the colliery arrive and bell put down he price another two-and-six for a day or two no order come in and he resolve to wait until the week be out and then if needful get haye to arrange for a meeting with osborn on the last evening of the week a number of the co-operator meet in the kitchen at ashness and for a time talk about the weather and the price of sheep askew let they talk and kit be too preoccupy to give they a lead he have be thoughtful since he meet janet bell for she have banish the self-deception he have unconsciously use and throw a new and disturbing light on he friendship with grace ridiculous as it be in many way he be fall in love with grace osborn moreover he have meet she a hour since and she have talk with a friendly confidence that make he heart beat the girl like and trust he and although he dare not look for more this in itself be much it be plain that he ought to conquer he infatuation but he doubt if he could listen to the other mechanically he be silent and absorb until one ask weel what be to be do aboot coal noo be we gin t ' buy i dinna ken say another my womenfolk be grumell a ' it be lang sin ' we have good light bread but they be none for let bell have he way he be come doon five shilling and we have peat enough to fall back on if he put up price again somebody else remark hooiver i reckon he be force to sell and we might get anither half-croon off if we wait peter take he pipe from he mouth it be a kittle point t ' womenfolk have be patient and bell canna rob we much if we buy from he noo aw t ' same we can beat he doon some shilling if we hoad on then hoad on and break the grasp skinflint say one of the younger man i doot if we can break he and wad not say it be wise to try if he 'll come down anither shilling i think we might tak ' he coal that wad be a just price and we ought to be satisfied let he smart urge the other he be rob we lang enough well say peter thoughtfully i dinna ken if that be a reason for rob he and it be sometimes safer no to push you enemy over hard when he be willing to give in you must choose if you hoad on and force he to sell at a big loss the fight can only end in yan o ' two way he 'll mak ' you pay top price for cattle food lime and patent manure or you 'll drive he oot o ' dale you must reckon if you be strong enough we 'll hear what kit say one of the rest remark kit 's mood be hardly normal he be not often rash but he feel sore and rebellious and this have a stronger influence than he know miss osborn like he but she father 's rank and tradition be daunt obstacle kit feel this be unjust and raw passion and prejudice that he be as a rule too sensible to indulge get the mastery my father be right he say we have start a fight with bell he be a dangerous man to rouse and will make we pay unless we beat he besides he have make some pay already old rheumatic man and young child starve by half-empty grate when the snow stop we get the peat and you have see the profit you work hard for melt before the price bell charge for cattle-meal he be be get greedier until he imagine he could rob we as he like and since he have force we into the quarrel my notion be we ought to fight it out peter look surprised but do not speak and there be silence for a few moment then one say : i be with kit we 'll hoad on until bell come doon seven-and-six if he do we 'll talk aboot it again after some argument the rest agree and when they go away peter turn to he son mayhappen you have send they t ' right road but i dinna ken i be none fond o ' fratch unless i be force we be forced kit answer moodily peter give he a keen glance and then spread out he hand it be possible for aw that it wad not ha ' do much harm to give t ' man he chance o ' makin ' peace kit do not answer but go out and askew sit by the fire with a thoughtful look something have happen to the lad and peter wonder what it be he feel vaguely disturbed but could see no light chapter xi osborn 's pride get hurt soon after the farmer meet at ashness bell feeling sore and resentful sit one evening in the tarnside library osborn after fix a time for he visit have keep he wait twenty minute and bell have come to think himself a man of a little importance the spacious library be very cold and the end of a small log smoulder among the ash in the grate bell know he have be bring into the library because it be osborn 's business room but the latter might have order the fire to be make up he neglect rankle although bell have something else to think about he have lower he price for coal another shilling without attract buyer and now admit that the dale folk ' resistance be get dangerous to some extent the askew be accountable for this but osborn get a large share of the profit bell have hope to make one do not pay a high rent for nothing by and by bell look at haye who stand by the hearth the next time i come to tarnside mr osborn will wait for I he remark haye make a warning gesture there be step in the passage and osborn come in he sit down at the end of the table and look at he watch i can give you about a quarter of a hour he say perhaps we have better begin the big room be nearly dark but the man sit in the light a shaded lamp throw across the table osborn look half bored and half impatient haye be urbanely inscrutable while bell 's mean face be mark by greed mr bell find he stock of coal accumulate faster than he like say haye he must pay on delivery and since he customer have combine against he feel he be entitle to some relief i do not see how that be my business osborn rejoin bell might get over the difficulty by lower he price i have putten it doon bell break in the price i can sell at be fix by my rent to some extent the argument be logical say haye then be i to understand that mr bell expect I to reduce he rent not to begin with haye answer give bell a warning glance he imagine he might gain he object almost as well if we stop askew cut peat you can not stop he the peat be he we might embarrass he while the snow last it save some awkward labor to cross creighton 's field and use he lonn a tenant be not entitle to grant a way-leave allow a friend to use the lane for a week or two can hardly be call a way-leave well although askew own the moor it be doubtful if he be entitle to remove peat for sale unless by arrangement with the lord of the manor i have see sir gordon 's agent and he be not unwilling to dispute the point at my cost say osborn with a sarcastic smile enforce the old manorial rights which nobody know much about would be a expensive business and i have no money to risk however if bell be willing to pay the lawyer -- i 'll pay nowt but rent it be high enough bell declare osborn shrug very well it would cost too much to try to frighten askew off he be confoundedly shrewd and obstinate bell be silent for a few moment but he face get hard as he fix he eye on osborn there be another matter t ' mill lease will soon fall in and i canna tak ' it on again unless i get the repair and improvement do mr haye have t ' list the agent take out the list with some builder ' and millwright ' estimate and osborn frown as he study the document it be obvious that bell mean to use pressure i do not like to be threaten he reply it be not a threat say bell with a cunning smile if i be to lose my money at coal yard i must earn some at mill but unless i get t ' repair and new machine mill willunt pay to run he pause and study osborn 's face resume : there 'll be nea peace for either o ' we while the askew gan aboot makin ' trouble i suppose that be so to some extent osborn agree then be it fair to leave I to fratch wus ' they after aw they be mair you enemy than mine i do not understand you i have no coal to sell bell look up with a sour grin there be worse way o ' hurt a proud man than touch he pocket if you dinna ken what be go on it be time you watch young kit i 'll say nea mair but aw t ` oad wife be crack and you can ask mr haye he ken osborn 's face get red but he give bell a haughty look anything that touch I personally be my private concern -- and we be talk about the lease of the mill i can not make all the improvement you ask for but perhaps something can be do when we have study the matter mr haye will let you know bell get up and when he go out osborn turn to haye what do the fellow mean he say you know it be dangerous ground and i frankly wish he have tell you to ask somebody else however there be some gossip -- go on say osborn sternly whom be they gossip about miss osborn since you insist osborn clench he fist and the vein rise on he forehead as he say and young askew haye make a sign of agreement and osborn get up walk across the floor he come back with a savage sparkle in he eye and stand in front of haye tell I what you know with a pretense of reluctance haye obey he tell osborn about grace 's visit to railton 's and hint that she have go to find out if kit have bring the sheep then he narrate they meeting in the dark near creighton 's farm and state he grounds for imagine she have ride down the hill on the first load of peat haye be tactful and apologetic but he make it plain that the girl be in kit 's confidence and have know he plan osborn stop he with a savage gesture he face be deeply flushed and he voice be hoarse as he say : that be enough the thing look impossible i must try to find out what foundation there be for the ridiculous tale i shall be relieve if you do find it be ridiculous say haye who go off soon afterwards for some minute osborn lean against the mantel with he hand clench for he have get a shock he admit that the osborn have some fault but they be the tarnside osborn and have rule the dale for a very long time it be something to spring from such a stock and the wilful girl have disgrace they all osborn have suspect grace of hold dangerous modern view but it be unthinkably humiliating that she have engage in a flirtation with a farmer 's son he have declare the thing impossible but he fear it be true haye have be very clear about she visit to railton 's and she come down malton head on askew 's sledge be ominous she must have be strongly attract by kit since she have do a thing like that besides she have obviously sympathize with and perhaps help he plan this be treachery because it be a tradition of the osborn that they stand together by and by he hear voice in the hall and brace himself he must go down to receive he guest and be glad that they have come since he do not want to tell he wife about the matter yet in fact he do not think he would talk to grace the thing be humiliating and there be a possibility that haye have be mistaken osborn resolve to watch the girl and then insist on a reckoning if she give he grounds for do so he go down and carry out he hospitable duty next morning he arrange for a day 's shoot the snow have nearly go and there be a few pheasant leave in redmire wood the party start early take they lunch and in the afternoon grace leave tarnside and walk down the dale she have no particular object but the day be fine and she wonder whether kit have bring all the peat from malton head there be no wind and the frost be not keen gray cloud trail across the sky that be touch with yellow in the west and soft elusive light play about the dale patch of snow on the fellside gleam and fade mossy belt glow vivid green red berry in the hedgerow shine among withered leaf and fern and then the light pass on and leave the valley dim something in its calm beauty react on the girl and make she thoughtful she love the dale and feel that she might be happy there if it be not for she father 's poverty and overbearing temperament after all they be not really poor they have enough to satisfy they need they cling to out-of-date tradition cause the strain one gain nothing by pretend to be rich and important there be no logical reason for try to live like one 's ancestor and the effort cost the osborn much it mean stern private economy public ostentation and many small deceit grace be get tired of this pretense she want something simpler and dignified for the most part the dalesfolk look happy and she have come to envy they they have they trouble but they be trouble all mankind must bear and they have joy one do not properly value at tarnside : human fellowship and sympathy and freedom to follow they bent a shepherd 's daughter for example could marry whom she like and be not force to accept a husband who have wealth enough to satisfy she parent grace blush as she think of alan thorn and contrast he with kit she do not want to marry yet but perhaps if kit be not a work farmer 's son -- she pull herself up with a smile for it look as if she have not break free from the family tradition after all it do not matter if kit be a farmer 's son he be honest and generous he have a well-modeled figure bright eye and a clean brown skin but since kit be not she lover she be indulge in idle sentiment and then she admit that he might love she although she do not yet love he indeed if she must be honest the thing be possible -- she have see he face brighten and remark he satisfaction when they meet then she stop abruptly as she see he come down the road there be a path across a field close by but it would be admit too much if she try to avoid he and she go on kit come up dress in rough work clothes with muddy leggings and a hedge stick in he hand two dog run before he and it look as if he have be drive sheep grace be very calm when he take off he cap and he think the hint of stateliness he sometimes note be rather marked it do not daunt he he feel it be proper grace should look like that she note that he be hot and breathless i see you as i be bring the sheep down burton ghyll he say then you must have good eye grace remark it be a long way and i do not wear conspicuous clothes kit laugh i would have know you much farther off there be nobody in the dale who walk like you grace give he a quiet glance that he meet without embarrassment she see that he have not mean to offer she a cheap compliment yet the compliment be justify a dancing master have tell she that she walk and carry herself well but where be the sheep she ask i leave they in the field at the beckfoot he answer with a touch of awkwardness we can bring they down afterwards i remembered i want something at allerby grace turn she head to hide a smile it be obvious that he have remember he want to go to allerby when he see she oh well she say i be go part of the way however i must not stop you if you want to get back to the sheep it be not at all important kit declare then he pause and grace think he be study he old and rather muddy clothes but of course he resume it be possible you would sooner go on alone she laugh do not be ridiculous mr askew i think you know what i mean i do not want to keep you from you work he look relieved yes although i be not very clever at this sort of thing i generally do know what you mean i can not tell if it be strange or not it certainly be not worth while puzzling about i expect i be rather obvious -- for that matter so be you frankness often save you some trouble and i do not know if it give you opponent the advantage some folk imagine however it be not we rule in the dale to say all we feel it be not bell 's for example how be the coal campaign get on well say kit thoughtfully so far as that go i believe we have beat he there be a new notice that lower the price seven-and-six altogether and last night we advise folk to buy but i do not know if the fight 's over bell may find another way of put on the screw i hope he will give it up grace reply i try to help because i feel i must but of course you see i can not help again kit make a sign of understand yes you show we how to bring the peat down now i do not know what to say it be awkward ground they be silent for some time afterwards for both have say enough and know that osborn 's resentment must be reckon on it make they feel like accomplice and draw they together they be young and not give to look far ahead but they see the threat that the friendship both value might be break off by and by three or four report ring through the calm air and grace come near to stop but do not she have forget osborn be shoot in redmire wood and she and kit must pass its edge for all that she could not turn back kit would guess why she do so it would be a awkward admission that she be afraid of be see with he by osborn or he friend she be afraid but she be proud and go on hope that kit have not note she hesitation he have not but be puzzle by she resolute and half-defiant look the gun be silent when they come to the wood which roll down the hillside below the road here and there a white birch trunk and a yellow patch of oak leave shone among the dark fir the beech hedge be cover by withered brown foliage a belt of grass run between the wood and road and grace take the little path along its edge she foot make no noise and she tweed dress harmonize with the subdue coloring of dead leaf and trunk the light be not good and she think she would not be visible a short distance off besides the sportsman might be at the other side of the wood she hope they be since she vaguely perceive that if osborn see she it would force a crisis she be not yet ready to meet then she thought be disturb for somebody in the wood shout : mark cock fly low to right a gunshot ring out close by and a small brown bird skim the top of the hedge flutter awkwardly across the road next moment dry twig rustle and a young man leap on to the grass with a smoking gun in he hand as he throw it to he shoulder kit run forward and strike the barrel there be a flash and while the echo of the report roll across the wood a little puff of smoke float about the man grace stand still tremble for she know she have run some risk of be shoot why do not you look before you shoot kit shout in a strange hoarse voice you have no business to use a gun on a public road it be lucky i be quick that be so my fault gasp the other who take off he cap as he turn to grace very sorry miss osborn do not see you want to get the woodcock hope you be not startle much grace force a smile she have physical courage and be shake rather by what she see in kit 's face than the risk she have run kit look strangely white and strained he have obviously get a bad shock but she think he would not have look like that have he save anybody else from the other 's gun my dress be hard to see against the tree you really need not be disturb she say the young man renew he confused apology and when he push through the hedge and they go on again grace look at kit he have not get he color back he lip be set and he gaze be fix the shock have break he control and bring she enlightenment he love she but she need time and quietness to grapple with the situation she heart beat and she nerve tingle she could not see the line she ought to take yet he must be thank you be very quick she say as calmly as possible although she be conscious of a curious pride in he somehow i know if there be need for quickness you would act like that i believe i be stupid enough to stand still until you jump well of course you know i thank you -- she stop for kit who turn he head for a moment turn it back and look straight in front he dare not trust himself to speak and they go on silently chapter xii osborn interfere when grace and kit have go a short distance they hear voice and a rattle of stick in the wood but the noise get fainter and she imagine the beater be move the other way ferrar who shoot at the woodcock have probably not have time to tell osborn about he carelessness and it look as if nobody else have be post near the road this be something of a relief but grace feel anxious a gate not far off lead to a drive in the wood and she think she have hear osborn 's voice she keep on the belt of grass which get narrower so that the path run close to the hedge on the opposite side a clump of silver-firs throw a shadow across the road and a patch of pale-yellow sky shine behind a opening in the tree the stiff fir-branches cut sharply against the glow but where she and kit be the light be dim for all that she stop abruptly when a man come out of the wood and turn as if to look up the road it be osborn and she think she know for whom he be look grace 's judgment fail she she push kit towards the beech hedge and they step into a small hollow among the withered leaf kit like grace have not have time for thought but as osborn look straight in front go past he feel he have do wrong for one thing it be rather shabby to hide and he do so reflect on he companion the feeling get stronger as osborn go up the road and kit be sorry he have give way to a cowardly impulse yet since he have hide he must wait after a few moment grace turn she head and kit see she face be flush it be obvious that she feel much as he feel she have prompt he to hide but she have do so in sudden alarm and he ought to have keep cool and think for both particularly since it be get plain that osborn be look for they the latter stop hesitate and come back and grace turn sharply to kit she look be strain but he get a hint of haughtiness and resolve he make a sign that he understand and know he have do well when he move back from the hedge a moment 's hesitation would have cost he the girl 's respect they wait in the road and kit 's heart beat fast but not with fear osborn stop a yard or two off and look at they with sternly control rage it be obvious that i pass you just now he say you do i ought to have stop you kit agree for a moment it do not strike I that you be look for miss osborn osborn glance at the hollow in the hedge it be curious you stop at a spot where there be not much chance of you be see grace turn as if she mean to speak but kit resume : after all i do not know that you be entitle to question what i do on a public road certainly not say osborn with forced quietness i have however a right to question my daughter 's choice of she acquaintance and it look as if i have some grounds for use my authority he pause and turn to grace you mother be wait for you you have better go home grace hesitate glance at kit it be she fault that they have hide and she would have wait have she think he want she kit 's face however be hard and inscrutable and with something of a effort she go away it be a relief to kit that she have go he have mean to keep she out of the quarrel and now he be ready to talk to osborn the matter do not end here the latter remark there be something to be say that you father ought to know i be go to ashness and expect you to come with I you must wait i have some sheep at the beckfoot and it will take I half a hour to drive they home kit say coolly osborn look at he with savage surprise it be unthinkable that he should be force to wait while the fellow go for he sheep but he see that kit be not to be move and try to control he anger very well i will meet you at ashness in half a hour kit brace himself as he go up the road in a sense he be not afraid of osborn but he have now to meet a crisis that he ought to have see must come in fact he have see it and have rather weakly try to cheat himself and put thing off he love grace and osborn would never approve kit know osborn 's pride and admit that he anger be perhaps not altogether unwarranted for that matter he doubt if grace know how far he rash hope have lead he then he thrill as he remember that when she push he back to the hedge and afterwards when they leave they hiding place something have hint that she do know and acknowledge he she lover in the meantime it be a relief to drive the sheep down the dale he could not think while he be occupy and think be disturbing he put the sheep into a field and overtook osborn as he go up the farm lonning in the dark a lamp burn in the kitchen and when they go in peter get up and put he pipe on the table he look at they with some surprise but wait without embarrassment indeed kit think he father be curiously dignified mr osborn have something to say he want you to hear kit remark although the thing 's really my business i agree osborn refuse the chair peter indicate and stand in a stiff pose he face be red and he look rather ridiculously savage i find you son and my daughter hide from I in the hedge at redmire wood he say i imagine i be entitle to ask for a explanation hiding say peter who turn to kit that be wrong it be wrong kit admit i tell mr osborn so in fact i must have lose my head when i make a mistake like this since i have the honor of miss osborn 's acquaintance -- who present you to my daughter osborn interrupted nobody kit admit with some embarrassment the day the otter hound be hunting the alder pool miss osborn want to cross the step stone some of they be cover and i -- ah say osborn then the thing begin as long since as that he turn to peter the girl be young and foolishly proud of be unconventional or she would have know that she could make use of you son 's help without a obligation to speak to he again it be obvious that he have work on she rebellious humor until she forget what be due to herself and she parent stop a bit say peter she be do she parent no discredit by speak to my son no discredit osborn exclaim lose he self control when i find she and the fellow skulk out of sight like a farm hand and a dairy-maid kit raise he head and he eye sparkle in a sense i be a farm hand but it would be better if you keep you hard word for I there be verra good dairymaid modest hardwork lass peter remark it be rather late to play the part of a rustic cavalier if that be what you mean osborn say to kit with a sneer and then turn to peter i be force to own that the girl deserve some blame although she be impulsive and unconventional she ought to have see it be ridiculous to let you son imagine they could be friend you think that be ridiculous of course say osborn with haughty surprise the absurdity of the thing be obvious weel say peter dryly i reckon they might be friend without much harm though i wad not have they gin farther although the lass be yours the lad be mine osborn laugh scornfully if i understand you you attitude be humorous but do you wish I to believe you do not know what be go on you have make my tenant dissatisfied and plot against I and now no doubt you see another mean stop say peter with stern quietness we have not be good neebor though i dinna ken that be much fault o ' mine but if you thowt i would use a foolish girl to hurt a man i do not like you be varra wrang hooiver you come for a explanation and i want one too he turn to kit you have better tell we why you keep up miss osborn 's acquaintance withoot she father 's consent very well say kit standing very straight and hold up he head i meet miss osborn so to speak by accident and afterwards we sometimes talk she beauty and talent be plain to I at first but it be some time before i know i love she and then it be too late i know my folly -- it be a folly i could not conquer and now i think i never shall well i suppose i hope that some day thing might change do you imply that grace know what you hope osborn ask no say kit quietly i give she no hint it be plain that she be willing we should meet and talk like friend this be not wrong not wrong that my daughter should meet you secretly osborn exclaim with sudden rage be you foolish enough to imagine you and a member of my family could meet like equal i have not pretend to be miss osborn 's equal but the inequality i acknowledge be not what you mean osborn shrug with scornful impatience pshaw we 'll let that go you say you hope thing might change do you think any change of fortune could give you the taste and feeling of a gentleman make you a proper husband for my daughter you know the thing 's impossible kit color and hesitate and peter sign he to be quiet these meeting must be stop i be as much against such a match as i think you be ah say osborn who look puzzle you hint something of the kind i do not know that you point of view 's important but i can not understand my meaning 's no varra hard to see peter answer the lass be bonny and so far as i ken weel-meaning and kind but she have be badly browt up at a extravagant hoose she 'll not can help she husband except mayhappen to waste and she have niver learn to work and gin withoot weel it seem we be agree miss osborn be no the lass i would welcome for my son 's wife osborn look at he with frank surprise then he say we 'll make a end and turn to kit if you speak to my daughter again she will be forbid to leave the tarnside grounds if you write to she you letter will be burn she can not resist my control for the next three or four year there be nothing more to be say he go out and peter who walk to the porch with he come back and look quietly at kit a proud and foolish man but he be hit hard he say mayhappen it will hurt my lad but you must be do wus ' this osborn 's daughter be none for you kit look straight in front with he hand clench so it seem for some year it do hurt i can not give she up peter light he pipe and there be silence for a few minute then as kit do not move he remark : i ken something o ' what you be feel aw t ' same you have get to fratch there be nowt against the lass except that she be osborn 's child but she be none o ' we kind and it be sense and custom that like gan to like it would be easier if i could get away i can not stop in the dale know she be about and i must not see she peter go into the next room and open a old desk he have for some time expect that the moment he now shrink from would come and he heart be sore but he know he son 's steadfast character and mean to save he pain go back he give kit he brother 's last letter mayhappen it be better that you should gin he say quietly kit read the letter and look up with a strained expression i never think i would want to leave ashness and i feel a selfish brute all the same it would be a relief just that say peter i 'll miss you when you have go but it be no ' my part to stand in you way we 'll write adam to-morrow and tell he you 'll come kit cross the floor and put he hand on he father 's arm thanks i think i know what this mean to you it will cost I something but i must go he go out and peter sit still look gloomily at the fire he feel old and know he would be very lonely soon the fire burn low and the kitchen get cold but kit do not come back and when peter hear he housekeeper 's clog on the stone outside he get up and cross the floor to get he hat old bellum be curious and he do not want to talk but there be something to be do in the barn and when he heart be sore it be a relief to work part ii -- on the caribbean chapter i the old buccaneer it be about four o'clock in the afternoon and kit askew lounge in a chair on the bridge-deck as the _ rio negro _ steam slowly across the long swell of the caribbean the wrinkled undulation sparkle with reflect light in a dazzling pattern of blue and silver and then fade to green and purple in the shadow of the ship a wave of snowy foam curl up as the bow go down and the throb of the propeller quicken as the poop swing against the sky then the lurch hull steady and the clang of engine resume its measure beat the _ rio negro _ be old and ugly with short iron mast from which clumsy derrick hang tall upright funnel and blister gray paint she boat be dirty and stain by soot and a belt of rust at she waterline hint at neglect but no barnacle and weed mar the smoothness of the plate below she antifouling paint be clean and she line beneath the swell of quarter and bow be fine in fact the _ rio negro _ be faster than she look when she carry she regular load of two thousand ton and she under-water body be hide she trade in the gulf of mexico and the caribbean and at certain port custom official carefully scrutinize she papers at other they smile and allow she captain privilege that stranger do not get kit wear spotless white clothes a black-silk belt and a panama hat of the expensive kind the indian weave hold the fine material under water a glass occupy a socket in he chair and when the _ rio negro _ roll a lump of ice tinkle against its rim a box of choice cigar lay on the deck kit however be not smoking but drowsily ponder the life he have lead for the last three year he be thinner and look older than when he leave ashness he have lose something of he frankness and he raw enthusiasm have go he face be quieter and he mouth set in a firm line he remember he surprise when he first meet he uncle at a luxurious florida hotel adam askew wear loose white clothes a well-cut tuxedo jacket a diamond ring and another big diamond in he scarf he skin be a curious yellowish brown and he eye be very black he rather look like a spanish creole than a englishman he have nothing of he brother 's quiet manner although he be get old he walk with a jaunty step he have a humorous twinkle and he laugh be careless in fact he have a exotic romantic look that harmonize with kit 's notion of the pirate who once haunt the gulf of mexico when kit afterwards learn why adam 's friend call he the buccaneer he see that he first impression be not extravagant now he remember that when they sit behind the imitation moorish arch on the hotel veranda adam study he and laugh you be certainly peter 's son he remark i can imagine i would just leave he at the end of the ashness lonning thirty year since except that he be get older i reckon he have not change and for that matter peter be never young well you be surely like he but if you stop in this country we 'll put a move on you if i be like my father i be satisfied kit rejoin adam 's black eye twinkle now i see a difference there be red blood in you but do not take I wrong peter 's a white man straight as a plumb-line one of the best he be a year the younger of we but when the old man die he bring I up there be two kind of askew and i belong to the other lot i do not know why they call you after royster kit it be obvious that adam know the family history for christopher askew be a turbulent jacobite who lose the most part of he estate when he join prince charlie 's starve highlander in the rearguard fight at clifton moor afterwards the sober quietness at ashness have now and then be disturb by a askew who inherit the first kit 's reckless temperament three year have go since kit meet adam and he have learn much to begin with adam send he to a american business school and make he study castilian and french then he send he to mexico and country farther south where he study human nature of strangely varied kind he meet and trade with man of many color : french and spanish creole negro indian and half-breed with some of the blood of all he know the american gulf port and they cosmopolitan hotel and gamble saloon but adam note with half-amused approval that while he be not at all a prig he develop peter 's character and not kit the jacobite 's now they be go south across the caribbean on a business venture by and by adam come slowly along the bridge-deck the three year have mark a change in he and kit think he do not look well adam suffer now and then from malarial ague catch in the mangrove swamp he be thin he yellow face be haggard and he shoulder be bent sit down close by he light a cigar and turn to kit we ought to raise the coast before it be dark and i reckon mayne will get he bearing he remark the lagoon 's a blame awkward place to enter and i would have wait until to-morrow only that don hernando be expect we it will save we a day if we can get in since you want to land the b f cargo in the dark kit say thoughtfully we pay high wages and the _ rio negro _ be a expensive boat to run that be so adam agree with a smile you talk like a cumberland flock-master count every cent you spend be a safe plan but i do not know that this trip will pan out much of a business proposition do you feel better for you sleep kit ask some though i have get a headache and a pain in my back guess they 'll shake off when i get to work i be surprise when you say you mean to sail with we so i imagine adam rejoin dryly you wonder why i do not as usual trust you to deliver the goods well there be rather more to this job than that and i mean to put you wise before we land you have hear I call a pirate but i do not reckon on take home much plunder now kit muse while adam beckon a mulatto steward who bring he a glass and some ice he uncle 's character be complex sometimes he be hard and exact all that be he sometimes he be rashly generous ostensibly he be a merchant shipping tool and machine particularly supplies for sugar mill to the country round the caribbean and take payment in native produce kit however know the case land from the _ rio negro _ do not always hold the goods the label state and that adam 's money sometimes help to float a unpopular government over a crisis and sometimes to turn another out it be a risky business carry on with people who have a talent for dark revolutionary intrigue since don hernando alvarez be president of the republic i do not quite see why we need smuggle in he machine-gun kit remark on the surface the reason be not very obvious alvarez be president now but may not be very long it depend on whether he or he rival galdar get he blow in first i reckon the chance be against alvarez if galdar put up a fight but the latter 's not ready yet and alvarez mean to arm he troops before the fellow know i imagine about half the citizen be plotter and spy alvarez have be honest so far i suppose if he win he 'll pay that be so say adam dryly if he go down we get nothing although i do not know much about he ancestor and suspect that one be a indian alvarez be white but the other fellow 's a blame poor sample of the half-breed nigger well when alvarez find thing be go wrong he send for I ah say kit in a thoughtful voice i begin to understand he do understand although he would not have do so when he meet he uncle first he have know adam play the part of a merciless creditor and think few man could beat he at a bargain but he keep he bargain when it be make and now and then risk he money on lose cause it look as if he have inherit something from christopher the jacobite you have know alvarez long have not you kit resume when i meet he first he be a custom officer with some perquisite and a salary that pay for liquor and tobacco vanhuyten and i run the old _ mercedes _ then and van make a mistake that put we at the fellow 's mercy there be a good case for confiscate the schooner which would have give alvarez a lift while we go break in fact the night of the crisis i drop van 's pistol overboard he would get malaria badly and be feel desperate well all we have give alvarez do not cover that kind of a job but he would promise to stand we friend and keep he word like a gentleman guess it need some nerve and judgment to work thing the way he do and when we steal out to sea at daybreak past the port guard i know there be one man in the rotten country i could trust with my life now he be in a tight place he know he can trust I adam get up and cross the deck lean against the rail in the distance where the glitter fade there be a long gray smear that seem to float like a smoke-trail above the water higher up a vague blue line run across the dazzling sky the first be a fringe of mangrove forest the other lofty mountain a minute or two later the fat brown-faced captain come down from he bridge look like the punta we have hit she first time he remark in about a hour i ought to get my mark when d'you want she take in soon as it be dark adam reply you 'll have to trust you lead and compass can not have you whistle for a pilot and i would sooner you put out you light it be you risk and not the first time i have break rule i guess i can keep she off the ground we 'll get busy presently and heave the hatch off the bf case be right on top adam nod and beckon kit when the captain go away you have not be in the santa marta lagoon yet stand by and watch the sounding and compass while mayne take she across the shoal you may find it useful to know the channel kit understand malaria and other fever be common on low-lying belt of the caribbean coast and skipper and mate fall sick moreover the _ rio negro _ do not always load at the regular port sometimes she creep into mangrove-fringed lagoon and sometimes stop at lonely beach and send load boat ashore when she captain see the gleam of signal light when it be get dark kit and adam go to the bridge and the former note that he uncle breathe rather hard and seize the rail firmly as he climb the ladder the red glow of sunset have fade behind the high land and a gray haze spread across the swampy shore but the water shone with pale reflection on one side a long dingy smear float across the sky it do not move and kit think it have come from the funnel of a steamer whose engineer have afterwards clean he fire captain mayne study the fleecy trail with he glass i do not know if that be a coffee-boat go north i can not make out she hull against the land he say sometimes there be a _ guarda-costa _ hang round the point better take no chance adam reply glance at the _ rio negro 's _ funnel from which a faint plume of vapor float mayne sign to the quartermaster in the pilot house and the bow swing round half a hour afterwards he ring he telegraph and the clang of engine die away while the throb of the propeller stop in what seem a unnatural silence a few barefooted deck-hand begin to move about and one stand on the forecastle where he dark figure cut against the shine sea the rest go aft with a line the other hold and when mayne raise he hand there be a splash as the deep-sea lead plunge a man aft call the depth while he gather up the line and mayne beckon another who climb to a little platform outside the bridge and fasten a strap round he waist we be on the santa marta shelf but i be four mile off the course i set mayne remark i want to work out the angle from the first bearing i get kit go with he into the chart-room for he know something about navigation they have teach he the principle of land-surveying at the agricultural college and this have make he study easier when he come back the moon be get bright but the haze have thicken on the low ground and the height behind have fade to a vague formless blur the trail of smoke have vanish there be no wind and the smooth swell break against the bow with a monotonous dull roar as the _ rio negro _ go on she be alone on the heave water and steam slowly but the noise of she progress carry far by and by a light twinkle ahead leap up into a steady glow that last for some minute and then go out that be a relief remark adam who have strike a match and study he watch the ground 's clear and don hernando have somebody he can trust wait at the lagoon you can let she go ahead captain mayne ring he telegraph and kit go into the pilot house the dim light of the binnacle lamp touch the compass but everything else be dark and the window be down kit could see the quartermaster 's dark form behind the wheel and the silver shine of the sea there be a splash as the man on the platform release the whirling hand-lead when he call the depth mayne give a order and the quartermaster pull round the wheel the swell be not so smooth now it run in steep undulation and in one place to starboard a broad foam patch appear between the roller kit know the water be shoaling fast as the _ rio negro _ steam across the inclined shelf it be risky work to take she in because the fire have vanish and there be no mark to steer for mayne must trust he compass and he rough calculation tide 's run flood he say to adam she would have steer handier if we would go in against the ebb but there be a better chance of come off if she touch grind you do not want to touch ground and stop there with the bf goods on board adam reply after this there be silence except when mayne give a order white upheaval break the pass swell on both side of the ship she roll with violent jerk and at regular interval the bow swing up when they sink a dark mass with a ragged top cut off the view from the pilot-house and kit know it be a mangrove forest he could see no break in the wall of tree that grow out of the water but they be not far off when there be a heavy jar and the rio negro stop the floor of the pilot-house slant and kit and the quartermaster fall against the wheel then there be a roar as a white-topped roller come up astern and break about the vessel 's rail in boiling foam she lift strike again and go on with a awkward lurch port hard over mayne shout hoarsely and kit help the quartermaster to pull round the wheel the order disturb he since it look as if mayne be off he course the swell break angrily ahead but in one place some distance to one side the wall of forest look less solid than the rest a roar come out of the mist and kit know it be the beat of surf on a hidden beach this tell he where he be because a sandy key protect the mouth of the lagoon but he doubt if mayne could get round the point the tide be carry the vessel on and there be break water all about she go on with engine thump steadily the hollow in the forest open up until it become a gap and kit could not see tree behind it mayne give another sharp order and kit and the quartermaster pull at the wheel the dark bow swing the speed quicken and the roll stop the throb of the screw and thump of engine echo across misty wood and there be a curious gurgling noise that kit think be make by the tide ripple among the mangrove root the air get damp and steamy and a sour smell fill the pilot-house kit know the odor of rot leaf spice and warm mud in the meantime he be keep occupy at the wheel for mayne change he course as the tree roll past until the telegraph ring and the engine stop then there be silence until he hear the splash of the anchor and the roar of run chain as the _ rio negro _ slowly swing round the winch rattle and she boat be hoist out kit get into one with adam and land on a muddy beach dark figure come down to meet they horse be wait at the edge of the forest and a few minute later they mount and plunge into the gloom chapter ii the presidio dazzling sunshine flood the belt of sand where the shadow of dusty palmetto quiver beyond the moorish arch the old presidio smell like a brick-kiln and the heat outside be nearly intolerable in the middle of the dirty patio a fountain splash in a broken marble basin and it be dim and by contrast cool under the arcade where kit sit among the crumble pillar the presidio be a relic of spanish dominion and its founder have build it well copy with such material as they could get stately model the moor have leave in the distant peninsula a part have fall and block of sun-baked mud lay about in pile but the long white front with its battlemented top and narrow bar window stand firm in spite of the ruinous patio the presidio be the finest building in the town the other so far as kit could see be square of mud for the most part whitewashed although some be color pink and cream the glare they reflect be dazzling but a row of limp palmetto run between they and the space in front of the presidio and here and there kit note round mass of vivid green except for the splash of the fountain all be very quiet and although the shadow have lengthen it look as if the half-breed citizen be still enjoy they afternoon sleep now and then a barefooted sentry noiselessly pass the arch he wear a dirty white uniform and ragged palm-leaf hat but carry a good modern rifle and kit know where the latter have come from the country be rich with coffee rubber sugar and dyewood its inhabitant however for the most part prefer political intrigue to cultivation its government be corrupt and prosperity have vanish with the spaniard ' firm rule a table carry some very small glass and coffee-cup stand in the arcade don hernando alvarez occupy the other side and kit imagine it be not by accident he sit with he back to a whitewashed pillar since he be in the shadow and as he wear white clothes could not be see a short distance off don hernando 's hair be coarse and he skin dark he face be well molded although the cheek-bone be prominent he black eye be keen and he thin lip firm he wear a plain red sash with no other touch of color except a bit of riband on he breast it be obvious that he be not a peninsular as pure-blooded spaniard call themselves but he look like a man who must be reckon on just then he dark face be moody you have come in good time he say to adam askew in castilian i think the curtain will soon go up for the last act of the drama but the plot be obscure and i do not know the end i imagine the action will be rapid adam reply unless you have change much you be cut out for you part ah say alvarez one get cautious as one get old one lose the young man 's quick sure touch that be so to some extent adam agree and indicate kit it explain why i have a partner my brother 's son still perhaps one see farther when one be old alvarez bow to kit you have a good model seor a man who seldom hesitate and whose word go a rare thing in this country i do not know about yours then he turn to adam with a hint of anxiety how far do you see now i see what i have to do and that be enough the consequence come afterwards alvarez 's face clear you be always a gambler but you run some risk if you bet on I he be silent for a moment and then resume : in a sense i envy you you have a partner you can trust but i stand alone my son be find in the plaza with a knife in he back and the man who kill he go unpunished galdar be somewhere behind that deed although i do not see he object yet adam remark the people like maccario and he removal clear the ground my enemy be cunning and i think do not mean to force a conflict until my friend have go now there be not many leave and the time have come morale die of poison diaz of snake-bite and vinole be shoot by a curious accident so far i have escape perhaps because i be lucky and perhaps because it be not certain the people would choose galdar if i follow my friend i have wonder why you hold on for a president of this country you have have a good run i think i would have leave after a few prosperous year and located at havana for example alvarez smile there be a time when we have money in the treasury and i might have go but it be too late afterwards part of the revenue stop in galdar 's hand -- that be one way of embarrassing I -- and i be force to use the rest to undermine he plot now i be draw on my small private estate but why do not you go while there be something leave you be not extravagant and do not need much kit think adam 's remark be justified alvarez live with indian frugality and look ascetic besides he have be long in power and have no doubt have opportunity for enrich himself at he country 's expense kit like alvarez but do not think he much honester than other spanish-american ruler he have meet it be partly for my daughter 's sake i remain alvarez reply she be at a spanish convent and i would not leave she poor then i have my son 's death to avenge he pause and add with a deprecatory smile : moreover i have think i can rule this country better than my rival that be a sure thing adam agree in english well you have better tell I how you think matter be go if i be to help you properly i want to know alvarez look about all be very quiet there be nobody in the patio and it be some distance to the nearest window in the wall that face the pillar for all that he lower he voice and answer in hesitate english with a american accent it be hard to tell a gamble in which one take steep chance perhaps half the people with a object be for galdar and half for I those who have none will wait and back the man they think will win so far i have the soldier but they pay be behind and they be badly armed and drill they will stand by I if i can give they machine-gun and pay off arrears but this must be do soon without galdar know the next president will be the man who strike before the other be ready what will the thing cost altogether adam ask he look thoughtful when alvarez tell he and then nod all right you 'll get some of the gun to-morrow and another lot be on the way go ahead i 'll help you put the business over alvarez fill the little glass with a liquor that have a strong spicy smell and when he guest lift they touch theirs with he it be what i have hope my friend if i live you will not lose he drink and then hold he glass slackly poise while he muse kit who be nearest the arch turn and glance out he see the reflect light quiver across the trampled sand and the dusty green of the limp palmetto then below the latter there be a pale-yellow flash and the president 's glass fall with a tinkle a pistol-shot ring out and kit swinging round see that a flake of plaster have drop on the table there be some dust on alvarez ' brown face and on he clothes but he look unmoved next moment adam lean on the table steadying a heavy automatic pistol and three quick flash stream from the perk barrel three small puff of dust leap up about the root of a palmetto and as the empty cartridge rattle on the floor kit think a indistinct figure steal through the shadow of the fan-shaped leaf he be not certain because the light be dazzling and thin smoke drift about he head he throw he chair back and plunge through the arch run across the sand and stop at the top of a narrow street man and woman of different shades of color come out of the door and begin to talk excitedly but there be nobody who look like a fugitive kit go back after he get he breath and meet two or three untidy barefooted soldier who run past when he enter the arch adam be coolly reload he pistol while the president dust he clothes it be nothing -- they have try again the latter remark still it look as if galdar feel himself stronger than i think now with you permission i will go and give some order he smile as he add : there will be some prisoner by and by man my guard do not like but the fellow who fire the shot will not be catch what about the sentry adam ask alvarez shrug it be hot and perhaps he be half asleep i think the man be faithful and just now i be the soldier 's friend he go off and adam fill he glass and look at kit i feel i be get old and want another drink i get the bead on the fellow 's dark head and miss he by a yard well i guess you can not expect to have steady finger when you have get malarial ague it be a dramatic kind of country anyhow kit light a maize-leaf cigarette and muse he have be startle but he nerve be good and he know something about the dark-skinned reckless people of the south they be rob by they ruler who spend the most part of the revenue to keep themselves in power and sometimes when the vote be useless assassination seem the only remedy but it be on he uncle 's promise kit 's thought dwell although adam be rich the sum alvarez need be large the latter be honest in a sense and kit think would not rob he friend but he might be unable to make repayment in fact he have warn adam that there be a risk and the bullet that strike the pillar be a significant hint the venture look rash but adam have state that it be not a business proposition he and the president be friend and this count for much the old buccaneer have a sentimental vein then kit 's thought stray and he wonder what peter be do in the north country dale kit have prosper since he join adam and the latter have hint that he might be rich but he be tire of intrigue and excitement and the glare of the south he want the brace wind and the soft light that chase the fly shadow across the english hill he smile as he reflect that he be like the herdwick that never forget they native heaf but while he long for the red moor and straight-cut valley he feel a stronger call he be young and have see the daughter of the south louisiana creole with a touch of old french grace dark-haired habanera with languid eye whose movement be a delight to watch octoroon ready to welcome a lover who be altogether white and half-breed indian girl all have charm and some have show he favor that mean much but they charm have leave kit cold he think about grace osborn steady-eyed and marked by english calm she be frank and sometimes impulsive but even then one get a hint of proud reserve there be no touch of southern coquetry about grace she be not the girl to attract a lover and let he go but if he come and prove he worth she would go forward with he steadfastly through the storm of life kit sigh and pull himself up grace be not for he and he must not be a romantic fool he look round and see that adam be quietly study he what be you think about partner he ask and kit know the epithet mean much adam have not call he partner at first i be think about ashness he reply ah say adam softly i often think about it too the old house among the ash tree and the herdwick feed on the long slope behind the red heath on the fell-top and the beck bubble in the ghyll everything 's clean and cool in the quiet dale and the folk be calm and slow he pause and resume with a curious smile : once i reckon i would go back when i get rich and make thing hum but when i have the money i see that plan would not work those quiet folk would have beat I with they unchanging way and ashness be too good to spoil for all that i allow i would see it again before i die but now i do not know he smile fade and he give kit a keen glance why do you pull out it be not for my money you have not tell I yet no say kit with some embarrassment i hardly think it be much of a story but if you like i 'll tell you now after a few moment he stop awkwardly and adam raise he hand go on i want to get the girl properly fix kit be not skilled at sketch character but he draw grace 's portrait well and when he stop adam make a sign of sympathy you have help I place she do not know i would have trust another man 's judgment when he talk about he sweetheart but you be not a fool well it seem to I the girl 's worth get miss osborn be not my sweetheart it be possible i shall never see she again but you can not forget she no say kit quietly i can not forget adam be silent for some moment and then look up you be like peter slow and staunch but that be one reason you be my partner well i know osborn 's kind folk we have no use for in the united state white trash we call they man with no ability whose foolish pride make they think it be mean to work reckon they have first claim on the soft job and do not belong to the world of fight man but i guess they listen when money talk kit say nothing although he think adam 's conclude remark significant and the old man go on : don hernando help I on my foot when vanhuyten and i first come along this coast with about a thousand dollar and a worn-out schooner he be be my friend ever since and now he be hard up against it i have get to see he out guess it be go to cost I high but when the job 's put over there ought to be some money leave and i do not know that you need forget the girl if she have not forget you well perhaps i have say enough and now i 'll go and see where don hernando be adam get up and as he cross the patio kit note that he shoulder be bent and he movement slack adam have change much since they first meeting at the florida hotel he have some very obvious fault but kit know what he owe he and feel disturbed chapter iii the gold onza kit pause as he wind the long silk sash round he waist and look out of the window of he room at the presidio square block of house color white and yellow run down the hill here and there a palm rise from a opening and the dusty green of the alameda break the monotony of the flat roof and straight blank wall that give the town a eastern look kit note the strength of the presidio 's situation the old building stand high its battlemented roof command the narrow street and there be a broad open space all round he think a few machine-gun would make it impregnable since a revolutionary mob be not likely to be provide with artillery kit tuck the end of the sash under the neatly-arranged fold some time be require to put on a spanish _ faja _ and at first kit have think the trouble unnecessary but have find it be prudent to protect the middle of the body in a hot climate when he be satisfied he turn and look about the room there be no curtain or carpet and two very crude religious picture be fix to the wall although the air be not yet hot it be not fresh and a smell of spice decay and burnt oil come in through the window that open on the patio a sunbeam touch a small earthen jar hold a bunch of feather flower the jar be harshly color but the outline be bold and graceful and kit know no pottery like that have be make in the country since the spaniard come he have buy it with the flower for a few dollar and remember that the shopkeeper have include its contents when he offer it to he _ todo loque hay _ he say in uncouth castilian kit turn over the jar carelessly take out the flower and as he do so something inside rattle and a large coin fall into he hand the coin be old and heavy indeed he think it weigh about a ounce take it to the window he rub its dull face and when the metal begin to shine sit down with a thoughtful look unless he be mistake the coin be gold and do weigh a ounce when he finish dress he go to the little dark shop the shopkeeper be make coffee with a handful of charcoal on the doorstep for the sake of the draught and take off he hat politely as kit come up i find a piece of money in the jar i buy from you kit say in castilian then you worship be lucky the other remark but the money be not mine the shopkeeper shrug what matter it be yours now be the coin worth much it be worth find well say the shopkeeper i do not know where the money come from and it may have be there a very long time the jar be old and i buy it from a indian some year since he pause and give kit a keen glance you will remember that i offer you the jar with all there be inside you do it hold some feather flower still as you do know about the money -- then you want to give it back if the owner can be find certainly say kit the shopkeeper bow i will make enquiry if you should need anything i sell seor perhaps you will remember that i be a honest man kit go away feel puzzle and somewhat surprise it look as if the fellow be honest but kit think he have study he and there be something curious about he manner besides a remark he make imply that he know the coin be old when he eat he eleven o'clock breakfast with adam and the president in the arcade he take out the coin and tell they about the shopkeeper 's refusal to take it back a spanish onza adam remark worth nearly five pound in english money but a collector might give you more if it be as old as it look one use to see onza in cuba and native merchant in central america who have not much use for bank like to get they now however they be get scarce in this country all gold coin be scarce alvarez say dryly i agree with the shopkeeper that don cristoval be fortunate and expect he feel that my people be honester than he think i be puzzle -- say kit and stop for he see the president 's smile and begin to understand you be shrewd seor but that be to be expect from my old friend 's nephew to begin with the man who keep the shop be not a supporter of the government ah say kit i think i see alvarez bow one can trust you intelligence and you can keep the coin it look as if my antagonist be curious about you character -- the honor of a man who would take money that do not belong to he be open to doubt the experiment be cheap kit say nothing and the president fill a little glass with scented liquor i know my friend don cristoval and you uncle have stand much harder test he touch kit 's glass with he well i be lucky because i may need friend soon he get up and when he go down the long arcade adam look at kit with a smile when i be you age i would not have take the onza back i would have keep the money and my faith with the president in fact in those day i keep anything i could get now the other fellow know what you be like i reckon he 'll find the owner of the coin adam go off after the president and kit ponder a few day later he sit one evening at a small table outside the caf bolivar the caf be badly light hot and full of fly there be no door or window and a few wooden pillar divide the low room from the pavement which be strew with cigarette end and cardboard match in front small palm and eucalyptus line the dusty alameda where group of citizen walk up and down inside the caf somebody sing a spanish song and play a guitar it be not cool on the pavement although a faint breeze make the palm rustle the air be heavy and a smell of aniseed and new rum hang about the spot presently a man who have be play domino get up and come to kit 's table he be a white man with pale blue eye and yellow hair and although rather fat he carry himself well kit have meet olsen before and he nod when he sit down nothing do at the casino and the place be very hot he say besides i do not quite trust the man who run the bank take they all round these folk be clever crook kit agree languidly and note the order olsen give the half-breed landlord the fellow do not look as if he indulge much but kit think a large glass of the strong liquor be not often ask for as a rule the american he have meet on the caribbean coast be abstemious while the half-breed and spaniard be satisfy with small _ copita _ of fiery spirit distil from the sugar cane the english german and scandinavian adventurer consume they freely and perhaps the german drink the most how do you like it here olsen resume when he put down he glass it be a country that soon pall be you stay long i can not tell say kit who decide not to state that he know the country you see i be not in command no say olsen i suppose you be a relation of the buccaneer a poor relation he give I a lift when i need it olsen laugh well i guess he make you hustle a pretty lively old pirate if all one hear be true i reckon they do not call he the buccaneer for nothing but it be hint that he be begin to lose he grip i see you copita 's empty will you take another drink no thanks i have have enough say kit who distrust olsen he think the fellow 's careless remark cover some curiosity and have try to leave he in doubt olsen probably imagine he be adam 's clerk you be cautious but one soon get reckless here olsen resume we be all adventurer out for what we can get and the chance against we make good be pretty steep my notion be to have the best time i can pick up as much money as possible and quit before fever intrigue or a revolution knock I out it be a exciting life kit agree money do not seem plentiful you have get to hustle and back the right man since you be stop at the presidio it be obvious that askew 's on the president 's side well i suppose everybody know my employer have put they money on galdar then i imagine you run some risk sure say olsen smile alvarez do not like I and if i be not a american citizen i would feel scared show he secretary my naturalization papers when i put up my shingle take they out as soon as i reach the united state from norway kit ponder olsen speak english and castilian well but he accent be not american nor kit think scandinavian there be a number of german in the country engage in extensive but rather dark commercial scheme whom the united state consul watch with jealous eye kit know that no one could transact much business without to some extent meddle with native politics but while the other adventurer be satisfy with the money they could get it look as if the german want something else it be perhaps significant that olsen have so to speak insist that he be a naturalized american and come from norway kit doubt askew 's judgment be generally pretty good but he be get old olsen remark i do not see why he be back the president my notion be galdar 's surely go to win he pause and look at kit thoughtfully in fact if i be hold a clerk 's job on the other side i would consider if it would not pay I to change kit imagine this be a cautious feeler make to find out if he could be buy but he smile if galdar do win he will not have much to give he friend he certainly will not have much money olsen agree it be go to cost he all he can raise to turn alvarez out but he 'll have something to give at the country 's expense sugar and coffee concession and perhaps monopoly if i can get my share it will pay my employer well and i allow they be generous he stop as if he think he have say enough and after order another drink look up with a grin two girl in light dress have pass the caf once or twice with a male companion and a fat old woman who wear black clothes kit have not notice they particularly because other group be move about but he now remark that the man have go and the _ duea _ be a yard or two in front one of the girl look round and he think she glance search the caf and then stop at he table the seorita 's a looker say olsen i wonder which of we she fancy she be be round this way before i be not remarkably handsome and there be other people in the caf kit reply anyhow i do not want to get a jealous seorita 's knife in my back you be a blame cautious fellow olsen rejoin in a meaning tone however you 'll find I at the casino evening if you feel you would like a talk and now i 'll get along he go off and kit smoke another cigarette he think olsen have so to speak be sound he the fellow have certainly give he some hint kit imagine he have take a prudent line by keep the other in the dark about he partnership with adam and they plan when he have smoke he cigarette he cross the street to the alameda and go up a broad walk beneath the tree the sky have clear the moon be high and in front of the opening pool of silver light lay upon the ground by and by kit see the group he have notice a few yard ahead they be move slowly and although he walk no faster he soon come up with they the girl who have look into the caf be nearest and the moonlight touch she face as she turn she head kit give she a half curious glance and feel some surprise for he could see she better now and think she a pure-blooded spaniard the _ peninsulare _ be aristocrat the girl have a touch of dignity and she dress be rich it be strange if a girl like that be willing to defy convention and risk a intrigue with a stranger yet he imagine he have see she smile and she carry a little bunch of purple flower in the hand nearest he he look again and see that she be beautiful and move with the grace that generally mark the _ peninsulare _ when they be young the path be broad and he could keep level with the group without exciting curiosity but he think it curious that the fat old woman who ought to have guard the other be in front he resolve to go past and just before he do so the girl give he a glance that he think be half amuse and half provocative then she turn she head and next moment he see a flower near he foot he note a faint smell of heliotrope and know she have drop the flower for he this mean something although it would not have much significance unless he pick up the heliotrope he do not and walk past with a quicker step hear a soft laugh when he reach the presidio he sit down on the balcony that overlook the patio outside he room there be nobody about and he begin to muse it be rash to take thing for grant but he think he have be make the subject of three experiment somebody have put a gold onza in the indian jar olsen have try to find out if he be ambitious and the girl in the alameda mean to learn if he could be move by beauty well they ought to know something about he now but they be not very clever or they would have extend they experiment over a longer time it look as if they think he something of a fool and this be perhaps a advantage kit smile as he remember that when janet bell try to flirt with he he have be rather humiliate and feel himself a prig he be older now and have not be much embarrassed in the alameda although he nearly pick up the flower he curiosity be excite and he want to find out the girl 's object indeed it be hard to see why he have leave the flower alone but he have a vague feeling that it be unfair to use a charming girl in a dark intrigue since he have know grace osborn he have give woman a higher place for she sake he would not try to gain a advantage against he and the president 's antagonist by embark on a adventure with the spanish girl then he begin to wonder whether he would see grace again but presently get up with a impatient shrug grace in all probability have forget they friendship and married thorn anyhow she be not for he and it be futile to indulge a barren sentiment chapter iv the president 's ball breakfast be over and alvarez sit at a table in the arcade smile as he indicate the transform patio the broken pavement have be sweep the fountain scrub until the marble show white vein and the old brass rail of the balcony gleam with yellow reflection where the sunshine fall small palm and flowering plant in tub stand among the pillar flag hang from crumble cornice and barefooted peon be fasten up color lamp when the people be discontented they must be amuse the president remark in rome they give they circus and i have think of a bull-fight there be a spanish quadrillum in cuba but i find it would cost too much to bring the company across besides i do not know if strong excitement would be good for the citizen a ball be safer adam agree while they have the function to talk about they 'll forget to plot for a week perhaps well it ought to be some help if you agent be prompt they be hustler and know they have get to get busy i expect the _ rio negro _ back in fourteen day and then it will be you business to rush she cargo up mule transport 's slow on you swamp track and it be perhaps unfortunate you do not give my friend the concession for the light railroad you might have find it useful now alvarez shrug a railroad can be cut and locomotive break down at awkward time when they driver be bribe then i have grant so many concession that there be not much that foreigner think worth get leave in the country one must keep something to bargain with govern a people like yours be a expensive job however since they make it expensive they ought not to grumble if you tax they high they do not always pay the tax alvarez rejoin with a twinkle if they run I out they will probably disown they debt and then there will be trouble with the foreigner still that be not very important because i shall be go and the american will not let the other ' consul use much pressure the speculator understand the risk that be so say adam and add meaningly : some of the speculator be american alvarez put he finely-shaped hand on adam 's arm my friend if it be possible you will be pay if not it will be because i be dead i know say adam i be not scare to take chance and when they go against I i do not grumble anyhow time be important and if you work this ball properly it ought to give we another week you 'll get the money for you soldier shortly afterwards and mayne will land you gun the president 's dark face soften and he smile i know whom i can trust he say and go away if it be possible for a half-breed to be a honest man don hernando meet the bill adam remark anyhow he be a better president than these folk deserve and they 'll be blame fool if they turn he down he be silent for a few moment and then resume : i give you a share in my business kit and now if you be willing i 'll buy you out but i be quite satisfied i would much sooner stick to we agreement kit say with surprise well i guess you be rash you share be not large but it would go some way to buy a english farm raise herdwick sheep be a pretty tame occupation but i reckon it be safer than back alvarez kit think hard and imagine he see adam 's object of course he say if you want to get rid of I -- i do not know that i be keen you be some help but you come out to forget the girl in england and not to stay well if you mean to go now be you time the trouble be i have not forget she kit answer quietly adam 's eye twinkle if you go home you may get she and i allow she be probably worth the effort but you be not go to side-track I like that if you quit now i can buy you out and you 'll have something to help you make another start afterwards i may not be able you need not hesitate about take the money i guess you have earn it i suspect where you be lead still you see i would sooner stay for one thing i hate leave a awkward job half finish you be begin to feel the job be bigger than you think it be when you undertake it it certainly be adam agree however since you insist i 'll talk plain alvarez have no claim on you although he have a claim on I and i pay my debt the last to fall due be go to strain my finances but it must be pay a hundred cent for every dollar all the same the liability be not yours there be no reason why you should not pull out while you be safe kit shake he head i see a reason i do not know if it be sound but after all one 's self-respect be worth something oh well say adam we will not quarrel you be very like peter and he be the staunchest man i know he get up and when he go off kit feeling somewhat move light a cigarette and smoke thoughtfully it look as if adam do not think the president would win but for all that mean to stand by he although not fastidious about he business method adam have he code and be not afraid when friendship demand it to fight for a lose cause moreover kit mean to fight with he then he get up and smile adam mean well but he be clumsy if he have want to save kit from share he risk he might have make a better plan when evening come kit enter the arcade and sit down in a quiet spot to look about the moon be nearly full and flood half the patio with silver light the rest be in shadow and row of color lamp twinkle in the gloom a band play behind the pillar the rattle of castanets break in on the tinkle of the guitar when the beat be sharply mark the music be seductive unlike any kit have hear in england and he think it tinge by the melancholy the moor have bring long since from the east to spain at one end of the patio group of young man and woman move through the change figure of a old spanish dance they pose be strangely graceful and some have a touch of stateliness this vanish when the music change and the well-balanced figure raise bent arm dance with riotous abandon in a minute or two the melancholy note be strike again and the movement be mark by dignified reserve kit get a hint of southern passion and by contrast of the austerity that often go with indian blood in the meantime he note the play of move color for the woman wear white and pink and yellow some have flower in they dark hair and some cover they head with a lace mantilla the man 's clothes be vary for a number wear shabby uniform and other white linen with red silk sash while a few have choose the plain black and wide sombrero of the spanish don at the other end of the patio portly seoras with powdered face sit among the pillar and grave dark-skinned citizen move about the pavement in talk group a heavily-built man with a very swarthy color and thick lip go to and fro among they bow and smile and kit know this be galdar the president 's rival kit do not like the fellow and think he negro strain be mark he look sensual cruel and cunning for the most part the president stand outside the crowd although now and then a group form about he he be tall and thin he face be inscrutable and kit think he look lonely and austere by and by a officer kit have meet tell he he must dance and take he along the arcade the officer stop where two girl sit under a string of lamp with a man in black clothes and a fat old woman behind at first kit could not see they well but when they get up he start as he recognize the girl who have drop the flower then he try to hide he embarrassment as he be present to seorita francisca sarmiento she be handsomer than he have think and as she make he a stately curtsey she eye twinkle kit imagine the other girl study he carefully and wonder whether she know about the flower it be however he duty to ask the seorita to dance and after a few moment they cross the pavement kit have some misgiving because the dance be involve and one use a number of different step but the girl guide he through its intricacy and when he take she back sign he to sit down he obey for francisca sarmiento have a imperious air other young man come up when the music begin again but pass on and kit imagine the girl have make they understand they be to do so since one or two frown at he well she say look at he across she fan how do you like this country it have many attraction kit reply but some drawback the drawback be not very obvious now ah she say give he a mock glance for a englishman you be polite but it look as if you be as cautious as i think i be flatter that you think about I at all kit rejoin she laugh and play with she fan oh well we be curious about stranger particularly when they be friend of the president 's one wonder why they come i imagine most of we come to get money in this country one get nothing unless one run some risk and you be cautious francisca remark kit note she insistence on this trait of he he think she remark have a meaning that do not appear on the surface i wonder what grounds you have for think so he say be they not obvious she answer not long since you hesitate to pick up a sprig of heliotrope i durst not think the compliment be mean for I francisca glance at he with quiet amusement you be modest seor it look as if you have a number of virtue for one thing i imagine you be honest and honesty be not very common here she pause and resume in a meaning tone : it be a drawback if one want to get rich i do not know that my character be worth you study kit reply carelessly you be of some importance seor although i have admit that you be modest it be strange you do not know why should i know kit ask francisca study he over she ebony fan which hide half she face and emphasize the curious glow of she black eye i do not think you be as dull as you pretend have you not be experiment on recently i think i have say kit after all a gold onza be not a great temptation i find another -- a spray of heliotrope -- harder to resist but you do resist she reply in a quiet voice yes say kit fix he eye on she face i be a adventurer like the rest but it be rather a shabby thing to try to gain a advantage in a battle with a woman besides as i be not clever i might have fail with a languid movement of she head francisca look round and kit imagine she see the other be too far off to hear then she make he a half mock bow we need not quarrel seor and i will give you a hint since you be incorruptible this town be not the place for you stranger from the north sometimes get fever and i would not like you to suffer because you be honest and have choose the lose side ah say kit you think we side will lose francisca move she fan as if to indicate galdar who stand in the moonlight near the fountain he be smile urbanely and a number of man and woman have gather about he kit know they be people of importance at the end of the patio the president stand alone in the advance gloom you see she say well i be engage for the next dance you have my leave to go kit leave she and sit down in a quiet spot on the whole he think the president 's antagonist have be foolish when they try to use the girl she be so to speak too good and perhaps too proud for the part they expect she to play this however be not important he imagine she have mean well when she give he a hint although the hint be not worth much because kit think adam see how thing be go then he reflect with some amusement that he need not bother much about deceive the enemy since galdar 's friend would not suspect that buccaneer askew have knowingly choose the lose side presently kit join adam who sit near a lamp he face be damp and look pinch let 's go and get a drink he say i be thirsty get a dose of intermittent fever again some table behind the pillar be lay out with wine and fruit and adam beckon a mulatto waiter _ tinto and siphon _ bring some ice there be no _ siphon _ seor we have sherry vermouth and some very good anisado you have plenty _ siphon _ adam declare go and look the waiter go away and adam frown i can not stand for they scented liquor i want a long cool drink after a few minute the waiter come back with a large glass in which a lump of ice float in red wine and mineral water adam send he away remark : that be a stupid fellow i want to mix the stuff myself he drink thirstily and put down the glass taste bitter too much resin in the wine or perhaps it be imagination he lift the glass but stop and throw the rest of the liquor on the pavement reckon i have have enough about the meanest drink i have strike give I a cigar the taste stop in my mouth kit give he a cigar but after a few minute he throw it away i do not feel much better and think i 'll go to my room you might come along the stair be steep he get up awkwardly and lean upon the table breathing rather hard while big drop of sweat start from he forehead this confound ague grip I tight do not know when i have feel so shaky better give I you arm they start and keep in the shadow reach the outside stair without exciting much curiosity but kit feel disturbed adam go up slowly stop now and then and stumble across the balcony at the top bright moonlight shone into the bare room where a small lamp burn and kit see that adam 's face be wet leave I alone he say you can come back by and by and see how i be get on kit do not want to go but give way when adam insist he meet the president soon afterwards where be don adam the latter asked kit tell he and add that he uncle have seem to get worse after drink some wine ah say alvarez thoughtfully fresh lime-juice be better when one be feverish do he drink anything else no say kit the waiter want to bring some anisado but he insist on the wine alvarez take he to the table where the refreshment be serve and clap he hand a waiter come up but kit say that be not the boy where be you companion the president ask one be wash the glass seor i do not know where the other have go alvarez open a door and kit see a man put small _ copita _ into a pail it be another fellow who bring the wine he say and alvarez beckon the waiter call the mayor-domo a man dress in plain black clothes come in and alvarez ask : how many of these fellow do you send to serve the wine two seor it be enough three come it will be you business to find the third say the president sternly and turn to kit what be the fellow like kit describe the waiter and alvarez say to the mayor-domo you will be hold accountable if the man have get away send doctor martin to the bottom of the stair the mayor-domo go away and alvarez knit he brow galdar 's friend be bold but i have not expect this however don adam 's drinking wine may have balk they and martin be a good doctor kit ask no question for he could trust the president and think there be no time to lose they cross the patio and find a man wait in the shadow at the bottom of the step alvarez say a word or two and they go up when they enter the room adam glance up from the bed i see you have bring the doctor he say with a effort in this country one take precaution alvarez reply you look ill my friend i would have look worse if i would drunk anisado adam remark anyhow you have better light out and let seor martin get to work the doctor who feel adam 's pulse make a sign of agreement and then write on a leaf of he pocketbook give it to the president will you send that to my house i need the thing at once alvarez move away and adam look at kit with a forced smile you need not be anxious partner i do not drink all the wine reckon they have not get I yet then they go out and leave adam with the doctor chapter v olsen 's offer for a time kit wander about the arcade talk now and then to people he know the doctor have forbid he to return to adam 's room and the president say it be important the guest should not know that anything unusual have happen although kit watch the stair anxiously nobody come down but he see the mayor-domo go quietly about and servant come and go on mysterious errand when he look out he find the sentry have be double on the terrace and one stop when for a few moment kit leave the arch but the soldier know he and march on while it be obvious that the waiter be be look for kit think the search have begin too late at length alvarez send for he and although he heart beat as he follow the messenger he feel some relief when he see the president i have good news the latter say the doctor be no longer anxious and you may see you uncle in the morning it look as if don adam 's caution save he you mean when he refuse the anisado alvarez nod it be a strong-smelling liquor and one drink a small quantity take water afterwards if one want don adam know the country and after all my enemy have not much imagination to offer he anisado be a rather obvious trick i be thankful they fail kit say sternly and clench he fist with sudden passion if they have not -- one understand don cristoval i have feel like that when the plotter do not fail alvarez answer with grim sympathy he be silent for a moment or two and kit imagine he be think about he murder son then he resume : well we shall have a reckoning and it will be bad for the dog when i send in my bill but that must wait and i would like you to dance i see seorita sarmiento be not engage and she dance well i doubt if dona francisca would care to dance with I again ah say alvarez one should not be too modest francisca be a politician but she be a woman perhaps you find she be not on my side i imagine she be not alvarez shrug well i do not fight with woman although they be sometimes dangerous try again my friend just now we be all play at make-believe kit obey and find francisca gracious she dance with he and afterwards allow he to sit by she by and by she remark : i have not see seor askew for some time he be not very well say kit francisca study he face i hope he illness be not serious i think i see doctor martin fever my uncle get it now and then i think i warn you against we fever francisca reply meaningly there be two or three kind but all be not dangerous some be kit suggest yes to foreigner we other take precaution and be acclimatize well say kit in a thoughtful voice i have not have fever yet but i suppose a unacclimatized adventurer run some risk francisca play with she fan and kit imagine she be ponder a risk that lead to nothing be not worth while she remark i think it would be prudent if you leave the country while you be well i should be sorry if i think you want I to go say kit that be cheap seor i give you good advice oh well say kit i really think you do there be matter about which we do not agree but i believe you be too kind to let a rather ignorant antagonist get hurt franciscan eye twinkle as she rejoin : i like the compliment better than the other but i be engage for the next dance and as you be intelligent there be not much more to be say kit go away think rather hard the girl have some part in the intrigue against the president and it would obviously be a advantage to she friend if he could be persuade to leave the country now adam be ill admit this he think she warning sincere on the whole he like francisca sarmiento and believe she do not want he to be hurt if adam do not get much better and he have to look after thing he would certainly run some risk of a cunning attack by the president 's enemy when the guest begin to leave kit go to he room and after some hour of broken sleep be tell that adam want he he find alvarez in the room and adam lie with a flush face and wet forehead in a big cane chair when kit come in adam give he a friendly smile and turn to alvarez if i would take that drink at a wineshop i would have deserve all i get he say i allow i be safe at the presidio it be a stain on my hospitality for which somebody shall pay that be all right say adam you be not accountable look as if the other fellow be too smart for both of we but i have a feeling i would better stick to _ tinto _ and _ siphon _ you can generally taste anything suspicious in that mixture and i have be dope before but as i be a american citizen and american influence be powerful i do not expect they would be bold enough to get after I alvarez smile we climate be unhealthy but if you have die and suspicion be excite you countryman would have make the president responsible that would have be another embarrassment and i have enough galdar 's friend be a cunning lot adam reply well i think you doctor have fix I up for a time what about you plan i have some talk with my supporter last night and we agree to strike when the _ rio negro 's _ cargo arrive we need the gun and money to pay my troops and when we get they we will arrest the lead conspirator this will start the revolution but it will fail if my blow be strike before galdar be ready yes say adam we can trust mayne he know he be get to hustle i have fix it for he to get the spanish money at havana and that will mean lose a day or two but the old _ rio negro _ can hit up a pretty good pace and mayne will not spare he coal i reckon we 'll hear from he soon adam stop and kit see that it cost he a effort to talk take the president away they meet the doctor on the stair and kit wait at the bottom until he come down seor martin be a fat dark-skinned spanish creole you uncle be a obstinate man and will not take a hint he remark i have some trouble to save he and he may not escape next time then you imagine there will be another time seor martin shrug expressively i be a doctor not a politician but in this country much depend upon the risk of be find out seor askew be old and not strong one must pay for lead a strenuous life and he have have malaria for some year he ought to remain in the north it be you business to persuade he but do not disturb he yet i will try kit say doubtfully you think it needful if he do not go soon he will not go at all the doctor reply in a meaning tone he go away and some time afterwards kit return to he uncle 's room the shutter be push back from the balcony window and the strong light reflect by the white wall show the thinness of adam 's figure and the deep line on he face he skin be a curious yellow color and he eye be dull you have not be well for some time and the stuff you get last night have shake you rather badly kit remark with a touch of embarrassment i think you ought to go back with mayne you imagine you can manage thing better without I adam rejoin no say kit color it be a big and awkward job but perhaps i can manage i feel you ought to go it look as if the doctor have put you on my track he be be argue with I what do he say kit hesitate and adam smile i can guess partner and perhaps he be right well i be get old and have a notion i will not live long anyway do not see that it matter much if i go or stay and i have a reason for stay you do not know yet besides i hate to be beat and mean to put over my last job he pause and give kit a steady look there be one drawback put it over may cost you something that do not count kit say quietly what you have be yours i expect you earn it hard i certainly do adam agree i earn part of what i have get by job that cost I more than my health i would wipe out some of my early deal if i could well i do not know if play a straight game on a lose hand will cancel past mistake but i feel i have get to play it out my wad and yours be in the pool it be not my wad kit object you have treat I generously oh well say adam perhaps i 'll ask you to remember that by and by in the meantime i have no use for argue and be go to stop we 'll say no more about it but if i be too sick to handle thing you 'll take control you know my plan and that be enough i do not need you promise that you will not let I down now you can get out i be go to sleep kit go away feel move but anxious he uncle trust he and he have get strangely fond of the buccaneer adam have he fault and he career have be mark by incident that be hard to justify but he be staunch to he friend kit do not know how far alvarez deserve he staunch support and suspect that adam be to some extent move by pride he mean to make good before he let thing go kit resolve that when the old man 's hand lose the grip he would take firm hold next day adam be obviously worse and when two or three more have pass the doctor look anxious then one hot evening the president bring kit a letter address to he uncle don adam be asleep and must not be disturb he say perhaps you have better read this it may be about the _ rio negro _ kit open the envelope and frown the letter be from mayne who state that he have meet bad weather soon after leave port and the racing of the engine in a heavy sea have cause some damage he have however reach havana where he have receive the spanish money and do not know what to do some time would be require to repair the damage but it would be risky to resume the voyage with disabled engine kit give the letter to the president whose dark face flush and for a few moment he storm with spanish fury this dog of a sailor have be buy he cry clench he hand as he walk about the floor if the money do not arrive soon it will be too late my soldier will not take we note galdar have pay he to ruin I kit know the emotional character of the half-breed let he rage alvarez do not often lose he self-control and he have some grounds for feeling disturb when he stop kit say quietly the captain be honest but if he lose he ship with the gun and money on board it will not help we much if my uncle be better in the morning i will see what he think if not i will decide about the order to send when alvarez leave he he go into the town and after walk about the alameda sit down at a table in front of the caf and order some wine this be safer than the black coffee and scented cordial the citizen drink but he taste it carefully and give himself up to anxious thought without drain he glass the insurance on the _ rio negro _ do not cover all the risk mayne would run if he leave port with disabled engine and the coast be dangerous the loss of the ship would be a blow but if mayne do not leave havana soon the freight might arrive after the president 's fall kit feel he responsibility shrink from the momentous choice and while he ponder olsen come up and occupy a chair opposite drinking _ tinto _ he remark well i guess that be prudent but how 's the buccaneer he be be look shaky and i hear he be ill kit wonder how much olsen know he say adam 's fever come and go and he would no doubt be better soon olsen smile and shake he head there be no use in give I that stuff i know the climate askew 's go under fast and will never be fit again i reckon the old man know he be get to let up if you do not what be you go to do when he pull out it will need some thought kit answer cautiously since he have grounds for believe the other imagine he be adam 's clerk olsen order some vermouth and then remark in a meaning tone : i do not have to be careful about my drink there be a advantage in take the popular side be you sure yours be the popular side wait and see olsen rejoin though that plan 's expensive because it may be too late when you find out my employer do not often back the wrong man and i trust they judgment now if you 'll listen i 'll show you kit sign he to go on and olsen resume : the buccaneer will drop out soon and you 'll be leave to do the best you can for yourself well i do not suppose you 'll get another chance like this we 'll pay you ten thousand dollar if you can keep the _ rio negro _ back for a week that do not indicate that you be sure of win kit remark dryly besides i would not trust galdar to put up the money i do not ask you to trust galdar my people will find the money in a sense it do not matter to we who be president except that we want the concession galdar promise and they be worth a extra two thousand pound we 'll give you american bill for the sum if you steamer land she cargo too late to be of use kit think hard it look as if olsen know the _ rio negro _ have break down if so he be obviously well inform and he employer be persuade that the probability of the president 's downfall be strong enough to justify the bribe two thousand pound would go some way to make ashness a model farm while it be plain that adam might lose the money he have hint he mean to leave kit kit however do not feel tempt although he want to find out something about olsen 's plan you seem to take my agreement for grant he remark you must see that i could embarrass you by tell alvarez olsen laugh you could put he wise but you could not embarrass we the president know whom he be up against the trouble be he be not strong enough to get after we well suppose i refuse you 'll be a blame fool that be all there be to it kit doubt he know what have happen to adam and in spite of olsen 's statement imagine galdar 's friend would not let he warn the president anyhow you must give I until the morning i want to think about it he say in order to test he suspicion we can not wait the thing must be put over now there be no use in try to raise my offer you know we limit oh well say kit i be afraid i 'll have to let it go there be difficulty and if you can not wait -- olsen look at he with surprise and kit see he have not expect he offer to be refuse the fellow have a cynical distrust of human nature that have persuade he kit could not resist the temptation he shallow cleverness sometimes mislead he and have do so when he take it for grant that kit be adam 's clerk you do not mean you be go to turn my offer down olsen say sharply you force I i can not decide just yet olsen hesitate knit he brow oh he exclaim that be ridiculous the thing will cost you nothing and i 'll come up a thousand dollar you ought to see you must accept i do not see kit reply as carelessly as he could and get up since you can not wait i understand the matter 's off he go away and glance back as he cross the street see that olsen 's pose be curiously fix and he seem to be gaze straight in front some of the customer now leave the caf and kit lose sight of he the moon be high and clear but the black shadow of the tree fall upon the walk through the alameda and there be not many people about kit would sooner not have cross the alameda although this be he nearest way but think he have better do so olsen might be watch and kit do not want the fellow to imagine he be afraid since it would indicate that he know the importance of he refusal yet he be afraid and it cost he something of a effort to plunge into the gloom chapter vi the president 's watcher when kit be half way across the alameda he stop and look about dark tree rise against the sky he could smell the eucalyptus and they thin shadow cover the ground with a quiver open pattern there be a pool of moonlight and farther on the solid fan-shaped reflection of palm nobody be near he although he hear voice across the alameda and he stand for a few moment think while he heart beat since he have refuse olsen 's offer caution be advisable because kit feel sure the fellow have expect he to agree and it be obvious that he know enough to make he dangerous he distrust olsen who be not a native american and probably not a norwegian as he pretend there be a mystery about he employer but kit suspect that they be german and as a rule the latter ' commercial intrigue be mark by a unscrupulous cunning of which few of they rival seem capable this be admit much since the foreign adventurer do not claim high principle on the surface it be obviously prudent to take the shortest line to the presidio but kit reflect that olsen would expect he to do so it might be better to put he off the track by go another way and kit be anxious to know if he have leave the caf step back into the shadow he make for another path and a few minute afterwards return to the street he glance at the caf as he walk past and see that olsen be not there he think this ominous since it indicate that the fellow have go to consult he revolutionary friend and kit imagine they would try to prevent he reach the presidio he seldom carry a pistol which be difficult to hide when one wear thin white clothes on the whole he have find a suspicious bulge in one 's pocket rather apt to provoke than to save one from attack but he be sorry he have not a pistol now kit go back across the alameda hope he have put olsen 's friend off the track if so he would be safe until he get near the presidio when he must be cautious he pass two or three group of people and now and then hear step behind but the step be follow by voice that relieve he anxiety for all that he be glad to leave the alameda and turn up a street the street be narrow hot and dirty there be a smell of decay rubbish and the rancid oil use in cooking one side be in shadow and almost unbroken wall rise from the rough pavement for the most part the outside window be narrow slit since the house get light from the central patio here and there a oil-lamp mark a corner but that be all and kit keep in the moonlight and look about keenly when he pass a shadowy door perspiration trickle down he face and he feel a unpleasant nervous tension yet nobody come near he and when he cautiously glance round nobody be lurk in the gloom he begin to think he have cheat olsen but admit that it be too soon to slacken he watchfulness at one corner he see two figure in shabby white uniform and hesitate in spanish-american country the government generally maintain a force of carefully pick man entrust with power that be seldom give to ordinary police they patrol in couple carry arm and be sometimes call _ guardia civile _ and sometimes _ rurale _ kit know he could trust the man but doubt if they could leave they post besides he do not want olsen to know he think it needful to ask for protection now he come to think of it he have see the _ rurale _ outside the caf and at another corner perhaps this be why he have be leave alone he go on rather reluctantly and by and by reach the broad square in front of the presidio the old building be clear in the moonlight kit could see a sentry on the terrace and a faint glow in the slit in the wall that mark adam 's room it be hardly two-hundred yard off and he would be safe before he reach the arch but a grove of small palm and shrub run between he and the square there be rail behind the tree and the nearest opening be some distance off a high blank wall throw a dark shadow that stretch across the road by the rail and meet the gloom of the tree kit look about without stop or turn he head much there be nobody in sight but he somehow feel that he be not alone it be a disturbing and apparently a illogical feeling that he must not indulge and pull himself together he go on with he fist clench he be not far from the gate and although he listen hard could only hear he own step and voice in a neighboring street yet he nerve tingle and he muscle get tense in front a thick dark mass that look like a clump of euphorbium or cactus stand beside the path and just beyond it a bright beam of moonlight shone between the droop branch of the palm he think the spot the beam touch be dangerous as he cross it he figure would be strongly illuminate and he would have he back to the dark bush he want to move aside and go round the bush but this might give somebody time to spring out and get between he and the gate the gate be close by and he be strangely anxious to reach it for all that he be not go to indulge he imagination he plunge into the gloom without deviate from he path and conquer a nervous impulse that urge he to run when he have nearly pass the bush he think he hear a movement and a thick stalk of the cactus shake half instinctively kit leap forward and feel something soft brush against he shoulder as he swing round in the moonlight with he mouth set and he hand draw back to strike he see a blanket on the ground there be nothing else and he breathe hard as he search the gloom the blanket have not be there before next moment a dark figure spring from the shadow and a knife flash in the moonlight then he hear a heavy report and a puff of smoke blow past he head the figure swerve and staggering awkwardly fall with a heavy thud it do not move afterwards and while kit gaze at it dully a man in white uniform run past and stoop beside the fellow on the ground kit vacantly note that a little smoke curl from the muzzle of he pistol one cartridge be enough he say coolly you worship do not escape by much another _ rural _ come out of the bush and when they turn over the body kit see a dark face and a long thin knife clench in a brown hand he understand now that the blanket have be mean to entangle he arm or head half-breed peon often carry a rolled-up blanket of good quality on they shoulder it be gil ortega the _ rural _ remark a good shot that will save we some trouble comrade how do you come here when you be wanted kit ask as calmly as he could the _ rural _ smile by the president 's order seor we be watch the caf but it look as if you have get in front of I it be so seor we think it best to follow this fellow he lose you when you turn back kit nod for he remember that he have instinctively avoid one or two dark lane that would have give he a shorter line than the street ortega and the _ rurale _ have take the shorter way he think it curious the report have not draw a crowd but although he hear voice nobody come near and he imagine the citizen be use to pistol shot give the _ rurale _ some money he cross the square to the presidio and go to he room light a cigarette he think a smoke might be soothing for he have get a jar after a time he go to look for alvarez and find he sit in front of a table in the patio a soldier stand not far off but the president be alone and the light of a shaded lamp fall upon a bundle of letter and document alvarez work hard and have inherit a rather austere simplicity from he indian ancestor kit think he plain white clothes and quiet calm give he dignity it look as if my enemy mean to lose no time he say in english when kit tell he about he adventure it be they third try in a few week kit agree do not you find the uncertainty about where they 'll strike next rather wear alvarez shrug one get use to these affair a custom of the country and there be something to be say for it if the plot succeed it be a easy way of turn out a president and change the government perhaps it be better to kill a man or two than fight round barricade and burn the town in the north we find it possible to change we government by vote you be cold-blooded people and do not understand the passion of the south alvarez rejoin with cynical humor we have try you plan but one must be rich to buy the vote besides if one be beat at the poll there remain the last appeal to the knife but you will let this go we have something else to talk about that be so say kit to begin with i must thank you for send you _ rurale _ to look after I it be nothing alvarez reply in a deprecatory tone you be my guest and we try to take care of foreigner because if they meet with accident they consul ask embarrassing question besides watch they serve two object then i expect you know i meet olsen at the caf kit suggest dryly alvarez smile yes i know but i be not suspicious after all one do not generally conspire in a public place in fact i do not understand why olsen meet I there he may have mean to compromise you to put doubt in my mind it be possible now i think of it kit assent i hope he do not succeed i know my friend don cristoval but what do the fellow want i do not know all you spy be pretty smart but i expect we colloquial english puzzle they kit remark smile however i be go to tell you -- he narrate what olsen have say and alvarez look thoughtful galdar must be nearly ready he have be quicker than i imagine what be you go to do about the steamer i 'll wait until tomorrow if my uncle be well enough he must decide but if he be no better alvarez ask kit give he a level glance then i will send mayne order to run all risk and start whether he engine be repair or not ah say alvarez with a bow olsen be foolish when he try to bribe you i suppose this be you answer well it be lucky that a fast schooner sail to a port from which a telegram can be send when you order be ready i will see that they go next morning kit find adam lie half awake after a night of delirium the old man 's eye be heavy he brain be dull and the doctor who come in make kit a sign not to disturb he kit go out and spend some time write a message to mayne it be necessary that the captain should know what he must do but kit be anxious to give no hint about the importance of speed that other would understand he mean to guard against he order be read by spy in olsen 's pay when he have seal the envelope and address it as the president have tell he he go down to the patio and find a peon talk to a guard this man be the mate of the catalina and want to see you say the guard and when he go off kit turn to the other who look like a sailor my wife live in the town and i have be at home for a day or two say the man i be go back to the schooner now and be tell you have a letter for the patron kit put he hand in he pocket although he have expect the mayor-domo would come for the message there be not much formality at the presidio and the fellow be obviously a sailor yet kit hesitate and as he stand with he hand on the envelope think the other 's eyelid flicker the flicker be almost too slight to notice but it hint at nervousness and kit drop the message back very well he say wait a few minute he go along the arcade and stop near the end look back the sailor have sit down on a bench and be light a cigarette this look as if he do not mind wait and kit wonder whether it be worth while to disturb the president who be occupy he go on however and alvarez sign he to sit down when he enter he room after a minute or two he put down the document he be read to he secretary well he say have you write you message for captain mayne it be here the _ catalina 's _ mate be wait alvarez turn to the secretary my order be that the _ patron _ should come that be so seor i send he word the man tell I he wife live in the town and he be start back kit interpose the _ patron _ have a house here alvarez reply we will see the man but first send a order to the guard to let nobody go out he wait for a minute after the secretary go off and then beckon kit who follow he downstairs and into the arcade when they reach it kit stop and alvarez turn to he with a meaning smile there be nobody on the bench it look as if my order be send too late alvarez remark you have better tell I exactly what happen kit comply and alvarez send for the guard and ask : how do you know the sailor be the _ catalina 's _ mate he tell I he be seor afterwards when don cristoval do not come back he say it be not important and he would not wait alvarez dismiss the man and shrug as he turn to kit the plotter be clever but they make a mistake the fellow be too modest he ought to have say he be the _ patron _ well we must try to find he although i expect we be late now give I the message for captain mayne it look as if we antagonist know its importance kit give he the envelope and go back to adam 's room chapter vii adam resume control although the shutter on the balcony window be open no draught enter the small bare room and the heat that soak through the thick wall be nearly intolerable there be not a sound in the presidio and a drowsy quietness brood over the dazzling town it be two o'clock in the afternoon and the citizen be rest in they darkened house until the sun get low and work and intrigue begin again adam and kit however have be talk for some time when the former lean back in a big cane chair frown at he nephew he thin face be wet with sweat but he shiver and he hand shake you can quit argue i have get to go he say i do not get much better anyhow and can not stand for lie off when there be a big job to be do i believe i could see the job through kit answer quietly adam 's dull eye sparkle you might i guess you be anxious to try you power but so long as i can get about i be in command it be doubtful if you can get about kit insist i be go to try you 'll have a quiet mule ready when it be get dark and i 'll ride out of town then if the saddle shake I i 'll go in a hammock you can cut out you objection the thing 's fix very well say kit we have better make for corriente since the point command the port and the lagoon mayne will stop for a hour or two look for a signal when he pick up he mark we 'll start for the port and take the other track afterwards there be no use in tell the opposition where we be go i imagine they do not know if the _ rio negro _ have sail or not for that matter we do not know kit remark oh shuck adam exclaim mayne understand what we be up against and he would pull out when he get you telegram if he can not use he damaged engine he 'll disconnect and bring she along with the other he stop kit with a frown if you be go to tell I the _ rio negro _ can not steam across on one cylinder you can cut it out i have teach the man i put in charge that when a job 's needful it have get to be do he pause and when kit say nothing go on quietly : well i reckon galdar 's crowd will expect the boat to make for the port it be easier to land cargo there and there be a better road with good luck we 'll have the goods deliver before they know she be go to the lagoon now you can go along and get busy kit go away in a thoughtful mood he agree with adam that secrecy and speed be essential because if the rebel get a hint of they plan they might strike before alvarez could ensure the loyalty of he troops by distribute they back pay much depend upon which party get in the first blow in fact if the gun and money reach the town before the rebel know they be land kit think the president 's chance of win be good all the same he imagine that adam whom the doctor have forbid to get up would run a dangerous risk at dusk a few barefooted soldier parade on the terrace with two mule and three or four peon since it be impossible to evade the watchfulness of galdar 's spy adam have resolve to set off openly and not to give they a hint that he journey have a important object by try to hide it he mount awkwardly with a obvious effort and when he be in the saddle set he lip for a moment or two then he turn to alvarez and smile i be not a back-number yet but it be lucky the opposition do not know how hard it be for I to get up alvarez make a sign of understand you must dismount as soon as possible you be very staunch my friend i have get to make good if everything be fix we 'll pull out _ adio seores _ say alvarez take off he hat much depend on you somebody give a order there be a rattle of thrown-up rifle a patter of naked foot and the party move away kit turn after a few moment look back he see the long straight building pierce here and there by light rise against the orange sky and the president 's tall figure conspicuous in white clothes in front of the arch he attendant have vanish he stand motionless as if brooding and kit think he look pathetic and lonely he afterwards remember he glance at the old presidio they ride down a hot street the moon have not rise and the place be dark except for the feeble gleam of a oil-lamp at a corner the clatter of the mule ' foot on the uneven stone echo along the wall and here and there indistinct figure look out from shadowy door for the most part the watcher let they pass in silence and although kit imagine news of they departure would travel fast he be glad they pass none of the light cafs and open square it would be hard to see who be ride the mule and while galdar 's spy would probably find out this would need time and time be important after leave the street they follow the road to the port for some distance and then turn into a track that wind along a dark hillside among clump of tree when they enter it adam stop he mule and get down awkwardly i have have about as much as i can stand for he remark breathing hard look as if we have get a start but i reckon the other lot will try to track we to the port when the moon get up then with a sigh of relief he lay down in a hammock the peon have get ready and when two of the latter take up the pole they go on again on the second night after leave the presidio kit sit on the coaming of a small steam launch that lurch across the long undulation roll in from the caribbean it have be blow fresh and although the wind have drop the swell run high when the launch swing up a vague hazy smear rather suggest than indicated land astern the sea ahead be dark but in one place a faint reflection on the sky tell that the moon would soon rise although the beach be some distance off a dull monotonous rumble pierce now and then by the clank of the launch 's engine hint at break surf the furnace door be open and the red light touch adam 's face as he sit support by a cushion in a corner of the cockpit he look very haggard and kit think he the worse for he journey the light 's in my eye but there be nothing on the skyline a minute or two ago kit remark it will be awkward if mayne do not get across you seem persuade he 'll come i know he would start we can not tell what may have happen afterwards and there be more wind than i like he 'll be here on time if he be be able to keep the old boat off the ground time be get short i expect the rebel have find out we be not at the port and galdar will have the road watch when the news get to the town it might pay he to risk force a conflict if he could seize the convoy and i 'll feel happier when the gun and money be off we hand it will be the president 's business to look after they then that be so adam agree we part of the job 's to land the goods and it be unlucky the tide be small there will not be much water on the shoal and although we 'll have a extra few inch tomorrow i do not want mayne to wait kit ponder for he have take some sounding when come out they be probably not correct because the launch have roll among the white comber that sweep the shoal while he use the lead but the average depth be about the steamer 's draught in she usual trim mayne however ought to know what depth to expect and kit hope he have load the vessel to correspond by and by the mulatto fireman shut the furnace door the puzzling light be cut off and kit search the horizon for some minute he see nothing and then a trail of red fire soar into the sky he be bring she across say adam get we rocket off the rocket sweep up in a wide curve and burst into crimson light after this there be darkness for a time until a indistinct black object appear against the brighten sky then the launch sink back into the trough where the gloom be only break by the glimmer of the phosphorescence that spangle the water when she swing up on the top of the next swell the steamer be plainer and kit blow the whistle as he change they course when the moon rise slowly out of the sea he stop the clank engine and the launch reel up and down some fifty yard off the steamer the _ rio negro _ carry no light but the phosphorescence shone upon she wet plate as she roll they out of the water she side rise high and black and then sink until she rail be nearly level with the spangled foam indistinct figure scramble about she deck and when kit sheer the launch in she ladder go down with a rattle a half-breed on board the launch catch it with he boat hook and adam stand at the bow wait for a chance to jump upon the narrow platform that lurch up above he and then plunge into the sea kit feel anxious he do not think adam be equal to the effort and dread the consequence of the shock if he miss and fall stand by he shout to the seaman on the ladder when the _ rio negro _ steady after a violent roll and then touch adam now before she go back adam jump awkwardly seize the seaman 's hand and kit lean out push he on to the platform as it begin to sink then he jump and come down in a foot or two of water help adam to the deck mayne meet they at the gangway and take they to he room where adam sit down and gasp when mayne pour out some liquor he clutch the glass with a shake hand after he drain it he be silent for a moment or two and then ask in a strained voice : have you bring the goods get they all we have not a nice trip do not know how finlay keep she going and i think i would lose she on tortilla reef but we can talk about that afterwards adam make a sign of satisfaction and lean back feebly it be some relief to know the goods be here finlay can drive she seven knot and have plenty steam mayne say to kit i be bother about the water there will not be too much kit ask the vessel 's draught and look thoughtful when he hear what it be i can not guarantee my sounding but imagine she will not float across and a ugly sea be run on the bar she 'll certainly hit the bottom and the chance be she hit it hard mayne remark when kit tell he the depth he have get i expect too the mist will drift off from the mangrove with the land-breeze and hide we mark he pause and glance at adam who lean back in a corner with he eye half shut but i reckon we have get to take she in yes say adam dully leave I alone you can fix thing with kit mayne beckon kit and they go to the bridge the moon have rise and throw a belt of silver light across the sea but it be a half moon and would not help they much ahead in the distance gray haze obscure the water and the dull roar that come out of the mist have become distinct mayne ring he telegraph to reduce the speed so far as i can reckon it will not be high-water for most two hour and on this coast you can not calculate just how much the tide will rise there be go to be trouble if we find it shoaler than we expect and i have plenty trouble come along finlay could hardly drive she four knot in last night 's breeze and the current put we on tortilla reef she stop there twenty minute jamb down on she bilge while the sea come on board kit note two boat that have obviously be damage while the steamer hammer on the reef and the white crust of salt on the funnel but mayne resume : say the old man look shaky never see he like that you want to get he home he will not go however he be rather worse tonight i think he be anxious about you turn up in time to catch the tide the journey try he and now a reaction have begin well i allow there be not much use in argue if he mean to stay but he need not have bother about my get across when the order come i know i have to bring she or pile she up what askew say go they be silent for a time while the _ rio negro _ with engine throb slowly creep towards the coast the land breeze bring off a steamy heat and a sour smell the long undulation be wrinkle by small wave and a thin low haze that obscure the moon spread across the water kit look up now and then could see the masthead swing across the sky there be however nothing to be see ahead but a gray line that move back as the steamer go on it be sure a blame bad night for we job mayne remark as he gaze towards the hidden land i be glad i tell you dago to burn a flare when they hit the channel kit say nothing the launch have vanish and there be no guide light in the mist the turmoil of the surf have get louder and ring through the dark like the roar of a heavy train presently mayne order a sound to be take and look at kit when the leadsman call the depth a foot less than we reckon and there will not be much rise i do not like it mr askew and if my employer be not you uncle i would heave the old boat round kit nod sympathetically he feel he hate the smother haze that roll in front and hide the danger but they must go on and trust to luck he know adam 's plan and no argument would shake he resolve half a hour later a twinkle break out some distance ahead and mayne ring he telegraph i be thankful for that anyhow he remark we 'll let she go but i have my doubt about what will happen next the throb of engine quicken the gurgle of water get louder at the bow and the _ rio negro _ lurch sharply go shoreward with tide and swell the twinkle vanish and reappear to starboard now and chain rattle as the quartermaster pull round the wheel then the light fade and they be leave without a guide in the puzzling haze ten minute afterwards there be a heavy shock and a rush of foam sweep the rail as the steamer list down she lift and strike again with a jar that try kit 's nerve a hoarse shout come from the forecastle and man run about the slant deck as a frothing sea roll on board mayne clutch he telegraph beckon kit bring mr askew up he be get to tell I what i be to do kit meet adam clumsily climb the ladder and when he help he to the bridge mayne remark : she be on the tongue shoal do not know if i can back she off and steam out to deep water but if you consent i want to try i will not consent say adam we be go in what be that light to starboard the launch she be in the channel i doubt if there be water enough for we if we can get there then shove she across the sand or let she go to bit mayne ring the telegraph and touch he cap very well she be you ship and we have some sound boat leave for the next ten minute kit cling to the bridge he want to help adam into the pilot-house but the old man wave he off cloud of spray sweep the vessel and make it hard to see she rail where the white comber leap now and then one break on board and pour in a foam torrent across the slant deck she tremble horribly as she strike the sand it look as if she be drive sideways across the shoal but the flare on the launch have go out and kit doubt if mayne know where he be sometimes the tall black forecastle swing in a quarter-circle sometimes the stern go round for the most part however she lay with she side to the roller and it be plain that the struggle could not last long if they do not get off in a few minute rivet would smash and butt open and one must take one 's chance in the boat two be damage but other might be launch and kit be relieve to note that two or three deck-hand move about as if engage in clear the davit-tackle he sympathize with the man although he do not think mayne have give they order in the meantime adam cling to the rail sway when the bridge slant but look unmoved and kit know that so long as the _ rio negro 's _ engine turn he would go on it be not for nothing man call he the buccaneer and now that he be stake he life and fortune on a hazardous chance there be something daunt about he grim resolve a sea roll up astern and bury the poop kit feel the steamer lift and turn as if on a pivot at the middle of she length the after-deck be full of water but the bow be high and go round and he be conscious of a curious shiver that run through the strain hull as she shake herself free from the sand she crawl forward stop and move again with a staggering lurch the next sea sweep she on but she do not strike and after a few moment kit know she have cross the top of the shoal she whistle shriek above the turmoil of the sea a light blink in the spray and she lurch on before the tumble comber by and by the water get smooth and a indistinct dark mass grow out of the mist mayne who be pacing up and down he bridge stop near kit with a reckless laugh this be the kind of navigation they break skipper for if those be the mangrove on false point i may take she in if they be not we 'll make a hole in the forest kit look about but could not see the launch the dark mass be a thick belt of tree but he do not know and do not think mayne know where they be and the easy motion indicate that the tide be carry the steamer on much to he relief the indistinct wall of forest seem to bend back away from the sea it look as if they be enter the lagoon and then he hear the telegraph and the rattle of rudder chain the screw shake the vessel as it spin hard-astern and the bow begin to swing it be however too late the forecastle would not clear the mangrove and kit know the water be deep among they root shout to adam he seize the rail and wait for the shock it come for there be a crash and a noise of branch break the steamer roll recoil and forge on into the forest some minute later mayne stop he engine and there be a curious quietness as he come up to adam we be fast in the mud sir although she 'll take a list when the tide fall we may be able to work cargo i 'll lay out a anchor in the morning and try to heave she off but i calculate it will be full moon before she float chapter vii the mangrove swamp early next morning kit go on deck although it be hot everything drip with damp and sour-smelling mist drift past the ship she mast and funnel slant and kit could hardly keep he footing on the inclined deck when he look over the rail the row of wet plate run up like a wall above broken mangrove root and pool of slime smash trunk and branch be pile against the bow and dingy foliage overhang the vessel 's lower side kit walk aft the screw be uncovered and shallow muddy water dot by float scum surround the stern which project into the lagoon in one place however a mud-bank touch the bilge and three or four man stand on plank cautiously try its firmness they be wet and splash and one who venture a few yard from the plank sink to he waist the other pull he out and then they climb a rope ladder kit think the experiment prove that nothing useful could be do until the tide flow round the ship another gang be move a kedge-anchor across the deck while a few more coiled heavy rope beside the winch mayne obviously mean to try to heave the vessel off but kit think he would not succeed until the moon be full in the meantime cargo could only be land when there be water enough to float boat up to the ship and kit glance across the lagoon there be no mangrove on the other side although thick timber grow close down to a belt of sand below this be mud across which he imagine heavy goods could not be carry the heat and steamy damp make he languid and he go to adam 's room adam have get up and sit half-dressed on the lower berth with a glass on the floor close by he hand shake and there be no color in he lip it be rather early for a strong cocktail but i feel i need brace he say what do you think about we chance of get she off i imagine it be impossible for another week and do not see how we 'll get the cargo out do not you say adam grimly it have get to be do if mayne find the job too big i 'll put it through myself you ought to leave before the malaria knock you down kit rejoin if i have the power i would make you go adam smile you mean well boy but you do not understand and if you plot with mayne to bluff I i 'll surely break you both now go and see if the president 's man have arrive then you can tell mayne to rig he derrick and take the hatch off kit go out and after a time three or four figure appear among the tree across the lagoon they come down to the mud but when kit shout ask if they could launch a canoe one shrug and they turn back i reckon the old man mean we to get busy with the cargo mayne remark yes say kit i understand he be ready to undertake the job if we find it too much for we he be a hustler sure so far as i can see the thing can not be do but if askew want it do i guess we have get to try we 'll carry out the kedge and make fast a warp or two when the tide flow he 'll expect it though i do not reckon much on we chance of float she by degree the muddy water crawl up the plate and the _ rio negro _ rise upright the haze melt and it get fiercely hot when the sun shine a canoe man by half-breed peon cross the lagoon and with heavy labor the kedge-anchor be hoist out and hang between two boat half-naked man toil at the oar until the lashing be cut and the boat rock as the anchor sink then they crew drag large stiff warp force they way among the mangrove root and make the rope fast where they could they come back exhaust drip with water and daub by slime and mayne go to the bridge the sun pierce the narrow awning and there be not a breath of wind the lagoon shone with dazzling brightness and the iron deck throw up a intolerable heat kit feel the perspiration soak he thin clothes and big drop of moisture trickle down adam 's yellow face as he sit with half-shut eye in a canvas chair by and by he take out he watch and kit note that he move it once or twice before he could see the time have not you better get busy he ask mayne the telegraph clang the engine pant and the _ rio negro _ begin to shake as the screw revolve there be no movement but the rack throb until mayne raise he hand and winch and windlass rattle puff of steam blow about the cable rise from the water with a jar and the warp run slowly across the winch-drum foul with greasy scum hold on to it mayne shout get in the last inch he voice be drown by the rattle of chain and hiss of steam but the uproar begin to die away and the sharp clatter of small engine change to spasmodic jar then somebody shout there be a crash and the end of a broken warp fly back tear up the dazzling water the windlass stop and a few moment later a clump of mangrove sway kit hear green wood crack as a rope that have stretch and strain begin to move then mayne raise he hand let go stop she you be pull up the tree there be a sudden quietness except for the insistent throb of the screw and mayne turn to adam if the cable hold i can smash the windlass but i can not heave she off very well you quit and get the cargo out better hustle while she be upright mayne go down the ladder and when he unlock the iron door of the after wheel-house a gang of man bring out a row of small-box a mulatto from the beach who wear neat white clothes and a expensive hat count the box and then give adam a receipt don hernando will be glad to get these goods and we will start at once he say although i have a guard it will be safe to reach the town before the president 's enemy know that would be prudent seor adam agree and turn to kit when the mulatto go away i have do my part and it be alvarez 's business to see the chest get through well we have both take some chance since he be a customs-clerk and i a _ contrabandista _ run the old _ mercedes _ but i reckon this be my rashest plunge anyhow if i get my money back or not i have put up the goods now you can tell mayne to break out the gun mayne give order derrick-boom swing from the stumpy mast pulley rattle and heavy case rise from the hold the boat however could not get abreast of the forward hatch and the case have to be move across slippery iron plate to the after derrick that hoist they overboard it be exhausting work and the heat be intolerable the white crew throw off they soaked clothes and toil half-naked in the sun that burn they skin but adam leave the awning and go about in the glare at first the mate grumble with indignant surprise they employer be break rule work the cargo be they business and nobody else must meddle besides they have not meet a shipowner able to superintend the job one who venture a protest however stop in awkward embarrassment when adam give he a look and the other soon admit that few captain know more about derrick and sling nevertheless kit be anxious as he watch he uncle he know adam would pay for this and wonder how long he could keep it up at noon the peon refuse another load and when adam address they in virulent castilian coolly pull the boat away from the ship when they have row a short distance they stop and one get up more be not possible seor he say to work in this sun be not for flesh and blood after we have sleep for a hour or two we will come back adam feel for he pistol but hesitate with he hand at he silk belt and kit think he look very like a buccaneer it might pay to plug that fellow and i would have risk it when i come here in the _ mercede _ still i guess don hernando have enough trouble mayne stand behind he grin i reckon that fix the thing do not know i be sorry the dago have light out my crowd be use up and ready to mutiny for two hour the tired crew rest while the water sink and the steamer resume she awkward list then the boat come back and the man crawl languidly about the slant deck until adam go among they with bitter word the sea breeze be blow outside but no wind could enter the gap in the tree and foul exhalation from warm mud and slime poison the stagnant air kit 's head ache he eye hurt and he joint be sore he feel strangely limp and it cost he a effort to get about all the while the winch hammer and pulley scream as the case come up and the empty sling go down the heat get suffocating and the slant of mast and deck make matter worse because the man must hold the derrick back with guy while the heavy goods clear the coaming of the hatch much judgment be need to drop they safely in the boat man gasp and choke quarrel with each other and growl at the mate but somehow hold on while the tide ebb and the sun sink nearer the mangrove ' top it dip when the breathless peon push the last boat away from the _ rio negro 's _ side and the noisy machine stop darkness spread swiftly across the lagoon and a white fog hot and damp as steam rise from the forest and hang about the ship everything be very quiet for the man be too limp to talk but a murmur come out of the distance where the long swell beat upon the shoal kit and mayne sit in the chart-room with a jug of iced liquor on the table in front sometimes they speak a few word and sometimes smoke in silence while adam lay on the settee say nothing at length he get up and a steward help he to he room somehow the other feel it a relief that he have go i can hustle but you uncle make I tired mayne remark if you get what i mean it be like watch a dead man chase the boy about you feel it be unnatural to see he on he foot well one have to pay for fool with a climate like this and i be afraid the bill he 'll get will break he can not you make he quit i can not i have try the curious thing be he know the cost mayne resume know what be come to he unless he go yes say kit in a thoughtful voice i believe he do know and do not mind this make it rough on I i be powerless to send he off and i be fond of the old man mayne make a sign of agreement he be a pretty tough proposition and be worse when he be young but i have risk my life to serve he the buccaneer hold he friend kit say nothing he be anxious and depressed and soon go off to bed when work begin next morning adam be on deck and superintend the landing of the cargo in spite of kit 's protest kit think the day be hotter than the last and after a hour or two 's disturbed sleep in he stifle room find it hard to drag himself about when the exhaust peon stop at noon he lay under the awning and keep close to adam when they resume he do not like he uncle 's fix frown and think it be cause by the effort he make to keep at work if not it be a hint of pain he stubbornly try to overcome besides he step be drag and he movement be awkward about the middle of the afternoon adam stand near the noisy winch while a case be hoist the winch-man look up when the heavy load hang from the derrick swing across the slant deck hold she while they steady the boom adam shout and seize the rope that slip round the drum the winch-driver be watch the other who struggle with the guy and perhaps forget it be not a strong man who have come to he help for a moment or two adam keep he grip and then he hand open and he stagger back somebody shout a pulley rattle and the case run down crash against the steamer 's rail kit run forward but reach the spot a moment too late for adam lay unconscious on the iron deck they pick he up and carry he to the bridge where it be a little cooler than he room but for some time he do not open he eye then he look about dully and see kit give he a feeble smile you be in charge now partner keep the boy hustle he say there be the coffee to load up when you have put the gun ashore look as if i have get to leave the job to you he turn he head draw a hard breath as if it have hurt he to speak and say nothing more the work however go on until it get dark and when the mist rise from the mangrove and a heavy dew begin to fall they carry adam to he room he sleep for part of the night while kit watch but now and then toss about with delirious muttering when morning come he do not wake and kit look at he pinched wet face go on deck with a heavy heart he have send for the spanish doctor but think it do not matter much if seor martin come or not in another day or two he would be alone chapter ix adam 's last request it be nearly full moon the night be calm and the flow tide ripple among the mangrove root clammy vapor drift about the ship and big drop fall from the rigging and splash upon the deck a plume of smoke go nearly straight up from the funnel and now and then the clang of furnace-slice and shovel rise from the stokehold for mayne hope to float the vessel next tide for the most part however the man be asleep and it be very quiet in the room under the poop a lamp tilted at a sharp angle give a feeble light that touch adam 's face kit sit on a locker opposite look anxious and worn you load up some of the coffee adam remark in a strained voice half of it i think the rest 's on the beach say kit it be doubtful if we 'll get the next lot since seor martin understand the fighting have begin the lot you have ship will be something to score against the account it be prime coffee and ought to sell well i would like you to get the rubber but alvarez can not wait long for the goods mackellar have ready for the boat another voyage and you can pull out for the old country i would reckon on go with you but that be do with kit say nothing the doctor have come and go for he be need elsewhere and could not help the sick man one could indulge he and make thing comfortable for a few day but that be all he say and kit see that adam know by and by the latter resume : i have be think about peter and ashness i would have like to see the old place and the fell again and when i be half asleep i think i hear the beck splash among the thorn and the pee-wits cry well you be go back and you 'll marry that girl though it will cost you something to see alvarez through you ought to be rich enough you must not talk too much say kit seor martin tell you to rest adam smile it do not matter now if i rest or not my brain 's clearer and i 'll talk while i can i never tell you much about my early life but i be go to do so because there be something i want to ask then you have only to ask it kit reply i know say adam feebly you be staunch well you have see the despatch-box in the office marked _ hattie g _ though i lose the old boat long before you come out she be a coal-eater and do not pay to run but i keep she go until she hit the reef my first steamboat -- i get she when she be go cheap but she be buy with my wife 's money and call after she i meet hattie in florida about the year you be bear she be vanhuyten 's cousin and the finest thing that ever wear a woman 's shape northern grit and southern fire for she spring from new england and good virginium stock i have see no woman with she superb confidence well i be a _ contrabandista _ with some ugly tale against my name but i fall in love with hattie and marry she in a month adam be silent for a few minute and while kit muse shovel clink in the stokehold and the vessel begin to lift the tilted lamp straighten and its light rest on adam 's waste form he silk pyjamas rather emphasize than hide he gauntness he look strangely worn and weak but kit could picture the strong passion of he love-making there be something fierce and primitive about the old buccaneer and it be not hard to see how he have so to speak sweep the romantic girl off she foot by the fiery spirit that have burn he out yet he have never talk about other woman and though he know the south kit think he have care for none i leave she in a few week adam go on alvarez be put up for president and my savings be at stake hattie go home to virginium while i help alvarez on the coast he be hard up against it though he be be president three time since well when thing look blackest i be knock out in salina swamp by fever and a bullet that touch my lung they take I to the old indian mission -- we be cut off from the ship -- and father herman put the _ rurale _ off my track i have send he wine and candle he be at the mission yet it stand between thick forest and swamp like this and the padre 's the only white man who have live there long get down the chart and i 'll show you the landing place kit do so feel that he ought to indulge a sick man 's caprice and adam after give he clear direction be quiet for some minute then he begin again with a effort : vanhuyten tell hattie and i find out afterwards that she have have trouble at home she folk have never trust I and want to keep she back but she have rich friend who send she out like a american princess on a big steam yacht she get to the mission when i be at my worst and find i could not be move send the yacht away it be some day before i know she have come there be no doctor to be get alvarez could not send help and the government soldier be hunting for he friend but father herman know something about medicine and hattie help he better than a trained nurse i can see she now go about the mud-walled room in she clean white dress without a hint of weariness in she gentle eye that be when she think i be watch but sometimes at night she head bent and she figure droop it be blisteringly hot and when the sun go down the poisonous steam from the swamp drift round the spot sometimes i begged she not to stay and sometimes i rage but hattie could not be move and my weak anger break before she smile she be strong and would not get fever she say she have come to nurse I and if i insist would go home when i be well adam stop and ask for a drink and afterwards kit hope he have go to sleep but he presently rouse himself again i have get to finish partner because there be a reason you should hear it all by and by father herman have to nurse we both and when i get better hattie die we bury she by torchlight in the dusty mission yard -- she be a catholic -- you 'll see the marble cross i have be lonely ever since and that be partly why i send for you peter come next to hattie and you be peter 's son now i be ready to pull out and somehow i think hattie will find I when i be wander in the dark love like hers be strong but i want you to listen when you have give I another drink kit hold the glass to adam 's crack lip he drink and lay still breathe hard and kit hear the ripple of the tide the _ rio negro _ be get upright and as the lamp turn in its socket the light move across the wall after a time adam resume in a clearer voice : all i have be yours mackellar will prove the will but you 'll see alvarez out as i mean to do another thing mayne will get the old boat off tomorrow and when he be load up i want you to take I out and land I on the creek i marked behind salina point he can fly the flag half-mast i 'll have start on the lone trail then you 'll hire some half-breed boy at the _ pueblo _ in the swamp and take I to the mission and lay I beside my wife hattie be a catholic and you can tell father herman that what she believe be good enough for I afterwards you 'll send he now and then the box of candle he will tell you about they be to burn in the little chapel before we lady of sorrow where hattie use to pray i might get well you 'll do this for I i will kit answer with forced quietness then i have finish say adam i be go to sleep now and may not talk much again he turn he head from the light and presently kit hear he breathe quietly go out on deck at high-water next day the _ rio negro _ float off the mud and when she swing to she anchor kit go into adam 's room adam be very weak but look up get the coffee on board i be afraid you will not have time for the next lot and the rubber he say tell finlay to bank he fire you 'll want steam to take I out kit understand and nod because he could not speak and adam give he a quiet smile go to sleep again some hour later mayne join kit who have go on deck for a few minute that be the last of the _ hacienda luisa _ coffee he say indicate a boat alongside the peon tell I the next lot 's come down but if we ship it we 'll miss the tide you can close the hatch the coffee must wait it be high-grade stuff and bring top price i sure do not like to leave it to spoil we must risk that kit say quietly there be another thing pedro the clerk reckon they be fight near salina and the president 's not popular in that neighborhood look as if you might have some trouble to take the old man to the mission it be possible say kit i be go to try have everything ready for we to get off to-night mayne lift he hand to he cap very well sir we 'll start as soon as there be water enough he go away but kit know what he mean the captain have do he duty by indicate obstacle but he approve he new master 's resolve and own he authority kit be persuade he would have mayne 's loyal help and go back to adam 's room when it be get dark adam move he head as the engine begin to throb and the propeller churn noisily in the shallow water it stop after a few turn and steam blow off finlay 's give she a trial spin adam remark in a very faint voice i see you have get thing fix and i be ready to start he stop and shut he eye for a minute or two and kit do not know if he be conscious or not then he resume in a strained whisper : all 's ready ring for full-speed i be go to meet my wife he draw a hard breath sigh and do not speak again a hour afterwards mayne meet kit come out of the room and glancing at he face take off he cap i guess it hit you hard and i 'll miss he too he say i 'll not get another master like the buccaneer he go off to give some order and kit sit down feeling very desolate when the tide have rise and flow past oily smooth under the full moon the windlass begin to rattle and the cable clang the anchor come up and when the engine shake the ship mayne pull the whistle-line and a long blast roll across the wood next moment a rocket soar and burst in a shower of color light vanhuyten and askew 's signal the head of the house be make he last trip the captain remark the echo sink the color light burn out and the measure beat of engine jar upon the silence as the _ rio negro _ go to sea for a time the land breeze blow the steam of the swamp after she and mast and funnel reel through a muggy haze as she lurch across the surf-swept shoal she float high and light she muddy side rise like a wall as she steady between the roll that dip she channel in the foam outside the swell be regular and the roll long and rhythmical the haze thin the air get sweet and cool and the heart of the crew get lighter as she steam out to open sea for all that man lower they voice and tread quietly when they pass the poop cabin where she dead owner lay at sunrise mayne hoist the house-flag and the star and stripe droop languidly half way up the ensign staff until the glassy calm break and the sea breeze straighten the blue and silver fold by and by he change the course and mountain rise ahead although a bank of cloud hide the plain and mangrove forest at they foot in the afternoon he search the haze with he glass and get a bearing stop the engine near salina point at dusk if the weather 's good i 'll wait three day he say then if you send no word i 'll pull out for havana and get the engine properly fix better take this bag of spanish money mint silver go and you may find the dago shy of the president 's note kit take the money a boat be swing out and four sailor carry the plain flag-wrapped coffin down the ladder they be rough man but kit imagine he could trust they another crew pick up the oar greasy cap be lift the _ rio negro 's _ whistle scream a last salute and the boat steal away mayne steam off to anchor on good holding ground and kit sit at the tiller with he eye fix on the misty coast it be dark when he hear breaker and see the glimmer of surf there be shoal all round he but he have be tell about a bay where a creek flow through a sheltered channel he do not know if he could find the channel and if not the boat might be wreck but something must be leave to luck and they pull on before the curl swell she strike and stop until a comber roll up astern it break and half bury she in rush foam but she lift lurch ahead and do not strike again the man be nearly knee-deep as they bale the water out and one be afterwards idle because he oar have go in spite of this they make the creek and drift quietly into the gloom of the mangrove with the flow tide after a time the water get shallow and they push she across the mud while leaf and rot branch float up the creek no light pierce the forest and the feeble beam of kit 's lantern scarcely touch the shadowy trunk that move past until they come to a opening kit think this be the spot he have be tell about and turn the boat she would not float to the bank and he and he four man get out and lift the coffin they sink in treacherous mud but reach a belt of sand riddled by land-crab 's hole all be very quiet except for the ripple of the tide and the noise make by the scuttle crab the sand however be dry and warm and they sit down to wait for morning when the boat go away chapter x the road to the mission the sun be high when kit and he tired man reach the village he be wet with sweat and the moisture that have drip upon he from the leaf in the early morning and the man gasp when they put down they load two wear greasy engine-room overalls and two ragged suit of duck they soft hat be stain and batter and they look like ruffian although mayne pay good wages respectable seaman avoid the _ rio negro _ and she crew be as a rule accustom to fight with knife and sandbag on disorderly water-front now they carry pistol hide as far as possible but ready for use small square mud house occupy the hole in the forest where the plaster have not fall off they white front be dazzling but they be dirty and ruinous and the narrow street be strew with decaying rubbish although the _ pueblo _ have once prosper under spanish rule it be now inhabit by languid half-breed of strangely mixed blood engage in smuggling and revolutionary plot they stand about the doorway barefoot and ragged watch kit with furtive black eye i want porter and a guide to the mission he tell the _ patron _ who lounge against a wall smoking a cigar it be a long way seor and the road be bad besides one can not travel when the sun be high the road be no doubt safer then than in the dark that be true agree the other with a philosophic shrug the country be disturbed i must start at once kit say firmly i be willing to pay for the risk the _ patron _ speak to the other in a harsh dialect but none of the loaf figure move they say the risk be great he remark there have be fight and the president 's soldier be in the wood the president 's soldier will not meddle with we kit answer incautiously for a moment the half-breed 's eye be keen but he dark face resume its inscrutable look then the seor be a friend of the president 's if we meet he soldier they will let I pass the soldier be not the worst there be the _ rurale _ man without shame who shoot and ask no question however we will see if i can find porter if the seor will wait until the afternoon kit distrust the fellow and think he have a object for put off the start he have be warn that the _ meztiso _ sympathize with the rebel and imagine that he party 's safety depend on its speed but he do not want to look impatient and imitate the other 's carelessness sit down and light a cigarette while he ponder to begin with he suspect that the _ patron _ would prevent he meet any of the president 's soldier who might be about and it would be prudent to finish he business and get back to the ship before galdar know he be in the wood he man claim to be american citizen and mayne know where he have go but the latter 's statement might be doubt if the party disappear it be know that askew be engage in a risky trade and the captain 's story would look more romantic than plausible kit see he must depend upon he own resource and presently note that a man be leave the village the fellow keep behind the group in the street as far as he could and move quickly there be something stealthy about he movement and when he look back as if to see if kit be watch the latter get up stop that man he say but he be go to he work seor the _ patron _ object in this country one do not work while the sun be high say kit who rather ostentatiously pull out he pistol call he back the _ patron _ shout and the man return but kit keep he pistol in he hand nobody must leave the _ pueblo _ until i start he say i want porter and be willing to pay very well the patron agree shrugging perhaps i can find a few man but they will want the money before they go for a time kit bargain the sailor be tire and few white man be capable of much exertion in the tropic swamp he must have help and doubt if the _ meztiso _ could be trust think it best to offer a sum that would excite they greed but stipulate that half would not be pay until they return when the _ patron _ be satisfied kit turn to the sailor you 'll have to hustle boy he say the sooner we make the mission the sooner we 'll get back and i reckon nobody want to stop in these swamp there be something beside you wages come to you that be all right boss one reply the old man drive hard but he pay well and he be white you can go ahead we 'll put the job over the peon take up the stretcher-pole lash to the coffin a relief party go behind and they set off nobody speak and the _ meztiso ' _ bare foot fall silently on the hot sand although kit hear the drag tramp of the sailor ' muddy boot in the open space round the village the sun burn they skin and they push on as fast as possible for the twilight of the wood here and there a bright gleam pierce the gloom but for the most part deep shadow fill the gap between the trunk creeper lace the great cottonwood tangled vine crawl about they tall buttress root and hang in festoon from the giant branch some of the tree be rotten and orchid cover they decay with fantastic bloom the forest smell like a hothouse but the smell have a unwholesome sourness growth run riot green thing shoot up choke each other and sink in ferment corruption kit do not know if it be a relief to escape from the glare of the clearing or not the sun no longer burn he but he could hardly breathe the humid air and effort be almost impossible all the same he push on flounder in muddy pool and sink in belt of mire the road have be make long since by slave labor when the spaniard rule and have fall into ruin like the country when they yoke be broken kit could trace the ancient causeway across the swamp and wonder when another strong race would put they stamp on the land the descendant of the conqueror have sink into apathetic sloth the blood of the dark-skinned people that run in they vein have quench the old castilian fire when the light be fading the porter declare the swamp in front be dangerous and put down they load and after some trouble the white man light a fire a heavy dew begin to drip from the leaf and the blaze be comforting in the gloom that swiftly settle down kit have bring a piece of tarpaulin and spread it between the root of a cottonwood he do not mean to go to sleep but he head ache and he be wear out by physical effort and anxious watch by and by he eye get heavy and he sink down in a corner of the great root the fire have burn low when he look up and a bright beam that touch a neighbor trunk indicate that the moon be high all be very quiet but for the splash of the fall dew the glade be a little brighter and rouse himself with a effort he glance about he see the white man 's figure stretch in ungainly attitude on a piece of old canvas they be all there but he could not see the _ meztiso _ get up he walk into the gloom and then stop with something of a shock there be nobody about for a few moment kit think hard to begin with he have be rash to pay half the porter ' wages before they start the money be a large sum for they and they have steal away perhaps because they be satisfied and afraid of meet the president 's soldier or perhaps to betray the party to the rebel for another reward if the latter supposition be correct kit think he run some risk galdar 's friend know he could not be bribe and that adam be ill although it be hardly possible they know he be dead they would see that kit have now control and since he help be valuable to the president might try to kill he he best plan be to push on he waken the sailor who grumble but pick up the coffin when he tersely explain the situation wet bush brush against they soak they thin clothes trailer catch they head and the road get wetter and rougher until they come to a creek kit could not tell how deep it be the forest be very dark and only a faint reflection mark the water we must get across boy he say and the other agree they be hard man but the dark and silence weigh they down and excited vague superstitious fear it be a gruesome business in which they be engage and they do not like they load they plunge in and one call out hoarsely when he stumble and the lurch coffin strike he head another gasp as if he be choke while he struggle to balance the pole the current rippled round they leg it be hard to pull they foot out of the mud and when there be a splash in the dark they stop drip with sweat that be not altogether cause by effort one swear at the other in a breathless voice shove on you slob he say the old man 's get heavier while you stop i want to dump he and be do with the job guess i have have enough splashing and stumble they go forward and when they struggle up the bank kit wipe he wet face for a moment or two he have think the man would drop they load and as it jolt vague and black on they shoulder the creaking of the pole have jar he nerve he be go to keep he promise but he sympathize with the man who have have enough after they leave the creek the road get very bad and in place vanish in belt of swamp they sink in mud and stagnant water and no light pierce the daunting gloom but it be not hard to keep the proper line because one could not enter the jungle without a cutlass to clear a path at length when the man be exhaust the tree get thinner and the moonlight shine through touch the front of a ruin build the rest be indistinct but the building be large and have evidently belong to a sugar or coffee planter the sailor stop and kit study a gap in the wall the gap do not look invite and there be no doubt snake and poisonous spider inside but he could go no farther and the broken wall offer some protection perhaps kit be move by a atavistic fear of the dark forest and he own that he be influence by the civilized man 's longing for the shelter of a house they go in and after put down the coffin in a room where vine crawl about the ruin wall the sailor enter the next one frankly state that they want to get away from the coffin kit could stop and watch it if he like but it bother they to have the thing about kit let they go and sit down in a corner among the rubbish light a cigar a moonbeam rest on the opposite wall and the room be not dark some light come in through hole although there be impenetrable gloom beyond the door by which the man have go he could see the wet leaf of the vine and the black coffin cover by the flag but he be not afraid of it the man who lay there have be he friend and claim the fulfilment of he promise at the same time it be soothing to hear the sailor ' voice until they get faint and stop afterwards the silence be burdensome although a small creature begin to rustle in the wall kit do not know if it be a snake or a spider and be too tired to feel disturbed by and by he cigar fall from he mouth he pick it up but it fall again and he head droop the moonbeam have move some distance when he open he eye and straighten he body with a jerk the room be nearly dark and when he think about it afterwards he imagine he be only half awake for he heart beat and he be conscious of a enervating fear a dark object indistinct but like a man stand beside the coffin with something of a effort kit recover he self-control as the figure turn and come towards he it move with a curious stealthy gait make no noise and this be enough for kit he have no grounds for distrust the sailor and they wear heavy boot try not to change he position he feel for he automatic pistol the butt catch a fold of he sash and he be force to bend he elbow in order to get it out it look as if he would be too late and he slip as the movement dislodge the rubbish on which he sit then as he shrink with a instinctive quiver from the prick of the knife the figure swerve and leap back kit throw up the pistol and pull the trigger there be a flash that dazzle he eye and a little smoke curl up but when he lean forward he antagonist have go he hear no movement when he spring to he foot and almost imagine he have be dream until the sailor shout and they boot rattle on the broken floor they run in and when kit tell they what have happen go to the hole in the wall the moonlight touch the front of the building and part of the road be bright but the shadow of the forest have creep across the rest all be very quiet there be no sound in the gloom then a flake of plaster fall close behind kit 's head and a sharp report roll across the tree one of the man shoot at a venture and two of he companion run savagely along the road until kit call they back come in he say when they return you be a plain mark in the moonlight and can not see the other fellow among the tree look as if it be you he want one reply well i guess we have no use for be leave without a boss and since we do not like we camping ground you have get to come with we we 'll draw cut for who be to watch kit go with they he feel shake for the man who have bring down the plaster be obviously a good shot he imagine it be another who have intend to stab he in fact a number of he enemy might be lurk about he be not as a rule vindictive but the stealthy attack have induce a dangerous mood and he be sorry he have miss the man it be hard to see why he have do so but he have perhaps be half asleep now however he resolve to watch until day break chapter xi kit keep he promise it be get light when the man on watch call kit who go to the gap in the wall thin mist drift about the tree and trail across the road there be some open ground in front of the building but behind this the forest loom in a blur shadowy mass i reckon i see something move where the fog 's on the road the man remark kit see nothing he eye be keen for he have search the hillside for sheep but it look as if they be not as keen as the sailor 's and standing in the shadow he watch the indicate spot after a minute or two a figure come out of the fog and signal with a lift hand more of they around say the sailor grimly there be trouble come to they if they mean to corral we jake 's at the side window and he have to get out of mobile because he be too handy with he gun not often have to pull mine but i can shoot some quit talk kit rejoin and he mouth set firm when the figure vanish he think the rebel mean to surround the building if so they be probably numerous and the rifle shoot some hour before justified the supposition they have first try to kill he quietly and find this impossible have resolve to seize the party well there be good cover behind the broken wall he man be a reckless lot and he mean to fight he wish the other would begin for stand highly-strung in the dew be nervous work the light have get clearer when he note a movement in a festoon of trail vine the wet leaf shake as if somebody be cautiously pull they back and kit stiffen he muscle it be a comfort to feel he hand be steady and although he have not use a pistol much he be a good shot with a gun he think he could send a bullet through the move leaf but want he lurk enemy to begin the fight a face appear at a opening and a arm push through the man be come out and kit feel he nerve tingle then as the fellow 's body follow he arm the sailor say quietly do not move boss i 'll fix he next moment kit swing round for the man who step out into the road wear a white uniform the sailor lean against the wall to steady he aim and he tense pose and rigid hand indicate that he be press the trigger hold on kit shout do not shoot the sailor lower he pistol and kit spring out of the shadow wave he hat come forward we be friend the _ rural _ turn and call to somebody and then join kit glance at the sailor 's pistol with a dry smile it look as if i have run some risk you do not mean to be surprise no say kit one take precaution i come very near be surprise last night so the _ galdarero _ be about we suspect something like this i suppose it be why you mean to search the _ hacienda _ but do you see we the _ rural _ indicate a plume of smoke that curl up from behind the ruin wall we see _ that _ when one take precaution it be prudent to see they be complete kit nod there be no use in get angry he man be rash and careless but to some extent this be why he have choose they they have no doubt light the fire to cook breakfast where be you companion he ask there be three of we you will see the other in a few moment they watch the road farther on it be usual for we to patrol in two but of late some have not return a revolution be a bad time for _ rurale _ one pay old reckoning then kit smile i imagine it would have be bad for any _ galdarero _ who have try to steal away down the road but i expect you know I we have order about you seor you see a servant of yours the _ rural _ answer with a bow but it might be better if you tell we you plan after give he a cigarette kit send the sailor to tell the other and when the _ rurale _ come up offer they a share of the breakfast he man have cook while they eat he tell they what have bring he there and where he be go so the american be dead i have see he at the presidio one remark well seor it would be prudent to finish you business at salina to-night after that i do not know there have be fight and some of the president 's soldier have be kill in the swamp i must finish the business kit reply it do not matter what happen afterwards the _ rural _ nod the american talk like that quick and short but what he say go however we will go to salina with you when you be ready kit get up and give he man a order i be ready now they set off soon afterwards and reach the mission as the light be fading two small mud building and a little church stand among some ruin in a opening and a frail old man meet the party at the gate he take off he hat when the sailor put down the coffin and then listen to kit 's quiet narrative this poor place be yours it be a prosperous mission long since he say in this country man no longer build but plot and destroy -- it be easier than the other now we will put the coffin in the church and then i will give you food father herman draw back a old leather curtain and the smell of incense meet kit as he stand at the door while the sailor go forward with they load the church be nearly dark but kit see it have some beauty and there be object that hint at more prosperous day at the other end a ruby lamp glimmer and a wax candle burn with a clear flame before a statue of the virgin kit know whence the candle come and that hattie askew have kneel on the stone beneath it pray that she husband might get well then he look at father herman with a doubt in he mind the other meet he glance and smile the greatest of these be charity he say in latin and resume in fine castilian : he be we benefactor a man who keep he word and with such a wife i think we faith be he it be a gracious sentiment that they should not be part in a sense kit say quietly i think they have not be part yet at the last he say with confidence he be go to meet he wife who know say father herman there be much that be dark but one feel that he spirit reach out after hers well i know he would come back i have long expect he he go forward and light more candle when the sailor put down the coffin and the noise they boot make jarred kit 's nerve as they come back the light spread touch the bare wall and tawdry decoration about the shrine it be a poor little church fall into ruin and the beauty its pious builder have give it be vanish yet something redeem it from be commonplace and kit feel a strange emotional stir as he eye rest on the dim ruby lamp and the rude black coffin he think the light of love could not be quench and know the tender romance that have burn in the heart of the old buccaneer it be with something of a effort he turn away and follow father herman across the corral two hour later red torch flare in the dark as they lay adam in he grave and kit worn by anxiety and physical strain listen dully to the solemn latin office then when the old priest 's voice die away he go back to the mission where he fall asleep and sleep twelve hour in the morning he sit beneath a broken arch that have once form part of a cloister outside the patch of shadow the sun beat upon dazzling sand and a few vivid green palm-frond hang over a ruin wall beyond this the forest rise dark and forbid against the glaring sky although the rest have refresh kit he feel as if he have get older in the last few day and now the strain have slacken he be lonely so far he have obey order and when doubtful look to adam for a lead but adam have go and leave he control all that belong to he youth have vanish he be a man with a man 's responsibility and a man 's problem to solve presently father herman come up and sit down opposite although he look feeble he glance be clear and kind this house be yours seor and i be you servant he say yet i can not hope that you will remain long and the time be disturb if i can help -- since the rebel know i be here it would not be safe to stay but i can not reach salina point before the steamer sail kit reply i must get to havana as soon as possible father herman think for a few minute and then resume : a small schooner be load at a beach not far off and i know the _ patron _ he would take you to arena where the president have supporter and you might get a ship i think he sail to-night but i will send a message kit thank he and go on : you be my uncle 's friend and now i have take he place you be mine as you let he send you thing the mission need perhaps you will not refuse I i have not hope for this father herman answer with a grateful look the generous gift mean much to we for we be very poor friendship have privilege besides it be my uncle 's wish and will be something i can do for he sake father herman 's worn face get very soft and he give kit a approve glance you be he kinsman seor one can not doubt that like he you be staunch and do not forget but in some way you be different i will take you gift and pray that yours may be a less stormy life thank you kit say gently and go off to look after he man in the afternoon he leave the mission and a week later reach havana where he find a cablegram wait he get a shock when he open it and stand for a time with the message crumple in he hand for it tell he that peter askew be die at ashness then he sit down on the long arcaded veranda of the hotel with a poignant sense of loss for the last blow be heavier than the first it would be too late when he get home andrew he english relative would not have send the message have there be any hope after a time kit begin to pull himself together he feel dull and half stunned but see that he must brace up although one duty be deny he another be leave he could not bid he father good-by but he could keep he promise to adam and there be much to be do get up with a resolute movement he go to the telegraph office although peter have not hint that he be ill kit feel he ought to have go home before and now blame alvarez for keep he he know this be not logical but he hate the country with its turmoil and plot it be not worth help and in very truth he do not know if by support the president he be help it or not after all however this be not important alvarez need a last supply of munitions that adam have agree to send kit doubt if they would be pay for but the doubt do not count for much adam know the risk when he agree and he engagement bind he nephew the goods must be deliver and then kit would let the business go when he reach the office he write a cablegram to andrew at ashness and another to mayne who have leave havana before kit arrive chapter xii the last cargo dusk be fall and kit urge he tired mule up the wind road he skin be grime with dust for he have ride hard in scorching heat and be anxious and impatient to get on the _ rio negro _ be in the lagoon and some cargo have be land but kit stop the work when nobody come to take the goods it look as if the message he have send through a secret channel have not reach the president and this be ominous he have hear rumor of fight when he be in cuba and the united state but the newspaper give he little information and he have drive the _ rio negro _ across at full speed in order to finish the contract before the revolution spread which be all he want adam 's staunch loyalty have cost he he life but the president have no claim on kit besides he stop in the country have keep he away from ashness when he be need there he smile as he admit that he be hardly logical since he be stubbornly push on when almost exhaust in order that alvarez might get the goods he require but after all this be for adam 's sake as he ride up the hill the sky get brighter and a flickering illumination be reflect on the cloud that hang about the mountain it look as if the town be light up and kit wonder whether this be to celebrate a victory he strike the mule but the tired animal come near throw he when it stumble and he let it choose its pace the jolt have shake he and he be very tired for a time he skirt a belt of tree and when he come out on the open hillside the illumination be ominously bright now he be get nearer the cloud look different from the mist that roll down the mountain in the evening they be dark and trail away from the range still he could go no faster and he wait with grow anxiety until he reach a narrow tableland it command a wider view and he raise himself in the stirrup as he see that the light be the reflection of a large fire he sink back and pull up the mule let the bridle fall on its droop neck it look as if a number of house be burn in the town which indicate that there have be a fight the trouble be he do not know who have win and this be important if the president be badly beat he would not need the supplies at the lagoon although they might be useful to the rebel kit imagine it would be prudent to turn back but he must find out what have happen and send the mule forward half a hour afterwards he ride into the town the small square house be dark and there be nobody in the narrow street but he hear a confused uproar farther on although the glare in the sky be fainter it leap up now and then and a cloud of smoke float across the roof a red glow shine down the next street and he see the pavement be tear up break furniture lay among pile of stone the wall be chip and when kit get down he have some trouble to lead the mule across the ruin barricade although he see nobody yet the shout that come from the neighborhood of the presidio be ominous kit remount and ride slowly up to the edge of the sandy square where the palm grow along the rail the square be occupy by a excited crowd but the presidio have go a great pile of smoking rubbish and a wall break by wide crack mark where it have stand flame play about the ruin and kit turn he mule he think the crowd be wait to search for plunder and do not expect to find anybody calm enough to answer he question besides he need food and drink and might learn what have happen at the caf the small table stretch across the street and be all occupy but when kit have tie the mule to the alameda railing opposite he find a chair and order a omelette and wine the waiter look at he with some surprise and kit wonder whether it be prudent for he to stay you have be burn the presidio he remark we have get rid of a tyrant the waiter reply you may get another worse say kit as coolly as he could what happen to the president somebody shout _ mozo _ and when the waiter go away kit rest he arm on the table he be very tired and it be obvious that he have come too late since the president be overthrow he have lose a large sum of money and waste the effort he have make to carry out adam 's engagement he must get back to the lagoon as soon as possible but he need food and want to find out if alvarez have escape there be however some risk in ask question because the caf seem to be occupy by triumphant rebel presently the man at the next table get up and they place be take by another group among which kit note francisca sarmiento and she relation he think they look surprised but they salute he politely and soon afterwards the girl who be nearest look round you have courage seor she remark in a meaning tone i do not know if courage be need kit reply force a smile it look as if i could no longer meddle with politics then since you could not help alvarez why do you come i imagine i could help he until i see the presidio be burnt kit reply in fact i have not find out what have happen yet the girl study he with some curiosity but kit feel that he have nothing to fear from she if one do not know that you be incorruptible one could understand you rashness she say in a mock tone i suppose you steamer be in the lagoon kit look round the caf be crowd but the people be talk excitedly and nobody seem to notice he and the girl the noise would prevent they talk be hear there be no use in deny it because galdar 's spy have no doubt see she i would be glad if you can tell I what have become of the president francisca give he a keen glance you do not know alvarez be dead ah say kit i do not know be he kill he die soon after the fighting begin the doctor say it be apoplexy he have be hurry about in the burning sun i wonder -- he be a strong man and use to the sun francisca smile one do not ask question at a time like this it be prudent to believe what one be tell when the soldier lose they leader they run away kit be silent for a few minute he have have a faint hope that the president might rally he supporter and begin the fight again but the hope be go he know all he want and must leave the town as soon as he have have some food alvarez be a friend of mine and the news you have give I be something of a shock he say i think the country will feel its loss but that be not my business and since there be nothing to keep I here i shall be glad to get away it would be prudent to go soon francisca remark in a low voice i do not see why i be no longer important enough for you friend to meddle with I you be very modest seor if you be not rather dull you have goods that would be useful to the new president who have a rival he do not expect don felix muez have turn traitor and there be people who support he in the coast province another president kit exclaim with a soft laugh and then bow to the girl i think you mean well you have give I a useful hint and you have my thanks i will be rash and tell you that galdar shall not have the goods i bring franciscan eye get soft and a touch of color creep into she olive skin one do not often meet a man who put honor before money _ adio seor _ i wish you well then she turn to she companion who presently leave the table and soon afterwards kit 's omelette be bring while he eat olsen come in and sit down opposite light a cigarette you 'll allow that the buccaneer back the wrong man he say i warn you and reckon you obstinacy have cost you something that be so kit agree one must run risk in a business like this but i do not expect you to sympathize olsen smile i do not pretend i be not satisfied but i can show you how to get some of you money back i have learn much about you and askew since we have we last talk and be willing to buy part of the _ rio negro 's _ cargo you seem to know she have arrive oh yes i know some hour since i have be look out for you to whom do you mean to sell the goods kit ask do that matter yes it be rather important the important thing be you 'll get pay olsen rejoin kit frown he imagine he could demand a high price and now alvarez be dead there be perhaps no reason for refuse to bargain but he do not mean to let galdar have the goods he think adam would not have do so and he hold the new president to some extent accountable for adam 's last illness the cargo be not for sale he say oh shuck olsen exclaim i reckon you want to put up the price no say kit rather grimly i do not want to sell do not be a fool the man you back be dead you carry out you contract and it do not matter to he now who get the truck that be true kit reply but i will not help he rival olsen look hard at he and see he be resolute oh well if you be determine there be no use in argue you be something of a curiosity i have not meet a man like you before he go away and kit order more wine for he be thirsty after he long ride and have bear some strain he have to wait for the wine but have expect this since the caf be crowd and in the meantime he get up and look across the street nobody have meddle with the mule which stand quietly by the railing with drooping head kit wonder where he could get it some food and if he could hire a fresh animal then a waiter bring the wine and when he have drunk some and light a cigarette kit listen to the talk of the man at the next table get a hint that throw some light on olsen 's offer alvarez have use the vault under the presidio for a munition store and when he be dead the mayor-domo have blow up the building as the rebel force they way in now there be a new president in the field it be obvious why galdar want fresh supplies this however be not important and kit drain he glass and then try to rouse himself he must look after the mule and if it be not fit for the journey get another animal he feel strangely reluctant to move the fatigue he have for a time shake off return with puzzling suddenness and threaten to overpower he he head be very heavy he could hardly hear the people talk and every now and then he eye shut he could not keep they open but after a few minute he straighten he bent shoulder with a resolute jerk and clench he fist it be not fatigue that be master he the wine be drug he have not note a suspicious taste but he be thirsty and the omelette be strongly flavor with garlic and red pepper hold himself stiffly upright he try to think olsen have no doubt order the wine to be drug and he object be plain he mean to prevent kit reach the lagoon until he have remove the cargo on the beach and try to persuade mayne to land the rest well the plot would fail and with a effort kit get up and cross the street he suspect that he be watch but nobody try to stop he and he mount the mule the animal move off at a better pace than he have hope and he try to brace himself he head ache and he brain be very dull but somehow he stick to the saddle and although he could hardly guide the mule the animal avoid the people in its way after a time the street become empty the noise behind be fainter and the house be dark nobody seem to follow he and kit begin to hope he might be able to leave the town he do not know what he would do then and hardly imagine he could keep up the effort much longer perhaps when he get away from the house he could tie up the mule in a quiet place and rest when he ride down a rough track into open country he rock in the saddle and would have fall but for the high peak and big stirrup the hillside be blur distorted object that he think be rock and cactus lurch about in the elusive moonlight and the sweat run down he face as he fight against the drug he know it would conquer he but he be go on as long as possible at length the mule step into a hole kit 's foot come out of the stirrup and he fall for a moment or two the mule drag he along then he get he other foot loose and for a time know nothing more the moonlight be fading when he open he eye and see that he be lie beside a clump of cactus indistinct object move along the road not far off and he hear the click of hoof on stone a mule train be pass and be no doubt go to the lagoon he could not get up and be glad he be in dark shadow the muleteer have probably be tell to look out for he and a blow from a heavy stone would prevent he interfere with the rebel ' plan the indistinct figure however go on and kit relapse into unconsciousness it be daylight when he waken and see a man bend over he kit be cold and wet with dew he head ache horribly and he do not try to get up he pistol be underneath he and if the fellow mean to kill he he could not resist what do you want he ask the man say he have see he lie there and imagine he be ill then he hold out he hand and ask if kit could get up kit be surprise when he find himself on he foot although he sway as he try to keep he balance i suppose you be a liberator he say dully the other clench he dark fist no seor those dog the _ galdarero _ be no friend of mine but you be for the president it be know in the town kit admit it the fellow 's scornful denial be comforting and after some talk walk with a painful effort he go with he down the hill to a small mud house a few minute after he get there he go to sleep but in the meantime the man have promise to help he to reach the lagoon he keep he promise and before it be light next morning kit dismount on the sandy beach there be no moon and mist drift about the tree but the water shone faintly and the tide be nearly full the steamer loom in the gloom and when kit shout there be a rattle of pulley block and a splash of oar ten minute afterwards mayne meet he at the gangway and give he he hand it be some relief to see you back he say finlay have he fire bank and can get steam to take we out in a hour or two kit go with he to he room and sit down limply he be cover with dust and wet with dew he face be haggard and he eye be dull i 'll tell you about my adventure later he say what about the cargo some dago come along with a mule train and load up part of the truck on the beach they have a order that look as if it have be sign by you and as they be a pretty tough crowd and have they knife loose i let they take the goods when i study the order i be not sure about the hand and bring off all they have leave by and by another gang come along but i refuse to send a boat until i would see you you be prudent kit remark the order be forge let I see the mate 's cargo-list he study the book mayne give he and then ponder olsen have no doubt forge the order and kit imagine he would have some trouble to get payment for the goods the manufacturer might be persuade to take back the rest of the cargo at something less than its proper price but kit think the value of the munitions supply to alvarez would be lose the new president would certainly try to disown the debt kit however have know that adam 's staunchness might cost he much and something might perhaps be save he have have enough of the country and as soon as he could straighten out the tangle in which the revolution have involve adam 's business he be go back to ashness heave you anchor when you be ready he say to mayne we 'll call at havana and then steam for new orlean at high-water he stand on the bridge watch the mangrove fade into the mist ahead the sun be rise out of a smooth sea the air be fresh and kit 's heart be lighter he have do with plot and intrigue and be go back to ashness and the quiet hill at the same time he feel a tender melancholy as he think about the little church at salina and the marble cross in the sandy yard then he lift he head and the melancholy vanish as he look across the sparkling water the clang of engine rise and fall with a measure beat and there be a noisy splashing at the bow bright streak of foam eddy about the _ rio negro 's _ side and a long smoke cloud trail astern as she steam to the north part iii -- kit 's return chapter i kit 's welcome kit be comfortably tire when he sit down by the beck at the head of the dale he have be at ashness for a week and find much to be do have occupy himself with characteristic energy it be a relief to feel that the heat of the tropics have not relax he muscle as much as he have think and that the languidness he have sometimes fight against be vanish before the brace wind that sweep he native hill the ache in he arm have come from use the drain spade and he knee be stiff after a long walk through the heather to examine the herdwick sheep he vigor be come back and he be conscious of a keen but tranquil satisfaction with the quiet dale fill he pipe lazily he look about the sun be near the summit of the fell and the long slope be turn gray in the shadow the yellow light touch the other side of the valley and the narrow bottom through which shine water run be a belt of cool dark-green a faint bleating of sheep come down the hill and the beck splash softly among the stone kit find the quiet soothing he have have enough excitement and adventure and have half-consciously recognize that the life he have lead in the tropics be not for he on the whole he think he have make good one do one 's best at the work one find but intrigue be not he proper job for all that he do not mean to philosophize and have something to think about when he sell the _ rio negro _ and pay he debt he find a larger surplus than he have hope moreover he agent have not yet enforce all business claim and might be able to send he a fresh sum the money he bring home would not have make he a rich man in america but it would go a long way in the dale and the soil and flock at ashness could be improve by modern method and carefully spend capital kit have begin at once and find he task engross but when the day 's work be over he feel a gentle melancholy and a sense of loneliness adam and peter have go and he have love they both he know he would not meet they like again yet he have not lose they altogether they have so to speak blaze the trail for he and he must try to follow fronting obstacle with they fearless calm then he take he pipe from he mouth and he heart beat as a figure come round a bend of the road the girl be some distance off and he could not see she face but he know she and brace himself he have know the meeting must come and much depend on she attitude grace be no longer a romantic girl and though he have not forget she she might have be persuade that she have nothing to do with he now she must choose she line and he sit still half prepared for she to pass he with a bow while he wait he dog get up and run along the road old bob know grace and it look as if she have speak to and perhaps pet he while he master be away she stop and kit feel ashamed when he get up for she give he she hand with a friendly look and he see she have not change as much as he have think the proud calm he approve be perhaps more marked but he imagine the generous rashness he have like as well still lurk beneath the surface he have meet attractive girl in the tropics who know they be beautiful and add by art to they physical charm grace however use hers unconsciously he think she be too proud to care if she have such charm or not i be glad to see you back she say and stroke the dog that leap upon she bob and i be friend he know I when i come round the corner so do i kit rejoin quietly he think he note a touch of color in she face but she smile you do not get up perhaps you be not sure like bob i think i be sure but i have be away some time and it be not my part to force you to acknowledge I if i do not want to grace suggest well i do not forget my friend and now if you be satisfied we can let that go she pause and resume when he go on with she : the dalesfolk have miss you particularly since you father die it must have be a shock -- i feel it too because i see he now and then we be friend in spite of all kit be grateful for she frank sympathy and feel he could talk to she about he father he do not tell I this but he like you he be just grace reply people know and trust he he have none of the rancor that often lead we wrong when he be firm he do not get angry that kind of attitude be hard but it make thing easier but you be in america with he brother be you not i be in the united state and afterwards in some of the country on the caribbean ah say grace with curiosity that must have be interesting one understand that be a beautiful and romantic coast with its memory of the great elizabethan sailor and the pirate it be romantic and dangerous in part you can land at some of the town from modern mail-boat and find smart shop and cafs other have fall into ruin and lie half-hidden by the forest beside malaria-haunted lagoon you steal in through the mist at the top of a high tide much as the old pirate do and when you land find hint of a vanish civilization and the spaniard ' broken power but you seem to know something about the coast grace smile you look surprised there be a library at tarnside although it be not often use and we have book about the voyage of the buccaneer one book be rather fascinating but what be you do in the lagoon sometimes we load dyewood and rubber sometimes we lend money to ambitious politician in return for unlawful trading privilege and now and then engage in business that be something like that of the old adventurer after that you must find the dale very tame grace remark and quietly study kit she have like he honesty and resolution before he go abroad but he have gain something she have not note then although he wear rough work clothes and have obviously be digging he have a elusive touch of distinction and there be a hint of command in he quiet look he have see the world confront danger and use power and this have put a stamp on he it be hard to imagine you a pirate she remark with a twinkle you do not look the part and no doubt like other occupation it require some study kit laugh one do the best one can i rather think take trouble and a determination to make good be as useful as specialize training perhaps that be true it be curious in a way but i expect a good farmer for example might make a successful buccaneer one understand though that the last pirate be hang a hundred year since there be a few left although they method have change with the time some day i would like to tell you about my uncle he be so to speak a survival and i think you would appreciate he but how have thing be go in the dale grace 's twinkle vanish she look become serious and kit think he note sign of strain after all she have change since he leave ashness it be not that she look older although she be now a rather stately woman and not a impulsive girl he feel that she have know care on the whole she say thing have not go very well we have have wet summer and heavy snow in spring the flock be poor and rent have come down bell have go he quarrel with haye about some new machinery for the mill all be much the same at tarnside though my father be not so active gerald leave woolwich -- perhaps you know -- and be in a london bank kit hide he surprise gerald be not the stuff of which good bank clerk be make although osborn 's influence with the local manager have no doubt get he the post kit imagine the lad have be force to leave woolwich but money must be scarce at tarnside since he have go into business this throw some light on the hint of weariness he have note about grace if fresh economy be needful she and mr osborn must carry the load haye be still you agent i meet he yesterday and he give I a sour nod kit remark yes say grace and add quietly : i sometimes wish he be not well i never like the man all the same he be a very good agent from the landlord 's point of view and you father 's interest ought to be safe with he i suppose so grace agree but she look be doubtful and they reach the ashness lonn a few minute later when kit stop she give he she hand i hear you be go to make a number of improvement and wish you good luck kit go up the lonning and sit down in the porch light he pipe grace have not forget she have give he he real welcome home and he thrill as he think about she quiet friendliness perhaps the meeting be awkward for she but she have strike the right note with the dignified simplicity he have expect it say something for she pluck that she have meet he as if the interview at ashness when osborn have drive he away have never take place all this be comforting but kit be vaguely disturb on she account he have note a hint of anxiety and she have imply that thing be not go well for the osborn he mean to marry grace he longing for she be keener than he have feel it yet but it be not altogether selfish she must be remove from surroundings in which she could not thrive tarnside with its rash extravagance pretense and stern private economy be not the place for she but he feel he must be patient and cautious there be numerous obstacle in he way in the meantime grace meet thorn farther along the road and try to hide she annoyance as he advance perhaps it be the contrast between he and kit whose thin brown face have a half-ascetic look for alan be fat and get coarse grace have note this before but not so plainly as she do now he manners be urbane and he belong to she circle to some extent he code be hers and she have he prejudice and taste all the same she do not like he for one thing he be a type she father approve a man of local importance and strictly local idea and osborn have force she into rebellion alan manage the otter hound well and know much about farm but he be satisfy with this although he belong to a smart london club grace imagine he only go there because he think he ought yet he be cunning and patient and know why he bear with osborn she be sometimes afraid be that askew he inquire when he turn and go on with she grace say it be and he give she a careless look i hear he have come back might have be better if he have stay away a fellow like that be rather disturbing i do not think he could do much harm when you and haye be on you guard grace rejoin that be so thorn agreed and she could not tell if he know she have mean to be ironical anyhow i do not suppose he want to do much harm i be think about he example be it a dangerous example to improve one 's land i think you advocate scientific farming so i do i do not mean that although i do not know if askew 's farming be scientific or not one can not judge yet he independence and habit of take he own line might be dangerous mr askew 's independence be justified ashness be he yes say thorn thoughtfully that be the trouble if he be a farm tenant thing would be easier grace laugh you be delightfully nave i be afraid you 'll have to leave mr askew alone but i do not expect he 'll do anything alarming i think you know he be a friend of mine i know he be before he go abroad if you have renew the friendship it mean you be satisfied about he and perhaps we need not be disturbed you judgment be generally sound thank you say grace i have relation who would not agree but why do you dislike people who take they own line it would be awkward if one 's tenant do so but perhaps my feeling spring from envy the rest of we can not do what we want you can not for example grace give he a keen glance and then laugh on the whole that be true we have a number of rule at tarnside but one now and then get some satisfaction from break they rebellion do not pay thorn rejoin with a touch of dry humor you be young and adventurous but you 'll find it prudent so to speak to accept you environment and submit some people call submission duty but that be really cant they mean it save they trouble anyhow you can not make you own code when you be bear at a place like tarnside it be make for you ah say grace i wonder -- well you know i be sometimes rash then she be careful to talk about something else for she think alan have not philosophize without a object and it be not difficult to see where he hint lead when they reach the lodge she firmly send he away although he look as if he want to come to the house chapter ii a dangerous talent dinner be nearly over at tarnside the meal be serve with some ceremony although the bill of fare be frugal except when game could be shoot and as a rule nobody but osborn talk much now he have satisfy he appetite he look about the spacious room the handsome molded ceiling be dark from neglect and the cornice be stain by damp the light of the setting sun stream in through the long casement window which command the shine tarn and the wood that melt into shadow at the mouth of the dale it be a noble view but it do not hold osborn 's eye for the quiver sunbeam search out the fade spot on the curtain and the worn patch on the rug on the polished floor we need a number of new thing and i do not know how they be to be get he remark and when mr osborn say nothing knit he brow he have put away some money for renovation but it have go one could not keep money at tarnside it vanish and leave nothing to show how it have be spend i understand young askew be back at ashness he resume look hard at grace yes say grace i meet he not long since osborn frown he know she have meet kit but do not know if he like she candor the girl be independent but he think she now understand the responsibility of she rank the fellow be obviously prosperous since he be spend a large sum on drain i see a big stack of pipe and a number of man at work my opinion be it be a ridiculous waste of money perhaps there be worse extravagance grace rejoin i expect he have some hope of get he money back by grow better crop ours go and never return mrs osborn give she a warning glance osborn hate contradiction and grace and he often jar but the girl smile father and i be not go to quarrel about mr askew 's farm it be not worth while she say and study osborn with half-penitent sympathy the strong light touch he face force up the deep line and wrinkle and she think he be get older fast he eye be dull and he shoulder be slightly bent she know about some of he trouble and suspect other but the stamp of indulgence that have get plainer in the last year or two disturbed she the askew seem fate to give I trouble he go on now the fellow have begin to drain he neighbor will expect I to do so in fact black and pattinson bother haye about some plan for buy pipe when they pay they rent besides the contrast hurt i do not see why a fellow like askew should be able to waste money on rash experiment when we have not enough however this lead to another matter gerald come back tomorrow and will no doubt grumble about he poverty if he do you must give he nothing he have he pay and i make he a allowance i will not have he extravagance encourage grace smile as mr osborn get up with a disturbed look mother can not have much to give and i have nothing at all i be afraid gerald 's talent for beg will be use in vain she go out with mr osborn and when they have go osborn cross the floor to the sideboard fill he glass to the top this be he regular habit and its futility escape he although he know he wife and daughter know he feel he do enough if he exercise some self-denial when they be about in the meantime mr osborn sit down on the terrace and look across the untidy lawn we need a new pony mower jenkin can not keep the grass in order with the small machine he be very obstinate about the bedding plant he want to buy and the border look thin but i feel i must be firm she say and add drearily : i wonder when we shall be force to get a sport tenant and live in a smaller house father would not leave tarnside i suppose you do not know how thing be really go i know they be not go well and suspect they get worse but he will not tell I one could help if one do know i be afraid i have disappoint father and give you anxiety you need not have have grace reply with some bitterness after all however the fault be hardly mine i want to make my own career but be not allow to work at a useful occupation would somehow have humiliate we ridiculous pride and there be of course only one hope leave for you she pause and color as she resume : well although i be not sorry it look as if that hope have go it would have be a relief if you have make a good marriage mr osborn admit still since you meet nobody you like -- the man i might perhaps have like be poor father would no doubt think it my natural perversity or we bad luck but i do not believe in luck it be a excuse for weak makeshift and futility one can conquer bad fortune if one be resolute none of we except you have much resolution mr osborn remark and sigh so far you firmness have not help much i imagine you know you father have not give up hope yes say grace rather harshly i do know and that be why i be often impatient he will not be persuade the thing 's impossible after all alan have some advantage he have many drawback grace rejoin and then she face soften and she give she mother a appealing look i think you be on my side i be on you side where you feel strongly perhaps i be reserve and you do not often give I you confidence i be sorry we be seldom quite honest at tarnside somehow one can not be oneself but now we must be frank i do not like alan thorn i never like he it be impossible then my dear there be no more to be say grace make a sign of disagreement there may be much that be why i be disturbed you and i do not count mother we be expect to submit it be not that i do not like alan i shrink from he he be cunning and know how to wait sometimes he patience frighten I but why should he patience frighten you oh say grace can not you understand you know father 's habit and that gerald be follow he you know we debt be mount up and this can not go on some day we may be ruin and then i think alan will seize he chance perhaps i be imaginative -- but such thing happen mr osborn put she hand on the girl 's arm and she touch be unusually firm you may be alarm for nothing my dear but if the time should come when my help be really need it will be yours grace kiss she i can trust you i be weak -- i be sometimes a coward -- but now i be comfort they be silent for a few minute and then mr osborn look up be it prudent for you to meet christopher askew again grace color but meet she mother 's glance and answer with a thoughtful calm i see no danger i like kit before he go away but we friendship be really not romantic when father meet we in redmire wood a horribly silly impulse make I hide i blush when i think about it and imagine i forget i have grow up -- gerald and i use to hide when father be angry anyhow i make kit askew hide and he be first to remember and step into the road but this happen long since and he be older yes say grace he be different although one feel that he have keep a promise make in he half-developed stage he have be out in the world and do strenuous thing while i stay at home and play at make-believe he talk like a man who know he value and there be a touch of distinction in he look a stupid word but it come near what i mean mr osborn glance at she sharply but grace smile do not be disturbed mother i be try to tell you all i think we be friend but i imagine kit know he drawback from we point of view besides after father quarrel with peter askew i never send kit a message and he must have think i acquiesce in a way i do acquiesce it be the best thing to be do you see what this imply if i have love he it mean i have no pluck and be ashamed to acknowledge a farmer 's son but he know i do not love he and understand that we friendship would not bear the strain of father 's disapproval either way it hint that i be weak and not worth pursue well he meet I without embarrassment and we talk about nothing important i may meet he now and then but that i think be all very well say mr osborn who look relieved perhaps it would be prudent not to meet he often grace smile and be silent for a time she have try to be frank and think she have state thing correctly -- so far as she know then she remember kit 's look when she stop and speak and begin to wonder perhaps she have not tell all and the little she have leave out be important by and by she get up and go into the house gerald osborn come home next day and not long afterwards kit find he lie on the gravel beside a tarn on the ashness moor heavy rain have fall but the cloud have roll away and the water shone with dazzling light the sky be clear except for a bank of mist float about the round top of a fell and a swollen beck sparkle among the heather the wind have drop and it be very hot when he hear kit 's step gerald look up he be a handsome young man with some charm of manner although it be obvious now and then that he have inherit a touch of he father 's pride he glance be keen and intelligent but he mouth and chin be weak gerald have talent but be very like osborn since he be sometimes rashly obstinate and sometimes vacillate hallo he say i expect i ought to have ask you leave before i come to fish i hope you do not mind i do not mind nobody ask my leave kit reply have you have much luck gerald open he creel and show he a number of small dark-colored trout pretty good they rise well until the light get strong then i think i would take a rest will you smoke a cigarette kit sit down and look across the shine water at the silver bent-grass that gleam among vivid green moss on the side of the hill you must find this a pleasant change from town be you stay long a fortnight that be all i get i wish i could stop for good it be rot to spend one 's life work in a bank i suppose one must work at something kit remark i do not see why unless you be force the only object for work be when you must work to live and it be not mine because i can not live on my pay in fact the futility of the thing be plain kit laugh gerald 's humorous candor be part of he charm but kit think it deceptive why do you go to the bank then because my father think i ought i expect you know he believe in the firm hand i want to stop at tarnside which would have cost he less besides i could have look after the estate it will be mine sometime that be as much as be leave but haye transact the business just so say gerald rather dryly what do you think about haye he be you father 's agent and have nothing to do with I i imagine he be a capable manager i sometimes think he be too capable gerald rejoin kit let this go before he go away he have suspect that haye have plan he employer would not approve and he know gerald be shrewd it be however not he business and he remark : you want to go to woolwich do not you i do not gerald declare as a matter of fact i say so but my objection do not count i might have make a good farmer or land-steward but a number of we have be soldier and that be enough i do not know if it be a logical argument but i have to go and on the whole it be a relief when they turn I out too many regulation for my independent taste rule be good perhaps so long as they be make for somebody else he be silent for a few minute and kit muse he think there be some bitterness in gerald 's humor it look as if osborn have not be wise when he plan he son 's career without consult he this however be typical osborn be satisfy to give order and expect other to accept he point of view well say gerald get up i must be off rather a bear to walk to tarnside and the trout will probably rise again if there be wind enough to make a ripple but i forget to ask for sandwich if you lunch with I you could come back afterwards kit suggest and they set off down the hill when they reach ashness gerald try to hide he surprise kit have make some change in the old house and so far keep to the spanish rule of meal lunch be a late breakfast well serve in china and silver that be seldom use in peter askew 's time the low room have be cleverly paint and a casement command a view of the dale replace the original narrow window specimen of ancient indian pottery stand on the sideboard and there be curtain of embroidered silk feather-flower and silverwork that kit have bring from spanish america the thing give the lonely farmstead a exotic touch but they imply the command of money and cultivate taste you have a beautiful room gerald remark when the meal be over do not know that i be much of a connoisseur but some of the thing look rather fine i 'll show they to you presently kit reply and give gerald a small dark cigar i wonder how you 'll like the flavor we club cigar be dear and good but the best be nothing like this gerald declare after a minute or two where do they come from they be give I in cuba i believe the make be not offer for public sale in a general way cuban tobacco be not what it be but there be belt of soil that grow a leaf that can not be equal anywhere else i suppose they keep the crop for president and dictator the quality indicate it gerald suggest and kit smile gerald taste he black coffee if it be not bad form where do you get this there be nothing of the kind in cumberland and it be better than the turkish they give you in london it come from a costa rican _ hacienda _ and be a gift i 'll get no more when the bag be do if you come back in a month you 'll find I live in plain north-country style i imagine you make up for that while you be away say gerald who rise and go to the side-board a curious little jar and obviously old be this the kind of thing the aztec make i rather think it be aztec though i do not buy it in mexico i give about a pound for the jar and find a gold onza inside a _ onza _ oh yes a ounce the kind of coin some country mint but very seldom use something of a bargain i suppose it be kit reply incautiously for all that the onza be not mine and in a sense my effort to find the owner cost I a very large sum gerald give he a keen glance askew be not boast he have enjoy the command of money well he say i think i would have keep the onza whether it be mine or not he pause and pull a knife from its sheath the handle be ornamented and the narrow blade glitter in the light although its point be dull but what be this have it a story take care say kit it may be poison the _ meztiso _ use a stuff that will kill you if a very small quantity get into you blood the fellow who own that knife come near bury it in my back it look as if you have have some adventure gerald remark and lean against the sideboard he light a cigarette kit cross the floor and stand by the open window the shadow of a cloud rest motionless a patch of cool neutral color on the gleaming yellow side of the hill a wild-cherry tree hang over a neighbor wall and bee hum drowsily among the flower he be strangely satisfy to be at home and it be hard to realize that not long since he have be engage in a dangerous trade among the fever-haunted swamp have you any more curiosity gerald ask kit open a drawer in he big desk where he keep specimen of featherwork as he take they out he move some document and gerald indicate one _ cristoval askew _ you name in castilian i suppose you write a curious hand a matter of precaution anyhow i do not sign this order and that be why i keep it the thing be rather important and we be lucky to find out the cheat in time particularly as i imagine nobody could imitate my hand you 'll see my proper signature on the next document it be not a very good counterfeit say gerald who compare the write with the other this be a subject i know something about penmanship be one of my few talent and i keep the customer ' signature book at the bank yours be a uncommon hand but it could be forge let 's see may i use this paper kit nod and gerald knit he brow write the name three or four time and then look up i think i have get it hard to tell which be genuine if you put they side by side yes say kit i be not sure i could tell which be mine gerald laugh one have to study these thing part of my job you see and bank be cheat oftener than people think however i expect you want to get to work and i 'll go back to the tarn he go out and kit tear up the paper he think a talent like gerald 's might be dangerous if it be use by a unscrupulous man chapter iii the horse show it be a calm evening and osborn sit on the terrace study a print notice mr osborn pour out coffee at a small table and gerald and grace occupy the top of the broad step to the lawn the sun be low the air be cool and except for the soft splash of a beck a deep quietness brood over the dale it will be a good show osborn remark reach for a cup i insist on the rather early date because if we have wait until the hay be in we might have get wet weather two or three object but i be satisfied i take the proper line one must be firm with a argumentative committee gerald 's eye twinkle as he look at grace osborn generally be firm with people who give way and gerald have hear some grumble about he change the date for the horse show it be the last time i 'll be president osborn resume i have mean to resign but thorn could not take the post sir george be away and a well-known local man be need to give the thing a proper start rather a expensive honor gerald observe the president 's expect to make up the shortage if the day be wet that be one reason for my fix the meeting early when we often get it fine osborn reply navely the expense be a drawback but the committee would not let I drop out mother and grace will want new hat and clothes and i expect the job will cost you more than you think you 'll have to give they a lead by bidding for the chapel sheep if that meddlesome fellow drysdale be go to send he sheep to the show the arrangement be make without my know osborn reply angrily mrs osborn look disturbed but gerald laugh he rather enjoy provoke he father when he think it safe drysdale be treasurer for a body of nonconformist who want to build a new chapel and find the farmer reluctant to give money have ask for contribution from they flock and herd the idea be that the sale would be a extra attraction gerald go on still i admit it be hard for you because you hate chapel and will have to bid in fact you 'll no doubt have to buy the sheep at a sentimental price and sell they at they value i believe in liberty of conscience and do not hate chapel osborn rejoin for all that i own to a natural prejudice against people who attend such place largely because they mix up they religious and political creed it would be strange if i sympathize with they plan for rob the landlord anyhow drysdale mean to bring he flock and i be afraid you 'll have to pay the situation have some humor osborn knit he brow haye have be talk to he about the estate account and he have resolve to practice stern economy economy be needful unless he give a fresh mortgage to pay the interest on he other debt and here be a expense he have not bargain for if i would know about drysdale i would have resign he say i take the post again because there be nobody else they might have try askew gerald suggest askew a fellow of no importance unknown outside the dale i imagine he 'll be better know soon and he be rather a good sort give I a very good lunch not long since and have obviously spend something on the farm he room be like a museum and he have a number of valuable thing seem to have have some adventure abroad and find they profitable you mean he try to impress you by vague boast no say gerald i do not think he do the fellow 's not that kind in fact he be rather good form and have somehow get the proper stamp grace look at she brother as if she agree but osborn remark ironically you imagine yourself a judge oh well say gerald smile i have have the advantage of be bring up at tarnside and belong to a good london club anyhow askew 's much less provincial than some of we exclusive friend he stroll off and osborn go to the library where he spend some time study he account the calculation he make be disturbing and he resent the possibility of he be force to help drysdale 's fund nevertheless the president of the show would be expect to lead the bidding and the osborn do thing properly a week or two afterwards mr osborn open the show in a field by the market-town which stand in a hollow among the moor the grass slope to a river that sparkle in the sun and then vanish in the alder ' shade across the stream old oak and ash tree roll up the side of the moot hill and round the latter gray wall and roof show among the leave a spire and a square ivy-covered tower rise above the faint blue haze of smoke a few white cloud float in the sky and they cool shadow creep slowly across the field the horse be not very numerous but the show have other attraction and be a excuse for a general holiday the crowd be larger than usual mr osborn 's nervous speech be cheer and for a time osborn forget that the office he have take might cost he something he be carry out a duty he owe the neighborhood and feel that he could do so better than anybody else he do not admit that he like to take the lead place he first annoyance come with the sheep-dog trial he have not know askew be a competitor and frown as he see grace go up to he when a flock of herdwick enter the field the girl ought to have see that it be not the proper thing for he daughter to proclaim she acquaintance with the fellow then gerald follow she and begin talk to askew as if he know he well gerald be of course irresponsibly eccentric but he folly jar grace have find it needful to get a new dress and hat and kit thrill and try to hide he delight in she beauty as she advance he rough-coated dog run to meet she and she stroke its shaggy head i hope bob be go to win she remark it be doubtful kit reply he be clever but they do not give we much time and he be get slow one or two of he rival be very good you 'll do you best old bob say grace and the dog look up at she with friendly eye beat he tail on the ground then gerald come up and soon afterwards the judge tie a string to a farmer 's leg and fasten the other end to a post this allow he to run a short distance after which he must direct he dog by voice first trial mr forsyth 's merry lad a steward announce and the crowd gather round when the judge take out he watch furze bush have be stick into the ground to simulate a broken hedge beyond these be a row of hurdle with a open gate and then a number of obstacle while a rail pen occupy a corner of the field kit give grace a card show the way the sheep must be drive round the different barrier it be a good test particularly as we can not follow the dog and they must take each obstacle in its proper turn they be wonderfully clever to understand say grace and stop when the judge shout time the farmer call he dog a handsome smooth-haired collie that set off with a bind and drive the sheep at full speed towards the furze as they come up with fleece shake and a patter of little foot the man run to the length of the string and wave he stick away back gin away back t ` ither slap ye fule people laugh when the dog in desperate haste stop the sheep as they pack outside a hole but it drive they to the next gap through which they stream forrad gan forrad cry the farmer head they merry lad the dog turn the sheep and bring they back through another opening after which they race towards the hurdle and the collie hesitate as if puzzle by its master 's shout the sheep be near the end of the rail but it be not the end the card indicate then the dog seem to understand what be require and circle round the flock with swift graceful leap drive they along the hurdle and round the other end there be some applause from the crowd and afterwards good-humored banter when the dog run backwards and forwards at a loss the animal obviously know the flock must be take round the remain obstacle but have only its master 's shout for guide to the order in which they must be pass sometimes the farmer get angry and sometimes laugh but except for a mistake or two the collie drive the sheep in and out among the barrier as the card require and put they in the pen two or three more trial take place and for the most part the unoccupied dog strain at they lead and whimper but old bob sit at kit 's foot watch with he head on one side one can see he be think i believe he want to remember the right way round grace remark and smile when a steward beckon kit it be you turn she say i wish you good luck kit go off with he heart beating and feel half amuse by he keenness when the steward tie the string to he leg after he adventure on the caribbean and the stake he and adam have play for it be strange he should be eager to win a box of plate fork at a rustic show yet he be eager grace have wish he luck number four mr askew 's old bob the steward announce kit call and bob trotting away deliberately get the sheep together and drive they correctly through the hole he be do well in one sense and kit know he would make few mistake but time count and old bob be slow he have trouble at the hurdle where the sheep seem resolve to go the wrong way but he stop they and take they back to the proper end kit give very few order although he look at he watch rather anxiously bob understand and could be trust to do he work the trouble be he might not finish it in time at length kit draw a deep breath and put back he watch the sheep be in the pen and there be a minute leave kit go back to grace and bob trot up pant with he tongue hang out he look at kit as if for approval and then after wag he tail when he master speak hold up he paw to grace hallo say kit i have not know he to do that before it be not a sheepdog 's trick i teach he grace reply with a touch of color he have not forget and really deserve to be stroke she go away but she give kit a smile across the railing behind which she stand with mr osborn when the judge call out : first prize number four mr askew 's bob when lunch be serve in a big tent osborn sit at the top of the table but he satisfaction have vanish for one thing everybody have applaud when askew win the prize the fellow be obviously a favorite and this annoy he then drysdale 's sheep be to be sell by auction after lunch and the committee have hint that the president be the proper person to buy the flock drysdale sit next to kit at the bottom of the table he be a little shabbily-dressed man with a brown face and a twinkling smile where be the sheep kit ask we 'll send t ' band for they presently be you gin t ' bid i do not know until i have see they what about they quality weel it might be better they be gift you ken there be a young ram might suit you he be true carlside strain i do not know how you get he then i can not see mayson give away good breed stock drysdale grin some big stane fall on t ' ram when mayson be bring flock doon barra ghyll he look a bit the waur o ' it but you can tell the carlside blood i 'll see what i think about the animal kit say with a laugh do you expect a good sale the rich people as a rule go to church they 'll bid aw t ' same when you canna stir they generosity you can try they pride if you look at it one way the thing 's humorsome they dinna want to help I but they will it be possible kit agree i do not know if the plan 's above suspicion but you need the money it will be weel spend hooiver i must be off and see the band dinna get ower much to drink drysdale go away and soon afterwards a strange procession head by the band and guard by child enter the field a row of goose waddle solemnly in single file come first and then turkey stalk among they brood a boy lead a handsome goat and long-legged calf and in the rear straggle a flock of sheep when all be drive into pen the sale begin and the crowd laugh and banter the man who bid in the meantime kit examine the sheep some have fault and the ram have obviously suffer from its accident it be clear though that it spring from a famous stock and kit know a animal transmit to its offspring inherit quality and not acquire defect he recognize the stamp of breed and resolve to buy the sheep the ram be worth much more than he imagine the shepherd think he go back to the stand and by and by the auctioneer praise the flock when he stop there be silence for a few moment until osborn nod a cautious beginning often make a good ending but we have a long way to go yet the auctioneer remark who 'll say five pound more thorn make a sign and the auctioneer raise he hammer we have get a start but you must keep it up the opportunity 's what folk call unique you 'll save money by buy and help a good cause do not know which will appeal to you but you can pay you money and take you choice he look about while the crowd laugh and after two or three flockmaster advance the price catch kit 's eye mr askew 's a judge of sheep we 'll call it ten pound rise kit nod and osborn glance at thorn who shrug the latter have help to start the bidding which be all he mean to do and osborn would have try to draw out after make another offer have he not see kit he do not want the sheep although he be willing to buy they at something above they proper price now however askew be he antagonist the fellow must be beat we must finish the sale before the driving-match he say go up twenty pound they would not sell near it if you send they to the market a farmer remark do you sell pedigree stock to butcher the ram 's worth the money the auctioneer rejoin on the whole kit agree although he see that other do not moreover he be willing to run some risk by help drysdale whom he like and he sign to the auctioneer the farmer stop but osborn go on he have not like peter askew and like kit worse father and son have oppose he and now the young upstart be proud of the money he have no doubt get by doubtful means he would not let the fellow balk he and he face get red as he answer the auctioneer 's inquire glance presently he turn with a frown as haye touch he arm it be a extravagant price the agent remark they 'll want a check and you account be get very low you 'll have to cut down expense then osborn answer haughtily this be not a matter about which i need you advice haye shrug and osborn nod to the auctioneer when kit make another bid he feel hot and savage and want a drink but could not leave the stand askew mean to humiliate he and he must hold out he be the most important man in the neighborhood and must not be beat by a small farmer for all that the sum he would have to pay would be a drain after the next bid the auctioneer look at kit who smile and shake he head mr osborn take the lot the auctioneer remark he have pay a high price to help a good object but i think we all hope the next lambing season will give he he money back osborn 's savage satisfaction be spoil by a chill doubt and he go off to look for haye give the fellow a check for the sheep on the estate account he say how much haye ask and look thoughtful when osborn tell he there be a number of bill to meet and we 'll have no money come in until term-day can not you put off the bill i think not haye answer meaningly it might not be prudent we credit be not too good osborn be silent for a moment or two very well he say i 'll try to sell the sheep to somebody who 'll give I what they be really worth come over to-morrow and we 'll talk about the new mortgage then he go back moodily to join the judge for the driving-match chapter iv the flood on the morning after the show osborn walk up and down the terrace wait moodily for haye it be a rash extravagance to buy the sheep and he blame kit for this the fellow have go on bidding in order to force he to pay a high price besides the money would help a object osborn do not approve there be enough chapel in the neighborhood and any legislation that interfere with the landlord ' privilege get its warmest support at such place the sum he have spend be not remarkably large and he have cut he loss by sell the flock to a farmer at they market price but this be about half what he have give and he have some urgent debt although he have hope to hold out until term-day when the payment of rent would ease the strain on he finances he must have money and do not know where it could be get by prudent means in the meantime he look about gloomily the weather have change a moist west wind drive heavy cloud across the sky and the fell-top be hide by mist it threaten a wet hay-time and hay be scarce in the dale where they generally cut it late after feed sheep on the meadow osborn farm some of he land and have hope for a good crop which he need the grass in the big meadow by the beck be long and get ripe but the red sorrel that grow among it have lose its bright color the fill head roll in wave before the wind but there be something dull and lifeless in the noise they make and osborn know what this mean rain be come and when rain begin in the dale it do not stop he glance rest on the green embankment along the beck he father have make the dyke at a heavy cost but in place the stone and soil have gradually wash away if the dyke break at one spot the beck would return to its old channel and much damage might be do particularly if the flood roll across the turnip field osborn have mean to strengthen the dyke but have put it off because of the expense a little later haye come up the step osborn do not ask he to sit down although there be room on the stone bench and the agent lean against the terrace wall he face be inscrutable but he remark he employer 's rudeness i have see fisher and he be willing to take a mortgage on ryecote he say the interest be higher than i thought but the money would pay off urgent bill and cover the cost of the farmstead repair how much do fisher want osborn ask and frown when he be tell it be unjust two per cent above the proper interest i can not borrow for less however if we use the money judiciously we ought to get something back by higher rent lang and gray for example would pay a little more for the improvement they require osborn ponder he be in a suspicious mood and think haye want to negotiate the mortgage when i have satisfy the other tenant there will not be much left for lang and gray he rejoin my experience be that the money you sink in improvement be go for good they must be make for all that particularly just now when a dissatisfied spirit be spread among the farmer askew be show they what can be do by the proper use of capital askew osborn exclaim father and son the askew have be the origin of the worst trouble i have have haye be willing to indulge osborn 's rancor and derive a rather malicious satisfaction from see he annoyed besides he do not want to dwell upon the mortgage i wonder whether you know askew have buy drysdale 's sheep i do not know i sell the flock to graham then askew must have buy they soon afterwards unless he send graham to make the deal with you osborn 's face get red a shabby trick unthinkably shabby after he force up the price he pause and try to control he anger but why do he buy that second-class lot there be a carlside ram only fit for mutton i study the animal oh well askew no doubt think he be a judge i imagine he buy the other in order to get the ram he cheat I say osborn with a savage frown the fellow 's a cunning rogue i wish he have not come back -- confound he he pull himself up and add : however about the mortgage i suppose i must agree to fisher 's term see he and arrange the thing as soon as possible haye go away and osborn light a cigar he have a disturbing feeling that he have be rash the money would not last long and if he have not borrow it he might have pay the interest on other loan buy the sheep have really decide he to give the mortgage since it have make he feel keenly the embarrassment of have very little money at command there be another thing haye want he to borrow the fresh sum although a prudent agent would try to keep the estate out of debt he could not see haye ' object and feel suspicious but while he ponder it begin to rain and he go into the house it rain all day and at dusk the mist have creep down the hill the long grass in the meadow bent before the deluge and slant from the wind the beck begin to roar in the gyhll and thread of foam glimmer in the mist a hoarse turmoil rise from the stream that feed the tarn and a angry flood stain brown by peat rise steadily up the dyke there be no promise of better weather when osborn go to bed and he have known rain like that last for a week in fact he have know all the hay crop and the most part of the young turnip wash down the valley the rain be heavier when early next morning kit go out to move some sheep from a spot where the rise water might cut they off he come back along the meadow dyke and stop for a few minute when he reach its weakest place reed and tuft of heather whirl down the brown flood wide patch of turf and soil have fall away uncover the foundation of boulder and gravel and while kit look down a heavy stone roll out of its place and plunge into the stream other be ready to go the water be rise ominously fast and would rise for some time after the rain stop there be however nothing to indicate that it would stop and kit know he native climate look about with some uneasiness a hollow across the meadow to a hedge behind which be two large turnip field and he know this mark a former channel of the beck it be long since the water have flow that way but he father have tell he that in heavy flood it have some time spread across the field and join the other stream at allerby if this happen again the bottom of the dale would be cover and the crop ruin when he be go away three or four man with pick and spade come up be you go to mend the dyke he ask we be gin to try say one i reckon we 'll not can hoad she up if beck rise much she 'll rise three or four foot say kit be nobody else come neabody we ken aboot mr osborn send to allerby first thing but miller wad not let he have a man kit think hard bell have give up the mill and he successor have a dispute with haye to repair the dyke properly would be a long and expensive business since there be a number of weak spot but a dozen man work hard might perhaps strengthen the threaten part sufficiently to bear the strain clearly if they be to be of use they must be find and set to work at once in a sense the risk be osborn 's who would pay for he neglect but the flood might damage he tenant ' field and even if the damage be confine to osborn 's kit hate to see crop spoil you have better begin he say i 'll try to get help mayhappen folk will come for you though they wad not for t ' maister one reply we 'll need aw you can get before lang kit set off as fast as he could walk and stop for a minute at ashness send he man then he go on to allerby and at first find the farmer unwilling to move but after some argument they go with he to the mill we 'll hear what miller have to say one remark he ken maist aboot the job sin ' he have t ' mend t ' lade when haye refuse for aw that mend dyke be landlord 's business i 'll not stir a hand to save osborn 's crop the miller declare when he meet they at the door he oad rogue o ' a agent promise I he would build up brocken lade but when time come i have to do ' t mysel ' two of the other grumble about promise haye have not keep and then kit say all this be not important i do not ask you to mend the dyke for osborn 's sake but yours if the beck break through and run down to allerby it will spoil all the hay and fill the mill-lead with rubbish then we 'll get compensation landlord 's bind to keep dyke in order kit smile you 'll get nothing unless you go to law and i do not know if you 'll get much then haye be clever and the dispute would be expensive you 'll certainly find it cheaper to mend the dyke they ponder this until the miller make a sign of agreement i 'll not can say you be wrang i be come with my two man kit tell he to bring a horse and cart and the party set off for the threaten bank the beck have rise while kit be away and stone and soil slip down into the flood a angry turmoil indicate that the current have roll the rubbish into a dam we have get we job say the miller as he drive in he spade they get to work but the current that undermine the bank bring down the turf and soil with which they try to fill the hole it be plain that a stronger material be need and kit send some man to a roadmaker 's quarry at the bottom of the fell while he rearrange some harness when he have finish he fasten a extra horse outside the shaft of the cart and two man drive the team across the field they go off fast jolt the cart by they clumsy trot but kit know the extra horse would be need when they return soon afterwards osborn come up the other bank and stop opposite with the rain run off he mackintosh have anybody give you leave to meddle with the dyke he ask no say kit we 'll let it alone if you like but there will not be much of you hay leave when the flood break through and i imagine you could be make responsible for other damage osborn hesitate and kit see he frown begin to wonder whether he would send he away then he resume : who engage these man i do not know that they be engage anyhow if there be a difficulty about they get pay i be accountable bring they to tarnside when you have finish osborn answer and go off kit resume he work with savage energy he think osborn do not deserve to be help but this do not matter much other would suffer unless he finish the job he have undertake and it almost look as if the flood would beat he the trench from which they dig the soil they need fill with water the spade get slippery with rain and mud and the horse sink in the trampled slough kit however have make he plan while he look for help and have forget nothing that he might want hammer drill and a can of powder have be bring and now and then a dull report roll across the dale and heavy stone crash in the quarry when he have stone enough he and one or two other stand on the front of the bank with the water wash round they leg while they build up the ragged block the piece be hard to fit and sometimes the rude wall break when the man on top throw down the backing of soil kit tear he hand on a sharp corner but persist while the blood run down he finger and he wet clothes stick to he skin the other support he well and he only stop for breath and to wipe from he eye the water that trickle off he soaked hat the loaded cart plough through the mire meet the other go back the man at the quarry keep he supply and when he have make a foundation the bank begin to rise for all that the beck rise almost as fast and at noon they have not gain much on the flood kit be doubtful but on the whole thought it prudent to let the man stop they have work hard and could not keep it up without a rest when they collect with they dinner can under a drip hedge one remark : mayhappen we would better wait for osborn to send cold meat and ale i 'll mak ' a start with bread and cheese the other grin but kit get up as he hear a rattle of wheel do not begin just yet two of you go to the gate the man come back with a big jar and a basket and the other gather round when kit take off the clean wet cloth yon lunch niver come fra tarnside it be ower good and liberal say one ashness folk dinna believe in send a half-empty jar when they have eat and drunk one or two try to light they pipe but give it up and they get to work again kit 's hand hurt it be long since he have undertake much manual labor and he muscle feel horribly stiff he know however that the man need a leader not a superintendent and he would not urge they to effort he shirk and a leader be all they need they have no liking for osborn but they be stubborn and now they have begin they mean to finish shovel clinked stone rattle from the cart and the pile of earth and rock rise faster than the flood in the meantime the mist get thicker and the rain sweep the valley the long grass near the trench be trodden into pulp where the turf be cut the surface of the bank melt and the man stumble as they climb it with they load the wheelbarrow pour down water as well as sticky soil and kit 's clothes get stiff with mud despite this he hold out until in the evening the strengthened dyke stand high above the stream then he throw down he spade and stretch he ache arm i think she 'll hold the water back and we can do no more say kit the other gather up they tool and climb into the cart drive down the dale when they reach the tarnside lodge kit pull up you have do a good job for osborn and there be no reason you should not get you pay he say two or three jump down without much enthusiasm and the old gardener come out and give one a envelope for mr askew he remark be that all the other asked and the gardener grin that be all what do you expect the man take the envelope to kit and the rest wait with some curiosity they be very tired and big drop fall on they as the wind shake the drip tree kit open the envelope and he face flush as he take out a note address to haye pay c askew and the man whose name follow one day 's wages on estate account it run this be all and the sum note at the bottom represent the lowest payment for unskilled labor kit hand the note to he companion and while some laugh ironically two or three swear next time beck 's in flood osborn can mend he dyke himsel ' say one if five minute ' digging wad save tarnside hall i would sooner lose my hay than stir a hand then they get into the cart and drive off in the rain chapter v kit tell a story the rain stop at night the next day be fine and in the afternoon kit go up the dale to look at the mended dyke it have stand better than he have think the beck be fall and osborn 's field be safe until another flood come down kit do not know if he be pleased or not there be some satisfaction in feeling that he have do a good job but he do not think osborn deserve the help he neighbor have give follow the dyke until he come to the road he sit down on the bridge and light he pipe the sun be hot and he be glad of the shade of a big alder whose leave rustle languidly overhead the bent-grass on the hillside shine a warm yellow wet rock glitter like silver in the strong light and the higher slope where belt of green moss checker the heather be streak by line of snowy foam all be very quiet except for the noise of run water and the joyous note of a lark kit be not much of a philosopher action be easier to he than abstract thought but he vaguely feel that the serenity of the dale be mar by human passion man be no doubt mean to struggle but nature be he proper antagonist and while the fight against flood and snow be brace one gain nothing by shabby quarrel that spring from pride and greed kit be human however and own that he have feel savage when he read osborn 's note the fellow have mean to humiliate he and he get hot again as he think about it moreover osborn have so to speak for he sake insult the man he have persuade to help they have not work for wages when they fight the swollen beck and some kindly acknowledgment such as a supper at the hall would have go far to gain for osborn a good will that money could not buy anyhow since he offer pay the sum ought to have be a just reward for they toil osborn have be lead by personal rancor and there be no use in kit 's pretend he do not resent it the fellow seem to think he have a right to command and get savage when people would not obey kit feel he have do nothing to deserve he hatred but since osborn do hate he he must brace himself for a struggle and he mean to win then as he knock out he pipe he see grace for a few moment kit hesitate if grace know how osborn have reward he the meeting might be awkward but there be nothing to be gain by put it off he mean to marry grace whether osborn approve or not and to some extent frankness be needful he wait until she reach the bridge and get up when she stop there be some color in she face but she give he a steady look i have be to see the mend dyke she say and he know that she have pluck it be a rough job there be no time to finish it neatly i be surprised you be able to finish it at all i must not claim all the credit kit rejoin smile there be a number of other as well as the tarnside man grace make a impatient gesture we man could have do nothing useful if they have be leave alone and the other would not have help if you have not persuade they why do you to some extent my object be selfish if the flood have break through it might have do much damage to all the crop besides you father 's it could not have damage yours oh well say kit i hate to see thing spoil and be afraid i be meddlesome grace 's color rise but she fix she eye on he that be not kind i hardly think it be just i have not accuse you of meddle no say kit i be sorry it be a stupid remark but i expect you know what you father think grace be silent for a few moment she do know and would rather not have meet kit but be too proud to turn back besides she feel she father be prejudiced and although it be a family tradition that the osborn stand together she rebel and want to be just the situation be embarrassing but there be no use in pretense i think you be generous and imagine my mother agree she say she want to send some lunch to the beck but the rain be very heavy and there be nobody to go then remember something osborn have say she hesitate i understand you helper be pay oh yes say kit not with malice but because he see he must be frank i be not leave out grace turn she head this be worse than she have think she be angry and would not let kit think she approve she eye sparkle as she look up ah she say you deserve something very different i wish you have not tell I i do not tell you because i be hurt kit reply with grave quietness it look as if we have get to face thing you father think I he enemy i be not i have never try to injure he and if the dyke be threaten by another flood i believe i would mend it but whatever happen i mean to do what i think proper and it be possible we may clash again yes say grace i be afraid this may happen well i value you friendship and do not mean to give it up but i can not pretend and think you would not be deceive if i try you mean you would not do what you think be shabby in order to avoid a clash i mean something like that now you know how thing be you must choose you line i can not judge how far you duty to you parent bind you you can grace feel she heart beat and be silent for a moment or two i can not criticize my father 's deed and agree with people who be oppose to he she say all the same unless he expressly order it i can not give up my friend kit try to hide he satisfaction we 'll let it go i understand he expect she to move away and wonder whether it be tactful for he to stop but to he surprise she smile and sit down on the bridge very well suppose we talk about something else the shade be nice and i need not go home yet you promise to tell I about you adventure and you uncle i think you call he a survival from the old romantic day when the pirate haunt the gulf of mexico kit ponder as he lean against the alder trunk he think grace mean to banish the strain anyhow she be willing to stay and he want she to do so it be strangely pleasant to loiter on the bridge with she while the shadow tremble on the road and the beck murmur in the shade but if he mean to keep she he must talk and although he do not want to say much about he adventure he have a story to tell the story be move if he could tell it properly i be not clever at draw a portrait but i would like to try he say for one thing my subject 's worth the effort and then you see i be fond of adam in some way he be not romantic in fact he be remarkably practical he bold stroke be make deliberately after calculate the cost but now and then one get a hint of something strangely romantic and in a sense extravagant yet human nature 's curious when he play out a losing game know he would lose it be not from sentimental impulse but a firm persuasion it be worth while he pause and give grace a apologetic glance i be afraid this be rather foggy perhaps i would better begin where i meet he at a florida hotel -- if i be not bore you grace say she be not bore and kit gain confidence narrate how they bump the _ rio negro _ across the surf-swept shoal land the gun and meet alvarez he own part in they adventure be lightly indicate but the girl 's imagination supply what he leave out she feel strangely interested as kit 's portrait of he uncle grow into shape although she thought dwell largely on the artist then the background -- the steamy swamp old presidio and dazzling town -- have a romantic fascination and when he tell she about the journey to the mission and the church where the candle that adam send burn before the virgin 's shrine she eye shine ah she say i be glad you tell I one think better of human nature after hear a tale like that in a way it be a rebuke be such man numerous i have know two perhaps it be a coincidence that both be my relation they be commoner than people think you be a optimist but one like optimist grace remark with a gentle smile however what have the president do to deserve the sacrifice you uncle make i never know but suspect it be something against the law of he country if i tell my story properly you would understand that both be buccaneer but they have they code i like the president and you uncle be very fine one feel move when one think about the shabby little altar and the candle love have light that never go out -- all those year adam 's wife love he she go to nurse he although she friend warn she and she know the risk grace muse for a time and kit think she face disturbed then she look up quietly one need courage to know the risk and not to hesitate but you will keep those candle burn yes say kit i promise besides i like to think they be burn it mean something it mean much grace agree and after a pause resume : you have no doubt about take up you uncle 's engagement with the president although you see what it might cost of course not kit reply there be nothing else to be do grace smile and get up no she say there be nothing else you could do well i must go home kit go back with she for some distance they talk but little on the way but when she leave he she give he she hand and a look that make he heart beat soon after grace reach tarnside osborn cross the lawn to the tea-table where she and mr osborn sit beneath a spreading copper-beech he face be thoughtful when mr osborn give he a cup i meet the post as i be drive home he say there be a letter from gerald have he any news mr osborn ask nothing important he be well and say he be keep occupy which be fortunate in fact the harder they work he the better i would sooner gerald do not have much time on he hand then why do he write grace ask because gerald 's letter be by no means regular i hope he do not want money mr osborn remark no say osborn that be he do not want it for himself he hesitate and then resume : he state that if i could raise a moderate sum he know how we could make a very satisfactory profit in a short time it seem he have get a useful hint grace laugh about a racehorse gerald be always hopeful but he confidence in he ability to spot the winner be dangerous it have be so often misplace this have nothing to do with racing osborn rejoin angrily gerald know the consequence of indulge he folly again there be a difference between bet and buy share i do not know if the difference be very mark say grace with a curious feeling of annoyance for there be a note in osborn 's voice that jar he be like gerald a gambler greedy for money he have not earn and she think about the story kit have tell its hero have risk and lose he life and kit have pay in health and fortune because they put honor before gain for all that she know she have say enough when she see osborn 's frown gerald be young but he hold a responsible post and have opportunity of meeting important stock-broker and business man osborn go on turn to he wife he be of course optimistic and have be rash but after all he may have find out something useful he declare the venture be absolutely safe but you have no money to invest mr osborn insist anxiously as a matter of fact i have some you see i borrow a sum not long since on ryecote oh say mr osborn with a resigned gesture and then brace herself but if you have get the money it ought not to be use for speculation there be much that need to be do on the estate that be so it be my reason for borrow all the same it would be a very long time before i get back what i mean to spend on drain and steading besides the repair and improvement need not be make just yet and i might be able to use the money and earn a good profit first you might lose it all mr osborn insist gerald be rash and business man do not tell young bank-clerk important secret then although it be a shock to hear you have mortgage ryecote the money be so badly need that it must not be risk she pause and resume with some color in she face it be hard to own but perhaps gerald be not altogether to be trust osborn move abruptly he wife have touch the doubt that make he hesitate in fact this be a matter upon which he want she advice she know she son and have judge right when osborn have be deceive well he say knit he brow i have not quite decide i have think about ask for particulars but after all gerald 's hint may not be worth much and unless one be really well inform speculation be dangerous he look round and see thorn the latter have come up without disturb the group and now join they with a smile i hear you last remark he say my opinion be you view be sound it be very rash to speculate on share you do not know much about mr osborn feel disturbed because she wonder how much he have hear but he go on carelessly : gerald 's too young for one to trust he judgment my advice be leave the thing alone grace give he a grateful glance she do not like alan thorn but he be cautious and she see that osborn be hesitate it would not need much persuasion to move he one way or the other and she feel that to let gerald have the money would be a dangerous mistake you really think i have better keep out of it osborn ask certainly say thorn only a few of the big jobber can form a accurate notion how price ought to go for people like we speculation be a plunge in the dark osborn be silent for a few moment but grace see that he be pull in different way by caution and greed then to she relief he make a sign of agreement oh well i 'll let the thing alone thorn sit down and when mr osborn have give he some tea they talk about other matter presently grace get up and he walk with she across the lawn be you satisfied with the advice i give you father he ask yes say grace frankly i think he be tempt i be glad you come after all a hint that he would better be prudent do not cost I much you know i would do more than that to help you you do all that be necessary grace reply you have my thanks thorn glance at she keenly but there be something chill in she calm well i be go to london in a day or two and it might be advisable to look gerald up i will if you like yes say grace if it do not give you much trouble she leave he and thorn stand still frown grace be always like that friendly but elusive no matter how he try he could not break down she reserve chapter vi thorn make a plan thorn go up to town and one evening loiter about the hall of he club london rather bore he but he go there now and then because he feel one ought to keep in touch with thing it be in a sense one 's duty to know what be go on and the news he pick up help he to look well inform thorn have not much imagination but he be cautious calculate and generally see where he advantage lay he small estate be manage well in general he tenant like he and he investment be sound nevertheless he be dissatisfied he have wait long for grace osborn and fear that in spite of she father 's approval he get no nearer she alan thorn be not romantic but he love for grace be to some extent a generous emotion he know osborn 's poverty and it be plain that if he marry grace he might have to help he out of he embarrassment he be fond of money and have grounds for imagine that the daughter of a rich neighbor would not refuse he but he want grace and see he could not wait much longer he be fastidious about he clothes and they color and loose cut prevent people remark that he be get fat he dark hair be carefully brush he know however that he be get heavier fast and that he would soon be bald he have mean to go out but have no particular object and the street be hot besides after the quiet country he like the bustle in the hall people be begin to come in and one could see the crowd stream past the glass door sit down in a corner he begin to muse although he have be in town some time he have not see gerald he have call at the latter 's lodgings and find he not at home while when he go to the bank he be tell that gerald have be send to manage a small branch office thorn think it strange that osborn have say nothing about this and wonder whether he know gerald be extravagant and much less frank than he look he might have have a object for hide he promotion thorn understand that osborn make he some allowance but it be hard to see how the young man be able to belong to he rather expensive club after a time gerald come in and glance at two or three man who stand about at first thorn imagine he be look for he but see he be not gerald go into the telephone box close by and shut the door with a jerky movement it jar and then swing back a few inch as if the shock have jolt the spring thorn whose curiosity be excite listen and hear the number gerald ask for then he hear he say : yes -- osborn be that sanderson yes -- i say _ ermentrude _ any chance of a recovery what -- none at all can not hear -- oh sell at once margin 's go next moment gerald obviously see that the door be open for he bang it noisily and thorn hear nothing more he have however hear enough to give he food for thought and wait until gerald come out the young man stand still with he mouth firmly set and he eye fix on the wall as if he see nobody he clothes be in the latest fashion but the look of fastidious languidness that generally mark he have go turn abruptly he go up the stair and thorn enter the telephone box and open the directory when he come out he go up to a man he know can you tell I anything about short and sanderson stockbroker he ask not much say the other they be outside broker i imagine they be trustworthy but it be better to do business through a member of the exchange you 'll find it a good rule thank you say thorn who go upstairs to the smoking-room and find gerald sit in front of a table with a newspaper that deal with financial matter hallo say thorn i have be expect you for some day i suppose you get my message gerald look up and he smile be strain i do but have be much engage sit down and join I in a drink what have you order thorn ask and shrug when gerald tell he that go better after dinner i would sooner have something cool and light oh well say gerald i feel i need brace the fact be i have have a knock -- he stop as a waiter come up and say nothing until the man have go then he drain he glass and turn to thorn i be in a hole can you lend I two thousand pound thorn hide he surprise he think urgent need have force gerald to make he blunt request it be not he way to plunge at thing like that you ask you father for a smaller sum they tell you about my letter well thing have change since change for the worse they must have change rather quickly thorn remark for he suspicion be excite and he think he see a light gerald have be embarrass when he write to osborn and have not want the money to invest but to help he to escape the consequence of some extravagance that have nothing to do with it gerald rejoin will you let I have the money you can if you like to begin with you have better tell I why you want so large a sum gerald hesitate and he eyelid twitch nervously but he pull himself together and thorn wonder how far he would stick to the truth he know gerald and do not trust he very well i buy some share there be good ground for expect they would go up -- they go down when do you buy you meaning 's plain say gerald sullenly if you insist it be before i write home i suspect something like that however you have the share and they may go up again i have not get the share i buy on a margin and the margin 's go then you be rasher than i think thorn rejoin with a search look well you have lose you money and it be something of a surprise to hear you have so much anyhow it be yours and although the loss be serious i do not understand how you be embarrassed i borrow say gerald rather hoarsely you can wait the other fellow will not then of course if i renew the margin the share might recover and put I straight thorn ponder gerald 's statement be plausible but he doubt if he have tell he all two thousand pound be a large sum he say i do not know yet if i can lend it you gerald give he a steady look he face be haggard and the sweat run down he forehead it be obvious that he be desperate if you hope to marry my sister you have better help I out i have not much ground for think you sister will agree thorn rejoin with some dryness anyhow it be doubtful if you influence would go far with she if that be what you mean it be not what i mean gerald answer in a hoarse voice i have give you a useful hint you can spare two thousand pound and if you let I have the money you 'll be glad you do i must think about it you can call I up on the telephone at noon to-morrow gerald hesitate and then make a abrupt movement as a man come into the room the latter cross the floor and gerald get up very well he say and go off soon after gerald have go the man thorn have meet in the hall come in and he ask : do you know anything about _ ermentrude _ norton i suppose they be mine share i would not advise you to invest the other reply the company have seldom pay a dividend but not long since a rumor get about that a new shaft have bottom on rich ore he pause and shrug nobody know how such tale be start but they appeal to optimistic outsider who like to think they have get a secret tip anyhow there be some reckless buying by people who expect development at the shareholder ' meeting they be disappointed and be knock price down by they anxiety to sell out thorn thank he and begin to think he wonder where gerald have manage to get two thousand pound since he imagine that nobody would lend he the sum he do not know much about banking but it be possible that gerald have use he employer ' money hope to replace it before he be find out then since two thousand pound use for a margin would cover a large number of share it look as if gerald have lose part of the sum by previous speculation while he ponder the man whose entry have seem to disturb gerald come to he table and sit down opposite you obviously know young osborn he remark thorn say nothing for a moment or two hallam be not a public money-lender but sometimes negotiate private loan for extravagant young man about town one meet such people now and then at smart london club and thorn imagine the fellow could throw some light on gerald 's difficulty we come from the same neighborhood he reply he father be a large landowner i believe he have some land say thorn who begin to see he way he have not yet decide to help gerald but if he do he help must be make as valuable as possible the rent be low and the estate be encumber he resume on the whole i do not think you would consider it good security thank you for the hint osborn look as if he have get a jar i think he have he buy some share that have go down sharply and since he be a bank-clerk i expect the loss be a serious thing for he hallam nod carelessly no doubt do you know a man call askew i know something about he he own a farm in the dale and have recently spend some money on improvement although it be doubtful if he 'll get much return i can not tell you if he have any more or not but imagine he be not worth you bother about besides he be not the man i would expect to get into debt mr askew have not be try to borrow hallam answer with a smile well i promise to meet a friend and must not stop he go away and thorn sit still ponder the other man go out by and by and the room be quiet except for the rumble of traffic in the street and the rattle of a electric fan a waiter pull down a blind to shut out a bright sunbeam and thorn find the shade and soften noise from outside helpful to think gerald have use money belong to the bank and borrow from hallam in order to pay it back although thorn could not see what have persuade the latter to lend it be strange certainly that hallam have inquire about askew but in the meantime he could let this go gerald be threaten by a danger money could avert and thorn could help if he do help it would give he a claim to osborn 's gratitude although he could not tell how far this would influence grace the osborn cherish the old-fashioned tradition of they class and anything that touch one touch all grace however be modern and rebellious and thorn know she do not like he much he be not afraid to risk he money but he must not waste a opportunity he might not get again and the opportunity could be use in one of two way he could free gerald from he entanglement and use no pressure leave she parent ' gratitude to work on grace this be the proper line and would enable he to play a generous part have he be younger he would not have hesitate but he see a risk he be begin to look old and unless grace marry he soon must give she up the other line although not attractive promise greater security before he help he must state he term and force osborn to agree grace could not struggle because she refusal would involve the family in gerald 's disgrace thorn see the plan have drawback but grace be young and if he indulge and pet she she would no doubt get to like he and forget he hardness he have hear of marriage make like this that turn out happily for a time he sit with he brow knit and he mouth set he would have like to be generous but he love the girl and could not force himself to run the risk of lose she nevertheless he honestly try and afterwards remember with strange distinctness the soft rattle of the electric fan and the dull roll of traffic that throb in the quiet room while he fight the lose fight the sunbeam the waiter have shut out creep on to another window and shone on the fluted pillar before he get up he face be very hard for he have choose he line and know he must take it without doubt or pity go down to the hall he call up gerald 's branch bank a clerk who be work late reply that mr osborn have go i know say thorn give he name make a note to tell he he need not call on I to-morrow i find i be unable to do what he require very well say the clerk i 'll give he the message in the morning thorn ring the bell and leave the box ask for a railway guide there be nothing to be gain by stop in london and he look up the best train for the north chapter vii gerald 's return thorn go home and wait confident that osborn would presently send for he the estate be heavily mortgage osborn have no rich friend and when the blow fall would look to thorn for the aid nobody else could give in the meantime osborn enjoy a short relief from financial strain squander in personal extravagance part of the sum he have borrow and then set drainer carpenter and builder to work he like spending and now try to persuade himself that the money he be lay out would give he some return it ought to last until he have finish the renovation he tenant demand and although difficulty might arise afterwards he would wait until they do indeed he wife and daughter find he better humor than he have be for long then one evening when the hay be harvest and the corn be ripen he satisfaction be rudely banish grace have go to the lodge with a message and stop for a few minute by the gate the evening be calm and one side of the placid tarn glitter in the light the other be dark and soft blue shadow cover the fell behind she hear the languid splash of ripple on the stone and the murmur of a beck in a distant ghyll a strange restful tranquillity brood over the dale grace feel the calm soothing for she thought be not a little disturbed she have meet thorn in the afternoon and note a puzzling change in he manner so far she have be able to check he cautious advance but she now remark a new confidence that seem to indicate he have some power in reserve she admit that she might have imagine this but it trouble she afterwards she have meet kit and the comfort the meeting give she have force she to think they friendship have go far in fact it have reach a point friendship could not pass kit be not yet she lover but she think he wait for a sign that she would acknowledge he when he make he claim she like kit she have not meet a man she like so much this however do not imply that she be willing to marry he although she now and then rebel against convention she have inherit some of osborn 's prejudice and she mother spring from old-fashioned land-owning stock kit belong to another class the life he lead be different she have be teach to enjoy cultivate idleness break by outdoor sport and social amusement but kit be a worker farming for money and resolve to make he effort pay he wife must help and grace do not know if this daunt she or not moreover if she marry kit she must quarrel with she parent she know what osborn think about he have she be sure she love kit the choice would have be easier but although she blush as she muse this be too much to own yet he love she and after all -- she let the matter go and look up for there be step in the shadowy road then a figure come into the fading light and she start and run to the gate gerald she exclaim why have you come home somehow you do not feel flattered when people ask you why you come gerald rejoin with a forced smile it rather indicate surprise than satisfaction i be surprised grace admit try to hide she vague alarm we do not expect you how do you getaway i take a week 's leave i have not be very fit grace give he a sharp glance and think he look ill he face be pinch he eye be furtive and he mouth be slack what have be the matter she ask nothing very much gerald reply mental strain i expect manage a bank be a big job and i be not use to responsibility it look as if he carelessness cost he a effort and grace say nothing when they reach the house gerald resume : you 'll hear all about it later be the chief at home grace nod they have seldom call osborn father but chief and head of the clan and she think it significant that gerald use the name he often falteringly employ after boyish escapade she begin to feel that there be something wrong he be in the library she say that be satisfactory as far as it go gerald remark climb the step the sooner i see he the sooner i 'll get through the thing he pause and give grace a anxious glance you 'll stand by I you generally do i suppose so grace agree but i do not know you difficulty and what you want you will know soon gerald rejoin and shrug he shoulder well it be a awkward business i have get to brace up he leave she and go to the library where osborn sit at the big oak table with some letter and a wine glass in front of he the spacious room be mostly in shadow but a ray of fading light shone in through the tall west window gerald avoid the illumination as he advance and stop in the gloom opposite osborn who straighten he body with a jerk and upset the glass well he say harshly why have you leave the bank the wine be run across the table and on to you clothes shall i ring no say osborn push he chair back noisily let it run stand still or sit down tell I why you come to begin with i have leave the bank for good ah say osborn grimly i suspect something like this you mean they turn you out well you be consistent in you habit you leave school in similar circumstance you leave woolwich and now -- i be not turn out sir they give I a week 's leave but i can not go back osborn frowned thing have be go well and he have think himself free from trouble for a time but it look as if he would get he worst jar he try to preserve he calm and say with a touch of weariness : tell I what have happen and keep as near the truth as be possible for you gerald tell he stand back in the shadow and not pause to choose he word it be a ugly story that could not be tone down and he know if he stop he could not go on again although osborn say nothing he face get red and the vein on he forehead swell and gerald find he silence strangely daunt when the latter stop osborn get up and stand rather shakily with he hand clench get out of my sight you despicable thief he cry my control be go if you stand and fidget there i 'll knock you down there would not be much use in that although i deserve it gerald reply it be too late for excuse the situation 's dangerous you have get to help I out i can not help say osborn in a strained hoarse voice why do not you leave the country instead of come home gerald force a nervous smile the reason ought to be obvious sir i might be bring back we must get over the need for I to go you see the bill must be meet if it be dishonored everybody who know we will have something to talk about i think you a fool say osborn bitterly you be a fool but you have a vein of devilish cunning you steal and forge and then expect to shuffle off the consequence on to you relative he pull himself up for gerald 's coolness be steadying however i must understand what will happen when the lender find you can not pay the usual course would be for he to go to the endorser gerald reply and add with some awkwardness : i mean the man whose name i use he signature 's a guarantee and make he liable still as hallam 's a tactful fellow it be possible he 'll first come to you do you mean he be suspicious i do not know he take off a extortionate discount for a very short loan how much do he lend you the bill be for two thousand pound osborn make a helpless gesture i can not pay the money i borrow be partly spend and the rest must go for wages and material you can not put wages off -- he stop and sit down limply the shock be begin to tell he feel dull and have no reserve of moral strength to sustain he now he fury have go gerald saw this and know that guidance must come from he he wait however and osborn go on : it be ridiculous that we should be ruin for two thousand pound but there it be if i try to borrow from my friend i must tell why i need the money and i do not know who would lend thorn might gerald suggest meaningly i ask he and he would not but i do not think he refusal be final ah say osborn with a start why do you think it be not i imagine he have another plan he mean to wait until it be obvious we must have he help then he can ask what he like for a moment osborn 's anger blaze up again i see where you be lead you contemptible cur you expect you sister to pay for you it would be a good marriage say gerald awkwardly i think you want it stop exclaim osborn and rest he elbow on the table with he shoulder bent he have want grace to marry thorn but he domineering temper do not carry he as far as gerald think he have hope that by and by grace would consent it be ridiculous to imagine she would long refuse to see the advantage that be plain to he but to force she to pay for she brother 's fault be another thing although grace be rebellious he have some love for she in fact he revolt from the plan and feel he hate thorn for the pressure he could use he be nearly resign to let thing go and face the threaten disaster for a minute or two he do not move and gerald get horribly cramped as he stand opposite the room be get dark and osborn 's figure be indistinct but he quietness hint at a struggle gerald begin to feel anxious because he have not expect he father to hesitate at length osborn look up you have not tell I whose name you use askew 's say gerald with a tremor he know he could use no stronger argument but feel afraid askew 's shout osborn straighten he bent shoulder with a savage jerk this be more than i can bear be there nobody you could rob but the man who have plot against I since he come home from school he stop and gasp as if he rage be choke he and it be some moment before he go on : you have give the fellow power to humble we and drag we name in the mud can not you imagine how he 'll exult we honor in askew 's hand it be unthinkable if the bill be not meet the holder will apply to askew gerald say as coolly as he could osborn 's muscle relax and he sink back into he limp pose he hand shake as he wipe he wet forehead you have say enough leave I alone i must try to think gerald go out and draw a deep breath when he reach the landing he feel shaky and ashamed but know he have win the shut of the door give osborn some relief the anger and disgust gerald excite have confuse he brain but now the lad have go he see no light there be but one way of escape and this a way it be almost unthinkable that he should take the strange thing be he should hate it so much for he have never indulge he child or think about they happiness yet he shrink from force he daughter to marry thorn whom he approve while she do not he might perhaps for the girl 's sake have sacrifice he pride but there be a obstacle before which he courage melt if thorn do not help askew would know he disgrace and osborn do not expect he to be merciful he rancor against askew have by degree become a blind illogical hate that make it impossible for he to see anything kit do in its proper light feeling as he do he imagine kit would rejoice in the opportunity for humble he all the same know the fight be hopeless he struggle against the conviction that he must beg help from thorn in many way he like alan but he be hard and osborn dread he firmness now yet he could help and there be nobody else it get dark but osborn do not move a faint breeze come up and moan about the house and presently a moonbeam steal into the room osborn sit still with he head bent and he arm spread out across the table sometimes he burn with anger against gerald and sometimes he scarcely feel anything at all at length he get up and with a effort go upstairs half a hour later a heavy sleep that come as a reaction after the shock close he eye and banish he trouble for a time chapter viii grace 's confidence on the day after gerald 's return osborn shut himself up in he library if he could raise two thousand pound it would save he from agree to the demand thorn would no doubt make and although he really know the thing be impossible he seek desperately for a way of escape he be careless about money and for the most part leave he business to he agent but he want to find out how he stand before he go to haye there be no obvious reason for he do so but he have begin to suspect that haye be not as devoted to he interest as he have think he wife and grace distrust the fellow and although they know nothing about business osborn admit that the advice they have sometimes give he have be sound the involve calculation he make give he fresh ground for disturbance it be plain that he could borrow no more money and the sum he have receive for the last mortgage have nearly go he might perhaps get together three or four hundred pound at the risk of let builder and drainer go unpaid but this be not enough after a time he put away he book in a fit of hopeless anger and drive across to see haye at the market town the interview be short and disappointing osborn could not tell haye why he need money and find he unusually firm he prove that the estate be heavily overburdened fresh loan be impossible and stern economy must be use if it be to be save from bankruptcy to some extent osborn have expect this but have cherish a faint hope that haye might lend he enough to satisfy gerald 's creditor he could not force himself to ask for a loan outright and haye have be strangely dull about he cautious hint osborn believe the fellow could have help he but as he have show no wish to do so there be nothing to be say he drive home in a downcast mood and send for gerald i can not get the money he say you know the man you deal with be there any hope of he renew the bill i be afraid there be none sir gerald reply when he make the loan he know you be a bank-clerk and have no money i expect he do know but think you have some osborn sigh he anger have go and a dull hopeless dejection have take its place he feel as if he and gerald be accomplice in a plot against grace and do not resent the lad 's insinuation that they stand together the osborn do stand together and he hope grace would see she duty well he say the payment be not due just yet i 'll wait a little and then write to the fellow it be a relief to put the thing off but he find no comfort as the day go by and although he shrink from take mr osborn into he confidence he moody humor give she a hint besides he be not clever at keep a secret and now and then make illuminating remark mr osborn although reserve be shrewd and she and grace without consult each other speculate about the trouble that obviously threaten the house by degree they conjecture get near the truth and at length mr osborn nerve herself to ask she husband a few blunt question he have not mean to tell she all until he be force but be take off he guard and tell she much afterwards she send for grace when grace hear the story she face get very white and she look at she mother with fear in she eye i suspect something but this be worse than i think she say in a low strained voice but alan be a old friend it be not very much for he to do and perhaps he will be generous mr osborn be sit rather limply on the stone bench on the terrace but she rouse herself he be hard and i think will understand what he help be worth he know there be nobody else besides if we accept this favor we can not refuse -- oh say grace it be unbearable i never like alan i feel i hate he now she pause and give mr osborn a appealing glance but you can not think i ought to agree mother there must be another way mr osborn shake she head i can not see another way and many girl in we class have marry man they do not like though i have hope for a better lot for you with we woman do not count the interest of the family come first that mean the man 's interest grace break out father have be reckless all he life and now gerald have drag we name in the mud he be to be save from the consequence and i must pay it be unjust mr osborn agree so far as that go there be no more to be say but when one think of the disgrace -- gerald hiding in america or perhaps in prison she voice break she be silent for a few moment and then resume : you father 's be the conventional point of view that i be teach to accept but which i begin to doubt i must choose between my daughter and my son the son who carry on the house if gerald escape he punishment fall on you the choice be almost too hard for flesh and blood i know say grace with quick sympathy it be horrible well say mr osborn the line i ought to take be plain -- tarnside will be gerald 's we honor must be save but i do not know if you shrink from alan -- if he insist i shall hate he always yet it look as if there be no use in rebel i feel as if i have be catch in a snare that tighten when i try to break loose i understand why a rabbit scream and struggle until it choke when it feel the wire it be like that with I mrs osborn bent she head my dear my dear then she look up irresolutely with tear in she eye i can not see my duty as i think the convention be that my son should come first but you be nearer to I than gerald have be for long i feel numb and dull i can not think perhaps to-morrow i may see -- grace get up and kiss she then we will wait if no help come i suppose i must submit she go away with a languid step and mr osborn sink back in a corner of the bench look across the lawn with vacant eye in a sense she have shirk she duty and fail she husband but she have long give way to he and be now begin to rebel grace afterwards look back with horror on the disturbed evening and sleepless night and the morning bring she no relief she could not resign herself to the sacrifice she think she would be force to make and she mother tell she that osborn have send a note to thorn and a man from london would arrive in the evening it be plain that alan must be persuade to help gerald before the other come in the afternoon she walk up the dale without a object because it be impossible to stop in the house after a time she hear a dog bark and stop by a open gate see kit swing a scythe where a old thorn hedge throw its shadow on a field of corn he be cut a path for the binder and for a minute or two she stand and watch kit have take off he jacket and he thin blue shirt harmonize with the warm yellow of the corn and the color of he sunburnt skin the thin material show the fine modeling of he figure as he body follow the sweep of the gleaming scythe the forward stoop and recovery be mark by a rhythmic grace and the crackle of the oat-stalk hint at he strength he face be calm and grace see he mind dwelt upon he work he look honest clean and virile but she turn she head and struggle with a poignant sense of loss she know now what it would cost she to let he go then he dog run up and kit put down he scythe come to the gate he give she a search glance but she be calm again and begin to talk about the harvest he do not seem to listen and when she stop say abruptly : you be stand in the sun come into the shade i 'll make you a seat she go with he know this be imprudent but unable to resist and he throw a oat-stook against the bank and cover it with he coat grace sit down and he study she thoughtfully i want you to tell I what be the matter he say how do you know i have anything to tell perhaps it be sympathy instinct or something like that anyhow i do know and you may feel better when you have tell I it be now and then a relief to talk about one 's trouble grace be silent she heart beat fast and she long for he sympathy and he nearness give she a feeling of support but she could not tell he all she trouble he wait with a patience that somehow indicate understanding and she look about the tall oats ripple before the wind and soft shadow trail across the hillside when the white cloud pass the dale be fill with light that jar she hopelessness as you have not begin yet i 'll make a guess say kit thing have be go wrong at tarnside since gerald come home well if you can give I a few particulars it be possible i can help he steady glance be comforting and grace 's reserve give way it be humiliating and in a sense disloyal to talk about gerald but she pride have go and she be suddenly inspire by a strange confidence perhaps kit could help one could trust he and he be not the man to be daunt by obstacle yes she say vaguely it be gerald -- so i think kit remark very well you have better tell I all you know or anyhow all you can she give he a quick glance to see what he mean but he brown face be inscrutable and with a effort talk fast in order to finish before she courage fail she narrate what she have hear she could not of course tell he all and indeed mr osborn 's story leave much to be explain ah say kit i begin to see a light although the thing 's not quite plain yet anyhow you father need money and must ask he friend he pause and resume in a voice he try to make careless : have he ask thorn grace hesitate and turn she head as she feel the blood creep into she face yes you see there be nobody else i be not sure about that however it look as if thorn have not send he answer yet and there be not much time to lose you expect the man from london to-night grace say they do and study kit while he ponder he preoccupy look indicate that he be work out some plan and do not understand how bold she have be he do not seem at all surprise that she have come to he she have break the family tradition by give he she confidence but she feel happier i would like to see gerald he say it be important and i 'll be at ashness at four o'clock if he will not come you must let I know i 'll send he if i can say grace who get up then she hesitate and look away across the field perhaps i ought not to have tell you but i feel i must and i be glad i do kit smile and after walk to the gate with she go on with he mow she story leave out much he want to know but he think he see where it lead and would get the rest from gerald this might be difficult but he mean to insist when grace reach tarnside she meet gerald on the lawn and take he to the bench under the copper-beech mr askew want you to go to ashness at four o'clock she say askew want I gerald exclaim with a start and grace think he look afraid why i do not know he say it be important gerald look hard at she well i suppose it be important but how do he know about the thing i tell he grace answer with forced quietness you tell he gerald gasp and then laugh harshly i know you have pluck but do not expect this you do not seem to realize what a extravagant thing you have do i do not it do not matter will you go gerald ponder for a few moment and then look up you owe I nothing grace in fact you and mother have often have to pay for my folly but i want you to be honest now i imagine you understand what alan expect if he help I out yes say grace in a strange hard voice it would be a good marriage the kind of marriage you ought to make alan 's rich and can give you the thing you like and ought to have but with all that i imagine you would sooner let it go i hate it grace say quietly i do not like alan i never shall like he he have some drawback gerald remark and be silent he have not often a generous impulse but he be move by he sister 's distress and think he see a plan the plan be extravagant and risky for he i wonder whether you would sooner marry askew he resume grace move abruptly and she face get red she have not expect the question and be highly strung gerald see she embarrassment and go on : of course he be a outsider from we point of view but he be a good sort in fact he be much better than alan besides there be some ground for believe you be pretty good friend stop grace exclaim this have nothing to do with you it be unthinkable that you should meddle gerald smile i be not go to give askew a hint if that be what you mean i want to find out if you would shrink from he as you shrink from alan and i think i know you do not know grace declare and then stop and blush as she meet he steady look after all there be no use in pretend gerald would not be deceive still when he quietly get up she ask with alarm : what be you go to do i be go to ashness gerald reply i have make thing hard for you and mother but i will not bring you fresh embarrassment now in fact i think you can trust I and indeed it be obvious that you must he turn and look back with a smile if askew 's the man i think the chief will shortly get a jar grace want to call he back but somehow could not and sit still while he cross the lawn so long as she could see he he move carelessly but when he go down the drive behind a clip hedge he step get slow and he face be hard the thing he mean to do would need some pluck and might be dangerous if he have not judge askew right in the meantime kit go back to ashness and smoke a cigarette while he ponder what grace have tell he he have see that she do not altogether know she brother 's offense but since money be need kit could guess gerald have be bet or speculate and have use money that be not he undoubtedly kit do not think he have rob he employer because if he have do so he would not have stay at tarnside he have however rob somebody and as kit remember he skill with the pen he see a light gerald have use somebody else 's name on the back of a bill or promissory note and now the bill must be meet presently he hear step in the passage and look up as gerald come in indicate a chair gerald sit down and for a few moment kit study he quietly it be obvious that he feel some strain but he look be resolute and kit own that he have more pluck than he have think the room be very quiet and the shadow of a big ash tree fall across the open window the musical tinkle of a binder working among the corn come faintly down the dale well say gerald conscious of a sense of relief in askew 's presence you send for I i do you sister tell I something all she know perhaps but not enough anyhow you be in trouble about money and i promise to help for my sake gerald ask kit frown not altogether but we 'll let that go if i be to be of use you have better state the trouble plainly i must know how thing be i suppose if you find the money i need it will give you a claim on we gerald remark meaningly yes say kit with a steady look but that will not make any difference i do not mean to urge my claim i expect this clear the ground it do it be some relief as a matter of fact nobody can help quite as much as you ah say kit i think i see you use _ my _ name what be the sum for which you make I responsible gerald tell he and wait anxiously when kit knit he brow the sum be not so large as the latter have think and osborn 's inability to raise it indicate that he be seriously embarrassed i understand you father apply to thorn say kit do he know you have come to I he do not nobody know but grace i would better state that i do come because i think you would take a generous line and i be doubtful about thorn kit make a sign of understand thorn have not arrive yet he say he send a note he have come across but when i leave he have not arrive my notion be he be wait until the last moment with the object of make we realize we must have he help it be possible say kit who approve gerald 's handling of the matter the lad be a wastrel but he have run some risk in order to save he sister from be force to pay for he fault we will not bother about thorn 's object he resume tell I about you difficulty i do not want a half confidence gerald hesitate and then begin he tale he have use the bank 's money to speculate with and have lose plunge again in the hope of get straight he have get alarm when the margin shrink and have go to hallam the money-lender the latter have insist on a guarantee for the bill and gerald have use kit 's name he replace the bank 's money and have hope the share would go up before the bill fall due but they have not well say kit quietly i expect something like this and when the fellow bring the bill to you father it must be meet he stop and pick up a newspaper study the steamship advertisement then he turn to gerald there be another thing you can not get a post in england and for you mother 's and sister 's sake have better leave the country a fast new york boat sail from liverpool to-morrow you must get off by to-night 's train gerald look at he with surprise but i be not go to new york i have no money and do not know what to do when i get there i 'll fix that kit say dryly you be go anyhow if you deliver the letter i 'll give you to some people in mobile they 'll find you a job the rest will depend upon yourself for a few moment gerald hesitate and then get up very well perhaps it be the best chance i 'll get and i 'll take it but i must go back and pack i think not say kit there be not much time i must see the bank manager at he house first of all and start soon you 'll come with I to the town sit down and write to you mother i 'll see she get the note gerald do as he be tell and not long afterwards kit and he drive out of the ashness lonning and take the road to the town chapter ix kit go to the rescue as the sun get lower a apathetic gloom begin to replace the anxiety that have keep the osborn highly string mr osborn go dejectedly about the house sometimes move a ornament and put away a book for she brain be dull and she feel incapable of the effort to rouse herself for she daughter 's sake thorn have not arrive and if he do not come soon he would be too late on the whole this be some relief although it mean that there be no escape from the disaster that threaten she home tear by conflict emotion she have since morning struggle against the binding force of she tradition in a sense it be grace 's duty to save the family honor but the duty would cost the girl too much yet if grace fail they gerald must suffer and she doubt if she husband could bear the shame that must fall on all now however she be conscious of a numbing resignation that blunt feeling and dull she brain in the meantime grace stand at the lodge gate watch the road to ashness while the shadow creep across the dale gerald have not come back and she have not tell she mother where he have go the delay be worry particularly since kit have send no message he have say he could help and one could trust he but he do not come and the confidence she have feel be vanish if it be not well place there be no escape for she and she shrink with horror from meeting thorn 's demand the shadow get longer but nothing move on the road that run like a white riband across the field until it vanish among the tree at ashness presently however she hear the throb of a car come up the valley and a cloud of dust roll up behind a hedge it be thorn 's car she know its hum and as she watch the dust get nearer she face go white then as the hum become loud and menacing she clench she hand and run in nervous panic up the drive she be breathless when she reach the house but pull herself together and go to a quiet room where she would be alone osborn sit in the library hear the car and get up with a sense of relief and shrink he have be afraid that thorn would fail he and now he almost wish that the fellow have not come he be not in the mood to be logical and although it be obvious that thorn alone could save he from disaster know what grace must pay hurt he more than he have think yet she must pay he could find no other plan now he be acquiescent but not resign and he hopelessness give he calm thorn 's face be hot when he come in and he glance at osborn with a effort for carelessness when the latter indicate a chair osborn look old and broken but he have a touch of dignity that be new i be sorry if i be late thorn remark i have to go to swinset and have trouble with the car osborn wonder dully whether this be the real ground for he delay but he say oh well it do not matter now you have arrive i give you a hint about my object in send for you but you do not know all yet i imagine i know enough gerald 's in trouble he or you must meet the bill hallam will bring you see the fellow belong to my club and i have a talk with he when i be in town so you know what threaten we osborn remark rather sharply if so it be curious you wait until i send for you thorn hesitate he have mean to be tactful but it look as if he have be rash osborn 's suspicion be obviously excite the matter be delicate and i know you would send for I if you think i could be of use you can be of use unless i take up the fellow 's bill gerald will go to jail thorn make a sign of sympathy he be surprise by osborn 's bluntness which imply that the latter be desperate that must be prevent i 'll give you a cheque he take out he cheque book and then stop and osborn ask : be this a free loan alan i mean be it make without condition a gift if you like anyhow i will not bother you about repayment we can not talk about _ condition _ but i have something to ask grace say osborn rather hoarsely yes say thorn with a hint of embarrassment i want grace it be a awkward situation i do not want to urge that i deserve my reward but i have wait a long time and think you approve i do approve i hope she would marry you but i imagine she could be persuade and would do so willingly however it look as if i be mistaken thorn lean forward fix he eye on osborn grace be young and perhaps i do not make a strong appeal to she romantic feeling but i belong to she rank and she view and taste be mine that be much also i can indulge and give she all she like the refinement and comfort to which she be in a sense entitle after all they count for something i be try to be practical but i love she if you really love she i think you would do well not to urge she just now osborn remark quietly ah say thorn i can not wait wait have gain I nothing and there be a risk if i be young i would use all the patience i could control but i be get old and farther away from grace in another year or two i shall be bald and fat perhaps the argument 's humorous but it have a cruel force for I there be other girl bring up as we have bring up grace they might be flatter -- thorn spread out he hand you do not understand i be not look for a wife i love she and if she can not be persuade will never marry anybody else he pause and resume with some emotion : i know the shabbiness of use this opportunity but it be the last i 'll get i do not want to work on she gratitude but i see no other plan i would like to be generous -- but i can not let she go yet you seem to realize that she do not like you she will get over that she likes and dislike have not yet harden into they final mold she be impulsive and generous i can win she by patience and kindness it be a rash experiment if you be disappointed grace would have to pay thorn be silent for a few moment he have talk with sincere passion but now begin to think osborn 's firmness be something of a surprise thorn have not expect he would weigh he daughter 's feeling against the danger that threaten he house he opposition must be break down i have hope for you consent he say and he face get hard to some extent i take it for grant osborn 's head sink forward he have struggle but see that he be beat to beg would be useless and he could not fight pull himself together with a effort he look up you mean you know i could not refuse yes say thorn awkwardly i suppose i do mean something like that osborn give he a long steady look thorn 's face be set and he mouth be firm there be no hint of yield and osborn get up very well i must tell my wife he ring a bell and a minute or two afterwards mr osborn come in she sit down and osborn stand opposite alan have do we the honor of ask my consent to he marry grace he say with ironical formality if we approve he be willing to help gerald he turn to thorn i think i have state you term thorn color as he see that mr osborn 's eye be fix on he you exaggerate i be willing to do you a service that nobody else can render and think i be justified in count on you gratitude very well say osborn i do not see much difference except that you want to save we pride he pause and look at he wife you know grace best will she consent something in he manner move mr osborn it be long since he have ask what she think and she feel encouraged besides now the crisis have come she irresolution have vanish she have throw off she reserve and mean to defend she daughter no she say with a determine note in she quiet voice even if she be willing i should protest the fault be gerald 's and he must suffer osborn feel some surprise but he humiliation have make he gentle gerald can not suffer alone he disgrace will reflect upon we all and if he have a son it will follow he we have be reckless and extravagant but we have keep we good name and now when it be all that be leave we it must be protect that be gerald 's duty mr osborn rejoin and be silent for a few moment to some extent she husband 's point of view be hers and she know he finest quality be he exaggerated family pride but she would not force she daughter to marry thorn i will not consent she resume grace have long suffer for she brother 's extravagance but she shall not pay for he folly now it be unjust the price be too high then she give thorn a appealing glance alan can you not be generous i be not brave enough it might cost I too much thorn answer in a strained voice i can not let grace go she would be happy with I after a time mr osborn make a scornful gesture and there be silence osborn move irresolutely and it look as if he be hesitate then step echo along the landing and he start as kit come in thorn 's face get very dark but mr osborn look up with a strange sense of relief i do not stop to ask if you be at home kit remark as you know time be get short i understand a man from london will bring you a document about a loan that be so say osborn hoarsely what be you go to do about the document take it up kit answer with a look of surprise my name 's on the back he pause and glance at thorn still this be a matter i would sooner talk about with you alone thorn get up make a effort for self-control since mr askew have arrive i need not stay he bow to mr osborn it look as if i have not understand thing you will not need my help he go out with a curious heavy step and when the door shut osborn sit down and look at kit as if he have get a shock then you have not come to humble I certainly not say kit i should have come before but have to find my bank manager who have leave he office where be gerald what have you do with he mr osborn ask for she begin to see a light gerald 's at the station hotel wait for the train to liverpool he sail for new york to-morrow and take a letter to some friend of mine who will give he a good start he send a note mr osborn read the note and she eye shine as she turn they on kit it be perhaps the best plan i would have like to see he but i thank you what i have do cost I nothing and i imagine gerald will have as good as chance of make progress as he have at the bank while the excitement he 'll probably get will suit he better but hallam will be here soon if the train be punctual and before he come i want to know -- at this moment they hear a car come up the drive a servant knock at the door and hallam be show in he sit down in front of the table where osborn tell he and glance at kit this be mr askew osborn say mr osborn will stay she know you business hallam bow and try not to look surprised very well i have bring the document about which you write i be sorry i find it impossible to renew the loan let I see the bill say kit who take it from he and afterwards nod yes that be all right cancel the thing and i 'll give you a cheque you admit you liability then hallam ask of course what do you expect my name 's here it be not my habit to disown my debt hallam do not state what he have expect he be tactful and be satisfy to get he money pull out a fountain pen he cancel the bill and put kit 's cheque in he pocket that be all i think and i can get a train if i start at once he say if you should require help to extend you farm or improve you stock i should be glad if you would apply to I i be afraid you interest be too high kit rejoin with a smile and hallam bow to the other and go out when he have go osborn turn to kit who give mr osborn the cancel bill i do not understand he say dully why have you come to my rescue to some extent it be for miss osborn 's sake ah say osborn i suppose you have a demand to make now i be in you power you be not in my power mr osborn have the bill and if you can not repay I i will not urge the debt but there be so to speak a stipulation you must use no pressure to persuade miss osborn to marry mr thorn i be not likely to do so osborn remark dryly he pause and he face get red as he struggle with he deep-rooted dislike for kit you have take a very generous line mr askew he resume we have not be friend but i must confess it look as if i have be unjust kit smile luck make we antagonist however i hope the antagonism have go for good because after all i have something to ask i must go to london on some business to-morrow but with you leave i will again call in a week you will find we at home when you do come osborn answer with grave politeness and when kit get up mr osborn give he she hand he go out and osborn who feel limp now the strain have slacken lean back heavily in he chair and look at he wife the fellow be a work farmer but he strike just the right note well he have beat I and it be easier to be beat by he than i thought but he state he be come back -- yes say mrs osborn i think he mean to ask for grace osborn knit he brow i imagine that be do with it be one thing to take he help and another to give he grace after all there be not much difference between he plan and thorn 's i expect you will find the difference important mr osborn reply with a smile he have break down you unjustified prejudice and if he be the man i think he will leave grace free to refuse -- if she like then she go out for the strain have be hard to bear and osborn sit at the table with he hand tightly close he admit that he have from the beginning be wrong about kit but he prejudice be not altogether banish yet chapter x grace 's choice a week after hallam 's visit kit one afternoon start for tarnside he have be force to go to london about some american business but this be a relief since it give he a excuse for delay at he interview with osborn he have leave the most important thing unsaid because it might have jar mr osborn whom he think he friend have he ask for grace at the moment he have put she father in he debt in fact he see it would be tactful if he wait for some time but he do not mean to do so to some extent he distrust osborn and resolve to make he request before the latter 's gratitude begin to cool grace must have full liberty to refuse but he do not owe she father much he wonder how she would choose and he step get slower until he stop and sit on a broken wall look up the valley the day be calm and the sun shone on smooth pasture and yellow corn the beck have shrink in the shady ghyll and a thin white line be all that mark the fall where the main stream leap down the force crag on the steep slope the heather make purple patch among the bent-grass and malton moor shone red kit love the quiet hill he have know intrigue and adventure and now see he work wait in he native dale the soil call he he job be to extend the plow-land and improve he flock this be important because he could not tell how far grace would sympathize she father like the lead place a effort for display and such luxury as could be cheaply get be the rule at tarnside it be possible that grace have unconsciously accept a false standard of value kit might for she sake have change he mode of life have he think it good for she but he do not she must have inherit something of osborn 's taste and to copy the tarnside custom might encourage they development it be better to remove she from insidious influence to fresh surroundings where she would so to speak breath a brace air but this could not be do unless she be willing to go kit knit he brow as he muse because there be not much to indicate whether he would find grace willing or not she like he well enough but he have not venture to pose as she lover he be too proud and jealous for she know what osborn think he would not involve she in a secret intrigue yet she have be kind and he have now and then get a hint of a elusive tenderness moreover in she distress she have come to he she be proud and he think would not have ask he help unless she be willing to give something in return after a time he get up with a quick resolute movement he would soon know if he have set he hope too high and would gain nothing by indulge he doubt cross a field where the binder be at work he go up the tarnside drive with a firm step and see osborn and mr osborn sit under the copper-beech it look as if they be wait for he and he brace himself as he advance mrs osborn smile as she give he she hand and osborn indicate a box of cigarette sit down mr osborn will give you some tea presently he say with a effort for hospitable politeness because he could not yet resign himself to the demand he wife expect kit would make you have be to town on business he resume feeling that silence would be awkward i hope you find thing satisfactory i do say kit who be glad that osborn have no doubt unconsciously give he a lead he have go to visit the agent of he american banker and have learn that adam 's estate have turn out to be worth more than he have think it be a relief because it help I to get over some of the hesitation i feel he resume i want you permission to ask miss osborn if she will marry I osborn try to hide he disturbed feeling and answer with forced quietness : my wife warn I that i might expect something like this but i must own that i find agreement hard however after the help you have give we it be plain that i must try to overcome my reluctance that be all i ask in the meantime say kit i do not expect you to influence miss osborn in fact she must understand that i have no claim and feel herself free to refuse you be generous mr osborn remark of course it be obvious that she gratitude must count for much i do not want she gratitude to count kit declare and osborn give he a puzzle glance there be something else that must be say grace have be indulge and know nothing of self-denial frugality that you think proper and usual would be hardship to she can you give you wife the comfort and refinement she have have at home kit note mr osborn 's faint smile and wonder whether it hint at ironical amusement but he put a document on the table you be entitle to ask and i have bring a short draught of the arrangement i be ready to make if i be fortunate enough to win you daughter osborn pick up the paper and give it to he wife then he look at kit with surprise this alter thing you be almost a rich man if you want you could buy a house like tarnside no say kit firmly it alter nothing and leave I where i be i be satisfied with ashness ah say osborn you mean you would sooner be a work farmer than a country gentleman the preference be somewhat remarkable i know where i belong the important thing be that if miss osborn marry I she will be a farmer 's wife exactly say osborn from my point of view it be a awkward drawback i doubt if my daughter be suit for the part he look at mr osborn and resume : but this be a matter grace must decide about and you insist that no pressure should be use i imagine you be afraid of my influence and do not know if i be afraid of yours or not if you agree i will send for she kit say he be willing and be silent when osborn go away although he imagine mr osborn be sympathetic he could not force himself to talk since he have insist that persuasion must not be use he could not demand to meet grace alone and she might find it hard to accept he plan without some explanation which would be awkward to give when she parent be there he could if he want change he mode of life but if they be to be happy she must be remove from influence he think dangerous and he must use he energy in useful work he see this very clearly but whether grace would see it be another thing he feel some strain while he wait and watch the tremble shadow move upon the grass the ray of light that pierce the dark foliage flicker about mr osborn 's dress and when he glance at she he think she look encourage but she do not speak by and by osborn return and say grace be come and kit find the suspense hard to bear at length she come and he heart beat as he watch she cross the lawn she wear a plain white dress and when she stop in front of the other she face be pale but calm mr askew have ask my permission to marry you and i can not refuse if you agree osborn say in a formal tone he stipulate that i must not persuade you one way or the other and declare that he do not want to work upon you gratitude some color come into grace 's face as she look at kit then you do not value my gratitude i value it very much kit reply with forced quietness but i feel it ought not to count he stop awkwardly for he note a sparkle in grace 's eye and feel that he be badly handicapped she be proud and probably do not understand he disinterested attitude it be a relief when mr osborn interpose : mr askew be try to be just we have agree that you be not to be influence ah say grace i think i see -- she wait and osborn go on : since you be to make a free choice i must state thing as plainly as i can mr askew be not poor he be able to give you all we think you ought to have in fact there be no very obvious reason he should not leave ashness but he do not mean to do so and although i can not follow he argument imagine that it would be better for you both if he carry on he farm it look as if he do not approve we rule kit frown and color when grace turn to he on the whole osborn have not state thing incorrectly but the situation be embarrassing grace would no doubt resent the stipulation he feel force to make and expect a more lover-like attitude from the man who ask she to be he wife grace he say appealingly i be afraid you do not understand but when you must give up so much i durst not hide the drawback besides it be agree that i must not urge you she study he for a moment i do understand she say and then turn to osborn i suppose you be try to guard I but i be not afraid one get tired of pretense and secret economy and force idleness have not much charm well if mr askew know what he know about we be willing to run the risk -- grace say kit move forward but she stop he with a proud gesture there be a risk i think we shall both need courage but if you be willing i need not hesitate i will try to make a good farmer 's wife she turn and go away and the blood come into kit 's face as he look at osborn i have play fair but it be hard now you have hear she answer i be at liberty to plead my cause osborn say nothing but he wife give kit a friendly smile and he go off with a resolute step in pursuit of grace he come up with she in a shrubbery but it look as if she do not hear he for she head be bent grace he say put he hand on she arm i be embarrassed and in a way ashamed she turn and confront he with she wonted calm i do not see why you be ashamed you be just -- i think i mean quite impartial you want I to weigh thing and would have be resign if i have find the drawback too much it be not as easy as you think say kit grimly in fact i be burn with anger and suspense but you see i have promise you father -- yes say grace that be plain you be firm when you think i might be force to marry thorn and when father agree not to use he influence i suppose you could not use yours well i be glad you be angry it be human and you scrupulous fairness be not flattering she pause and to kit 's relief give he a smile after all it would not have hurt to be urge to marry the man i do like you mean I say kit and boldly take she in he arm she draw back from he blush after a few moment but kit be content there be something fascinatingly elusive about grace and he could wait they go on quietly down the path until they come to a bench in a shady nook kit lean against a tree and grace sit down kit she say i do not know you be rich it really do not matter but i be glad i fall in love with you when i do not know then you be in love with I she smile of course i must have be when i come to you because i be afraid of thorn love give I confidence i know you would help in a way i do a extravagant thing because you be not really like a lover at all the control i use often hurt say kit i be afraid i might alarm and lose you it be much to see you now and then he pause feeling there be something to be say that must be say now however about ashness -- oh say grace i suppose it cost you a effort to be firm and i hope it do you need not be afraid though when my father tell I i understand and it will not hurt to leave tarnside i be anxious to get away my dear say kit ashness have some charm and we will try to make it a proper home for you it be a home i sometimes go to see you father -- i like he so much kit one feel the old house have sheltered sincere man and woman who love each other and something they leave haunt the quiet spot i do not want you to alter it much you shall alter it as you like the only rule at ashness will be what please you now you be very nice i be go to be happy because i can be myself so far i have be force to be reserve you do not really know I kit perhaps that be true kit remark you be wonderful because there be always some fresh charm to learn i think i know you before i go away but when i come back i see how foolish i be i wonder whether you know i love you then grace blush i think i know and feel cheated why do you feel cheated oh say grace i like you i be young and feel i be entitle to love a man who love I if i want but could not use my right then not long since when you be so grave and just i feel i have be cheat worse i see say kit and come nearer the bench i be cheat too but look at I dear and i 'll try to tell you all i think he tell she with fire and passion and when he stop bend down to she she put she arm round he neck now you be ridiculously romantic but you be very charming kit she say chapter xi osborn 's surrender by degree osborn accept he daughter 's choice philosophically kit be not the son-in-law he have want but he be force to admit that the fellow jar less than he have think for one thing he never remind osborn of the benefit he have confer and the latter note that he country-house neighbor open they door to he they could not of course altogether ignore the man grace have promise to marry but osborn soon have grounds for imagine that they like kit for himself the wedding have be fix and osborn although not satisfy be resign in the meantime it begin to look as if the gloom that have long rule at tarnside be banish mr osborn 's reserve be less marked she smile and she step be lighter grace too have change and develop she have often be impatient but now be mark by a happy calm osborn find she gentler and sometimes strangely compliant although he feel he must make no rash demand the girl indulge he but she could be firm she new serenity have a charm moreover gerald write cheerful letter and declare that he be make better progress than would have be possible for he at home osborn have seldom think much about the happiness of he family but he feel a dull satisfaction because thing be go well with the other it be a set-off against he trouble which be get worse the improvement he tenant and haye have force he to make cost more than he calculate and he meet stubborn resistance when he talk about put up the rent the money he have get by the last mortgage have go he could not borrow more and he creditor demand payment of he debt he put off the reckoning however until one day when he drive to the market town to consult he agent he get a rude jar in the first place haye keep he wait in a cold room and he stand for a time by the window look out drearily at the old-fashioned square the day be bleak and wet and the high moor that shut in the little town loom blur and forbid through drift mist the square be empty the front of the tall old house be dark with rain and the drop from a clump of bare tree fall in a steady shower on the grass behind the iron rail the gloom react upon osborn 's disturbed mood and he frown when haye come in i send you word that i would call he say you do haye agree i be occupy when my clerk tell I you be here osborn look at he with some surprise haye be very cool and not apologetic well he say you know what i want to talk about i suppose you have see forsyth and langdon about the renewal of they lease yes both state they 'll go sooner than pay you extra rent then they must go osborn rejoin try to hide he disappointment since he have spend some money on the steading in the hope of raise the rent now he come to think of it haye have hold this out as a inducement when he urge the expenditure it look as if you judgment be not very good but by comparison with other thing the matter 's not important he resume you know the sum i 'll need between now and the end of the term i do know in fact i imagine you will need more than you suspect haye rejoin you 'll find it impossible to borrow the money on satisfactory term osborn look hard at he the fellow 's manner be rather abrupt than sympathetic but haye go on : before we advertise for new tenant there be something i want to suggest although the farm be mortgage i might be able to find a buyer -- at a price no say osborn firmly the buyer would have to undertake the debt and the sum he would be willing to pay would not last I long when it be spend i would have practically nothing leave the situation 's awkward but there it be of course if you be able to carry on until you rent come in -- you know i can not carry on i come to you hope you might suggest a workable plan who be the buyer i be say haye osborn 's face get red and he struggle for self-control the fellow be he servant but it look as if he have cunningly involve he in entanglement a honest agent would have avoid osborn remember that he have sometimes vaguely suspect haye now he know he it be too late i may be force to sell but not to you he say haughtily haye shrug that must be as you like but i be able to give you a better price than anybody else i have a object for buy the farm and if necessary would pay something near they proper value without take off much for the debt anyhow you have better look at this statement of you liability osborn study the document with a hopeless feeling thing be worse than he have fear and it cost he a effort to pull himself together when he look up why do you want to buy he ask well you see the land between forsyth 's and the dale-head be heavily mortgage and take the two farm with the other would make a compact block that could be economically work the new estate would run down to tarnside and since you may find it needful to sell the house i might make you a offer but the consolidation would not help _ you _ osborn remark with a puzzle look it would perhaps be a advantage for the mortgage holder i hold the mortgage haye say quietly osborn start but he stammer i get the money from somebody else that be so i buy the other debt and supply the fund when you raise new loan you buy the debt with my money osborn exclaim you use you post to rob I of my estate i suppose one must make allowance but you be unjust you get the proper value for the land you pawn and squander the money the consequence be inevitable and it be futile to complain for that matter it be not altogether unusual for a landlord and he steward to change place i trust you and you cheat I osborn resume with poignant bitterness you live in false security and refuse to think you know the reckoning must come but be satisfy if you could put it off now you must bear the consequence it be not my fault however this be not important will you sell no say osborn hoarsely i will not sell to _ you _ haye smile you must sell to somebody and will not get as good a price osborn get up and go out with a drag step the blow have leave he numb but as he drive home in the rain he have a hazy notion that haye ' statement be to some extent justified he have live in false security see how thing be go and yet refuse to believe somehow it have look impossible for he to lose tarnside the estate be he by the sacred right of inheritance for a hundred year there have be a osborn at the hall yet the estate have go and he be to blame it have so to speak melt in he careless hand he feel old and break when he tell he wife and daughter about the interview mr osborn do not look as much surprised as he have think and grace although sympathetic be calm they have know the blow be come and be ready for the shock after a time osborn leave they and grace look at she mother i must tell kit yes say mrs osborn i think he ought to know though this be not a matter in which he can help it look like that grace agree and then pause with a confident smile but kit 's rather wonderful you do not really know he yet he always find a way when there be something hard to be do ah say mrs osborn there be comfort in we trouble since they have give you a man you can trust grace go to ashness and find kit study some account in the room she call he museum put the book away come to the fire and talk to I say grace and stop he when he move a chair i think i 'll take the low stool it be wretchedly cold and i really come to be comfort she sit down lean against he chair with she head turn so that she could look up and hold she hand to the fire kit 's heart beat for grace have develop recently she reserve have go and a curious frank tenderness have come instead this be very nice she resume there be something very homelike about ashness perhaps i be romantic but i sometimes feel as if you father be still at the old house it be kind and quiet -- like he do not you think people can leave a influence kit yours will last so far i have not have much quietness i be afraid i have come to bother you again i hate to bother you but somehow trouble seem to follow I you trouble be mine kit say and stroke she head tell I about it grace tell he and although he say nothing wait calmly he face be thoughtful but the silence be not awkward she feel that it be mark by a intimate confidence kit she resume at length i do not know if you can help or if you ought you must decide dear i just want to tell you and i be comfort i can help kit answer quietly people abroad have pay some debt i do not expect to get and i be richer than i think he pause and muse for a moment or two it be strange the thing should happen now when i come home i imagine ashness would occupy all my time but i soon begin to feel i have not scope enough you see i would be with adam and he be a hustler well it look as if i have find a new field you mean you might buy tarnside yes i think the estate might be make to pay high farming 's a risky business in we climate and we have be satisfy to spend little and get a small return i think there be a better plan than that if one use modern method and can invest the capital however i see a obstacle to my buy tarnside father grace suggest well i be afraid he would never be economical and he like to rule but i do not mean kit that you should give he money to squander i know say kit gently although he face be rather stern adam 's legacy must not be waste in extravagance then you see tarnside ought to have be gerald 's but he be rule out -- grace look up yes kit now you have give he a fresh start he may make a useful man but tarnside be not for he she pause and blush but she glance be steady as she go on : it must be ours if you buy it for we to hold in trust -- she turn she head and kit quietly touch she hair they be silent for a few moment and then he say if the estate be to be properly manage my part will need much tact and i be impatient now and then but we would live at ashness and you mother would understand my difficulty she would help father 's old kit and might be indulge you would try not to hurt he and could consult he about thing that do not matter i think he would be satisfy if you let he imagine he have some control kit smile very well we will make the plunge tell you father to do nothing until haye move the fellow 's cunning and it might be better if he do not know what we mean to do he bent down and kiss she and she press she face against he hand kit you be wonderful thing get do when you come on the scene but perhaps you be nicest when they be do for I after all i be a osborn and would have hate to let tarnside go let 's plan what we can do when it belong to we for a time they engage in happy talk but kit reopen he account book when grace go home it look as if he be about to make a rash plunge because he would not have much money leave when he have carry out he plan however he could guard against the worst risk and on the whole imagine the venture ought to pay some week later osborn send for he and on reach tarnside he be show into the library mr osborn be with she husband and there be a bundle of papers on the big table i have get the particulars you want osborn say haye will arrive in half a hour but that should give we time enough kit nod yes i want a few minute when he have study the document he look up tarnside would soon be he and he glance about the library with a new curiosity although the day be dark and rain beat upon the high window the light be strong enough to show the fine modeling of the old and shabby furniture it be a noble room and with well use money could be give a touch of stateliness but there be something cold and austere about tarnside while ashness be homelike and warm he short survey strengthen kit 's half-conscious feeling that he belong to the farm and not the hall two thing be obvious he remark the mortgage must be wipe off and when other debt have be pay the rent of the land i be willing to redeem ought to keep you go if they be economically use i doubt it osborn rejoin so far the rent of the whole estate have fail to do so they will do so now kit say rather dryly that be if i be to free the land but you must decide if you will help or not he look at mr osborn who make a sign of agreement there will be enough kit indeed in some way we shall be better off than we be you have pluck say kit and turn to osborn know he must be firm the house and grounds will be yours to use as you like and the farmer will bring they complaint and request first to you you will be the acknowledged landlord and i shall be glad of you advice but the expenditure will be control by I osborn do not reply but mrs osborn say it be a generous offer kit wait conscious of some suspense for he doubt if osborn 's pride be quite humble yet he do not want to humble he but for the sake of grace and she mother do not mean to let he wreck he plan after a few moment osborn look up it be a hard choice but you have take the proper line and i be resigned he say after all i have have my day and although luck have be against I can not claim that i have use it well besides i be not rob gerald by agree to you plan gerald rob himself and I he pause and go on with some emotion : very well i be ready to abdicate and thank you for try to save my feeling by give I nominal control there be nothing more of much importance to be say and with the object of banish the strain kit begin to talk about improve some of the farm osborn do not help he much but he keep it up until haye arrive the latter seem surprised to see kit and hesitate when osborn indicate a chair mr osborn will stay and i bring mr askew to meet you as you like say haye who look annoyed but sit down and take out some document you have have formal notice that repayment of these loan be due and it would be a advantage to make arrangement for take up the other mortgage that will soon run out some time since i make you a offer that you refuse that be so osborn agree you offer be still unacceptable what be you go to do i must advertise the mortgage farm for public sale and when arrears of interest various charge and smaller loan be deduct there will probably be nothing leave the rest be not my business but i have manage the estate and do not see how you can carry on it be not you business and mr askew have a plan haye smile as he turn to kit you may perhaps resent my advice but i think it be sound you would be rash to meddle a small sum would be swallow up and make no difference you would be poorer and mr osborn would not gain that be obvious if the sum be small kit agree but how much do you expect to get if you sell the farm he nod when haye tell he a fair estimate i think we can take it as the proper price you mean to buy the farm in but i want they too and if you force a sale i 'll bid higher can you bid against I haye ask with something of a sneer i 'll answer that afterwards in the meantime let I state that i want the other farm when the mortgage run out you can fight I if you like but i do not think it will pay you and if we run price up mr osborn will gain very well here 's my offer to buy up all he debt he give a document to haye who study it with surprise i presume you be serious the latter say with a effort you be rasher than i think if you can make this offer good i can certainly make it good you have better apply to the bank manager if you have doubt for a few moment haye study kit who look quietly resolute then he say you be determine to oppose I if i do not consent yes say kit i mean to buy all the land mr osborn have pawn if you want it you 'll have to pay the price i fix since it must be a public sale do not you think it would be prudent to accept my offer haye clench he fist but with a effort preserve he self-control i be force to agree very well take the document to my lawyer and as soon as they be satisfied i 'll give you a check haye nod silently and bow to mrs osborn go out when he have go osborn get up we have not be good friend -- kit he say with some emotion old prejudice be hard to conquer but mine have break down at last -- you have beat I well i suppose i would not admit that the code i clung to have go for good but now i be drop out i do not know that i could find a better man to step into my place he pause and give kit he hand after all tarnside be not lose to we grace will follow I -- she belong to the new school but i think you child will rule the old house well then mr osborn advanced and kiss kit who go out with she and find grace wait in the hall haye have go mr osborn remark kit have force he to agree and you father be reconcile we have have much trouble but i think we shall all be happy yet grace look up and she eye shine ah she say i know long since that kit be wonderful in one way it would not have matter if he have save tarnside or not but now you and father know what a dear he be the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of the buccaneer farmer by harold bindloss
